Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion for the first quarter and excluding CVA, DVA, and a tax item, net income was $4.1 billion, a 4% increase over last year, translating to $1.30 per share. I\u2019ll discuss these results and then turn to two other significant items in the quarter, the Fed\u2019s objection to our capital plan, and the discovery of the fraud in Mexico.  During the first quarter, our institutional business performed well across our products and geographies. While lower on a year on year basis, market revenues rebounded from the fourth quarter and our equities business grew its revenues and continued to make progress. Higher volumes in treasury and trade solutions led to revenue growth despite the ongoing low rate environment. Our consumer bank again posted growth internationally, generating positive operating leverage year on year. Revenues in Asia grew, and while we continue to execute our repositioning plans in Korea, we believe revenues in that market have now largely stabilized. In the U.S., lower mortgage refinancing activity continued to impact our retail banking business while retail services revenues strengthened year over year, showing the positive impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. In a challenging revenue environment, we made progress toward several key priorities during the quarter. Overall, we grew both loans and deposits while focusing on improving our efficiency. We continue to optimize our branch network, reduce our real estate footprint, and simplify our product offerings. We reduced our headcount by about 3,000 people, to 248,000, which helped lower our expenses by over $250 million year on year. While assets in Citi Holdings declined at a slower pace in the first quarter as expected, we did bring the portfolio closer to breakeven. We\u2019ll continue to take advantage of more opportunistic sales as they present themselves, and we also resolved a significant legacy issue last week with the $1.1 billion settlement regarding certain private label mortgage securitizations. The narrower loss in Citi Holdings helped drive continued progress with our deferred tax asset. After reducing our DTA by $2.5 billion in 2013, we reduced the DTA by an additional $1.1 billion during the first quarter. While our capital levels were amongst the highest in the industry, we share your deep disappointment over the objection of our capital plan. Let me tell you what we\u2019re doing in response. First, we\u2019re engaged with the Fed, so we can fully understand their concern. We\u2019re committed to bringing our capital planning process in line with the highest standards befitting an institution of our global reach. Let me now share with you some preliminary takeaways based on what we\u2019ve learned so far. To begin with, we don\u2019t believe this is an issue with our business model or our strategy. It also isn\u2019t an issue with our levels of capital or capability to generate capital. As the quantitative tests showed, we exceeded the Fed\u2019s requirements with 150 basis points cushion in the severely stressed scenario. And after generating over $20 billion of regulatory capital last year, we generated an additional $6 billion in the first quarter of 2014.  We now have an estimated tier one common ratio of 10.4% on a Basel III basis, and at 5.6% we already surpass the supplementary leverage ratio requirement. While we clearly have a good amount of work to do to bring our capital planning process in line with the Fed\u2019s requirements, we believe we can fix what needs to be fixed in our CCAR process so we can pass the qualitative side as well. So let me be clear. Whatever the gaps are between the Fed\u2019s expectations and our CCAR process, we\u2019ll close it. We\u2019ll devote whatever resources and make whatever changes are necessary to accomplish this critical goal. We\u2019re moving as quickly as possible while mindful of the fact that it has to be done the right way. I want and I know our shareholders deserve an industrial strength, permanent solution that paves the way for sustainable capital return over time. We\u2019ve already begun to make changes we believe will strengthen our process. As you know, I\u2019ve asked Gene McQuade to delay his retirement and run our CCAR process. I\u2019ve fully empowered him to do whatever needs to be done as we prepare our next submission. It will require investment in new talent, acceleration of spend on certain system, and changes to the way we build, validate, and test our scenarios.  While not insignificant, we believe the required investments can be funded through our productivity initiatives, consistent with other investments we\u2019ve made and continue to make in our safety and soundness, including risk management, compliance, and AML.  In light of this, I believe the right decision is to focus our full attention on preparing for the 2015 CCAR process, which begins in the fall. Among other things, this delay in increasing our capital return means it\u2019s hard to see a scenario where we\u2019ll be able to meet our intermediate target of a 10% return on tangible common equity in 2015.  However, our 2015 return on asset and efficiency targets remain in place and we\u2019re committed to achieving them. I should also say that although we understand our shareholders desire for more information on CCAR, we aren\u2019t able to go into further detail, as our supervisory communications with the Fed are confidential. I hope people won\u2019t misread the absence of information as an absence of action. I assure you, we\u2019re addressing this issue with absolute urgency. Regarding the fraud in Mexico, we\u2019re progressing along several fronts. First, we\u2019ve completed our rapid review and have not identified similar issues with any other account receivables program globally other than with the PEMEX supplier program. We reviewed over 1,100 facilities with over $14 billion of receivable financings.  Second, working closely with the Attorney General in Mexico, we\u2019re continuing our rigorous investigation into how the fraud was committed and how our controls were breached. At this point, we\u2019ve terminated one employee who we believe was criminally involved in the fraud and anyone else we find to have been criminally involved will be fired as well as referred to the Attorney General. In addition, we expect to take action against others whose negligence or lack of compliance with our code of conduct allowed this fraud to be committed. Those responsible will be held accountable for their actions and inactions. We also continue to pursue the recovery of any misappropriated funds. And finally, we\u2019re reviewing all of our controls and processes in Mexico and will strengthen any area we think falls short of our global standards and best practices. While we\u2019d all like a quick resolution of this issue, we\u2019re doing a lot of work and it\u2019s just going to take some time to get it done. In closing, Citi has a unique global platform, one which as the quarter shows, is very capable of generating the returns our shareholders expect and reserve. We\u2019ll remain focused on serving our clients and taking our franchise to the next level. John will go through the deck, and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items which affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to last year. First, CVA and DVA had a small impact this quarter at $7 million, compared to a negative $319 million in pretax or $0.06 per share after tax in the first quarter of last year. And second, this quarter we took a $210 million tax charge related to corporate tax reforms enacted in two states. These reforms lowered marginal tax rates, resulting in a reduction in our state deferred tax asset for a negative impact on EPS of $0.07 per share. Adjusting for CVA/DVA and the tax item, we earned $1.30 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.29 per share in the first quarter of last year. This quarter\u2019s results also included roughly $165 million of incremental credit costs related to the Pemex supplier program in Mexico, including direct exposure to two suppliers. The vast majority of these credit costs were associated with our direct exposure to OSA and uncertainty around Pemex\u2019s obligation to pay us for a portion of the accounts receivable we\u2019ve validated with them as of year-end. The remainder was associated with one other supplier to Pemex that was found to have similar issues. We have not adjusted our results for these additional credit costs.  On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We earned $4.1 billion in the first quarter, up 4% from last year, as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were partially offset by a decline in revenue. Our return on assets improved year over year as well, to 89 basis points. Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year over year to $664 billion, as 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings, and deposits also grew 3% to $966 billion. On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Our expenses declined in total versus last year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Legal and related costs were $945 million in the first quarter, and repositioning costs were over $200 million. Excluding these two items, core operating expenses of $11 billion in the first quarter declined by over $400 million year over year. In constant dollars, expenses declined by over $260 million, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as the impact of business growth, including the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. Sequentially, core expenses were up versus last year, mostly reflecting higher incentive compensation, resulting from improved performance. On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 8% year over year as lower revenues were partially offset by lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit. The revenue decline was mostly driven by lower revenues in fixed income markets and North America mortgage origination, partially offset by growth in both equities and international consumer.  In Citi Holdings, the net loss improved significantly from roughly $800 million a year ago to just under $300 million, driven by a number of factors, including credit improvement in North America mortgages, the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher levels of mark-to-market gains, lower funding costs, and a one-time gain on a debt transaction. Citi Holdings assets declined by 23% year over year, to $114 billion or 6% of total Citigroup assets. Turning to Citicorp, on slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 3% year over year in the first quarter while expenses increased by 2%. International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression, as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in certain markets, particularly in Korea. However, most key drivers remain positive, with average loans up 7% and card purchase sales up 4% from last year. In addition, we began to see the benefits this quarter of our exclusive distribution agreement with AIA to provide insurance products in 11 of our Asia markets. Korea remained a headwind. However, while we continue repositioning this franchise, we believe revenues in this market have largely stabilized and credit has remained favorable. We will continue to restructure our cost base in Korea to reflect the lower revenue. International credit costs grew 12% year over year, mostly reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning, while the net credit loss rate remains fairly stable at 200 basis points.  Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 6% year over year and 2% sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion declined by 28% from last year, mostly reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity, and were up 5% sequentially, driven by a gain on a sale leaseback transaction. Branded card revenues of $2 billion were flat versus last year, as higher purchase sales and improved spread were offset by lower average loans. Retail services revenues grew 8% from last year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. And revenues were down sequentially in both card businesses on seasonally lower purchase sales and loan balances versus the fourth quarter. Total operating expenses of $2.4 billion were down 3% year over year, reflecting ongoing cost reduction initiatives, partially offset by the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. We have significantly resized our mortgage operations over the last year to reflect the change in market volumes, and we continue to rationalize our branch footprint in North America by reducing the number and size of our branches while concentrating our presence in major urban areas and enhancing our digital channel. Even as we have reduced branches, we have continued to grow our average deposits and retail loans, each up 4% year over year. And, we\u2019ve shifted a greater amount of our mortgage originations and card acquisitions to the retail channel. Slide nine shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. In North America, credit remained favorable in the first quarter, and we continue to anticipate the full year NCL rate to be in the range of 3%. Asia remained stable as well. And, in Latin America, we saw an uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates. The higher NCL rate in the first quarter was primarily driven by Mexico card, as that portfolio continued to season. We have also seen a greater than anticipated impact on consumer behavior from the fiscal reforms enacted in Mexico last year, which included higher income and other taxes. This appears to have dampened card purchase activity and is resulting in increased card delinquencies across the industry. Given these changes, in combination with the generally slower pace of economic recovery in Mexico, we currently expect the full year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with the 4.6% we experienced in the first quarter. The increase in the delinquency rate over the prior two quarters was mostly driven by our exposure to home builders in Mexico, for which we have established loan loss reserves. Any losses from these home builders may increase our NCL rate in the coming quarter. However, we would expect these losses to be charged against our reserve, and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit. Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for global consumer banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio excluding North America mortgage and Korea. As I mentioned earlier, revenues have declined in both North America mortgage and Korea over the past year, and this resulted in a significant drag on our reported operating efficiency. Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress reducing our efficiency ratio from nearly 56% a year ago to just over 54% today, as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations, all while continuing to invest in those markets where we see growth opportunities.  While we now believe the revenues in both North America mortgage and Korea have largely stabilized, we will continue to take actions to reduce our cost base and improve efficiency in these businesses.  Slide 11 shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses had declined to just over $5.1 billion by the third quarter of last year, and then increased in the fourth quarter as a result of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. In the most recent quarter, core operating expenses have been reduced again to just over $5.1 billion, and we currently expect to deliver modest reductions in each of the subsequent quarters this year. This improvement is expected to come from a variety of actions, including those examples shown on the right side of the slide. As you can see, we have made significant progress since the end of 2012 in reducing headcount, the number of card products, retail branches, and support sites, and we expect to make further progress by year-end. Turning now to the institutional clients group, on slide 12, revenues of $9.2 billion declined 7% from last year, but were up 28% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion were roughly flat versus prior period. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $1.9 billion were up 1% versus prior periods on a reported basis and, in constant dollars, revenues grew 4% year over year and 2% sequentially, as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression. Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from the prior year on lower debt underwriting activity, as well as lower M&A revenue, partially offset by growth in equity underwriting. And, on a sequential basis, revenues were down 8%, mostly due to a pull forward of M&A transactions into the prior quarter, while underwriting revenues were roughly flat. Private bank revenues of $668 million increased from prior periods, driven by growth in investments and capital markets products. And, lending revenues, excluding the impact of gains and losses on hedges related to accrual loans, were $415 million, up from prior periods, as higher loan balances and lower funding costs were partially offset by lower loan yields. Total markets and securities services revenues of $5.2 billion declined 12% year over year, but were up nearly 60% sequentially. Year over year, fixed income revenues of $3.9 billion declined 18%, reflecting the more muted environment in the first quarter of 2014, as well as our strong performance last year, in both securitized products and local markets rates and currencies. Sequentially, fixed income was up over 60% on a rebound in spread product and local markets revenue, as well as growth in commodity. Equities revenues of $883 million were up 13% from last year, and over 80% from the prior quarter, mostly reflecting improved performance in derivatives. And, securities services was roughly flat, as lower net interest revenue was offset by an increase in assets under custody and overall client activity. Total operating expenses of $5 billion were down 2% versus the prior year, driven by reduced headcount and lower incentive compensation, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs, legal and related expenses, and repositioning charges in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis, expenses increased by roughly $100 million, mostly reflecting higher incentive compensation, partially offset by the impact of reduced headcount.  On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. On a trailing 12-month basis, we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full year efficiency ratio from 67% two years ago to 59% as of the first quarter. Our comp ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29%, consistent with full year 2013. Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues increased year over year, driven mainly by higher investment revenues and hedging activities, while expenses also grew, mainly reflecting higher legal and related costs. Assets of $323 billion included approximately $111 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $156 billion of liquid, available for sale securities.  Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $114 billion at quarter end, with over 60% in North America mortgage. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter, mostly driven by net paydowns. On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.4 billion were up year over year, primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, as well as higher levels of mark-to-market gains versus prior period, lower funding costs, and a one-time gain on a debt transaction. Citi Holdings expenses increased slightly year over year to $1.5 billion, driven by higher leg and related costs.  Net credit losses continued to improve year over year, and we released $345 million of loan loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages. Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on slide 17, excluding legal and related expenses, the operating margin in Citi Holdings grew to nearly $700 million this quarter, driven in part by the higher one-time and mark-to-market gains I just referred to, while credit costs were roughly flat. The pretax loss in Citi Holdings was just over $400 million, driven by nearly $800 million of legal and related expenses. Legal expenses were somewhat higher than in prior periods, including roughly $100 million of incremental accruals to cover the recently announced $1.1 billion settlement to resolve certain private label securitization repurchase claims.  This represented a significant step in resolving our legacy issues, and we remain hopeful we will have better clarity on the remaining mortgage and securitization related issues in Citi Holdings, sometime this year.  On slide 18, we show North America mortgage trends in Citi Holdings, which continued to improve through the first quarter. We ended the quarter with $71 billion of North America mortgages, down 18% from a year ago, while net credit losses declined by nearly 50%, and the loss rate improved by nearly 100 basis points. We had $4.6 billion of loan loss reserves allocated to North America mortgages in Citi Holdings, or 42 months of NCL coverage.  On slide 19, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.8 billion in the first quarter, up from last year on slightly higher interest earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin, and down sequentially, driven by a lower day count. Our net interest margin grew to 290 basis points in the first quarter, mainly reflecting lower funding costs. As we look to the second quarter, we expect our net interest margin to decline by several basis points, likely followed by a modest increase in the back half of the year. On slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. As of the fourth quarter, we reported an estimated Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.6%. Subsequently, we announced that we would be required to add roughly $56 billion of operational risk RWA to our total risk-weighted assets, related to our transition to the Basel III advanced approaches. This additional RWA resulted in a pro forma Basel III tier one common ratio of 10.1% as of the fourth quarter, and we grew our estimated Basel III tier one common ratio to 10.4% in the first quarter. Our estimated Basel III supplementary leverage ratio was unaffected by the change in operational risk RWA, and improved from 5.4% to 5.6% in the first quarter. We continue to evaluate the impact of the newly released NPR for the U.S. SLR rules, and based on our limited review to date, we believe the impact should be flat to a slight improvement. In summary, our performance in the first quarter demonstrated continued progress on several fronts. Markets revenues rebounded from the fourth quarter, and while fixed income revenues were less robust than last year, we partially offset this decline with growth in equities, corporate lending, and the private bank.  Our international consumer business continued to grow, with positive operating leverage year over year, and we continued to see growth in purchase sales across our card portfolio. We also maintained our expense discipline, and credit remained broadly favorable. We significantly reduced the drag from Citi Holdings again this quarter, and we ended the period with a strong capital position. Looking to the rest of the year, our goal is to grow our core franchise while improving our operating efficiency and reducing the drag from Citi Holdings. In global consumer banking, we expect revenues to be somewhat flat going into the second quarter with sequential growth in the back half of the year, while core operating expenses should continue to decline each quarter. In our institutional business, revenues will likely continue to reflect the overall market environment, with a goal of steadily gaining wallet share while maintaining our expense discipline. And, in Citi Holdings, we remain focused on resolving our legacy mortgage and securitization related issues in order to further drive the business closer to breakeven. In the first quarter, we saw higher levels of one-time and mark-to-market revenues, which are not likely to recur. But we still expect to achieve a small positive operating margin, excluding legal expenses. For full year 2014, in Citicorp, we expect our core operating expenses to come in at or somewhat below the level of 2013, as continued repositioning and other efficiency savings should offset the impact of business growth, investment, and a continued increase in regulatory related expenses. And in Citi Holdings, core operating expenses should continue to decline, as we wind down those assets. Over the past six quarters, we have incurred roughly $1.7 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions we announced in December 2012. We expect to achieve approximately $2.2 billion of annual savings from these initiatives. Roughly $1.8 billion of these benefits are already included in our expense base on an annualized basis, and we have achieved an additional $1 billion of annual savings through our ongoing effort to simplify and streamline our organization as well as improve our productivity. Of these $2.8 billion in annualized savings, approximately 40% has been reinvested in regulatory, control, and compliance initiatives. Another 40% went to fund higher volume related expenses, cover the cost of inflation, and fund investment, including the Best Buy portfolio acquisition, and 20% has fallen to the bottom line to benefit earnings. In the second quarter, we expect total legal and repositioning charges to be roughly in line with the first quarter although the mix should change to reflect an increase in repositioning charges, due in part to the acceleration of our restructuring effort in Korea. For the second half of the year, repositioning charges should decline while legal expenses are likely to remain somewhat elevated.  With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator instructions.] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Quick question on expenses. Just to get to the high end of your efficiency ratio targets, it seems to me, if I kind of do the math, assuming flat revenues, you\u2019d have to get somewhere between $1.5 billion to $2 billion more in expenses out. Is that the right way to think about it or are you assuming the restructuring and legal charges go away as part of that, or is that independent of that or is there some revenue assumption in those targets? John Gerspach : I think the right way to think about this is, when we put those targets out, we were talking about low single digit revenue growth back in the 2012 level. And we do think that there will be, as I mentioned, some sequential revenue growth clearly in the consumer businesses, and we actually think about sequential revenue growth towards the back end of the year in our transaction services business as well, TTS. But overall, we are committed to hit those efficiency targets, as we established for Citicorp, in the mid-50s. You referenced the legal expenses, and as we set that target, I think another good way to think about this is when we set the target of the mid-50s, embedded in that target, we would have had about 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio set aside for BAU, legal, and repositioning. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : And just maybe trying to think through the fraud loss, it was helpful that you mentioned that you\u2019ve looked across other receivable programs, is there any reason to think that we should have concerns about beyond that, those types of programs for just general corporate lending? Have you done sort of a review there? And how do we get comfort, I guess, on that front? Mike Corbat : As I said, we, in this instance, did what we declared a rapid review not only obviously in Mexico, but across the franchise. And I we think took a great deal of comfort from the results of looking across as many geographies and as many programs as we did. And as the normal course of business and audit and risk, we\u2019re constantly looking at and reviewing those, and I think feel comfortable with, on the lending side, the way we\u2019re coming to work documenting and doing things. So again, it\u2019s something, as an institution, we\u2019re always focused on and always kind of going after and always looking to learn from things that occur, but nothing I think that leads us to have a broader fear either in Mexico or across the rest of the franchise. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : On emerging markets, it seems like the markets have rallied there. Has there been any kind of improvement, I guess, on the market side in March as emerging markets have seemingly done a little bit better? Mike Corbat : We\u2019ve seen a few things. We\u2019ve kind of transitioned out a bit of the year-end malaise, which was largely focused around Fed policy or Fed stance. And I think we\u2019ve seen volumes pick up, and I think confidence result as part of that. But at the same time, I don\u2019t think you can ignore what\u2019s going on in the Ukraine or in Russia. Those things clearly continue to have an overhang on the market. So I think the overall sentiment is better, but I think there\u2019s still some things out there which I think cause people to pause. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : John, just to clarify one piece of the outlook. The net interest margin you indicated that might be down a few basis points in the second quarter. Is that for NII dollars as well? Just kind of wondering what\u2019s driving that outlook, as it would seem that day count and seasonality in cards would get better from the first quarter as we move forward in terms of net interest income dollars. John Gerspach : If you take a look at our NIM performance for the last several years, there\u2019s a little bit of seasonality built into the second quarter where we normally just drop by a couple of basis points. You saw, I think, a little bit of an exaggerated drop two years ago. Last year we were down about 3 basis points, and there\u2019s some preferred stock dividend trading programs that we enter into traditionally in the second quarter as do others in the industry, and they just have a tendency to depress the NIM in the quarter. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Is that on dollars as well, John, if we think about net interest income dollars, and is there a benefit from day count in cards that will overwhelm that or setting that out? John Gerspach : There\u2019s one more day in the second quarter, so we will certainly benefit from that, but there normally is, as I said, a slight decline in it, but I don\u2019t think that you\u2019re looking at anything dramatic, and we certainly, as I said, expect NIM to bounce back up in the second half of the year. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And then as we think about that roadmap to the ROA target for next year, the comments that you just made to Jim were helpful. I think we struggle a lot with how much legal and repositioning need to come down in your model to kind of get to that ROA target. Can you clarify the 200 basis point that you mentioned, the BAU legal, you just mentioned in the prior question? John Gerspach : Yeah, as I said, when we first established the target a little over a year ago now, built into that target, we talked about having repositioning just be more of a BAU effort, and certainly we\u2019ve had higher levels than we would anticipate of repositioning in the last couple of quarters. As we continue to work through this simplification of the business and trying to improve the productivity. But on a BAU basis, again I don\u2019t want to parse it into how much is legal and how much is repositioning, but in general, we would look at legal and the repositioning charges to be roughly 200 basis points of the efficiency ratio. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And then on the CCAR, understanding there\u2019s a limited amount that you can say, are you able to give us any feel for the type of CCAR processes that you need to improve? Any examples you could provide there? Mike Corbat : I think I called out the things that we\u2019re probably going to be most focused on around some process driven things, some model driven things, some people driven things that we\u2019re going to be focused on. And again, I think from our perspective, from the conversations or what I\u2019ve heard, not business model, not strategy, and again, I think things that will take a fair bit of hard work, but things that we feel very strongly that we can get done. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Some of the items the Fed mentioned were previously identified. How do you work to ensure against those types of expectation gaps forming again? Mike Corbat : We haven\u2019t received our written communication yet, but what we didn\u2019t want to do is to wait. We wanted to be engaged from day one on all of these things, and so I think it\u2019s important that we get the written communication and that we make sure that there\u2019s good communication, good transparency around the things that we\u2019re going to do, the timeframe in which we\u2019re going to do them in, and what we think the results of that work will be. And so, we\u2019re going to be committed to doing that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Just a quick follow up on that last one. I just want to make sure, you said you believe the right decision is to focus the full attention on the \u201915 process? Mike Corbat : Correct. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Is that just a function of, like, wow, there\u2019s a lot to do, what\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s a difference of a quarter? Just because I know that some of us were hoping, like, it\u2019s a cumulative process, you want to get off this zero and get moving forward this year. Mike Corbat : Well, again, I think as we\u2019ve described, there\u2019s no one big glaring issue to fix. We\u2019ve got a series of things that we need to address across the workstream. Several of these things - and if it\u2019s model related, as an example of one - would require validation. Those things take time.  And what I don\u2019t want to do is find ourselves in a position of needing to rush to get a capital submission in sometime late third quarter, early fourth quarter, to not get the work done properly and not be in a position shortly thereafter, sometime mid-November, to start the official process or the go-forward process of our January submission.  And again, it\u2019s not a question of resources, it\u2019s not a question of people, it\u2019s not a question of dedicating those things. It\u2019s wanting to make sure we\u2019re in the right place, and I think that right now, committing to going down that path is not the right thing for the institution or the shareholders, and so I want to be focused on getting to the right place to take on the fourth quarter exercise of our first quarter 2015 submission. Glenn Schorr - ISI : So it\u2019s a management decision, not [unintelligible]. Mike Corbat : Management decision. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Good. Back about a year ago, when you put out your slides, you had one that had that four box matrix that showed 21 markets you called underperforming and had ROAs of less than 40 basis points. I definitely remember a couple, like Turkey, like Uruguay, like Paraguay. But recently, we saw stories on Spain, you just mentioned a partial downsizing in Korea. Can you just give a quick update on where you\u2019re at in terms of that process of culling the underperformers? Mike Corbat : When we look at that bucket, I think there\u2019s a couple of things you think about. It\u2019s not actually our ambition to cull that bucket. It\u2019s our ambition to actually take those businesses or those geographies and to get them to a place where they\u2019re worthy of investment from our franchise and they\u2019re creating adequate shareholder return. There\u2019s several levers we pull as we look at those, and some of the things you just described go at that, ranging from a Turkey, where when we looked from a consumer perspective - certainly not an institutional perspective, but from a consumer perspective - we couldn\u2019t see a pathway to investment that made sense over the intermediate or longer term. So we chose to sell that franchise. You look at a place like Korea consumer, we do see the pathway to actually getting that upscale franchise to the appropriate levels of profitability and return, but it\u2019s taking some time and some restructuring to get there. You know, again, you saw us, in that bucket, we\u2019ve closed five, we announced six, which was Honduras, where we just felt, after working with the business teams on the ground and in the product, we couldn\u2019t get there.  And then you\u2019ve seen others. One you mentioned in terms of Korea, where restructuring has been required, and there are others. And those are work in progress, and against that bucket, I\u2019m happy to say we think we\u2019ve made good progress. More to do, and again those buckets aren\u2019t static, and so we\u2019ve had some of those businesses and some of those geographies move out of that bucket and move up, and to stay the course, which is where you\u2019d like to get them or invest to grow. But work in progress, but making progress. Glenn Schorr - ISI : I\u2019m not sure if I saw it anywhere. Did you state your return on tangible common for corp and Holdings separately? And if not, could you? John Gerspach : The closest that we can give you to that would be slide 25 in the earnings presentation. It\u2019s the first slide of the appendix. And we have not yet formally done the allocation of the TCE for you, between corp and Holdings. We will be doing that later this year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : One more CCAR question. Based on what you know now, is your thought process to ask for buyback in the next submission, or do you need to kind of get through one clean before you ask for capital deployment above what you\u2019ve been doing? Mike Corbat : I think at this point clearly we\u2019re focused on the process, and what goes into that is environment, earnings, and all those things. But I think as I\u2019ve consistently said, if the stock is trading below, and trading meaningfully below, the math would strongly push you towards buyback versus dividend. But as we\u2019ve always said, we understand there has to be a balance. And I think if you looked at the quantitative submission we made this year, it was a balance between dividend increase by largely skewed toward buyback. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : And even in terms of working through some of the changes the Fed wants you to make, at this point, do you think you\u2019ll be confident enough to ask for any sort of capital deployment for next year in the \u201915 process, or do you think some of these things we\u2019re seeing at other banks, and just take some time in terms of model validation and things like that? Mike Corbat : I think right now we\u2019re focused on getting the process right. I think what we saw, one of the takeaways from the Fed process this year is there continues to be more and more delineation between the qualitative and the quantitative side. But I think we\u2019ve got several months of work to do here. We\u2019ve got a year to deliver in terms of earnings and quality of earnings in the things we\u2019re doing, and then we\u2019ll make that assessment. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : And I realize next year, asking about expenses, you\u2019ve given us the official targets that were unchanged, you gave us expense guidance this year, but as we think about the investments that you\u2019re making for things like CCAR and regulation, it will obviously be kind of a full run rate for next year, assuming you\u2019re spending throughout this year. I guess the question is, how should we think about cost all-in for next year, and are you still counting on low single digit revenue growth for those efficiency targets? Mike Corbat : We\u2019ve given you the expense guidance for this year, we\u2019ve given you the reaffirmation of achieving the efficiency target for next year. And we\u2019ll get more into detail as far as 2015 expenses perhaps later in the year. Matt O\u2019Connor - Deutsche Bank : And just lastly, on capital, the DTA usage was quite a bit ahead of last year\u2019s pace this quarter, above $1 billion. Is that a decrease run rate assuming earnings stay around here? Or was there something unusual from that tax hit that might have increased that? Mike Corbat : If you think about the components that led to the $1.1 billion, it\u2019s actually $1.1 billion of the DTA utilization came from Citicorp earnings. The Citi Holdings losses actually added $200 million to the DTA, and then the impact of the state tax law changes reduced DTA by $200 million. So basically, Holdings and the state tax law changes netted themselves out, and what fell to the bottom is the $1.1 billion.  So I\u2019d say there\u2019s really three variables that you have to think about. One is what is the level of Citicorp earnings? And clearly, at the level that we\u2019ve produced in the first quarter, that\u2019s going to have a DTA utilization of $1 billion or more.  The second would be the impact of DTA from Holdings losses. Generally, as we drive Holdings losses down, that should lessen the upward pressure on DTA. And then the third aspect would be OCI. And in this quarter, OCI actually just had zero impact on the DTA. But depending on what happens with OCI, that could either be a slight positive, meaning a reduction in the DTA, or a slight increase. So I hate to take you through the long walk, but those are the three variables that you really have to establish. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : John, could you share with us some color, you mentioned that there was strength in the equity trading area within the capital markets due to derivatives. What kind of derivatives were you guys seeing that helped that area? Mike Corbat : What we\u2019ve talked about in the past, our derivative franchise, and in this case our equities derivatives franchise, is largely client, and in this case largely corporate client related. Again, kind of matching against who our traditional client base is. And so we\u2019ve been building up the sales and trading capabilities there. We\u2019ve called it out in the past as an area of emphasis. And while one quarter does not a true trend make, I think we\u2019re making progress and the investments that we\u2019ve made in that are starting to pay benefit. And so again, I think as you think about it, it\u2019s largely on the client side, and it\u2019s largely in particular on the corporate client list of where we\u2019re getting the penetration. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : On the debt gain that you had in Citi Holdings, what was the dollar amount of that? Mike Corbat : It was less than $100 million. It was something close to, I think, $80 million. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : And I thought I saw you had a sales leaseback gain? Did you guys say in the first quarter? Or did I not read that correctly in the press release? Mike Corbat : No, we did. That would be reflected in the North America retail business. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : And what was that dollar amount? Mike Corbat : That was something in the $70 million range. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : What do you think you\u2019ll issue this year in terms of incentive comp for shares to employees? Mike Corbat : I don\u2019t have that share count in my head, I\u2019m sorry. But it will be somewhat similar to what we issued last year, I think. Maybe up or down just a little bit. But roughly in line. Gerard Cassidy - RBC : And then finally, in the communication that you guys pointed to with the Fed, regarding CCAR, is this with Washington? Or is it with New York? Are you comfortable that you\u2019re reaching out to the right people so that there\u2019s no miscommunication? Mike Corbat : It\u2019s in concert with both. Obviously, we\u2019ve got local and we\u2019ve got onsite Fed people here. Those are largely New York Fed. But the CCAR process is run centrally and largely run through that centralized process out of Washington. So I think it\u2019s incumbent upon us to make sure that we\u2019re communicating with both. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : So you just answered the question about the size of the debt gain in Holdings. The mark-to-market that you referred to, could you roughly size that for us as well? Mike Corbat : There were a couple of those things. Rather than try to tease through the whole thing, I think if I was taking a look at the Holdings performance, I would say that, to the extent that we point to some of these outsized gains, I think the best way to visualize that is actually that four-box chart that we give you on slide 17. And you can see that the adjusted operating margin for Citi Holdings, for the last three quarters, was roughly running at that $500 million or so level. And this quarter, it ticked up to $700 million. And I\u2019d say that you wouldn\u2019t be wrong if you assumed that the outsized contribution of those one-time items was the differential between the $500 million that we have been running and the $700 million that we ran this quarter. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : In terms of the mark-to-market, was it strictly a mark-to-market? Or was it a mark prior to a sale? In other words, what I\u2019m really trying to do is get a sense for the environment with respect to your ability to continue to sell down assets, or whether at this point we really should assume that that stuff is pretty much buckled down, and it\u2019s just one-offs from here. Mike Corbat : Is your question specifically on mark-to-market assets, or is that against the overall Holdings portfolio? Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Let\u2019s talk more broadly about the portfolio. Mike Corbat : I think the environment is fine to continue to look at opportunistic sale. And so not uncharacteristic from the past, you get a pretty big fourth quarter where you\u2019re trying to kind of get everything closed, and obviously the buyers like to get things done, and we do as well for year end. I think in the first quarter, you begin kind of setting up for the things you want to do.  You know, we\u2019ve laid out that it\u2019s the highest priority, to continue to work Holdings to breakeven, but we are going to be very focused on opportunistic sales and continuing to get assets down, risk out of the organization, capital released. And I think the environment is fine. You can see from the way we and others are describing credit, and we\u2019re describing the continued recovery in the U.S., again I think if the prices are there you should expect that we\u2019re going to continue to make some progress. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And while we\u2019re on Citi Holdings, just on the expense side, I\u2019m cognizant of what you\u2019re saying about the outlook going forward, but the expense structure there overall has been surprisingly sticky, given how the assets have come down and the sales that you\u2019ve been able to pursue. And I\u2019m wondering if, at this point, we should start to expect some step function kind of expense cuts in Holdings. Mike Corbat : You know, when you take a look at the expense structure in Holdings, obviously the legal expenses in Holdings have been running fairly high, and at some point in time, you should expect a step function down in mode. But from the core operating expenses, we\u2019ve been pretty religious about driving those down in proportion to the asset reductions that we have achieved. Now, there\u2019s some mix issues there. Some assets are a little bit more expense intensive than others. You can imagine that the mortgage business that we have, that is a little bit more expense focused, there\u2019s a little bit more expense associated with maintaining that business, than with mark-to-market assets. So it may be sticky from here, but those core operating expenses still should run down as we reduce the assets. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : As we look at the expense structure on the Citicorp side, you\u2019ve got a slide in the back of the appendix that mostly seems to be making some adjustments for how you distributed the corporate and other expenses out to the units. But is there any change in the efficiency ratio target that you\u2019re looking at in terms of a reallocation of expense cuts between the institutional and the consumer sides within Citicorp? Or is it all just exactly as it was, just reallocated for those corporate expenses? Mike Corbat : The only change that we\u2019ve made is to reflect the change in allocation of corporate expenses. That\u2019s it. The mid-50s target stays in place for Citicorp, and everything else is just math. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Final question for you on the SLRs. That was, I assume, computed entirely within the Fed\u2019s new NPR, which reflects the January BIS leverage ratio guidance? Mike Corbat : The 5-6 reflects everything but what the Fed came out with last week, and as we looked at those changes, that\u2019s where we said, if we were to apply those changes, the daily calculation for off balance sheet items, for instance, and some of the changes in netting, there we would estimate that the 5-6 would either be flat or perhaps increase slightly. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : And just as a follow up to that, in terms of the SACCR, as the BIS is now calling it, do you have any estimate as to what that might do? Mike Corbat : I\u2019ve got to tell you, Guy, you threw me with the SACCR. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Oh, that\u2019s the new standardized approach counterparty credit risk adjustments that the BIS put out in March, but the Fed hasn\u2019t put out an NPR yet on it. Mike Corbat : I can\u2019t answer that directly, I apologize. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So just to follow up on that last question, I think in prior conference calls you indicated that the Basel rules would be additive on the SLR, maybe 30 to 40 basis points, if I recall correctly? Mike Corbat : I think that what we\u2019ve said is that, at least in the last statement that we gave you, was that our early read on what the U.S. was proposing was that it might increase our reported SLR by about 10 basis points. And so all we\u2019re doing now is changing that to say it should be flat to slightly positive. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then just separately, you indicate at the beginning of the call that the whole CCAR process doesn\u2019t have any implication for the business model, mix shift, etc. But I just wanted to understand how you\u2019re thinking about some of the smaller geographies that you\u2019re embedded in. You did have an office closure recently in Latin America, and just in the context of the repositioning that you\u2019re expecting to continue doing here over the next year or so, how much of that is skewed U.S. versus non-U.S.? Mike Corbat : Most of the things that you\u2019ve seen, and the one that you\u2019re talking about, Honduras, are small consumer franchises. So if you look at what we\u2019ve done, whether it\u2019s Uruguay, Paraguay, etc., those have been subscale consumer franchises where we didn\u2019t see the path to profitability and adequate returns through investment or restructuring. So again, in that optimized bucket, we continue to look at those. We continue to work on it, and I think we\u2019re at this point where we feel like we\u2019ve got a business plan going forward against those that are there, a restructuring plan against those that are there, and we\u2019re going to go execute against that. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So we should expect to see some more of those kind of Uruguay/Paraguay? Or you\u2019re pretty much done? Mike Corbat : I think we\u2019re pretty much done against those. We\u2019ll always look under review. And one thing that I\u2019ve said is when we look at CCAR, as an example, and if there are things there from a data or information perspective that we just don\u2019t have a pathway to get a clear handle on and fix, we\u2019ll obviously reassess things based on that as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak of Nomura. Steven Chubak - Nomura : The first question I have is a two-parter, specifically relating to preferred issuance. John, on the most recent fixed income call, you noted that you plan on issuing higher levels of preferreds to approach the 150 basis point tier one capital buffer commanded under Basel. Does the delay in the planned capital actions impact the timing of your preferred issuance plans? And what level of preferreds are contemplated as part of your 2015 profitability targets? Mike Corbat : We\u2019re going to have more to say about the preferred issuance and the capital structure in our fixed income call, which is on Thursday. Steven Chubak - Nomura : Okay. And then switching gears to FICC, one of the things you mentioned on the press call is that you speculated that the FICC fee pool is likely shrinking, and you anticipate a 5% to 10% decline in 2014. I didn\u2019t know if that guidance contemplated the expectation for continued market share gains.  And presumably, if the regulatory or environmental headwinds continue to weigh on FICC, which we\u2019ve seen over the last few years, heavier gearing to flow oriented or transactional activities in local markets should certainly make you better plays. John Gerspach : The commentary I made as far as FICC being down 5% to 10%, I had intended to mean to overall FICC market as opposed to giving any specific guidance on our FICC revenues. But that would certainly be where we would take a look at the overall FICC market for this year.  As I said in the press call, if you just look at the last couple of years with FICC, it certainly appears to be a shrinking pie. To date, we\u2019ve been able to gain share, but there\u2019s a limit to just how much share you\u2019re going to be able to gain.  And what we have done, though, is we\u2019re not fighting the trend. We are actively managing our expense base and assessing our capacity. And we\u2019ve reduced the capacity, we\u2019ve reduced expenses, and we\u2019ll continue to operate in that fashion. We had said early on that our FICC business, for the most part, is much more of a flow business. And that remains in effect. That\u2019s not a change for us. We\u2019ve been operating that flow model for several years now. Steven Chubak - Nomura : And just one more from me on the DTA. Based on the 10-K disclosure, it looks like timing-related DTA still represents close to half of the total balance outstanding. So roughly $25 billion, a not insignificant sum. The cumulative loan loss reserve that we\u2019re modeling going forward is supposed to be a pretty meaningful driver of timing related consumption. That appears to be getting closer to exhaustion, and it appears to only make a small dent in the remainder going forward. I was just hoping you could help us identify some of the other levers which will help drive that timing related DTA utilization, just because it\u2019s such a large drag on your excess capital positioning. I think it\u2019s roughly a $13 billion deduction based on current calculations Mike Corbat : There are a plethora of items that constitute timing differences when you\u2019re looking at the difference between GAAP income and taxable income, both including revenue recognition differences as well as expense recognition differences and some of the issues that you\u2019re pointing to as far as loan loss reserves.  I can\u2019t give you a succinct rundown of all of those things. LLR clearly is a piece of that, and as you look at our LLR, when you say it\u2019s pretty much run its course, you\u2019re probably not that far from being off from a Citicorp point of view, but don\u2019t forget that the LLR then we have in Citi Holdings. We\u2019re certainly not looking to grow Citi Holdings, so that is LLR that still should be run off. So there\u2019s a variety of issues that can add to that DTA timing difference. Steven Chubak - Nomura : Are any of them potential levers that we could actually input in our models? Mike Corbat : No. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : John, maybe dovetailing on part of your response to that last one, you had 42 months of coverage in holdings, up from 39 three months ago. The reserve coverage has gone up by 3 months, life portfolio has gone down by at least three months. Could you kind of relate the life of that portfolio to it, and how we should think about that 42 months coverage as we go forward? John Gerspach : Just to be specific, the numbers that you\u2019re referring to isn\u2019t for all of Holdings. That\u2019s just the North America mortgage. And there, it\u2019s not so much driven by the life of the portfolio. One of the big drivers there is the percentage of loans that we have in troubled debt restructuring status. Because as you get into TDR loans, in effect the LLR that you have is really almost like a present value of a full lifetime loss. And that\u2019s what\u2019s really driving the overall level of LLR that we have in that book. So you\u2019ve got two things that drive the LLR. One is the amount of TDRs that we have. And I believe that the overall portfolio right now has a total TDR of somewhere between 20% to 25% of the portfolio is made up of TDRs. Importantly, when you take a look at the CFNA component of the portfolio, it\u2019s roughly 35% to 40% of the CFNA portfolio that\u2019s in TDR status. The second key driver of the amount of loan loss reserves that we have would be the reset that we\u2019re looking at in \u201915, \u201916, and \u201917 for the home equity loans. So those are two things that are actually going to continue to keep that, I think, relatively high for some time. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : And just to follow up, should we assume that those TDRs, as you\u2019re resolving them, they\u2019re being resolved either kind of inside of the reserves that have been set up, meaning the values that have been getting better over time? John Gerspach : Yeah, you haven\u2019t seen us adding dramatically to the reserve, and I think we\u2019ve been fairly steady, at least the last several quarters, at something around 90% or more reserve utilization against the NCL that the mortgage business has generating. And again, I think the words that we would use would be that we expect the vast majority of the NCLs that we have in mortgages should be covered by loan loss reserves. I don\u2019t want to get tied down to a 90%, but again, it should be fairly high. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : You talked a fair amount about the restructuring outside the U.S. When you\u2019re doing that sort of activity in the U.S. retail business, is it that you\u2019re going to be exiting cities, or going to be kind of reducing the density within the cities. Or how should we think about the pace in the U.S. business? Mike Corbat : What we\u2019ve tried to do is not just internationally or just in the U.S. make sure we\u2019re approaching the retail strategy in a unified way, and that is really an urban-based approach to consumer banking. In the numbers, in the deck, we speak to a reduction of branch footprint, and that\u2019s not just international, that\u2019s not just domestic. It\u2019s a mix of those. And we\u2019re going to continue to look at branch profitability, branch efficiency, and continue to act against that. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : You had mentioned kind of the $20 billion of capital generation last year and $6 billion this quarter, is it fair to think about the way you will be thinking about capital return for 2015 against those numbers, or against reported earnings? How should we be thinking as the base of that? Mike Corbat : I think at this point we\u2019re very focused on getting the process, and in particular the qualitative side of the process, right. I don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a position to speak to that approach. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company : I wanted to ask you about your confidence in the ROA targets and efficiency targets for next year. How much leeway do you have if in fact the revenue environment doesn\u2019t pan out? It\u2019s obviously been a tougher start than we all would have liked in the 12 to 15 months since you put the targets out originally. So if in fact we do have a tougher time from here to 2015, how much flexibility do you think you have on the expense side? And then within that flexibility, how far do you have before you actually do start worrying about cutting into muscle? John Gerspach : I think you\u2019re right, when we put these out we spoke to a couple of things. We spoke to the fact that we thought we were in a challenging revenue environment and I think the 13 to 14 months since we made that pronouncement, I think that\u2019s been proven correct.  I think the other thing that we talked about was that as part of that environment, we didn\u2019t see, nor were we counting on, a big uplift in terms of interest rates to be able to achieve our targets. And we\u2019re going to achieve these targets through a few things.  One is low single digit revenue growth, continued expense discipline, and a continued push across the franchise to continue to wind down Holdings. And obviously the Holdings piece is the ROA piece of things.  And again, I think you\u2019ve seen, methodically in the institutional side, the work that Jamie\u2019s done in terms of quarter on question, continuing to bring down expenses. Manuel\u2019s been fighting the headwinds obviously of mortgage in Korea, but again, sequentially, or largely bringing those expenses down on a quarter on quarter basis, and again, continue to that path, and continuing to take actions against it.  You saw the announcement that came out last night. You know, small, but again, I think symbolic of the effort in terms of another reduction in terms of ICG staff. Again, I want the businesses to be ongoing in their focus of managing to this ratio. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company : So if we didn\u2019t get back to that path where you see the path to a low single digit revenue growth, I guess where within the franchise would you have to look? And I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of how much capacity do you still have to make adjustments on top of these changes you\u2019ve already clearly made and have largely been working through the run rates, to John\u2019s earlier points. Mike Corbat : Part of the reason of having an efficiency ratio out there is to have this not just focused on expenses. What we don\u2019t want to do is be making bad decisions around investment or how we\u2019re thinking about our franchise. There\u2019s got to be the balance between revenue and between expense. And I think that we\u2019ve got to keep that balance. So we\u2019re going to keep pushing away on the expense side of things. Obviously we\u2019ve got work to continue to do on the legal side of things, and we\u2019re not counting on big revenue growth to be able to achieve it. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company : And my one follow up on the reserve release side, this quarter you saw continued nice releases out of card and also in the institutional group. And John, going forward, I was just wondering if you can help us understand the mix of reserve release that you expect or have we kind of gotten towards the end, as you had been saying in prior quarters, about the magnitude of release we could still be seeing out of a corp side. John Gerspach : I continue to think that the reserve releases will flow in card. Can you still anticipate having some for at least the next quarter or two? Probably. I wouldn\u2019t say they\u2019re done, but they should be reduced.  The reserve releases this quarter really came out of both branded cards in the U.S. and retail services. Branded cards, we\u2019re now down to an NCL rate of something in the 3.5%, and retail services, we\u2019re roughly at 4.5%. I don\u2019t see those NCL rates getting better at this point in time. So I don\u2019t anticipate continued reserve releases at the levels that we had out of those businesses in the first quarter.  You referenced ICG. ICG is a bit more episodic when it comes to either reserve builds or reserve releases or the recognition of NCL. And a lot of times, what you see there is the release of the reserve when we take an NCL. Because we would have had, for a particular credit, a reserve established, and therefore when you recognize the NCL, you release the reserve against it and it\u2019s a perfect marriage. So that\u2019s a little bit more difficult to predict, but certainly from consumer, it should be declining. Ken Usdin - Jefferies & Company : And ICG, was that exemplary of the Mexico extra losses you mentioned? Was that one that you just went right against the reserve this quarter? John Gerspach : No, that, for the most part, was an NCL. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I just had two follow up questions. First, on the conversation you had with Guy, can we take away from that, given your guidance for lower core operating expenses in holdings, that the pace at which holdings assets can decline from here could decline greater than the 3% pace we saw this quarter? John Gerspach : I\u2019m trying to make sure I\u2019ve worked through the construct of your question. If the assets decline at more than 3%, then the expenses might decline by more than 3%. That\u2019s going to just depend a little bit, as I said before, on which assets come down. If it\u2019s mortgage related assets, then yes, it should come down probably a little bit more than that. If it\u2019s a mark-to-market asset, it probably won\u2019t have the same impact on the overall expense base. But again, roughly speaking, as we reduce assets, we bring the expenses down in line with those asset reductions. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : I thought you had a strong message on core operating expenses coming down in Holdings for the rest of the year, and sort of given the message that this is really tied to the assets, I was just wondering whether it was fair to assume that the pace of asset declines was going to accelerate from here. But I get the message. And Mike, I apologize for re-asking the same question over and over again, but just to follow up in terms of what Matt and Moshe had already asked you, I think it\u2019s very clear - and thank you for the detail in terms of taking the steps to get the qualitative aspects of the CCAR correct - but assuming that you have made that progress a year from now, is the pace at which you ask for capital return from the Fed going to be dictated by the actual excess capital that you have? Or do you feel that your initial request, after you complete the qualitative process to their satisfaction, going to be more conservative? Mike Corbat : : I think as I said in the statement, we recognize we\u2019ve got to get what we do industrial strength. When Citi operates properly, and you saw in the first quarter, we\u2019ve got the ability to generate large amounts of regulatory capital. Regulatory capital in excess of our earnings. And so we need to get the institution to a position to be able to be returning significant amounts of that capital over time. I can\u2019t tell you, kind of going into this to where we are today, what that capital ask will be next year, but we\u2019ve got to get the institution into a position where, over time, we\u2019ve got the ability to return that capital. Erika Penala Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. I tried. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA : Related to CCAR, who at Citigroup is accountable for the failed stress test? And what are the consequences? Mike Corbat : I am. Obviously, when you think of something that is as important as this for the institution and our shareholders, it\u2019s at the top of the house. So I\u2019m accountable, and if you read our filings, it is in my scorecard, and it\u2019s something for which I\u2019m sure the board will hold me accountable in 2014 when they reflect upon the year. And I\u2019m accountable for it, and I\u2019m accountable for fixing it. Mike Mayo - CLSA : Who else is accountable, and what are the consequences? Can you be specific? I think I hear you saying you\u2019ll be paid down because you didn\u2019t pass, but that\u2019s one aspect. Another aspect is making sure you have the right team on the field to ensure that you have the appropriate regulatory relations. Mike Corbat : What I\u2019ve done is I\u2019ve made changes. I\u2019ve asked Gene McQuade to step back from his retirement and to take responsibility, working directly for me, in terms of our CCAR submission this year. And Gene has access to work across the firm, in terms of the things that need to be done, to make sure that submission is of the caliber and quality that it needs to be. And I\u2019ve got full confidence in Gene, and I have full confidence in the team we have to get to that point, because Gene\u2019s not going to be able to do it alone. Mike Mayo - CLSA : Why is the Fed\u2019s denial, the information related to that, only preliminary? And can you disclose some of the shortcomings without disclosing some of the exam findings? It\u2019s very frustrating for many investors not to have more information. Mike Corbat : As the findings and the conversations that we have, not with just the Fed, but with our regulators, are confidential, I think the Fed has actually been fairly forthcoming with the public when they made their announcements in terms of that there wasn\u2019t any one particular thing, there were things across the series of work streams that were submitted. And again, I called out things in terms of some general approaches to some processes, some things that need to be changed, in terms of our modeling, the way we vet certain risks within the organization, and the combination of people, modeling, and validation, as well as some other things go at those.  And so in there, there\u2019s not one big thing I can point at and say, \u201cThat\u2019s the fix.\u201d We\u2019ve got a number of things that we need to be focused on, and again, I think they\u2019re all fixable, and we\u2019re going to be focused on fixing them and creating the industrial strength process that we need to have. Mike Mayo - CLSA : Perhaps the more general question, is the Fed denial a wakeup call for Citi, or not? And what I think I\u2019ve heard you say on this call is that several areas are doing better - markets, Korea, Holdings, etc. - their optimized bucket is about done, you\u2019re making some of the process changes after the Fed denial, you\u2019re okay with your efficiency and ROA targets. So you\u2019re kind of giving us a little bit of a roadmap for the next seven quarters, but the way I look at it, Citi has failed two of the last three CCARs, it\u2019s been 16 years of a failed merger, and for shareholders, it\u2019s been two lost decades. Two decades ago today, the stock was 10% higher. So again, my main question is, is the Fed denial a wakeup call for you guys? Mike Corbat : I\u2019ll speak for myself and the management team, and I\u2019ll let the board speak for themselves. We\u2019re wide awake. This obviously came as a disappointment. And again, I\u2019m responsible for it, but if you look at, over the last 15, 16, 17 months in the job, the things that we\u2019ve done. We\u2019ve taken headcount down 18,000 people, net of adding 16,000 people across audit risk/compliance. We\u2019ve had sequential improvements in expenses across our ICG businesses. We\u2019ve addressed seven underperforming consumer businesses.  We\u2019ve set out intermediate - and again, I underline the word \u201cimmediate\u201d - targets, the ROA, the ROTCE, and the efficiency ratio targets. And we predicated our ability to hit the ROTC on our ability to return some capital. That\u2019s now proven difficult to do, but committed around the ROA, and committed around the efficiency targets, and we don\u2019t view that as the end state of the company.  We talked about DTA consumption and our ability to change that, and there have been those historically who were quite critical of our ability to consume DTA, and I think we\u2019ve proven. We came in and we said, it\u2019s a priority, $2.5 billion of DTA utilization last year, $1.1 billion for the first quarter of this year, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to consume it.  And so we\u2019ve got things we\u2019ve got to do. We understand. We are not sitting here without a sense of urgency, and if anybody feels that way, they shouldn\u2019t feel that way. And we\u2019re committed to pushing the firm forward. And again, in there, we\u2019re coming with those actions every day. Mike Mayo - CLSA : One conclusion that I reach from the Fed\u2019s denial is that they\u2019re encouraging Citigroup to simplify. Would you agree that that is a push by the regulators and the Fed? Mike Corbat : I think that simpler is always easier in a process like this. Again, in the conversations that I\u2019ve had, the conversations have not been about the business model or the strategy. Again, it\u2019s incumbent upon us, and we completely recognize it. We if don\u2019t have the ability to speak to, to model, and to overlook, govern, and control our organization, then yes, we shouldn\u2019t be in that business, or we shouldn\u2019t be in that geography. But I think we\u2019ve got the ability to do those things, and in the conversations that I\u2019ve had, I don\u2019t believe that\u2019s the statement. Mike Mayo - CLSA : Okay. Well, I hope the Fed gives you any more information that would be helpful for investors before your annual meeting next week, and I look forward to asking questions of the board. Will you webcast the annual meeting next week? Because that would allow the board members to disclose material information. Mike Corbat : We are not going to be webcasting. Mike Mayo - CLSA : All right. Well, I hope someone can change their mind there. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom of SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : John, the mortgage originations were down, it looks like, about 37%. And [favorable] rate lock is down about 20. So what would that have translated into in terms of mortgage income for the period? John Gerspach : The mortgage revenues for the first quarter were down single digit numbers from where we were in the fourth quarter. So as we\u2019ve said, the mortgage revenues pretty much now have stabilized at around the fourth quarter levels. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : So I guess that implies that there was some kind of benefit on the servicing side to offset the decline in origination? John Gerspach : Actually, the spreads have held up fairly well. We changed the mix to be less reliant on purchased mortgages and more reliant on mortgages that we\u2019re now originating out of our branches, which is a better returning business for us. So again, we\u2019ve changed some of the mix of the business, but in general, as I said, the revenues have largely stabilized in that business. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And then just to reconcile that against, you know, adjusting in the North American retail banking business, just excluding the sale leaseback, it looks like you would have been down only 2%. So what would have accounted for the difference? John Gerspach : There\u2019s continued spread compression that we continue to have in that business. Even as we grow deposits, in the low interest rate environment, on a deposit-oriented business, you\u2019re going to run into revenue pressure. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And did I also understand you that credit card volumes in the period across both the proprietary branded and the retail were down more or less in line seasonally? Is that the correct understanding? John Gerspach : From an A&R point of view, or an E&R point of view, the net receivables in those two businesses did exhibit the normal performance that you would have in the first quarter as far as balances being down from where they were in the fourth quarter. However, for the industry, as well as for us, we continue to remain challenged with an overall decline in the A&R and in the E&R. Certainly in our branded cards business, you\u2019ll see a decline year over year. And so that just reflects the continued deleveraging on the part of the U.S. consumer and the resulting high payment rates that we\u2019ve been experiencing. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : I was also referring to the charge card volume, if that would have looked different than what the typical seasonal trend would have implied. John Gerspach : I don\u2019t think so. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And then just lastly, on CCAR, understanding that some of the issues are preliminary, I\u2019m just trying to understand the broad scope of all your statements. But perhaps if you could just help me understand, how satisfied are you today that you understand what all of the criticisms are? John Gerspach : I think at this point we\u2019ve had conversations. I won\u2019t be fully satisfied until we get the written response, and then we close the gap or we close any questions or differences that we may have from what\u2019s in that letter. But again, around the conversations, and it\u2019s been, I would say, good, active, fairly constant engagement to date. Again, I want to see the letter. I don\u2019t think I\u2019m going to be surprised by the letter, but I need to see it. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And just sort of rolling that forward to resubmission, putting aside any capital return dynamics, how much progress do you think you\u2019re expected to show on these issues at that point? And is it possible to actually have accomplished that? John Gerspach : I think the way we need to think of things is we run an institution of global importance, and we shouldn\u2019t set the standard to whatever the Fed standard is. We should set the gold standard in terms of what our approach to the process should be. And I\u2019m comfortable with Gene\u2019s leadership and coordination from the rest of the team we\u2019re going to have the ability to do that, but also, recognizing that that\u2019s not going to be static. Our work\u2019s not going to be static. The bar\u2019s not going to be static, and we\u2019re going to have to continue to go at this every year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : First of all, in terms of the SLR guidance versus last quarter, John, as you said, you thought that the new U.S. rules would benefit you by about 10 basis points. You\u2019ve updated that to flat to up modestly. I guess I\u2019m curious, given what JPMorgan said last week, that potential netting of derivatives and some of the new U.S. rules might help them by 30 to 40 basis points, where you might see some differences between the benefit you\u2019re estimating and the benefits that they might be estimating. John Gerspach : I don\u2019t know what they baked into their original estimates, so I have no way of commenting on how my view of the changes would differ from their view of the changes. I can just tell you where we are and where we would expect to be. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : And then in terms of the Basel III RWA, on an average basis, those were up about $55 billion in Citigroup, a little bit more than that, $57 million in Citicorp. What drove the increase in the RWA? Was it model rejection or was it something else? John Gerspach : I\u2019d focus you on slide 20. That\u2019s probably the easiest place to see it, because it deals with quarter end balances. And so from a quarter end balance point of view, with both quarter ends reflecting all of the changes, the incremental op risk, what you see there is about a $27 billion increase in our risk-weighted assets from the fourth quarter going through the first quarter.  So about a third of that increase is in fact due to the loss of model approvals as we\u2019ve exited from parallels. So that\u2019s exactly the impact that you were looking for. And then that requires us to use alternate approaches, which just adds a little bit to the risk weighted assets. And that would be primarily in market risk. And then the balance is primarily just due to an increase in lending and commitments. You\u2019ve seen how our loan book has grown. We\u2019ve got additional commitments there. And so that\u2019s just a general business driver. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Securities : And then lastly, I think you mentioned that you\u2019re starting to believe in some revenue stability in Korea. And maybe this is putting the cart before the horse, but I guess I\u2019m just curious as to, given where you stand today, what the timing might be for potential revenue upside in the Korean franchise, now that you\u2019ve stabilized it. John Gerspach : Well, I would say that there is a good shot that we will have sequential growth coming from Korea, again, certainly in the back half of the year. That\u2019s the way we\u2019re looking at it. Obviously revenues, we think they\u2019ve stabilized now. I think when you\u2019ve seen the announcement - at least the papers have been reporting about - that we\u2019re going to shut 56 branches in Korea, we need to work with our union there in order to then make sure that we\u2019ve got appropriate headcount that matches those branch closures. That\u2019s likely to have some residual impact on the revenues there, so I\u2019m not quite sure that we can look to the second quarter as far as having revenue growth in Korea, but once we get that second quarter repositioning behind us, I think we\u2019 then should be looking towards sequential growth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Derek De Vries of UBS. Derek De Vries - UBS : In your statements, it looked like you pushed a lot of the costs from the corporate other into the divisions, which makes sense, but I guess I was surprised you didn\u2019t push any of the $56 billion of incremental operational RWA into the divisions. Is that just a timing issue, sort of adjusting your models? Or is that corporate center going to have $124 billion of risk-weighted assets going forward? John Gerspach : As we exited from parallel, and you can maybe go back to some of the disclosures that we\u2019ve made on this, with the level of operational risk-weighted assets, the $288 billion of RWA that is an amount that we agreed with the Fed on. We don\u2019t have the models in place today to apportion that last $56 billion out into the business units. So it\u2019s very much model-related more than anything else. I don\u2019t envision that $56 billion staying in corporate forever, but until we get an agreed upon model approach, it\u2019s going to be difficult to apportion it out. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time. Susan Kendall : Thank you, operator. Thank you all for joining us here this morning. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to the investor relations team. Thank you.",

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instruction for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2013 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Susan, thank you; and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $181 million for the second quarter of 2014. Excluding the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement CVA and DVA, net income was $3.9 billion, up slightly from last year or $1.24 per share.  Before I get into our operating performance I want to discuss our legacy mortgage settlement. The comprehensive settlement announced today with the U.S. Department of Justice, the State AGs and the FDIC resolves all pending civil investigations related to our legacy RMBS and CDO underwriting, structuring and issuance activities. We also have now resolved substantially all of our legacy RMBS and CDO litigation. We believe that this settlement is in the best interest of our shareholders and allows us to move forward and to focus on the future in serving our clients. During this quarter, our institutional businesses performed well outside of markets where macro uncertainty and historically low volatility reduced client activity clearly impacting our fixed income and equities revenues. Corporate investment banking revenues strengthened, led by strong equity and debt underwriting and our treasury and trade solutions businesses again saw underlying revenue growth as volumes continued to increase. In consumer banking, year-over-year comparisons continue to be affected by lower mortgage refinancing activity and our repositioning efforts in Korea. But we believe these businesses have now stabilized and we're better positioned for growth in the second half of the year. We grow our consumer loans despite the uneven economic environment and saw continued signs of progress in our U.S. cards business.  Excluding the settlement announced today, Citi Holdings turned to profit for the first time since its formation and we announced agreements to sell our consumer businesses in Greece and Spain which will further reduce holdings assets in the third quarter. The holdings profit actually helped drive DTA consumption which totaled $1.1 billion in the quarter and $2.2 billion for the first half of 2014. And despite the impact of the legacy mortgage settlement on our net income, our capital position strengthened to a Tier 1 common ratio of 10.6% on a Basel III basis and our tangible book value also increased.  During the first half of this year we generated $10 billion in capital despite today\u2019s settlement. Throughout the organization we're focused on strengthening our capital planning process, improving our execution and increasing our efficiency; we're engaged in a firm-wide effort that includes improving our target client model, streamlining our structure, processes and technology platforms and optimizing our real estate footprint.  These actions create a capability to make investments in our business, regulatory and compliance activities and strength in our capital planning process. They also allow us to reduce our operating expenses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year.   While this effort is on-going, we are already making some good headway. For example, during the second quarter, we\u2019ve reduced our headcount by 3,500 people to 244,000 and it is now down nearly 7,000 for the first half of 2014 and 15,000 people since the fourth quarter of 2012. We continue to simplify our product offerings and we further rationalized our footprint, shrinking retail branches by nearly 140 while reducing consumer support sides by another 31 locations.   Looking ahead, for the second half of this year, I feel good about how we're positioned and I believe we should see an improved revenue picture. On the consumer side, the U.S. economy is gaining strength as job creation and consumer spending increases. Internationally, our franchise is performing well and we believe the headwinds facing our retail business in Korea are abated.  In our institutional business, while client activity has been lower in markets, business such as investment banking and trade finance are showing momentum. We\u2019ve also demonstrated the ability to reduce the drag of Citi Holdings and utilize DTA, both of which will contribute to the strengthening of our capital positions going forward. John will now go through the deck and then we will be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach :  Okay, thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items which affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to last year. First as Mike described, this quarter, we took a $3.7 billion after-tax charge related to the mortgage settlement for a negative impact on EPS of a $1.21 per share; and second, CVA and DVA was a negative $33 million pre-tax this quarter or $0.01 per share after tax compared to a positive 477 million pre-tax or $0.09 per share in the second quarter of last year.  Adjusting for CVA, DVA and the impact of the settlement, we earned $1.24 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.25 per share in the second quarter of last year. Throughout today\u2019s presentation, I\u2019ll be discussing our results excluding these two items to provide comparability to prior periods.  On slide four, we show total Citigroup results. We are in $3.9 billion in the second quarter and $8.1 billion for the first half of 2014, both up slightly from prior periods as lower revenues were offset by lower operating expenses and a decline in credit cost. Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $668 billion as 8% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings and deposits grew 3% to $966 billion.   On slide five, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related costs were roughly $400 million in the second quarter, mostly incurred in Citicorp. Repositioning costs were also around $400 million, including approximately $270 million of repositioning costs related to our consumer franchise in Korea.   Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in the second quarter declined by over $225 million in constant dollars, driven by continued cost reduction initiatives and the decline in Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as the impact of business growth. Sequentially, core expenses were down versus last quarter, reflecting lower incentive compensation and continued efficiency efforts, again partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost.   On slide six, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. In Citicorp, earnings declined 18% year-over-year as lower revenues and higher legal and repositioning costs were partially offset by lower core operating expenses and an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we earned over $240 million this quarter, compared to a loss of nearly $600 million last year.  Citi Holdings revenues increased significantly from last year driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve builds in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Core expenses continue to decline in line with a 15% year-over-year reduction in assets. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $111 billion of assets or 6% of Citi Group assets. Turning to Citi Corp on slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter. Core operating expenses, excluding legal and repositioning cost also increased 1% from the prior year, driven by business growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs, partially offset by on-going efficiency savings. Including legal and repositioning cost, total operating expenses increased 12% from the prior year, mostly due to the repositioning charges in Korea.  International consumer revenues continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of certain markets. Korea remained a headwind year-over-year, however the franchise was broadly stable quarter-over-quarter and we believe we should begin to see sequential revenue growth in Korea as we go into the second half of the year.  Aside from Korea, the most significant challenge for Asia consumer revenue this quarter was a decline in investment sales revenues both year-over-year and sequentially. While this business has grown over time, quarterly investment sales revenues tend to reflect the overall capital markets environment and in the second quarter we saw a weaker investor sentiment. We provide more details on Asia consumer revenues on appendix slide 25. Despite these headwinds most underlying drivers remain positive with average loans up 7% and average deposits up 3% from last year. International credit cost grew 10% year-over-year mostly reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning in Latin America while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at below 200 basis points. Slide eight shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were down 5% year-over-year and flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.2 billion declined by 26% from last year mostly reflecting lower mortgage refinancing activity, and were up 3% sequentially as higher mortgage revenues and improved deposit spreads offset the absence of a onetime $70 million gain in the prior quarter. Branded cards revenues of 2 billion were up 3% versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and lower average loans were partially offset by an improvement in spreads driven by a reduction in promotional rate balances. And retail services revenues grew 7% from last year, driven by the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. On-going cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down by 4% year-over-year to 2.3 billion even after absorbing the impact of the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. We continue to resize our North America retail banking business in the second quarter, taking cost out of our mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint all while continuing to grow our franchise. Over the past 12 months, we have sold or closed over 70 branches in North America. During the same period, we grew average retail loans by 11% and average deposits by 4% including 11% growth in checking account balances. In branded cards, we also saw momentum while total average loans have continued to decline modestly, this mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances. Full rate balances have growth year-over-year for five consecutive quarters, reflecting account growth and increased card usage primarily in our proprietary rewards and travel co-brand products including American advantage where new account growth for our executive card has exceeded our expectations. Credit remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving more than what we had anticipated in branded cards and retail services contributing to a loan loss reserve release of nearly $400 million. At quarter end, our loan loss reverses in North America cards represented roughly 16 months of concurrent NCL coverage. Slide nine shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, global consumer credit trends remained favorable in the second quarter with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In North America, the strong credit trends I just mentioned drove an improvement in our outlook and we now anticipate the full year NCL rate to be roughly in line with first half results or slightly better than our previous estimate of around 3%. Asia remained stable, and in Latin America, we saw a modest uptick in both NCL and delinquency rates. These trends were driven primarily by Mexico cards as that portfolio continued to season and consumers continued to adjust to fiscal reforms as well as the impact of slower economic growth. We continue to expect the full year NCL rate in Latin America to be roughly in line with first half levels. This rate could be higher of course if we incur any losses related to our exposure to homebuilders in Mexico; however, we would expect these losses to be charged against our reserves and therefore they should be neutral to the overall cost of credit. Slide 10 shows the efficiency ratio for global consumer banking on a trailing 12-month basis. Total franchise results are shown on the light blue line, while the dark blue bars represent the efficiency ratio excluding North America mortgage and Korea. As I\u2019ve mentioned before, revenues have declined in both North America mortgage and Korea over the past year, in addition we encouraged significant repositioning charges in Korea in the second quarter creating a drag on our reported operating efficiency. Outside of these businesses, we have made steady progress reducing our efficiency ratio to just under 54% as we have exited underperforming markets and simplified our operations. Slide 11, shows our total consumer expenses over the past five quarters, split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Legal and repositioning costs were elevated in the second quarter driven by Korea, while core operating expenses continued to decline. We expect to make further progress in reducing core expenses in the second half of the year as we remain on track to achieve or exceed our year-end goals for headcount reduction, card product simplification and branch and support side rationalization. Turning now to the institutional clients\u2019 group on slide 12; revenues of $8.5 billion declined 7% from last year and 8% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.5 billion grew 6% from last year and 9% from the prior quarter. Excluding the one-time $50 million gain in the prior year, treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 3%, both year-over-year and sequentially as growth in fees and volumes were partially offset by spread compression. Investment banking revenues of $1.3 billion were up 16% from last year and 27% from the prior quarter, driven by particularly strong debt and equity underwriting activity. M&A revenues improved from the prior quarter and we continue to increase our share of announced M&A volumes in a growing market. Private bank revenues of $656 million grew 2% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the impact of spread compression and were down 2% sequentially on lower capital markets activity. Core lending revenues were $454 million, up from prior periods mostly due to higher average loans. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 16% year-over-year and 21% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion declined 12% from last year as historically low volatility and continued macro uncertainty dampened investor client flows particularly in rates and currencies. In addition, the prior year period benefited from gains as we paired back risk positions given increased volatility in emerging markets.  Sequentially, fixed income revenues declined 22% reflecting seasonal trends. Equities revenues of $659 million were down 26% year-over-year and 25% sequentially reflecting lower client activity, as well as weak trading performance in EMEA in part driven by macro and geopolitical uncertainties in the region. In securities services revenues were roughly flat versus last year as increased client activity was offset by a reduction in high margin deposits and up 7% sequentially due to increased client balances and higher activity from new accounts. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were down 2% versus the prior year driven by lower incentive compensation partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost and legal and related expenses in the recent quarter. On a sequential basis, expenses decreased by over a $100 million mostly reflecting lower incentive compensation. On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. On a trailing 12 month basis we have lowered our operating expenses every quarter for over two years, driving the full year efficiency ratio from 66% two years ago to 60% as of the second quarter, even as the revenue environment has remained challenging. Our comp ratio for the most recent 12 months was 29% consistent with the full year of 2013. Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher, legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance cost. Assets of $326 billion included approximately $104 billion of cash and cash equivalents and a $167 billion of liquid investment securities. On slide 15 shows Citi Holdings\u2019 assets which totalled $111 billion at quarter-end, with roughly 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $3 billion during the quarter mostly driven by net pay downs. Roughly $3.8 billion of asset sales were in process during the quarter, but not yet closed as of June 30. These include $2.7 billion of assets from the announced sale of our retail operations in Spain and Greece, as well as nearly $1 billion of mortgage loans, each of which should close in the third quarter. On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings\u2019 financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.5 billion were up year-over-year primarily driven by the absence of rep and warranty reserve bills in the recent quarter, higher gains on asset sales and lower funding costs. Citi Holdings\u2019 expenses decreased significantly with core operating expenses down 15% in line with the reduction in assets. Net credit losses continued to improve and we released $254 million of loan loss reserves, the vast majority of which was related to North America mortgages. Looking at the past five quarters of Citi Holdings results on Slide 17; the operating margin in Citi Holdings remained at roughly $700 million this quarter driven in part by gains on asset sales. Credit remained fairly stable and on an adjusted basis, legal cost declined significantly driving Citi Holdings to a profit in the second quarter. On Slide 18, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Net interest revenue was $11.9 billion in the second quarter, up from last year on higher interest earning assets and an improvement in net interest margin and up sequentially driven by day count. Our net interest margin declined sequentially to 287 basis points in the second quarter driven by lower loan and investment yields partially offset by lower cost of funds. We currently believe our net interest margin should remain roughly flat to second quarter levels for the remainder of the year. On Slide 19, we show our key capital metrics. Despite the impact of the settlement our Basel III tier one common ratio grew to 10.6% as we benefited from DTA utilization during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 5.7% and our tangible book value grew to $56.89 per share. So in summary our results in the second quarter demonstrated further progress on several fronts, while markets revenues reflected the challenging environment, we showed continued momentum in our investment banking franchise and Treasury and Trade solutions continued to grow all while we continued to reduce our total expense base in ICG.  On the consumer side we continued to grow loans, deposits and card purchase sales while reducing our core operating expenses and maintaining overall favorable credit performance. And in Citi Holdings excluding the impact of the settlement we achieved our first profitable quarter and we believe Citi Holdings should remain profitable for the remainder of this year, although with some variability quarter-to-quarter. Looking to the second half of the year, in markets our results will likely reflect the overall environment. Although we would certainly anticipate that market conditions should be somewhat more favorable than in the second half of 2013. In investment banking revenues will also reflect the overall market, but we feel good about the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance not only in the second quarter but over the past year. And in Treasury and Trade solutions we believe we can continue growing our revenues in the second half of the year driven by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds. Turning to consumer banking; in North America we believe revenue should grow in the second half of the year, both versus the first half of 2014 as well as year-over-year with positive operating leverage. And in international consumer revenue should also grow in the second half of the year. As we move past our repositioning efforts in Korea and the underlying growth of the remaining franchise becomes more apparent. Turning to expenses; in Citicorp our core operating expenses should continue to decline, although we expect to face on going higher regulatory and compliance costs. Repositioning expenses in the second half of the year should be roughly in line with the first half levels and legal cost will likely remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature. We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our credit performance, while we saw an increase in loan loss reserve releases in our North America cards business this quarter, driven better by better than anticipated credit performance. We do expect the reserve releases to be lower in the second half of the year and nominal credit costs in Citicorp could increase as we continue to grow our loan portfolios. And finally we expect our tax rate for the remainder of the year to be broadly in line with the first half in the range of 32%. And with that Mike and I would be happy to take any questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Our first question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein :  John a few questions, yes, just wanted to follow up on a couple of things you just mentioned. On the legal cost would you expect with the settlement now taking a lot of the mortgage exposure off the table? I assume that legal cost would look more like this quarter where ex-CMBS settlement they seem to come in around 400 million rather than the prior trend which was closer to about 800 million? John Gerspach :  Well, let me break it down this way John. I\u2019d say that with the legacy mortgage settlement behind us, we wouldn\u2019t expect holdings to have any significant level of legal charges in the second half of 2014. Now as I said, legal expenses in Citicorp that they are going to remain somewhat elevated and episodic in nature. I wouldn\u2019t expect anything significant. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : And this quarter you had about 400 million in Citicorp in which you characterize that as still elevated to $400 million? John Gerspach :  I would say that\u2019s elevated versus what would expect in a normal environment, so we will see where we will go at the second half of the year. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein :  Okay. And then I thought the repositioning expenses will be coming down in the second half of the year after the elevated charge this quarter for Korea. I thought you might have said that last quarter that they will be coming down after this. So, I thought you just said now that they would stay at the first half levels. What would be keeping the repositioning cost so high? John Gerspach : : Well John, we continue to focus our efforts on our operations in the countries that we had identified as optimized markets. And matter of fact if you go back to the conference that we presented at near the end of May, we actually used the slide that showed that we had improved our efficiency ratio by over -- I think it was 300 basis points in those markets during 2013 and we generated further improvements during 2014 through a combination of efforts of branch closures, product rationalization, consolidation of operation and headcount reductions. And we're just going to continue that focus during the balance of this year and given that continued focus we just think it\u2019s more likely that the repositioning reserves for the second half are going to be much more in line with what we had in the first. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And you mentioned North America consumer expenses likely to improve some more, overall expenses on the core expense face of about 11 billion this quarter companywide. Do you hope to improve from there going forward? John Gerspach : : We expect the core expenses to decline sequentially in each of the next two quarters. Obviously, some -- we won\u2019t get as much I think as everybody would like just because of the higher legal and regulatory cost that we're facing but we do anticipate continued sequential decline in the core operating expenses. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And just shifting gears to the DTA utilization. That was a big number this quarter, John and better than expected. The big settlement didn\u2019t seem to have an impact, is that because it wasn\u2019t tax deductible, could you just explain that? John Gerspach : : You have got it, John. The lion\u2019s share of the cost, if you take a look, we talked about taking a pre-tax charge of 3.8 billion and an after tax charge of 3.7 billion, so to your point not much of the settlement cost was tax deductible. And so perhaps the best way to take a look at the performance in the quarter is looking at the results excluding the settlement and there you will see that I think in the first quarter we had $5.9 billion or so of pre-tax earnings and in the second quarter we have roughly the same amount. So, when you are dealing with that level of pre-tax earnings, you are going to get DTA utilization of again somewhere between 700 million, 800 million or 1.1 billion in the quarter. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And that $1.1 billion this quarter contributed to $2.2 billion of Basel III capital build. Could you just explain that on page 36, you show out $1.1 billion led to $2.2 billion of increased Basel III capital? John Gerspach : : Yes John that really is tied up in the multiplier effect and it\u2019s a very, very complicated formula that you've got to go through and take a look at not just the level of DTA but first of all what type of DTA. In both the first and the second quarter most of the DTA that we've been able to utilize, has come out of the FTC, those foreign tax credits. So, you start by, that\u2019s immediately dollar-for-dollar reduction because those things just come off the top.  Then between the capital growth as well as the reduction that we've had in things like mortgage servicing rights, we've got even more room now in our 10% buckets as well as the overall 15% bucket. And so you just add up all the various multiplier effects and you end up with that $1.1 billion actually contributing $2.2 billion in regulatory capital. John McDonald - Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Right, you got expansion of the cap, the dynamic cap. Last thing may be Mike, could you comment on the [indiscernible] or any update on the progress you are making understanding the fed\u2019s concerns and what they are asking you to improve and your confidence and the ability to satisfy the high qualitative bar that the regulators are setting? Mike Corbat :  Sure. What I would say, John, this is Mike, that there is really very little additional information beyond what we've said at the venues along the way but I think to summarize that we still are operating and feel strongly that this isn\u2019t an issue with our business model, our strategy, our levels of capital are clearly our ability to generate capital. Gene and the team are working to continue to enhance and where necessary, build the right (inclusive) [ph] processes in a range of scenarios around the firm. We feel good about the progress. We feel very good about the communication with the fed but its work in progress and we've got more work to do between now and year-end. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : A quick question may be just a follow-up on the legal side, you guys settled for $4.5 billion in cash and took a $3.8 billion charge, you only used up $700 million in reserves. Is that effectively a reserve build for what remains and that makes you feel a little bit better about your coverage going forward or is that -- are you only really have $700 million set aside for that, that issue. John Gerspach : : Here Jim, I\u2019m not going to comment on the reserve levels that we have set up for any individual litigation but in the math that you\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve left out the cost of the consumer relief efforts and we do anticipate and have made provision for expense that we will incur in connection with those consumer relief efforts and so that, that estimate is also embedded in the $3.8 billion pre-tax charge that we took. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, so it\u2019s not just through reserves but also through expense. John Gerspach :   Through the expense that we\u2019ve taken this quarter, yes. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, all right. John Gerspach :   You know Jim, we start with the $4 billion penalty, then you\u2019ve got the $500 million that we\u2019ll pay to the state AGs and the FDI Citi. You add to that the cost of the consumer relief, because there are hard dollar costs associated with the consumer relief efforts and then you subtract out the reserves that we have previously established and that would leave -- that\u2019s what leaves you with the $3.8 billion pre-tax number. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, fair enough, just a follow up on the expenses and targets, I think we\u2019ve obviously seen revenues come down quite a bit in capital markets year to date, I think you guys, as recently as early June at a conference have been sticking with your targets and I\u2019ve had some questions on how you guys get there with lower revenues, is this part of the reason why restructuring costs are going to remain higher because you\u2019re doing more on the expense side, so I guess they just want to see if that\u2019s right and if you feel still comfortable with your ROA and efficiency ratio targets given where you are right now. John Gerspach :   Yes, we\u2019re still committed to those targets for 2015 and you know as we said we\u2019re very focused on our execution efforts and in rationalizing the expense base in every one of our businesses. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : And so the weaker revenues don\u2019t give you pause. John Gerspach :   Well I mean, I don\u2019t want to be so cavalier about it, Jim to just say that we don\u2019t consider the weaker revenues but we\u2019ve taken all of that into consideration when we say that we\u2019re still committed to those targets. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Right, right, okay. No, that\u2019s great, and one last question just on deposit growth, is that very good quarter deposit growth and see corporate Asia has lagged quite a bit in your international side, is that simply a function of Korea or is there something else going there much broad based across Asia that\u2019s limited deposit growth. John Gerspach :   No, as you know Jim, we\u2019re carefully managing deposit growth and we have been managing deposit growth for some time, you can\u2019t just manage deposit growth at the top of the house, you need to manage it in each country and frankly in each legal vehicle, and so as we look at the liquidity needs for each of our -- each of the countries in which we operate we\u2019re very focused on the level of deposits that we have and importantly the quality of those deposits. So you\u2019re going to see -- you\u2019ll see some regions where we have targeted higher deposit growth than others and it\u2019s really based upon the liquidity needs in each of those regions. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay so it\u2019s just you guys holding it back. John Gerspach :   Well, we\u2019re carefully managing deposits. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : Okay, that\u2019s all I got. John Gerspach :   You have to manage your balance sheet. Jim Mitchell - Buckingham Research : No, I hear you, okay thanks, I appreciate it. John Gerspach :   Not a problem. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Hello there, quick in holdings, heard your comments about second half profitability which is cool, I\u2019m just curious, on the net interest revenue side, net interest revenues have increased last three quarters in a row but assets, loans and deposits are obviously shrinking with the whole run off, just curious on how that works. John Gerspach :   Well, we -- there\u2019s yield on assets and then there is cost of funds and we have been -- we\u2019ve been actively managing both sides of that equation, so when you take a look at it you start to lower your cost of funds as you run off assets and that produces the results that you\u2019re looking at. Glenn Schorr - ISI : That makes sense to me on cost of funds, I\u2019m curious mechanically how that works, is that assigning the relative, meaning when the book is larger and they\u2019re less liquid, it gets a higher cost and as the book gets smaller and more liquid you get a better funding cost, is that the big sling in there, I mean I\u2019m -- it\u2019s like a 150 million, it\u2019s not enormous but it\u2019s just counter intuitive. John Gerspach :   Well it\u2019s the type of funding that you have and the level and certainly the amount of funding that you have in each business as well and you know as the cost of that funding then goes down, you\u2019re going to get a benefit, I don\u2019t know how else to describe it, you know clearly some of the characteristics that you mentioned are driving characteristics, highly illiquid assets have a higher cost of fund -- cost more to fund than liquid assets, so as a book shifts from illiquid to more liquid you\u2019re going to see that we can therefore change the funding problem. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Yes, I\u2019m good with it, I appreciate it, same kind of com question, inside the equities business you mentioned some of the weaknesses was due to obviously lower volumes, the other part was I think I read a tagline on hedging on the Ukrainian side, produce part of the drop, can you just give a further comment I didn\u2019t see it in the release but I think I saw it online. John Gerspach :   Yes, no. In the second quarter, and again this is specific to the equities markets, the trading business. In the second quarter we had hedged our equities book in EMEA in anticipation of -- kind of a significant negative market reaction to the Russia, Ukraine situation. Now ultimately that did not materialize to the extent that we have planned for. And so as a consequence, our actions to de-risk the book actually resulted in realized losses during the quarter. So the realized losses that we took in lifting those hedges, equal to about 40% of the revenue decline in that product year-on-year. So we had a -- equities markets were down 26% year-over-year. And so that the de-risking activities actually contribute about 10 full percentage points to that decline. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Got it. Okay. It\u2019s helpful. And then last one, in the FX business, I know this is a hard one, but the slowdown that we\u2019ve seen, the environment obviously volatility has fallen off dramatically, is there any way to tribute how much of that is cyclical obvious of just lower volatility, lower client volumes, lower revenues to changes that have taken place in light of the recent investigations in the market? John Gerspach :   I think that\u2019s going to be really difficult to try to parse out. Mike Corbat : It\u2019s Mike. And I would say couple of things, I think that, again when you think of our FX business there\u2019s a couple of components to it, which in some ways makes it different from others, one is, we\u2019ve got the big transaction processing business and money is coming through the pipes that we process in a regular basis. I think to your question where we\u2019ve seen the real slowdown is on the more active trading. And just that largely being as a result of the lower volatility. So I would view a lot of that as being largely cyclical. And I would expect as volatility comes back, some reasonable portion of that to come back with the volatility. Glenn Schorr - ISI : Okay. That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. Thanks Mike. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Just a question first of all on your reasonable and possible losses with respect to the obviously, the resolution of a lot of issues, can you give us a sense of what that might look like versus last quarter when the (Q) [ph] comes out? John Gerspach : No Guy. We\u2019ll address that when we publish the (Q) [ph]. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Okay. Fair enough, thought I'd ask. I wanted to ask you question on the potential for the significant deposit movements in the probably foreseeable future at this point when the FED starts to move your short terms rate higher, it seems like the mechanics are going to be different than they have been in the past for all the reasons that we all know about. And I think we can say that there is a couple of schools of thought, as to what might happen when short term rates go up, one is deposits have really only shrunk a couple of times in the last century or so, it's always been very marginal, so not to worry. And then on the other hand JPMorgan has flagged their view kind of at the other end of the spectrum but maybe this time is different because of mechanics of what the FED\u2019s going to do will be so different and may require a drain of, the FED maybe trillion dollars of bank deposits. As you think about liquidity planning and your internal stress testing, is there anything that you can share with us about the range of best and worst case deposit growth that you might be thinking about? John Gerspach :   Yes. I am not going to give you a range Guy, but I\u2019ll say this. I\u2019d say that, when you think about the potential impact of the FED\u2019s actions on deposits, one we\u2019re probably less exposed than others on this, don\u2019t forget, we\u2019ve got of our $968 billion of deposits, it\u2019s just a little over $400 billion are domestic deposits. So it\u2019s not the biggest part of our book. And we, as I mentioned in response to one other question, we\u2019ve really been managing our deposit base very carefully over the last few years. And so I think the other thing you need to consider is the quality of an institutions deposit base. And I think that what we\u2019ve been able to achieve is an improvement in our quality of deposits, both internationally but specifically domestically, over the course of the last several years.  We\u2019re much more focused on and much more concentrated in real operating accounts, we\u2019ve really driven down the level of time deposits that we have in the business. And importantly when you look at with some of the FED\u2019s actions, I think that they are more likely to impact deposits that people take in from financial institutions. And if you\u2019re managing your deposit base in connection with the LCR and NSFR rules, you\u2019re going to be lowering that deposit base anyway so you should be less susceptible to big deposit movements because when the LCR and the NSFR rules deposits associated with financial institutions you get very little if any, credit for the liquidity value of those deposits. So they really bring you nothing as far as managing your overall funding, your overall liquidity. So we\u2019ve been very focused on managing all the aspects of the deposit base over the past couple of years, both as to the nature of the deposits, the liquidity value of those deposits, and really trying to focus on core operating deposits in both retail and corporate customers. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Got it. So the follow-up question was going to be how all of this might interact with LCR but it sounds like what you\u2019re saying is that the LCR shouldn\u2019t change very much even with the kinds of flows that might be associated with that type of that activity because they would probably be low LCR credit deposits anyway? John Gerspach : : Yes, it\u2019s going to be real interesting to see how the FED goes about the next level of managing as far as increasing rates because when you take a look at how monetary policy is going to interact with regulatory policy I think we\u2019re going to end up in a new world that none of us have lived through before nor has the FED. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Great. And then final question from me just on the core equity Tier 1 ratio that as you noted did pick up, that I believe is an advance calculation is that right? And if so, can you just tell us what the standardized was? John Gerspach : : Yes, the number that we published is the advanced methodology because again our Tier 1 common ratio is lower under advanced and it is currently under standard. I don\u2019t have the standard in front of me Guy, but it\u2019s higher than what the advanced approach [indiscernible]. Guy Moszkowski - Autonomous Research : Okay, fair enough. And thanks for the (proponents) [ph] on the deposit outflows, that was very helpful. John Gerspach : : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Couple of questions, one is on the op risks RWAs, you noticed you mentioned at bottom of page 19 that the op risk RWAs are flat Q-on-Q at 288 while for the last few quarters. And I guess I am just wondering does that imply that the kind of settlement that we just had this morning was reflected in your RWA outlook before? John Gerspach : : That\u2019s our view Betsy that this settlement was already embedded in the increases that we took to the op risk risk weighted assets both in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, because then when we\u2019re looking at these articles that are out there and obviously we don\u2019t know how much is reflecting of your views but you went in with the lower bid for the settlement than the ultimate final settlement, so I am just trying to square that. John Gerspach : : Well, don\u2019t forget it\u2019s a (combination) [ph] but usually impacts op risk is the overall industry more than a particular institution. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, so you would have thought that like the numbers that you actually came out with was more relevant than what the initial ask was that you might have had for yourself. Is that the way to think about it? John Gerspach : : The way to think about it is really the operational risk environment that the industry is facing and we think that that is really was already embedded in the 288 number. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then we\u2026 John Gerspach : : As of the end of the first quarter. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. And then we also have a couple of more things that still need to get resolved obviously it's been in the headlines for a while, things like LIBOR and FX. And so would those also be embedded within this number as well? John Gerspach : : Based upon everyone\u2019s current views as to what those could be. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay. Separate question on the Citicorp corporate other, its page 14. Just want to make sure I understand that expected sustainability of these numbers versus one timers in this quarter revenues down because of hedging activities, maybe to just understand what your thoughts are for that line item, how much did hedging activities impact that, would that have been more like 140 last quarter\u2019s revenue line? John Gerspach : : Yes, I think when you take a look at corp other, you\u2019re going to get a variation around $100 million from quarter to quarter. Sometimes it will be a little bit less than a $100 million, sometimes it will be a little bit more than a $100 million. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, on the revenue side. John Gerspach : : Correct. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then on the expenses little bit of higher legal and regulatory compliance, I am just legal sounds like it\u2019s a one timer but reg compliance I am not sure if that\u2019s a one timer or FED just keeps going so how much of that you\u2019re thinking about the expense line now? John Gerspach : : When you take a look at the first -- I'd take a look at the core operating expenses sequentially and if you look at them sequentially the 284 and the 297 are fairly close. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : So legal and repo should fade over the next couple of years is that how to think about there? John Gerspach : : Well, certainly repositioning as I said, repositioning cost overall for Citi should be -- the second half should be somewhat in line with what we had in the first half. And legal, as I said, I think that\u2019s going to remain elevated but it\u2019s also going to be somewhat episodic in nature. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And then just lastly on page 11, you have the consumer expense drivers and as of 2Q, in some cases, you've already exceeded what your year-end forecast is; does that suggest year-end forecast will be updated or we\u2019re just running ahead of schedule and the levers for the expense line in global consumer are largely around the support side at this stage? John Gerspach : Yes, I'd say yes to everything you said. So when you look at some of the drivers, we are running ahead of where we thought we would be clearly on headcount. We didn\u2019t feel that we could update you with the new year-end target at this point in time. So we will likely give you a better view as to where we're going to be at year-end when we come back to you in the third quarter. But obviously it should be lower than the 145 that we are right now. As a matter of fact, if you look at the target we have said it\u2019s going to be less than 145. So if we get less than 145, we'll give you a sense as to how low we think we will be able to drive that next quarter. And I think as far as from a support side point of view that clearly is a big driver of expense in the consumer businesses and that is something that we're very focused on. Good progress in the second quarter, taking those support side down by about 30. And we hope to be able to do that and more in the third and fourth quarter. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : And that\u2019s in part the benefit from the project Rainbow? John Gerspach : In part, it\u2019s Rainbow, it\u2019s also -- we talked about in the past trying to run the consumer business as opposed to a collection of 35 individual consumer businesses, as more of a global consumer bank, and so that clearly has some aspect of it. But there\u2019s also aspect that we can do just in the U.S where in the U.S., we sort of ran the consumer business not as a bank, but as a collection of product silos. And so as we begin to run the U.S. more as a retail bank, that also gives us the ability to close down sites and consolidate. Betsy Graseck - Morgan Stanley : Okay, so there should be more income here on the expense outlook? John Gerspach : That\u2019s what we're saying, yes. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Few questions, first, how much was the Ukraine hedging loss? John Gerspach : Well, I didn\u2019t give you an exact dollar amount, Mike, but you can figure it out by the fact that I said it was -- it caused about 10%; so let\u2019s call it just slightly around $100 million or so. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay, and as it relates to Korea, you\u2019re saying the headline should be abating. Can you give us any income figures for Korea or revenues or some additional detail that you don\u2019t disclose in the press release? John Gerspach : I\u2019m not going to go into specifics. We don\u2019t do specific country results. I will tell you this, our view is that -- again, revenues should be now growing sequentially in Korea. Excluding the repositioning charge, for the first time in several quarters, Korea actually turned a pre-tax profit. So again we're encouraged as to the future direction of our consumer franchise in Korea. Mike Mayo - CLSA: As it relates to expenses, a few people have asked about this, but when I go back to the March 2013 presentation that gave efficiency targets, it said the high end of efficiency assumes flat revenues and revenues for the first half of this year versus last year, down 3%. So once again, why are you still comfortable with your efficiency targets for 2015 when revenues have been so much worse, and you highlighted slide 10 and slide 13, your efficiency targets for global consumer and ICG, just can you confirm that is for the entire year 2015? You still expect to get not only those two targets but for Citi Corp as a whole? John Gerspach : Yes, I confirm that. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And if I to give -- a very short answer, you've given a lot of things that you\u2019re doing, why can\u2019t you still reach those efficiency targets even though revenues have been so much worse? Mike Corbat : Mike, its Mike. I think, as John is going to walk through things, we\u2019ve been taking a multi-pronged approach to the things. So the combination of headcount, support size, tech data information, we've been going across the board at different levers that we can pull to try and keep the expenses in line. And again I think as we think about the second half of the year, certainly on a sequential basis we are feeling better. I think if you look at the underlying drivers and fundamentals of the business, deposits, loans, what\u2019s going on in TTS, what\u2019s going on in the investment banking side of things, despite market challenges, parts of the firm are performing well and we think in the second year there are some continued revenue uplift there, and so again the combination of both levers around the efficiency ratio, the combination of revenue lift with expense discipline gets us to where we need to be. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And I guess the one wallet card is still legal and I know this settlement was lot more than I expected, or was more than almost any shareholder that I spoke with expected. And so if you can just give any additional color. I mean I just read one article saying that Department of Justice didn\u2019t want to hear about your small market share in some of the mortgage areas whereas that seems to be a relevant consideration. So why did you go ahead and settle for what is a huge amount in the minds of many shareholders as opposed to pushing this one? And what does this mean for your remaining legal issues? And what are your remaining legal issues and what do you think about it? Mike Corbat : I think when you look at our settlement, Mike; there are two components to it. One is the RMBS which has been quantified and then if you\u2019ve got a go down the list of actually fine just on the list in terms of our size in participation. But I think the other side of that is what we did in terms of putting the CDO litigation behind us. And when you go back and you look at our participation and CDOs, you look at 2005, \u201906, \u201907, we were somewhere at or near the top of the lead tables year in and year out in CDOs, and so this was very important to get behind us and I think meaningful. And again as I think, we went through the negotiation, we felt to get this behind us that this was something that was in our shareholders\u2019 best interest to move on from. Mike Mayo - CLSA: And what remains, I assume, FX and LIBOR are the big ones, how should we think about that potential exposure or am I correct in assuming those are the two big remaining legal exposures. Mike Corbat : We don\u2019t comment, Mike, in terms of forward-looking legal. Mike Mayo - CLSA: Okay. And last question. If interest rates increase by a 100 basis points, what\u2019s the benefit to Citigroup today versus say a quarter ago? Mike Corbat : A quarter ago, I think we\u2019ve told you it\u2019s somewhere between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion for a parallel shift in the interest rate move, if interest rates move by a 100 basis points. That\u2019s about a 100 hires (ph) in out somewhere between $1.9 billion and $2 billion. Operator : Your next question will come from the Moshe Orenbuch with Credit Suisse. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Great, thanks. I guess I was sort of wondering when you had spoken at a conference towards the end of May, you had mentioned that you though the entire market\u2019s revenue would be down kind of 20% to 25% and the FICC performance substantially better, and you kind of addressed a little bit around that but, I mean is it as simple as that June was better than the previous months, can you talk a little bit about that maybe put in the context of that current activity for the last couple of weeks and into the third quarter? Mike Corbat : Yeah, I\u2019d say that June was certainly a much better month overall from what we had -- the way we had viewed the market performance when we spoke at the conference at the end of May. And there is several events transpired at the end of May, beginning of June that had a common influence on the markets, specifically as it relates to spread products. So everything from the Crimea referendum, everything just sort of seem to calm down. And it was just a better overall environment, as I said, mostly for spread products in the month of June. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Now that\u2019s just kind of continue to show through in July so far. Mike Corbat : Again, it\u2019s been just a couple of days in July, let\u2019s not get too carried away. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Okay. Another question kind of unrelated and that is given the strength of your capital and the high level of capital generation, are there ways that you can actually kind of use that capital position before you have an opportunity to return capital next year? I mean are there activities that you had reduced or stopped doing that you would consider doing again? I mean are there any ways to think about that for the back half of this year just given I mean even the sin buckets, so there are ways to kind of use those just given the strength of that capital position? Mike Corbat : I think Moshe, if you\u2019d go back; I think there is a couple of different ways we potentially think about using it. One is we\u2019re not going to do stupid things with it around putting risk on it doesn\u2019t make sense or doesn\u2019t fit to business model. But I think if you go back, you look at best pie and I think going forward then probably beat the opportunity to take a look at some more portfolios that might come available. And so again we\u2019d take a hard look at those and if they are accretive to the business, we\u2019d be prepared to act on those.  Clearly we continue in our investor grow markets to grow and whether that\u2019s footprint, clients, balance sheet and so we are putting our capital to work in those areas and I\u2019d say those are probably the two primary things that we\u2019ve looked at in terms of capital use. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Just a follow up on that, Mike. The private label card is an area where there have been a couple of portfolios that are up for sell, any other areas that you would just specifically highlight where you\u2019ve seen kind of opportunities to put capital to work? Mike Corbat : I think that the private label card, I think there is potentially some things coming forward in the cards business. John talked a little a bit about. We\u2019ve been pleasantly surprised in terms of the uptake on the American Airlines\u2019 portfolio opportunities to continue to grow organically. But I would say away from those things, Moshe, we are largely focused on what we can do organically around our business model. Moshe Orenbuch - Credit Suisse : Thanks. Mike Corbat : And again you\u2019ve seen both in consumer and both in ICG pretty good loan growth. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Market. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : Following up on the comments about the good loan growth in ICG group, you guys had very strong corporate lending revenue growth in the quarter can you give us some color where the corporate loan growth is coming from? Mike Corbat : Now again it\u2019s pretty widespread, trade products have continued to perform well. We actually saw a slight rise in loan spreads in trade loans this quarter. And we had good uptick from a corporate lending point of view in both Europe and North America. And some of that was related to activity in the capital markets area and M&A, but again it\u2019s been pretty good. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : The results for the second quarter, in the years past the large banks second quarter results often reflected the Shared National Credit exam, can you give some color to the results reflect -- your results this quarter reflect any changes that the regulators may have had due to the SNC exam and maybe where does that stand right now the SNC exam? Mike Corbat : Yes, I am not aware that we had to make any significant changes as a result of the Shared National Credit exam. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : Another question sticking with the ICG group, can you guys estimate how much of the fall off in the trading revenues are cyclical versus secular? I know it\u2019s a difficult question, but the volatility is certainly down in this business; hopefully it will come back to drive revenues higher, but can you give us an estimate what you\u2019re thinking might be and then as part of that, are you at a size if it is a secular decline, are you comfortable with the size of your expense base if a part of it is a secular decline? Mike Corbat : Yes, as you\u2019ve said, Gerard, it\u2019s really hard to come up with an actual number as to what is cyclical versus secular. We continue to evaluate how we view the various offering that we have in those markets businesses and we constantly adjust our capacity to where we think the new secular trend is, so again it\u2019s somewhat product by product as opposed to just say, its markets in general and again its things move based upon market conditions. You take a look at our FICC revenues for this quarter. FICC revenues were down 12% now that was primarily driven by rates in currencies. And rates in currencies are going to respond to what\u2019s going on in the market. But even in the rates in currencies, rates in currencies were down something close to 30% for the quarter. But you\u2019re looking -- you\u2019re comparing rates in currencies this second quarter compared to the second quarter of \u201913 and second quarter of \u201913 was relatively strong quarter for rates in currencies. And in fact our results in the second quarter benefited from some outside gains that we took as we correctly lowered our inventories in our local markets business in anticipation of increased negative sentiment in the EM associated with the tapering. So the absence of those prior year gains associated with the de-risking contributed probably a full 6 percentage point to the year-over-year decline in risk in currencies revenues, and so risk in currencies down 23% year-over-year that\u2019s kind of in line with what would I think expect from a seasonal point of view and in the currency environment. So hard to find that there is something dramatically secular going on there. When you look at spread products on the other hand, spread products were up just about 30% year-over-year and basically the entire year-on-year increase occurred in the month of June following the improvement in markets sentiment that I referenced earlier. So you\u2019re still seeing a lot of cyclical that\u2019s running through the year the various businesses at this point. Mike Corbat : And I think the second part of your question, if you go to Slide 13, ICG is not standing and watching that if you go back and look at Slide 13, you see the nine consecutive quarters, you see from a core operating expense that the business is taking out about $1.1 billion of operating expense. So again continuing to stay focused on the model when the cyclical versus secular and trying to make sure we\u2019re adjusting to those two pieces. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : Shifting gears moving onto Citi holdings, you\u2019ve gave us some good color about the pending sales that you have in the pipeline and I think you\u2019ve said almost $1 billion of that number come from mortgage loans, what are you seeing in pricing for the distressed assets in the mortgage area, I am assuming it\u2019s improved but by how much? Mike Corbat : It\u2019s improved. I can\u2019t give you an actual figure quarter-on-quarter. I just don\u2019t have it in my head, but it has improved. But again it\u2019s improved, but you have to take a look at those loans broken out by a bunch of different categories and also by the location of the loan, by specific MSA code. So it isn\u2019t as though the entire market is re-priced up by 500 basis points or something like that. It really is product dependent and market dependent. And as you know, we have been very active sellers of these mortgages in the past. So it\u2019s not that we haven\u2019t already gone through this book and done a lot of sales activity. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : This is in due putting this mortgage problem behind you with the settlement today, is there ever a reason to do a very large bulk sale in Citi Holdings? And to put it behind you, is that ever feasible? Mike Corbat : I think it\u2019s all dependent upon price. If the price was right, we\u2019d be happy to do it. I think based on current market prices and you can see the improvements on the NCLs and you can kind of do your own market check and look at what the market would pay for these assets versus the funding collect out value and today I\u2019d say it\u2019s not there, but if they were to present itself, we\u2019d be happy to react to it. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : Would you say it\u2019s extremely wide from what you, in terms of market prices versus what you\u2019re comfortable with or are we within, is it something that within the realm of possibility? Mike Corbat : No I think, again I think as John said, you can\u2019t just take the entire portfolio and lump it because it goes through first through seconds through the deal with CFNA mortgages and all are very different and all have very different pricing characteristics to it. So it\u2019s probably most likely amongst the prime first, you\u2019d get close first and as you move down that spectrum that bid to offer spread so to speak would probably widen out. But again, as we look there what we want to sell, it\u2019s not just the headline asset reduction, but more importantly it\u2019s the removal of risk, it\u2019s the removal of cost of servicing and in particular special servicing against these and obviously capital release. So we look at it against what we see the risk-adjusted earnings power of the asset is and if it\u2019s close, we\u2019re happy to move on I would say for a lot of the portfolio today we don\u2019t see that, but not to say it won\u2019t happen some point in the future. Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Market : Great. And then just last question, I may have missed this, I apologize. You guys have moved very swiftly in reducing your branch count here in, globally, but in North America as well. Is there much left to do in North America in terms of reducing the number of branches in the consumer business? Mike Corbat : I think you will see continued centralization of our branches around the key metropolitan areas. And again in accordance with our stated strategy where we want to really focus on the large cities. So I still think that there is some level of branch rationalization yet to go. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer & Co. Chris Kotowski - Oppenheimer & Co.: Yes, good morning. Earlier in the quarter there were a number of press reports about attempts to sell one main financial and I\u2019m just thinking, does it make sense for Citi to sell a profit-making company for cash, but it can\u2019t return to shareholders? Or is there a way to spin it out to shareholders or what if that got caught up in the whole CCAR process or would it count as a disposition if you did it that way? Mike Corbat : Well I think, again kind of going back we in my words crossed the bridge back in 2009 when we placed one main into holdings or at that point Citi Financial into holdings. And while it\u2019s a terrific business, the subprime unsecured lending business is not a business that's core to who we are or our client base for our future. So again what we\u2019ve said is, we want to in essence maximize the exit value for our shareholders and we\u2019ve been running that in accordance with that. And I think as we\u2019ve shown in holdings dispositions we\u2019re wide open to different structures, spin sale, different approaches are on the table. And I think as we get closer to kind of looking at that exit, we\u2019ll certainly way all of those. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with SunTrust Robinson Humphrey. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : Maybe if we could just step back for a few minutes and talk about the list of strategic priorities, Mike you\u2019ve articulated since you moved into CEO role there was of course the operating expense reduction, the DTA utilization, the resumption of revenue growth across different regions. The reallocation of resources among different global geographies that maybe were under scale and maybe an unspoken one was some of the resizing that occurred in-site, ICG. So I wonder now, where would you say you are like which ending are you in with respect to those various priorities? Mike Corbat : Well, I think if you go back and you touched on some, so I think you\u2019ve seen from the efficiency ratio perspective in your operating expenses I think you\u2019ve seen pretty consistent progress against moving towards the target that we set out for the company. I think that when you look at things such as DTA, at the point we really stated the priority of DTA utilization, DTA was still going the wrong way, we\u2019re still increasing. And I think since that point in time we\u2019ve showed the consistent ability to use it. I think the PC didn\u2019t mention in there was we said John and I had put out it by the end of 2015, we wanted to get holdings to breakeven. And I think this quarter got us there a little bit early and it\u2019s our job to work to try and obviously sustain that. And I think candidly the most challenging part of it has really been the revenue side of things, it\u2019s been the environment. I think a combination of the economic, the regulatory and the political nature of things around the world has probably made things more challenging than we certainly would have liked. We\u2019ve tried to continue to adjust the business model to that. So I think that we\u2019ve made progress on everything that we\u2019ve set out to do, we\u2019ve got more work to do, we\u2019re not going to rest until we get there. But I feel quite good and quite proud of what we\u2019ve managed to accomplish in the last 1.5 years or so. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And you touched on the benefits to reductions from the sale of Greece and Spain. Were there any geographies that sort of moved into the review bucket in the past quarter or two quarters that maybe the market is nowhere? Mike Corbat : No I think, again we showed the optimized list as part of the 2013 exercise, John spoke earlier to the progress against that bucket that in fact we\u2019ve made about 330 basis points of efficiency gains in 2013 and we\u2019ve continued to get those gains in 2014. And what we\u2019ve said I think remains consistent today that we need to have a pathway or a line of vision or a line of sight to those businesses or geographies making sense over the intermediate or longer time frame. And so if we discover businesses or believe their businesses that can\u2019t get there, they\u2019ll absolutely come under strategic review. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : And just last question from me on slide 24, the last 12 months return analysis. The 10% that\u2019s listed there and then there is a call-out box, so including the DTA it would be 13%. You changed a little bit from the prior quarter. So I am just curious, would that number have increased the number excluding the DTA? Would that increase sequentially this period? Mike Corbat : No actually on a trailing 12 months basis, because we\u2019ve generated more capital our denominator has increased and therefore has lowered the return. Eric Wasserstrom - SunTrust Robinson Humphrey : So that actually got to the cracks of my question, that the compounding of capital is occurring at a rate faster than what\u2019s occurring in the new areas, effectively correct? Mike Corbat : That\u2019s exactly what\u2019s going on. As I said in the opening in the first half of the year we generated about $10 billion of capital. Operator : The next question will come from the line of Erica Najarian with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Erica Najarian - Bank of America Merrill Lynch :  My questions have all been asked and answered. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW:  I just had a few quick questions here. You said that the revenues in Citi Holdings benefited from the asset sales done there. Can you give us what the dollar impact was from the benefit and it was all to NII? Mike Corbat : If the dollar amount of the asset sales is somewhat similar to the dollar amount that we have disclosed last quarter as far as the benefit of asset sales, which was somewhere in the vicinity of $200 million or so. So it\u2019s roughly flattish to the first quarter. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW:  And then off Citi Holdings and the period of loans went down 8 billion, other assets went down about 300 million but the total assets went down 3 billion. What\u2019s the driver of the delta there? Is it organic growth? Mike Corbat : You\u2019re focused on Holdings, right? I just want to make sure. Yes as we sign to sell the businesses in Spain and Greece, they come out of the loan book and they go into assets held for sale. So they move down into other asset category. That\u2019s the way that once you\u2019ve got an asset held for sale, you one line the assets and one line the liabilities of those businesses, and so therefore they come out of loans or whatever other balance sheet line they are in and they all go down to other assets and other liabilities. That\u2019s all. Brian Kleinhanzl - KBW:  And then within the efficiency ratio that you looked out in the global consumer banking, excluding Korea and mortgage banking would be meaningfully lower. But even if you back out the expenses related to Korea this quarter, still mortgage banking is being a drag on the efficiency ratio. Do you still think that market share gains is enough to improve the efficiency ratio there or do you actually do more repositioning in North America mortgage? Mike Corbat : Well we\u2019ve actually have been taking -- the expenses have been coming out of North America mortgages. Now they come out of mortgages on somewhat of a lag basis because you tend to recognize your revenues, especially when you\u2019re doing originate to sell you tend to recognize the revenues when you lock in the rate, when you do a rate lock. And then you still have another quarter where you\u2019ve got to do all the processing in order to really make the sale. But, in general, the expenses have been coming down in North America. We think we have got the, with the expense reductions that we should expect to see in the third quarter, I think that the business is properly sized both from certainly from an expense point of view compared to the level of originations that we would expect to get out of that business. Operator :  Your next question will come from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin - Jefferies :  John, first on follow-up on Holdings, so the adjusted operating margins gotten up to 700 with the help from that 200 million of gains, is it fair to say that we are now kind of in this new higher range for that operating margin for Citi Holdings or is it still just dependent on whether or not you can get those gains every quarter as you continue to make incremental sales? John Gerspach :  I would say it\u2019s still dependent upon our ability to get those gains, so I would tend to look more of the 100 as the level that we would expect in that business, somewhere between 400 and 500. And if we get a reasonable amount of asset sales then you would get up to the 700 level. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay and then secondly on credit quality. This quarter is interesting that the reserve released in consumer and specifically North America card was bigger than it\u2019s been for a while and then conversely the mortgage released in Holdings was actually smaller. So, can you help us dimension, how should we just think about aggregate release going forward and what you anticipate would be the bigger drivers from here? John Gerspach :  Clearly the reserve release that we had in cards, as I tried to indicate in some of the remarks that I made, that was really in response to the fact that the credit performance in cards just got a lot better than what we have been anticipating at the end of the first quarter. At the end of the first quarter, we were talking about overall North America NCL rates sort of leveling off at 3% for the year and we just continue to see much more favorable delinquency experience as well as NCL experience in both branded cards and retail services. And we expect that level of NCL and delinquency to continue, so that\u2019s what really drove the reserve release in the second quarter. I don\u2019t expect that the reserve releases in those two cards businesses to stay at the level that we have had in either the first or the second quarter as we move into the second half of the year. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: And then on the mortgage side is it just more dependent on sales from here then it is on credit performance? John Gerspach :  No, if you take a look at just at mortgages, I believe that if you look at the reserve release as a percentage of the NCL that we have took in mortgages, it\u2019s roughly equivalent to where we have been. I think that the reserve release was equal to about 86% of the net credit losses that we had in the Holdings\u2019 mortgage book and we have been running somewhere between 85% and 90% in any of the last several quarters. So, that reserve release is likely going to again somewhere in that 85% to 90% range of the NCLs that we ultimately charge off in mortgages. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay and then quick question on the asset yield. So, you mentioned that the NIM should be pretty stable from here, deposit cost look sort of flattened. So, can you talk to us about incremental loan yields and incremental securities purchases and then ability to continue to just grow overall balance sheet in terms of NII dollars? John Gerspach :  Our expectation is that loans will continue to grow. I mean we still have loan growth in, again focused on the Citicorp business. Citicorp loans grew 8% year-over-year and we anticipate again still getting good healthy loan growth in our Citicorp businesses. Those loan growth, even if spreads comedown a little bit on loans that still gives you a nice healthy contribution to your near and your NIM. I think you are right as far as deposit cost, I think that\u2019s probably going to be somewhat flattish from here on out may be a slight uptick but not much. But we still have the ability to lower our overall cost of funds as we continue to issue, rollover the long-term debt at more favorable spreads then what we were issuing several years ago. Ken Usdin - Jefferies: Okay and then last question on that last point, John. As far as the long-term debt and then also more importantly the continued preferred issuance and I think you guys are still around 70 basis points of B3 RWAs. Can you give us an understanding of just how much of that long-term debt is for roll and then also your general issuance plans on how much of that preferred bucket you want to continue to get on? John Gerspach :  As far as long-term debt, I think we are pretty much at the level certainly of the long-term debt held at the holding company we are pretty much at the level that we think we need to be on a full year basis. And so there will continue to be issuance. We will give you an update on those issuance plans when we do our fixed income conference towards the end of this week but I think it\u2019s pretty much in line with the guidance that we gave out at the end of the first quarter. And we will continue to be an issuer of preferred stock; we recognize that we\u2019ve got some preferred stock issuance to do over the next three to five years, so we will be issuing preferred stock but in a somewhat paced approach.  Operator Your next question will come from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Security. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security : Good morning, thanks for taking my questions, just a follow up on John, your pretty positive commentary about underwriting strength and M&A strength and I guess I\u2019m trying to get a little more color on was that just in the US or are you gaining, you feel you\u2019re gaining share across the different geographies, Asia, Europe and the US in both those businesses. John Gerspach : I\u2019d say it\u2019s fairly widespread, obviously it\u2019s going to be a little bit heavier in some geographies than other and I don\u2019t want to get into you know a geography-by-geography commentary. But again it\u2019s a wide spread you know improvement in the second quarter certainly in the wallet share and again as we look to, as the wallet share that we\u2019re capturing in the announced M&A again that\u2019s fairly broad based. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security : Okay and then just returning to slide 24, I appreciate the breakout of the average allocated TCE which I presume is going to be updated annually, I guess I\u2019m curious as to the 42 billion of TCE allocated to corp and other, is that going to stay at a roughly similar amount to the total Citigroup capital or could that be moved down into some of the operating units over time. John Gerspach : Well when we set up the amount equal to corp other there we laid out the rationale for how we got there, it\u2019s a little bit of the operations that we have in corp other, importantly it\u2019s where we hold the capital associated with the DTA, it\u2019s where we hold some of the operator\u2019s capital that we can\u2019t quite allocate to other businesses and importantly as we continue to generate capital, you know, far in excess of our ability to distribute capital, that amount will grow over time, so we\u2019ll do an annual you know re-appropriation based upon what the level of capital that we think is appropriate for each business, but as long as we continue to be net generators of TCE you\u2019re going to see more of that in the corp other number. Matt Burnell - Wells Fargo Security : And then just finally from me, you mentioned that the impact of a 100 basis point higher rate is slightly more at the end of June then it was at the end of March, I noticed that your securities, your investment portfolio is up about 8% year-over-year or 4% quarter-over-quarter. Can you update on what the estimated reduction in your tangible common equity would be from a 100 basis point higher rate environment. Mike Corbat : You know again, we\u2019ll put this all out next, probably when we do the fixed income conference, but my recollection is that it goes to about $3.4 billion.  Operator Your next question will come from the line of Derek De Vries with UBS. Derek De Vries - UBS : Thanks, I have a couple of questions on Latin America, I guess starting with last week the Mexican Anti Trust Authority published recommendations on reform, I was hoping you could give us some of those key recommendations and maybe talk a little bit about the impact they could have on dynamics. Mike Corbat : I have to tell you we don\u2019t view what was published last week as having any significant near term impact on dynamics, I say that the industry\u2019s still sorting through what was published and it\u2019s still in the early stages of analysis. Derek De Vries - UBS : Maybe a little more concrete, the provisions in Latin America ticked up, and I take on board your comments about portfolio growth and seasoning, but if there\u2019s nothing sort of one off in nature there, is this a level we should sort of expect going forward from Latin America or is there some one-off things in there. Mike Corbat : It\u2019s not necessarily one-off, but again most of the performance and the credit performance in Latin America consumer really is being driven by Mexico cards, and the consumer in Mexico is still absorbing a little bit of the fiscal reform actions that they have gone through and clearly as the Mexico economy continues to struggle to really regain the momentum that everyone thought that it would have, consumer spending has not been robust, so we would anticipate, it\u2019s what he said that the NCO rate will remain relatively high through the end of this year, that\u2019s why we said that Latin America NCO rate will probably stay at around the first half levels but you know, we do believe that once that gets behind us there should be improvement in those NCO rates, as we go into next year, so still feel very good about the overall the underlying credit quality in our Mexico cards portfolio. Derek De Vries - UBS : And then I guess one last question just touching on it, I think you\u2019ve had talked about a lot today. The last quarter you said that when you made your 2015 targets you build in about 200 basis points in your efficiency ratio for litigation, so obviously going off a lot from this year, I am just wondering with three months further along, do you still feel comfortable, you\u2019ll get enough of litigation stuff behind you this year at the 200 basis points for litigations. So a good gap as to where you\u2019ll come out next year? John Gerspach : Just to be clear, I believe that what I said was that the 200 basis points would cover to both, repositioning as well as legal and related costs. So we\u2019ll have to see as we get closer to the yearend we\u2019ll take a look, but again, we still believe based upon what we look at today that we should be able to achieve the efficiency targets that we set out for 2015. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Andrew Marquardt with Evercore. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore: Just back on the balance sheet dynamics in a potentially changing rate environment at some point ended deposit velocity question that Guy was getting to earlier. Can you just help us understand if you do have certain level that you baked into your modeling, how do you think about the outcome in terms of may be that -- I mean over half deposits or in fact from ICG group and third is our -- in North America, so it\u2019s still a relatively good contribution total deposits. How you do think about maybe isolating that component that could be at risk in terms of reversal, once raised eventually move higher? John Gerspach : Yes. Actually we don\u2019t view that component as being at risk because, certainly, I won\u2019t say there wasn\u2019t $1 of deposit but it is at risk but the overall deposit level, we don\u2019t view as being at risk, especially on a TTS businesses, the trend, the treasury and trade, the solutions of deposits, because they really represent for the most part operating account balances. And so those are the funds that businesses need to have in order just to conduct their ongoing operations. So again, we feel relatively good about it, now if the FED tapering or if the FED comes in and does something to try to drain liquidity out of the system that could impact future deposit growth, but it\u2019s not likely to impact the absolute level of deposit that we currently have in those businesses. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore: And do you have any updated LCR reach it at this point or is that something we should refer not a fixed income call question maybe? John Gerspach : That calculation is still ongoing and we\u2019ll give that to you when we do the fixed income call. It still is a very strong ratio. I just don\u2019t have it in front of me right now. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore: The last quarter was about 120-ish, if I recall correctly? John Gerspach : Yes. It\u2019s going to be just around that maybe even slightly higher, when we publish at this week. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore: Got it. And then just lastly, I know there\u2019s been a lot of questions of interest ratios and goals, but can you just help us understand maybe just to come it down like, if in fact the revenue environment remains to have it and tougher for longer, if the revenue environment is stagnant here, there certainly sounds like there\u2019s room on TCB to move nearly on ICG as well. And efficiency ratio really been met, if the revenue environment today seems as it is for another six quarter or so, is that possible is there enough room on what you have already or would it drive -- you generally think maybe point another something like to draw, that we consider other things? John Gerspach : Let\u2019s think about the revenue environment that you refer to, all right. We have ongoing revenue growth and has had ongoing revenue growth in Latin America even as Mexico has slowed down. So the revenue environment for Latin America still seems to be in growth mode and we feel very good about the way our franchises position there. When you take a look at Asia, we now have got the Korea repositioning behind us. And we have had underlying growth in each of our franchises in Asia over the last several quarter, but that has been offset in many ways by the reduction in revenues in Korea so we actually are quite constructive as far as the revenue environment today in Asia, Asia consumer has producing growth both sequentially and year-over-year in the second half of the year. So we feel really good about the performance of our Asia consumer franchise going forward. In North America, we\u2019ve got the mortgage repositioning out of the way, so our mortgage revenues stabilized in the first quarter they actually grew in the second quarter, we\u2019ve got that business now positioned properly we think for the way the market should move forward. And again we\u2019re not looking to constantly gain, we don\u2019t look to be number one or number two in that business we just want to be able to serve our customers through our retail branches within appropriate mix of correspondence business. So again we\u2019re very constructive on what we\u2019ve been able to do with the mortgage business. Branded cards I mentioned we\u2019ve got purchase sales growth, we\u2019ve got good underlying momentum in the full rate loans in that business and importantly in the products where we have actually been investing. When you take a look at branded cards, branded cards I think the year-over-year sales growth purchase sales growth was about 5% but if you look at the portfolios where we\u2019ve actually been investing the sales growth there year-over-year is upwards of 8%. So again we feel really good about the momentum and the revenue prospects for branded card. So in our consumer franchises from a revenue momentum point of view we feel good about the revenue momentum. And then when you move over to the ICG, we look at the banking franchise and again with the past investments that we\u2019ve made in investment banking we\u2019re doing very well as far as being able to maintain or actually grow wallet share. We\u2019ve had several quarters in a row now of 1 billion or a $1 billion plus revenue quarters. So again we feel good about the revenue momentum in that business. We feel very good about the revenue momentum that we\u2019ve got in transaction services in TTS. 10 quarter, eight quarters in a row, we struggled with spread compression overwhelming the volume growth because of the contribution of volume growth. Now that we see the impact of the spread compression beginning to abate the impact of the volume growth now actually is able to overcome the spread compression. And so we feel really good about the revenue prospects for that business going forward. So then that leaves you with markets. And I think we spend an awful lot of time focused on what\u2019s going on in markets but markets while it\u2019s an important part of our business it is not the largest contributor to our overall revenue picture or our overall profitability. And so I think that there are some legitimate questions going forward as far as markets but the rest of the business I\u2019d say we feel pretty good about the revenue prospects. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore: That\u2019s helpful, thanks for that summary. And then in terms of in markets and maybe it\u2019s summarized in the ICG when you referenced your I think comp ratio this last quarter was 29% in line with last year. Should we expected that should remain or could it tick higher just because as one referenced earlier as well still trying to figure out how much is cyclical versus secular? Mike Corbat : The 29% that I referenced is actually the comp ratio over a trailing 12 month basis. So that\u2019s 29% both for full year 2013 and 29% for the last 12 months as measured as of the end of this quarter. Andrew Marquardt - Evercore: And should we expect that for the full year or is that? Mike Corbat : I am not going to forecast where comp ratio is going to be but you can see that we\u2019ve been holding in fairly constant. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Steven Chubak - Nomura: So one of your competitors provided some helpful disclosure on the advanced approach framework under CCAR specifically which reflected an additional 100 basis point decline in the Firm\u2019s Tier 1 common under stress due to the stressed RWA inflation under the Basel III advanced framework. And since the advanced framework appears to be your binding capital constraint at the moment, I was wondering whether you\u2019ve conducted a similar assessment internally and if so if you could provide some guidance as to how the advanced approach framework could further impact future risk based capital ratios under CCAR? Mike Corbat : I got to tell you, I have not spent any time looking at what our peer institution put out there, so I apologize. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Have you done the work yourselves though? Mike Corbat : I am not sure what they did, so I don\u2019t know what they did so I can\u2019t comment as to whether or not we did something similar. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay, fair enough. And then switching gears and as a follow up to Betsy\u2019s question on operational risk capital your comments indicated that 56 billion true-up proposed by the Fed or imposed by the Fed late last year, contemplate some buffer for litigation matters not yet resolved. And I was just wondering what the process is for the Fed providing guidance on op risk capital level so is the feedback given quarterly or is it nearly evaluated as part of the advanced model submissions which from what I recall is actually an annual process? Mike Corbat : Yes, it\u2019s something that is under discussion periodically. But obviously goes through a much fuller exam on an annual basis. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Okay. And then just one more from me on capital allocations, as part of your enhanced segment disclosure on slide 24 the amount of capital allocated exclusive of DTA to support the operations in Corp and Holdings and focusing I guess or excluding the corporate other segment was a combined 126 billion or so which implies on current RWA levels about a 10% Tier 1 common target. And I was wondering if we should think about that 10% Tier 1 common ratio as an appropriate through the cycle target for Citigroup at this juncture or is it simply still too early to make such a determination? Mike Corbat : Again when you take a look at the underlying franchises in Citi right now. We clearly think that the Citicorp businesses are capable of producing mid-teens ROTCE, and again that\u2019s going to be -- so the overall firm\u2019s contribution to ROTCE is going to be dependent upon our ability to return capital at some point in time. Steven Chubak - Nomura: Actually there is one more quick question regarding the DTA disclosure. Can you update us on the level of U.S. foreign tax credits that are subject to expiry by 2018? I know it was about 9.9 billion at the end of the year, but obviously you\u2019ve made some progress over the last two quarters. John Gerspach : Yes, we update those disclosures on an annual basis. There is just too much movement during individual quarters that actually come up with something that is relevant. So we will update you at the end of this year as to the progress that we have been making. Operator : You have no further questions at this time. Susan Kendall : Thank you Regina and thank you all for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to the investor relations team. Thanks. Operator :  Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

[Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW Operator : Hello, and welcome to Citi\u2019s Q3 2014 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer Mike Corbat and Chief Financial Officer John Gerspach. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. (Operator instructions.) Also this call is being recorded today. If you have any objections please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brett. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO Mike Corbat will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, www.citigroup.com. Afterwards we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the \u201cRisk Factors\u201d section of our 2013 Form 10(k).  With that said let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for Q3 2014. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA net income was $3.7 billion or $1.15 per share. Before I address the quarter I\u2019d like to discuss the actions we announced regarding Global Consumer Banking. As you know, we\u2019re committed to simplifying our company and allocating our finite resources to the business where we can generate the best returns for our shareholders. Consistent with these priorities we intend to exit our consumer businesses in eleven markets \u2013 among them Japan, Egypt and Peru. We\u2019ll continue to serve our institutional clients in these markets which remain important to our global network. While these consumer franchise have real value we didn\u2019t see a path for meaningful return. We believe our Consumer business will achieve stronger performance by focusing on the countries where our scale and network provide a competitive advantage. Sales processes are already underway in most of these markets and I expect these actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. At that point we\u2019ll have reduced our Consumer footprint by 19 markets since 2012 and Global Consumer Banking will be serving 57 million clients across 24 markets. I\u2019d also like to address the announcement we issued earlier this morning regarding a legacy Banamex unit which provided personal security and protective services. While the fraud is not financially material, in light of the conduct we found in the interest of transparency we thought it was best to inform you. As you know we\u2019ve been reviewing our franchise in Mexico and have already made meaningful changes to strengthen our processes and controls, and will continue to take whatever steps are necessary to make sure that every part of our global franchise lives up to the standards all of us rightfully expect. Now turning to the quarter : we achieved solid performance across our Institutional businesses. Both Banking and Markets saw improved revenue from prior-year period assisted by a better trading environment and a strong M&A pipeline. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues increased slightly despite spread compression.  Global Consumer Banking had a strong quarter as well and saw loan growth throughout the regions. In North America we had revenue improvement in each of our businesses both quarter-on-quarter and year-on-year while we continued to optimize our branch network. Internationally we saw revenue improvements across every region compared to Q3 last year. Overall these results show solid business performance which has helped increase Citigroup net income by 5% year-to-date over 2013. We also continue to be focused on reducing the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and consuming DTA. These have been execution priorities and we again made progress on both fronts. In Citi Holdings we closed the sales of our Consumer businesses in Greece and Spain which helped reduce assets during the quarter by 7% to $103 billion. Holdings assets now constitute only 5% of Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. The Holdings profit of $272 million again helped drive DTA consumption. We utilized $700 million of DTA in the quarter, bringing the total to over $5 billion for the last seven quarters. This contributed to our generating nearly $4 billion of regulatory capital this quarter and growing our Tier One common ratio to 10.7%. Our tangible booked value also increased to $57.73. While we\u2019re pleased with our ability to generate capital we\u2019re equally focused on our ability to return it to our shareholders. During the quarter we continued to make progress on our efforts to strengthen our capital planning process.  Most important our capital planning process is being fully embedded in the way we run the firm. This must impact everything, from increased business engagement and enhancements to our forecasting models and scenario design processes \u2013 all of which lead to an improved approach to risk and controls. This work will continue as we get closer to receiving the 2015 stress test scenario from The Fed at which point we\u2019ll prepare a strong submission which reflects the work that has been done. As we finish out 2014 we\u2019re very mindful of the challenging macro environment. Geopolitical tensions, uneven growth and concerns over the timing of interest rate increases have increased volatility. While the economy in the US seems to be slowly gaining strength, the Eurozone is not yet in growth mode and emerging market growth has slowed.  While our expense reduction efforts have been productive we continue to face pressure related to legal costs and the need to invest in regulatory and compliance, as well as the critical need to protect our network from cybercrime. We\u2019ll remain vigilant along each of these fronts to ensure the safety and soundness of our institution. John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019d be happy to take your questions. Thank you. John? John Gerspach : Okay, thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Let me briefly review the results of the quarter and then I\u2019ll go into more detail on the strategic actions we announced earlier today. To start, I\u2019d like to highlight two items that affect the comparability of this quarter\u2019s results to prior periods. First, CVA/DVA was a negative $371 million pre-tax, or $228 million after-tax this quarter including a $474 million one-time charge due to the implementation of funding valuation adjustments related to certain derivatives. Together these charges had a negative impact on EPS of $0.08 per share this quarter, similar to the CVA/DVA charge last year.  And secondly, last year we recorded a tax benefit of $176 million or $0.06 per share related to the resolution of certain tax audit items. Adjusting for these items, we earned $1.15 per share in the recent quarter compared to $1.02 per share in Q3 last year. Throughout today\u2019s presentation I will be discussing our results excluding these items to provide comparability to prior periods. On Slide 4 we show total Citigroup results. We earned $3.7 billion in Q3, a 13% increase from last year. Pre-tax earnings of $5.9 billion grew 28% driven by revenue growth and lower credit costs, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. However, our tax rate was higher this quarter at 36%, reflecting a higher level of non-tax deductible legal accruals versus last year as well as higher tax costs related to the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain. On a year-to-date basis, we generated positive operating leverage with modest revenue growth and flat expenses, and our return on assets improved to 83 basis points. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew slightly year-over-year, to $654 billion, as 4% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued decline in Citi Holdings. And deposits were flat at $943 billion. On Slide 5 we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related and repositioning costs totaled over $1.3 billion in Q3, mostly incurred in Citicorp. We also incurred $59 million of operating expenses related to the sales of our Consumer operations in Greece and Spain this quarter. Excluding these items core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion in Q3 increased by roughly $100 million versus prior periods, primarily reflecting an adjustment to incentive compensation expense driven by better-than-anticipated performance year-to-date in our Institutional franchise. Higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to CECCAR and the impact of business growth were more than offset by continued cost reduction initiatives as well as the decline in Citi Holdings assets.  We expect to incur an incremental $150 million to $175 million of costs in full-year 2014 as we work to enhance our capital planning process. We estimate that about one-third of that amount will be non-recurring. In 2014, the incremental CECCAR-related costs will be more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. In Q3 we spent an incremental $60 million related to the CECCAR process and we expect this amount to increase further in Q4. On Slide 6 we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp\u2019s pre-tax earnings grew 13% as higher revenues across the franchise and lower credit costs were partially offset by an increase in operating expenses. Citicorp expense growth was mostly driven by higher legal and repositioning costs, the adjustment to incentive compensation and ICG, and higher regulatory and compliance costs partially offset by efficiency savings.  In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter with over $270 million in net income compared to a loss of over $100 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $103 billion of assets or 5% of total Citigroup assets. Before I go into more detail on Citicorp I\u2019d like to cover the strategic actions Mike discussed earlier which will streamline and simplify our Consumer operations. We are exiting our Consumer operations in eleven markets plus our Consumer Finance business in Korea. As you can see on Slide 7 these actions include markets across Latin America, Asia and AMEA.  Substantially all of these operations were previously classified as \u201coptimized markets\u201d in our country bucketing framework, and while we have made steady progress in many of these businesses we ultimately determined that our scale did not provide for meaningful returns.  We already have active sales processes underway for over half of the businesses and we currently expect the strategic actions to be substantially completed by the end of 2015. We expect to report these Consumer operations as part of Citi Holdings as of Q1. We will continue to serve our Institutional clients in these countries which remain important to our global network. On Slide 8 we provide details on the financial impact of these actions, showing Citicorp on the left and Global Consumer Banking on the right. Over the last twelve months these businesses contributed over $1.6 billion of revenues and $34 million of net income. Total assets were $29 billion as of the end of Q3 including $7 billion of consumer loans; and total deposits were $26 billion. As shown on the far right, on a pro forma basis our Global Consumer Banking business would continue to capture more than 95% of our existing revenue base while further simplifying our operations and improving our performance. Now, turning back to Q3, on Slide 9 we show actual results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 22% year-over-year in Q3 driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs, partially offset by higher legal and repositioning charges. Revenues grew 5% year-over-year in Q3 driven by continued volume growth across the franchise with average loans up 5% and average deposits up 3%; a rebound in investment sales revenues in Asia; and a reduced impact from our repositioning efforts in Korea. Core operating expenses excluding legal and repositioning costs were roughly flat as ongoing efficiency savings offset the impact of business growth as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs. International credit costs declined 13% year-over-year driven by a net loan loss reserve release in the current quarter, while the net credit loss rate remained broadly favorable at just under 200 basis points. Slide 10 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 33% year-over-year this quarter driven by higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and continued favorable credit trends. Total revenues were up 5% year-over-year.  Retail Banking revenues of $1.2 billion grew 9% from last year, reflecting continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds as well as a mortgage repurchase reserve release of roughly $50 million this quarter. Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were up 1% versus last year as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans. And Retail Services revenues grew 8% from last year, mostly driven by the BestBuy portfolio acquisition. Ongoing cost reduction initiatives drove total operating expenses down slightly year-over-year to $2.4 billion even after absorbing the impact of the BestBuy portfolio acquisition and higher legal and repositioning expenses. We continued to resize our North America Retail Banking business in Q3, taking costs out of our mortgage operations and rationalizing the branch footprint, all while continuing to grow our franchise. Over the past twelve months we have sold or closed nearly 90 branches in North America. During this same period we grew average retail loans by 9% and average deposits by 2% including 10% growth in checking account balances. We also continued to see momentum in branded cards. While total average loans have continued to decline modestly this mostly reflects the runoff of promotional rate balances.  Full rate balances have grown year-over-year for six consecutive quarters and we continue to see strong growth in accounts and purchase sales in our proprietary Rewards and Travel co-brand products. We also launched our Double Cash card this quarter, which rounds out our product portfolio in the important cash-back segment. Slide 11 shows our Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail. Overall Global Consumer Credit trends remained favorable in Q3, with net credit losses and delinquencies both improving as a percentage of loans. In North America the NCL rate continued to improve while 90+ day delinquency rates were flat. Asia remained stable, and in Latin America we saw a modest uptick in the NCL rate while the delinquency rate improved slightly. Net credit losses grew broadly in line with our expectations in Q3 driven by portfolio growth and continued seasoning in the Mexico cards portfolio as well as the impact of both slower economic growth and fiscal reforms in that market. However, our overall loan growth was slower than anticipated which had a negative impact on the NCL rate for the quarter. This slower loan growth reflected the overall economic environment as well as a higher level of prepayments in our mortgage portfolio. Looking to Q4 we expect the dollar amount of net credit losses in Latin America to be more or less stable. Slide 12 shows the expense and efficiency trends for Global Consumer Banking on a trailing twelve-month basis. While annual expenses increased in late 2012 and early 2013, driven in part by higher North America mortgage activity, we have driven down the core expense base over the last five quarters even as we have absorbed the impact of higher expenses associated with the BestBuy portfolio acquisition. Including roughly $800 million of legal and repositioning charges over the last year, our total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer Banking was 56%. Slide 13 shows our total Consumer expenses over the past five quarters split between core operating expenses and legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses continued to decline on a sequential basis in Q3 as we made further progress towards our year-end goals for headcount reduction, card product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization.  Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 14, net income grew 29% year-over-year driven by higher revenues partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues of $8.7 billion grew 13% from last year and 2% sequentially. Total Banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 11% from last year and were down 3% from the prior quarter.  Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as growth in fees and volumes was partially offset by spread compression. Sequentially, revenues declined by 2% driven by lower trade assets and spreads. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 32% from last year driven by strong M&A and equity underwriting activity, and down 7% from the prior quarter as continued momentum in M&A was more than offset by seasonally lower underwriting volumes. Private Bank revenues of $663 million grew 8% from last year as growth in client volumes was partially offset by the impact of spread compression. Corporate Lending revenues were $442 million, up 17% from last year reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs partially offset by lower loan yields and down 3% from last quarter on lower gains from asset sales. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.3 billion grew 8% year-over-year and 5% sequentially.  Fixed Income revenues of $3 billion grew 5% from last year driven by strength in securitized products as well as an increase in foreign exchange volatility and volumes which benefited our Rates and Currencies business in the month of September. Sequentially, Fixed Income revenues were down slightly as a seasonal decline in spread product revenues was mostly offset by strength in rates and currencies. Equities revenues of $763 million grew 14% year-over-year driven by improved client activity in derivatives, and were up 16% sequentially on better trading performance. In Securities Services revenues grew 8% year-over-year driven by an increase in client balances and activity.  Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over prior periods, driven by the compensation adjustment, higher regulatory and compliance costs, and higher repositioning charges partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings. On Slide 15 we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. On a trailing twelve-month basis, the efficiency ratio declined to 59% this quarter despite continued elevated legal and repositioning charges. And our comp ratio for the last twelve months was 28%, down from 29% last quarter. Slide 16 shows the results for Corp. Other. Revenues declined year-over-year driven mainly by hedging activities while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CECCAR process. Assets of $332 billion included approximately $97 billion of cash and cash equivalents and $180 billion of liquid investment securities. Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings assets, which totaled $103 billion at quarter-end with over 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $8 billion during the quarter driven by net pay downs and divestitures including the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain.  On Slide 18 we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Total revenues of $1.6 billion were up year-over-year, primarily driven on gains on the sales of our Consumer operations in both Greece and Spain and lower funding costs, partially offset by losses on the redemption of debt used to fund Holdings assets. Citi Holdings expenses decreased significantly, driven by the lower level of assets as well as lower legal and related costs partially offset by $59 million of episodic expenses related to the sales of our Consumer operations in Greece and Spain. Net Credit losses continued to improve, down 45% year-over-year, driven by North America mortgages. And we offset all of the mortgage net Credit losses with loan loss reserve releases. The net loan loss reserve release of $144 million includes the impact of roughly $75million of losses on assets moved to held for sale this quarter. Excluding these losses, the reserve release would have been close to $220 million. On Slide 19 we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 291 basis points in Q3 reflecting lower cost of funds. Looking to Q4, given the sale of Consumer loans with attractive margins in Greece and Spain we could see our net interest margin decline by a basis point or two. On Slide 20 we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter our Basil-3 Tier One common ratio grew to 10.7%, driven by net earnings and continued DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio also improved to 6.0%, with about half of the sequential increase due to the impact of the revised final US Rules. And our tangible book value grew to $57.73 per share. In summary, our results in Q3 demonstrated momentum across the firm. In Consumer Banking we grew revenues, loans and deposits in every region resulting in positive operating leverage and strong income growth over last year. And in our Institutional franchise we saw broad revenue growth across Markets, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions, also resulting in positive operating leverage and significant growth in net income. In Citi Holdings we were profitable again this quarter while continuing to wind down the remaining assets in an economically rational manner. And we continued to grow our book and regulatory capital. Looking to Q4, in Consumer Banking we expect to continue growing our revenues while maintaining positive operating leverage year-over-year. In Markets our results will likely reflect the overall environment as well as normal seasonal trends. In Investment Banking, revenues should also reflect the overall market but we feel good about the quality and momentum of our franchise as demonstrated by our performance. And in Treasury and Trade Solutions we believe we can continue growing our revenues year-over-year in Q4 driven by continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds. Turning to expenses, in Citicorp our core operating expenses should be relatively flat to Q3 levels as we expect to continue to face ongoing higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced capital planning process. Repositioning expenses should be more or less in line with the roughly $400 million we incurred in Q3, and legal costs will likely remain elevated and episodic in nature. We continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to our Credit performance. And finally, we expect our tax rate for Q4 to be broadly in line with the first half of the year in the range of 32%. With that Mike and I would be happy to take any questions. Operator : (Operator instructions.) Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Hey, good morning guys. I appreciate the sort of disclosure on Mexico \u2013 obviously that\u2019s been a focus of investors. Obviously you\u2019ve probably done a very thorough review. Can you give us a sense of how you feel about just overall risks \u2013 people talk about AML issues or worries about that? As you\u2019ve gone through the process can you give us some comfort level there? And then I guess taking a step back, second question being as you reduce complexity by getting out of eleven more markets, potentially getting rid of One Main, how do you feel that helps you going into CECCAR next year? Thanks. Mike Corbat : Sure. Jim, I think from a Mexico perspective we said as part of OSA we were going to embark on a comprehensive review of our policies and processes. That review is significantly underway; I think we\u2019ve made some meaningful changes to the way we come to work and think about things in Mexico.  We continue to be focused on those things and again are committed to getting the franchise to the right place. It\u2019s an important franchise for us in every sense of the word and a place where we think there\u2019s growth and a place where we need to and should be making investment; and we\u2019ve got to get those things right, and we\u2019re committed to do that. And we\u2019ve put a lot of resources forward both locally and from around the globe to help us be able to do that as quickly as we can. I think from a complexity perspective, I think two things \u2013 one is you hit on part of it, and John and I talked about it : these eleven Consumer markets plus the Korean piece were those that were in the optimized bucket. They were those that we were working with the businesses on in terms of trying to create a pathway to proper returns. We didn\u2019t in the end see that in these, and so I think in many ways these decisions were made around a couple axis.  One is that we didn\u2019t see the prospect to getting to adequate returns in a reasonable period of time. Second, we felt that we could take those resources and we could reallocate them into other parts of our business where we would certainly have the ability to try and get more out of them. And I think the third piece you touch on is around those : if you don\u2019t have a pathway to that it doesn\u2019t make sense to keep complexity or keep things in the firm that aren\u2019t going to be able to touch those. So I think we were able to tick off several boxes by making these moves. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Right, makes sense. And I think with these sales though it seems like it helps profitability. Does that give you more comfort on the ROA target? And then just a quick clarification, your ROA target of 90 basis points includes Citi Holdings and that contemplates, I\u2019ve had some questions around the selling of One Main and what that may do to your targets. John Gerspach : That\u2019s right, that\u2019s right. Yes, and so the ROA target includes Citi Holdings so that\u2019ll be there to begin. We\u2019ve put all the caveats around big gains or losses that are outsized, etc., but that\u2019s there. And again, I think you can see in these moves \u2013 and again, as we\u2019ve described we\u2019re going to move these businesses into Citi Holdings; and in Citi Holdings I think we\u2019ve proven that we\u2019ve got the people and the expertise that can manage these exits well. And we don\u2019t want our go forward businesses distracted in that process, and again, we\u2019ve already started the process against most of those and have an expectation that we\u2019d like to be out of the majority of those by the end of \u201915. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : But otherwise you still feel comfortable with the target even if you sell a profitable business like One Main? John Gerspach : We do, yes we do. Jim Mitchell \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay great, appreciate it. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Thanks. Following up on the targets, John and Mike, I was wondering how you\u2019re feeling on the Consumer Bank, on the GCB targets for efficiency ratio on Slide 12. John talked about the target and you give the helpful box there. The 49% to 52% efficiency target seems like a stretch from the pro forma 55%. Can you help us feel better about kind of what are some of the drivers there? Mike Corbat : Sure, John. When you take a look at that slide I think you\u2019ll notice that at the top of the slide there\u2019s a blue box that has the repositioning charges and legal charges of $800 million, and that both the 56% and the 55% figures include what we would think of as being rather outsized repositioning and legal charges on a trailing twelve-month basis.  So that, I think you\u2019ve got two things. One is, as you can see with the dark blue boxes both on this slide as well as the next slide, we are continuing to drive down the core operating expenses in the business. But at the same time then I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ll see the same level of repositioning charges going into 2015 that we\u2019ve seen during 2014. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And John, did you mention that there will be any repositioning charges for the simplification you described today? Or is that a driver for the $400 million that you talked about for Q4? John Gerspach : I\u2019m sorry, John, I missed the beginning part of your question. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : I was just wondering what repositioning expenses might be associated with the strategic actions you announced today. John Gerspach : Nothing specific in that $400 million related to the eleven markets. Those things, whether or not we have repositioning charges associate with that will really be determined based upon the structure of whatever deal that we negotiate on a sale. So it\u2019s a little early to call that. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. And then just to clarify the CECCAR expenses, you mentioned incremental costs of $100 million to $150 million in 2014 over 2013? John Gerspach : Correct. John, $150 million to $175 million is the number that I quoted. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, and you spent $60 million or so this quarter? John Gerspach : We spent an incremental $60 million year-over-year this quarter. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : And was there any in the first half of the year that would count towards that $150 million? John Gerspach : Yeah, there was some. Certainly beginning in Q2, I don\u2019t have that number right in front of me but it would have been much less than the $60 million that we had in Q3. And we expect those expenses then to continue to ramp up into Q4. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Got it, okay, so we can kind of put the pieces together there. And then you said one-third of it you expect to be nonrecurring? John Gerspach : Correct. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay. Okay, and then just on Credit, John, you had the reserve release in International Consumer. What drove that and how are you feeling about reserve releases continuing in the other parts of the businesses, domestically in Citicorp and then also in Holdings? John Gerspach : Yeah, I\u2019d say that we\u2019re still seeing, well first as far as from an international point of view that was largely driven by Asia but also by continuing favorable credit trends throughout the countries with the exception of where I called out the NCL rate issue that we have in Mexico \u2013 although again, the dollar losses there of net credit losses were largely in line with our expectations. It\u2019s much more of a rate issue. We continue to see real favorable credit in North America, certainly in both our mortgage business but importantly in both of our cards businesses \u2013 Branded Cards as well as Retail Services. So that story is still continuing. When I look at the net credit margin which I think you see it in the supplement \u2013 the net credit margin in our Branded Cards business this quarter was over 950 basis points. So that\u2019s really outstanding performance in that US Branded Cards business. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : How should we think about whether we\u2019re likely to see some reserve releases in Card or in the mortgage part of Holdings going forward? John Gerspach : Well the mortgages, as far as from a holdings point of view, John, you can pretty much expect that we\u2019re going to be you know largely netting off reserve releases against the NCLs that come out of mortgages. You know, this quarter it was just about 100%, I think it was like 101%. Last quarter we were in the 90% range, so you\u2019re going to see a large portion of whatever losses we take in the mortgage book in Holdings offset by reserve releases. As far as the rest of the world I don\u2019t think you\u2019re going to see much more in the way of reserve releases coming out of our International Consumer operations. We continue to grow those books and so just as you continue to grow the loan book you\u2019re going to have to build loan loss reserves against that. And then in the US it\u2019s really going to be driven by just how much better our credit performance can get in our two Cards businesses. You might still see some reserve releases in the near quarters but I wouldn\u2019t look out much past that. John McDonald \u2013 Sanford Bernstein : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Thank you. Maybe just a little color on timing and what drove the one-time implementation of the FVA on the over-the-counter derivatives that you mentioned \u2013 I think you have the bullet on Slide 3. John Gerspach : Yeah, this is something that we\u2019ve been looking at for some time. There\u2019s been a couple of other institutions that have adopted it so it\u2019s been something that\u2019s been knocking around in the market. We\u2019d set ourselves a goal to adopt it sometime during 2014, as soon as we could get all the systems in place and we had the ability to monitor this type of calculation over several months, a full quarter. And so we had gotten everything in place and we felt comfortable then pulling the trigger on the formal adoption in Q3 instead of waiting until Q4. We think it\u2019s the way the industry is going and therefore we wanted to adopt it as soon as we felt comfortable that we had the systems in place to track it. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Okay, and is the one-time [catch-up], and like you said \u2013 some people have adopted it, some haven\u2019t. And you expect everybody through by year-end? John Gerspach : I don\u2019t know by year-end but I do think that over time, and I don\u2019t know whether time is this year-end or next year-end, I think the move is to go that way. And we just felt it was better to be at least in the middle of the pack. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Got it, okay. We can move on, thanks. John Gerspach : No problem. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: You\u2019ve had a big benefit as others have as lower average rate on long-term debt, and that\u2019s been a driver of your stable and actually even growing margin. So I heard your comments about the one or two basis points, I\u2019m not overly focused on that, but my one question is going forward in terms of debt coming due and all thoughts around TLAC how much more optimization do you see coming in say the next two years on the cost of financing, impact on margin and then where you fit in TLAC in general? John Gerspach : Okay, that\u2019s a very broad question. That\u2019s okay, that\u2019s alright, it\u2019s a great question but let me just try to break it down into pieces. So let me start I guess with TLAC is probably, because again we still don\u2019t know where TLAC is going to come out. We\u2019ve all seen the rumors and everything else but we haven\u2019t seen the formal rules yet so it\u2019s a little hard to judge exactly what\u2019s going to be implemented with TLAC. But from a TLAC point of view right now, we would put our loss absorbent capital at just over 20% of our risk-weighted assets.  Now that\u2019s again our calculation based upon our interpretation of the rules, and in order to get to that 20% for instance we have eliminated all of the structured notes we issue as saying we think that they\u2019ll be ultimately kept out of the rule. That may be right, that may be wrong but that\u2019s what gets us to that little bit over 20%. So we feel like we\u2019re okay with TLAC, but obviously there\u2019ll be more work to do and we\u2019ll have to see again how the rules come out. So let\u2019s put the response to TLAC aside just for a second. And then when you take a look at our existing book, you know, I still think that there is some optimization work that we can do on the liability side of our balance sheet. Don\u2019t forget we still have debt that we\u2019re carrying that was issued in \u201907, \u201908, \u201909, \u201910 when our credit spreads were much higher than they are today. And so as that debt runs off that can still give you some lift. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Maybe the other side of the equation is I\u2019ve noticed growth in international markets has been good on the loan side. The deposit growth has been less impressive and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something that you\u2019re doing consciously or just a product of some of the markets that you\u2019re in. Just curious on\u2026 John Gerspach : Glenn, what you\u2019re seeing is we are active managers of our balance sheet and again, you\u2019ll notice that. Especially take a look at the US Cards business \u2013 I mentioned that before. You\u2019ll see there that we\u2019ve actually been driving up yields in the US Cards business. As we\u2019ve let those promotional balances run off we\u2019ve actually experienced higher yields than on those interest-earning assets. So I don\u2019t want you to think that everything we\u2019re doing is just on the right-hand side of the balance sheet; we\u2019re actively moving on the left-hand side of the balance sheet as well as we think about driving our NIM performance. But to your other question then on deposits, yes, we\u2019re active managers of our deposit base as well. And we\u2019re looking to run what we would term a \u2018compact\u2019 balance sheet. We\u2019re not looking to grow the balance sheet much beyond where it is today. We don\u2019t think we need a balance sheet much larger than $1.9 trillion to serve our clients. And so within that construct then you need to be very careful about both what you put on the left side of the balance sheet and how you fund that on the right side of the balance sheet. And so when you deal with all the rules that are out there as far as net stable funding ratio, the LCR, the SLR \u2013 all of those rules come into play as we think about how to structure the right side of the balance sheet. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Okay, maybe just a really quick wrap-up. We definitely appreciate Slide 8 on the impact of the strategic actions. Are we looking at that slide each quarter as we roll through \u201915 or is there chance you move those eleven markets in something like discontinued ops and we get a clean look at Citicorp without it? John Gerspach : No, Glenn, one of the things that we mentioned is that effective Q1 we\u2019ll move those eleven markets into Holdings so that we will give you a clean look at the GCB. We\u2019ll show it on a pro forma basis again next quarter but then beginning in Q1 we\u2019ll give you a clean look at the Global Consumer Bank. Glenn Schorr \u2013 ISI: Thank you, missed that one. Appreciate it. John Gerspach : That\u2019s not a problem, sir. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Hi, good afternoon. So first one, just a quick one, I don\u2019t know whether you can comment \u2013 JP Morgan gave us a little bit on the source of it. The legal charge, is it possible to say what that\u2019s tied to? I think JP Morgan indicated it was heavily tied to FX. Mike Corbat : Yeah, Brennan, as you know we typically don\u2019t comment on reserving actions unless it\u2019s related to a specific settlement that we\u2019re announcing. So that\u2019s as far as we\u2019re going to go today. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Okay. And then on the funding side, I believe you had said that funding costs drove the NIM expansion. Can maybe you give a bit more color on specifically what was behind that? Mike Corbat : Again, as we manage both the cost of our deposits as well as the cost of our debt, we\u2019ve managed to improve the cost of funds. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s giving you enough or if you need something, but the improvement was just about evenly split between the two. And so that\u2019s actively managing deposits \u2013 we\u2019re managing down things like time deposits and instead concentrating on getting deposit growth in operating balances, which are either interest-free or interest-light. And then on the long-term debt, again we\u2019re swapping out debt where we had issued it under higher credit spreads and replacing it with debt that is a bit more attractive to us today. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Yeah, sorry, I meant is there any geography impact there or anything beyond just shifting away from time deposits? Mike Corbat : Well, from a geography point of view most of the debt would be US-centric and the deposits would be a global phenomenon. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Okay. And then thinking about your rate shock scenario, can you give any color about how that might look in Year 2 or how you might think about that in Year 2? Just trying to think about the benefit from rolling the portfolio into higher-yielding securities versus your expectation for deposit pricing pressure. John Gerspach : Yeah, when we put out the $1.9 billion impact that really is, it\u2019s a rate shock type of thing. So it\u2019s an estimate as to what the revenue impact would be to the firm over a year if rates just moved instantaneously by 100 basis points. Now, obviously then as you begin to operate in that environment there\u2019d be a lot of moving pieces and give and take, but I would say that for the most part that $1.9 billion should be sustaining into Year 2. You might have some changes a little bit around the edges but it should be largely sustaining. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Okay, and I guess so effectively the benefit from rolling into higher rates would probably be largely offset by increasing deposit pricing? John Gerspach : Yeah, if you\u2019re in a rising rate environment again it\u2019s going to certainly impact both sides of your balance sheet. That\u2019s why I say it would be largely sustaining. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Okay, terrific. And then the last one with me, is it possible to get a rough idea of the cost basis of One Main? John Gerspach : No. Brennan Hawken \u2013 UBS : Alright, figured I\u2019d give it a shot. Thanks a lot. John Gerspach : That\u2019s okay, Brennan, thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Hi gentlemen. So you announced what sounded like very logical moves on the Global Consumer side. I was wondering if you could give us a sense for the capital free-up potential \u2013 what\u2019s either your capital allocated to those markets or the RWA impact? John Gerspach : Not at this point in time, Guy. We\u2019ve given you the capital attribution for the overall Consumer business and we\u2019ll refresh that in Q1, and when we refresh that in Q1 you\u2019ll see the impact from those exits as well as other changes. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Okay, fair enough. When you think about what you\u2019ve been doing to try to get a more positive CECCAR outcome next time I was wondering if you have had some discussions with the regulators about how they would view this type of strategic action that you\u2019re taking? Mike Corbat : Sure, Guy, it\u2019s Mike. Obviously we\u2019re in pretty constant and consistent dialog with the regulators. I think in there the business model and the running of the business is our decision in terms of what we want to do, and provided that we can show we\u2019ve got the ability to run it in the right way they\u2019re fine with that. I think to the earlier question, in this case given that these aren\u2019t and in the immediate case we don\u2019t see a path to being accretive for our shareholders it\u2019ll certainly work towards a smaller, simpler Consumer business, a more focused Consumer business. And in the end I think taking those factors, you\u2019ve got to view that as a positive. But the regulators haven\u2019t commented specifically on it. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Got it. Just a question on the DTA utilization : the level you did in the quarter was kind of comparable to what you did last year on a quarterly basis but I think in the first half you had been running more around $1.1 billion. I was just wondering mechanically maybe you can explain to us why it fell off. John Gerspach : Yeah, really it has to do, Guy, with everything. Earnings has been fairly consistent, so if you look at the earnings impact over the last couple quarters, our earnings \u2013 both coming out of Citicorp as well as Citi Holdings \u2013 have been running at about $800 million a quarter; I think one quarter it hit $900 million. So the real change from what we were running in the first half to what we ran in the second really has to do with the impact of CVA and OCI and it\u2019s as simple as that. But the earnings potential, if you go into the back of the deck, Page 39, there you\u2019ll see that for a trailing twelve-month period the earnings of Corp and Holdings utilized $3.4 billion of DTA. Now on a year-to-date basis that similar number is $2.6 billion and in the quarter it was $800 million. So again, very consistent at $800 million, $900 million a quarter, the earnings power of the franchise begins to utilize the DTA. It\u2019s the other stuff \u2013 it\u2019s how the OCI moves that gives you a little bit of noise that you see over there on the right side. For a full year the impact of all of that was $200 million of utilization but you\u2019re going to get noise quarter to quarter. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Got it. So the noise is going to depend on what happens to your credit spreads and those of your counterparties, and OCI \u2013 in other words, rates. And so you\u2019re really not going to know about that until the end of the quarter, basically. John Gerspach : That\u2019s exactly right, Guy. And again, that\u2019s going to be some noise but I think that the number you really want to focus on is how are we doing as far as utilizing DTA driven by the earnings capacity of the franchise. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Yeah, understood. Absolutely. JPM called out emerging markets\u2019 revenue in [FIC] as a driver of the relative strength in the quarter and I was kind of surprised that you didn\u2019t, that you indicated securitized products more just given your mix. Can you give us a sense for emerging markets\u2019 results in [FIC] in the quarter versus the two reference quarters? John Gerspach : Yeah, our emerging markets franchises performed very well in the quarter. They didn\u2019t necessarily contribute as much to growth year-over-year because they actually had a pretty good performance in Q3 last year. Now, the FX franchise performed well globally driven by September but if you\u2019re just trying to isolate what changed year-over-year securitized products had a slightly larger contribution.  And if you think about the environment that we were living in in Q3 last year compared to Q3 this year I think it\u2019s pretty easy to figure out why there would have been a little bit more client activity around securitized products \u2013 it was just a little bit better. Even though it wasn\u2019t a great rate environment it was certainly a better US rate environment than what we had last year. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Yeah, makes sense. Final one from me : during the quarter at least some of the, I guess Dodd-Frank driven new daily filings on liquidity and I think some of the Volcker stuff started to go into effect for the GFEBS. And I was just wondering to what extent you might ascribe some of what we were hearing towards the end of the quarter, [which] was some liquidity issues in credit markets \u2013 does that have anything to do with it? John Gerspach : You know, I don\u2019t know if I would ascribe movements in the credit markets, certainly not to Volcker. But I think everyone is looking to see how they\u2019re going to manage in a SLR/LCR/NSFR type of world. And anytime that you put out brand new rules I think it takes a while then for the system to sort of adapt to them. And that may have been some of the noise that you heard about at the end of the quarter. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : But do you think it has or maybe had temporarily an impact on the inventory management for the big dealers? John Gerspach : I would say that anybody who\u2019s concerned about managing their balance sheet, yeah, it would definitely have an impact. You have to be highly cognizant now of your SLR ratio and you\u2019ve got to manage through both the SLR and the LCR. So depending upon what deposits you take in, those deposits could have a high liquidity value or they could have zero liquidity value. If a deposit has zero liquidity value then you can\u2019t do anything with it other than invest it overnight, which means you\u2019re holding either cash or overnight Treasury securities. Now that drives up the asset side of your balance sheet and now you\u2019ve got to be worried about your SLR constraints because all of a sudden now you\u2019ve got to put capital against that. So depending upon where any individual firm was at quarter-end I would say that they were definitely watching both the asset side of the balance sheet from an SLR point of view and the right side of the balance sheet from a combined LCR and SLR point of view. Guy Moszkowski \u2013 Autonomous Research : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful, thank you. And thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem at all, Guy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank : If I could follow up on your comment about a strong CECCAR submission, if you can elaborate on that \u2013 on what does \u2018strong\u2019 mean do you think from a process point of view, from a capital [deployment ask] or just any comments you can give around that since you did mention it? Mike Corbat : Yeah, I think as I described, Matt, really we\u2019ve been focused on a number of things. But one is that really taking the CECCAR process and really embedding it into the firm and again, I think that goes along a few different channels. One is management engagement \u2013 how is management thinking about the business? What are the risks in their business? How do we quantify those? How do we position the firm against those?  Second is I think work we\u2019ve done around our models \u2013 building model validation, model integration into the firm. I think that we\u2019ve worked hard in terms of making sure in essence we\u2019ve got the boots on the ground across the different areas, in particular second and third lines of defense and making sure that they\u2019re synched up against our businesses and really operating in the right way. So it\u2019s a big focus towards model build-out, that infrastructure, but most importantly how really that gets embedded in the way we think about and run the business on a day-to-day basis \u2013 not a one-off submission and then back to the old ways. Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And I realize it\u2019s still about five, six months away in order to get all the guidelines, but as you think about what a successful outcome would be is passing on a qualitative basis enough or would you want to also be able to have a meaningful amount of buybacks as well to view it as a success? Mike Corbat : Well I think as you alerted to we\u2019re not going to speak to what the number is but we\u2019ve got to certainly get beyond success being measured as a successful submission with no capital ask, right? We\u2019re in a position where we\u2019re fortunate to generate large amounts of regulatory capital and we\u2019ve got to put the firm in a position to return that. So I would view a successful ask as a combination of those things. Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. And then just separately on expenses, the Q4 commentary of relatively flat on a core basis is helpful. As we think into next year maybe before we account for some of the business exits, but how should we think about the expense run rate beyond this year? You\u2019ve been taking some of these repositioning costs that I know have been driving the positive operating leverage. Is there more benefit from those still to come? John Gerspach : Matt, at this point in time we\u2019re still focused on in 2015 on delivering being able to run Citicorp in the mid-50%s efficiency ratio. So that\u2019s the target that we set out for ourselves a year and a half ago and that\u2019s still the target that we\u2019re working at towards 2015. Matt O\u2019Connor \u2013 Deutsche Bank : Okay. Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : Hi. As far as the GCB restructuring, Mike, is this it \u2013 going from 35 markets to 24? Or is there potentially more? Mike Corbat : Well I think as you look, Mike, just to kind of put it in context \u2013 I think we\u2019ve gone from a number higher than that. I think in aggregate we\u2019re down somewhere around 15, 17 markets in the past couple years. And so what we\u2019ve said is that we\u2019ve got an ongoing process which we\u2019ve talked very openly about, about our country bucketing and our business bucketing and the way we think about those.  We do still have businesses in the optimized bucket \u2013 those businesses obviously not being on the list are making progress towards the goals that we\u2019ve agreed to in terms of where they\u2019re going to get those businesses. And again, those buckets will continue as they\u2019ve been to be fluid and we\u2019ll keep assessing things against what we\u2019ve laid out. But right now those businesses are on track and feel like they\u2019ve got a pathway to get to a place of having adequate returns or good returns in the consumer business. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : Is there more restructuring in the US that you can do? You mentioned mortgage and branches \u2013 what else could be done? Mike Corbat : Well, as we\u2019ve laid out a series of metrics from a headcount, a product perspective, from a site perspective \u2013 things that are probably the largest drivers of costs in there, it\u2019s on Page 13 in the deck. And so we\u2019re committed on delivering those. We\u2019ve made significant progress against those : continuing to simplify our products, continuing to rationalize our branch footprint, continuing to shrink and consolidate our support sites. And again, those are the big drivers of expenses. So as we\u2019ve laid out there we\u2019ve got more work we think we can do. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : So getting to that target range in GCB of 49% to 52%, that would be more than simply less legal and repositioning costs? John, I think your answer earlier said that that was going to be a nice driver of it, but other than that what would be the main drivers? John Gerspach :  No Mike, as I said before there\u2019s two elements to it. I drew your attention, at least I intended to draw the attention to that Chart 12 and note that there were two areas of the expenses. We had the light blue box at the top which talked about the legal and repositioning charges and I pointed to that as one area that we felt would contribute next year. But more importantly, and I think this is where you\u2019re driving, it\u2019s the big blue box at the bottom that really talks about those core operating expenses. And there we intend to continue to drive those core operating expenses down. We lay out for you on Slide 12 the progress that we\u2019ve made on a trailing twelve-month basis but then you can also see when you flip over to Slide 13 that we\u2019re making progress in that area on a quarter-by-quarter basis. And that is going to continue as we continue to execute on the actions that Mike talked about \u2013 as we continue to reduce headcount, we continue to simplify the product offering and we continue to rationalize our branch and support site structures. So all of that work continues; it\u2019s ongoing now. It will remain ongoing into next year and beyond. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : Okay, and last follow-up on that : when you say \u2018support sites\u2019 I\u2019m just trying to get a little more meat on the bones on this Slide 13. Is support sites going down, is that a big expense takeout; or the headcount reduction, the branches, that should all help. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of magnitude. Mike Corbat : So support sites, Mike, I\u2019d break into probably two big buckets. One would be service centers and the second would be datacenters, and obviously as you can consolidate those, turn space back, create more scale, etc., you\u2019ve got the ability to get those costs out \u2013 centers of excellence, however you choose to describe them. And so I think we\u2019ve shown the ability to do that and we\u2019ve got more work to do. John Gerspach : Yeah, Mike, I think when you look at those four items that we lay out there they all are somewhat interrelated. We don\u2019t have \u201cstandardize the platform\u201d there but clearly as you simplify your products and you put everything onto one standard platform that means that you can then collapse a lot of individual call centers into one because you\u2019re not running individual call centers for different products in every country \u2013 each one then having to deal with a different operating system. So we standardize the information available to our customer service personnel. We make it easier for them to understand the products that we offer. That then enables them to provide a much better experience to our clients. So we can simplify the products, we standardized the platforms; we can reduce the sites and therefore we can actually provide our clients with a better experience with less people. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : Alright, that\u2019s helpful. Just one other separate question : I opened up the paper this morning and saw some comments from Mike O\u2019Neil, the Chairman. And so Mike Corbat, what\u2019s your current relationship with Mike O\u2019Neil, and just I thought the timing was interesting to see the Chairman. And Citigroup\u2019s the last major US bank that has the CEO and Chairman position split so I\u2019m just wondering your current thoughts on that \u2013 the tradeoff, the benefits, the costs of having that. Mike Corbat : Sure. I think from our perspective, I won\u2019t speak to others\u2019 \u2013 I think our relationship and our structure works well for us. I think our relationship is excellent. I think the dialog with the Board is very good and I think from a governance perspective and a relationship perspective when we think about and run the firm and the delineation of duties, it certainly works for us. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : And the degree that Mike O\u2019Neil\u2019s giving you council when it comes to these restructuring moves, like the one you announced today? Mike Corbat : I think we always have good, engaged strategic interaction with the Board \u2013 not just Mike but with the Board. And so the Board was aware of these actions and supportive of the actions that management recommended. Mike Mayo \u2013 CLSA : Great, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Hi, good morning \u2013 just a quick, ticky-tacky question at this stage. You mentioned the core operating expenses at $10.9 billion looking to keep relatively flat into Q4. I know we have some CECCAR expenses coming up a little bit. I mean maybe that adds a percent or something like that but we should expect those CECCAR expenses are on top of what you did in Q3, would it be incremental? Or are you saying that you think you have other things in core operating expenses you\u2019re going to peel back and that\u2019s going to offset your CECCAR expense increase in the quarter? John Gerspach : We would say that again, we should be able to keep the expenses relatively flat into Q4. We still have benefits that are rolling off for other expense initiatives that we\u2019ve introduced. I mean you\u2019ve seen the amount of repositioning charges that we\u2019ve taken \u2013 those repositioning charges do generate real savings. But those savings in Q4 are likely going to be reinvested then as we continue to enhance our capital planning process, CECCAR. Betsy Graseck \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Right, I get it. Thanks a lot. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thank you, good afternoon. Can you share with us, in your last (q) I think you put in there that a 100-basis point shift in the yield curve would contribute an additional $1.9 billion or so to revenue. If the yield curve flattens and The Fed does move rates up next year, but as you notice the ten-year today is down to about 2.2% - if we don\u2019t get the parallel shift how much of the benefit would you likely see with the front end going up but the long end remaining anchored where it is today? John Gerspach : If the front end went up but the long end dropped, there is a scenario we\u2019ve laid out for you which has a 100 basis point increase in short-term and a relatively flat long-term. I think what you see in that type of environment, we capture the lion\u2019s share of the $1.9 billion. I don\u2019t have that number in my head but it\u2019s a substantial portion of the $1.9 billion. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Great. The second question is can you remind us, in terms of your capital ratios, your Tier One Common ratio for example, what kind of cushion do you want to keep above whatever the final number turns out to be? And I know that\u2019s a moving target because you\u2019re seeing The Fed and others ask for more capital and they haven\u2019t given us the exact numbers yet, but are you looking to maintain a 50- or 100-basispoint number over whatever the final target becomes? John Gerspach : Well, as you say it\u2019s a little hard right now because we don\u2019t know where the final rules are going to come out. So give us a chance to take a look at the final rule and then we\u2019ll be happy to tell you what kind of buffer we think we need. There\u2019s still a bit of rulemaking yet to be laid down. We\u2019ve got the promise of another G-SIFI surcharge. We\u2019ve got OLA that still needs to be finalized. So when these things begin to settle down we\u2019ll be happy to come back to you then with a more informed target. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, thank you. And then as of today what would you point to as your binding constraint on the capital ratios? Which one do you guys look to today? And again, I know that this may not be the case a year from now. John Gerspach : Well let\u2019s see \u2013 on October 14th I\u2019d say it\u2019s Tier One, Basil-3, Advanced Approach, Tier One Common. But check back with me by November 14th and I may have a slightly different answer. And I\u2019m not trying to be cute \u2013 it\u2019s just that as the rules begin to change and they intersect you\u2019re constantly battling one against the other. If you had asked me a year ago I would have said SLR was going to be the binding constraint. Six months ago I was really worried that Standardized RWA, the standardized approach was going to be the binding constraint. Today I feel like it\u2019s Basil-3 Tier One Common, and then of course there\u2019s always the ultimate is of course the CECCAR submission itself. So we need to keep our eye on all four of those and it doesn\u2019t do you any good to just manage one. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Great. And then one last question : the Shared National Credit Exam hasn\u2019t been released yet, probably will be shortly here, but there was some commentary by The Federal Reserve. They\u2019re still concerned about leveraged loans by some of the larger banks \u2013 they\u2019re aggressively underwriting them \u2013 and they now claim they may use this in CECCAR as part of the qualitative area. Do you guys have any color on that or what do you guys think about that? Are you concerned about that if they bring it into the CECCAR process the way everybody underwrites leveraged lending? Mike Corbat : You know, those rumors are there, Gerard. We haven\u2019t heard anything on that formally so obviously this has been a big area of focus for The Fed and the OCC, so evolving. But we haven\u2019t gotten any guidance on that so far. Gerard Cassidy \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Thank you, guys. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities : Hi, good afternoon. I was hoping you could provide some clarity on what drove the sequential increase in risk-weighted assets. I guess historically what we\u2019ve seen particularly given periods of elevated FX volatility that there\u2019s a natural capital hedge from FX translation on the RWA denominator. And I didn\u2019t know if you could provide some more detailed guidance as to what were the sources of RWA build in the quarter. John Gerspach : Yeah, that\u2019s a good question, Steven. Since the beginning of the year we\u2019ve absorbed about, well, you can see it on the chart back on Slide 20 \u2013 we\u2019ve got about $60 billion in incremental RWA since the beginning of the year. The impact of business growth in Citicorp has been more than offset by reductions in Holdings and we\u2019ve gotten a little bit of FX benefit in this quarter that was probably worth about $10 billion or so. But the entire net impact really is the result of enhancements to our risk models, primarily credit models, and as well as our interpretation of the final B-3 rules. So we\u2019ve been enhancing our models and that\u2019s caused us then to increase the amount of risk-weighted assets that are required. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities : Thanks, that\u2019s really helpful. Is that model enhancement process, is it largely completed at this juncture or should we expect that there\u2019s more to come which could result in some RWA stickiness going forward? John Gerspach : Yeah, I\u2019d say we think that now we\u2019ve done an intensive review of the models certainly, especially in the period since we\u2019ve gone live on the Basil-3 advanced approach. And we\u2019re certainly comfortable with the models as they exist right now but here comes the big \u201chowever.\u201d However, our regulators still continue their reviews so there still may be additional enhancements required going forward. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities : Alright, fair enough. And just one more from me relating to the Securities portfolio and specifically the breakdown of HTM versus AFS. The last two quarters we\u2019ve seen an increase in the amount of securities you\u2019ve classified as hold to maturity, and just looking at last year\u2019s CECCAR results and in addition to that your midyear stress test exam which was published for public consumption, the AOCI losses were actually quite substantial and presumably should only increase as the number of Basil-3 deductions are recognized within the transitional horizon. I was wondering whether CECCAR considerations have actually prompted you to accelerate the reclassification of some of your securities portfolio and is that something that we should expect to persist going forward? John Gerspach : I\u2019d say if you looked at the percentage of our investment portfolio that is classified as HTM we\u2019re probably underweight compared to many of our peers. And so as we look at the possibility of reclassifying things between AFS and HTM it\u2019s a little bit more being driven by our view as far as volatility in our OCI, and therefore how that impacts the numerator in our regulatory capital. So again, that\u2019s really our focus. We want to make sure we\u2019ve got the right mix and again, we don\u2019t want to overweight towards hold to maturity. But we would look at it right now and say perhaps we\u2019re a little underweight where we are. Having said that we\u2019re very comfortable with the level that we have right now so I\u2019m not leading you to the fact that we\u2019re going to be increasing it dramatically. But we may continue to add bits and pieces into the HTM. Steven Chubak \u2013 Nomura Securities : Alright, understood. Thanks for clarifying that, John, and thank you for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem, Steven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Erika Najarian \u2013 Bank of America : Yes, my questions have been asked and answered, thank you. John Gerspach : Okay, thank you Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company : Thanks, guys. Just one question for me : John, you alluded in your prepared remarks to the recent bit of slowing in some of the international businesses. And I just wondered if you could flesh out for us when you think about your international businesses and developed versus emerging markets, do you see that slowdown as either A) partly seasonal, B) any change in terms of how you\u2019re perceiving growth; or C) related to just this kind of downgrade of growth expectations \u2013 and how are you responding to that? John Gerspach : I would say it\u2019s more of the latter as far as just the overall impact of everyone\u2019s expectations for global growth coming down a bit. In the comments that I made earlier I think what you\u2019re referring to is some of the comments I made as far as loan growth that we had in Latin America, specifically Mexico. So you do have certain market-by-market where you can see the impact, but from an emerging market view we still see good growth, good overall growth coming out of the emerging markets especially when compared to the developed markets. It\u2019s just a little bit less growth than what we would have anticipated earlier in the year. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company : And just as a quick follow-up on that : have you noticed anything then, you\u2019d mentioned a couple of comments in your prepared comments in the deck about spreads but has the spread and competitive environment changed at all in that too? Or are you finding yourself still able to gain share within those faster-growing economies? John Gerspach : Yeah, we\u2019re doing fine and I think that we\u2019re managing to keep pace within the economies in which we operate. We have seen spread pressure hit us in the trade product \u2013 that\u2019s certainly something that hit us this quarter. When you take a look at the revenue growth in TTS, the revenue growth in TTS was impacted both year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter by a roughly $40 million decline in Trade product revenues. And while the spreads in the cash management business were largely stable overall trade spreads have been declining now for several quarters.  So we\u2019ve seen that impact but we are maintaining our market share in that product, but we\u2019re doing that by shifting to an originate for sale type of approach. So we\u2019re maintaining market share but instead of originating for balance sheet we\u2019re originating to sell \u2013 that means that we forego net interest revenue in return for an upfront fee but as a result the trade revenue assets have declined, so have our trade assets. But we\u2019ve preserved and in some cases have improved our returns. So there\u2019s different ways of managing through lower spread environments. Ken Usdin \u2013 Jefferies & Company : Very well, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Hi John, thanks for taking my question. Just first of all, and I don\u2019t want to make too much of the midyear DFAST numbers but I was curious \u2013 your PPNR estimate for the most recent midyear DFAST was down about a little less than 30%. In fact that was in line with most of the other big banks but I guess I\u2019m just curious if there\u2019s any color you can provide as to what the difference was between the numbers that you put together for this year\u2019s midyear cycle and last year\u2019s midyear cycle just in terms of the PPNR exchange? John Gerspach : Well, I think there\u2019s two things. One is there\u2019s a different scenario. Obviously each year you construct a different scenario in which you then assess your stress within that scenario. So there\u2019s a scenario difference and also as Mike said earlier we\u2019re in the process of enhancing our overall capital planning process and I think you see some of the results in those numbers. Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Okay. And just moving on to the mortgage business, I know that\u2019s not a huge contributor to your overall bottom line but I guess in the bigger picture I\u2019m just curious how you all are thinking about the potential for loosening of standards by the FHFA even if it\u2019s minimal loosening in terms of opening up maybe the lower end of the mortgage market; and how much that might affect your ability to generate mortgage revenue given that you tend to target slightly better credit quality customers? Mike Corbat : I guess I would start in that, Matt, in terms of saying I think that that\u2019s important. I think it\u2019s good for the market because what we\u2019ve seen is the mortgage market today isn\u2019t functioning the way we\u2019d like. If you\u2019re not 20% down and high FICO it\u2019s been quite tough for people to get in and to be able to afford and buy homes. So one is I think for the overall system we would be supportive of that. I think as you rightly point out our model is largely focused around our Citi clients which tend to be higher in FICOs and probably have the ability to make higher down payments and higher deposits. But again, some of it falls in there and we\u2019d certainly be open and we\u2019d be supportive of that. So I think from our perspective I don\u2019t think it would have a big impact on Citi but I think it would be very constructive for the market. Matt Burnell \u2013 Wells Fargo Securities : Okay, that\u2019s it for me, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Yeah, hi. I was wondering in the context of the Page 8 disclosure about the impact of the strategic actions is $7 billion in loans roughly; and on Page 31 we see that Korea alone has about $24 billion in consumer loans. So I\u2019m wondering what specifically is in there and what isn\u2019t, and particularly I guess I was wondering is from all those countries is Citi Cards also withdrawing or is it just the basic branch system? John Gerspach : Yeah, let me try to help you through that one. First is we are not exiting the consumer franchise in Korea. We\u2019re exiting a specific element of that business \u2013 the consumer finance business in Korea which is a much smaller component of the overall Korea franchise. So when you take a look at the $24 billion worth of consumer loans that we have in Korea it\u2019s a relatively small amount of those loans that is actually then coming out. Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then just the cards \u2013 in those eleven countries are you basically out of the branch system, the branch banking system or also out of the card business as well? John Gerspach : It\u2019s going to be out of cards as well as out of the branches. Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Okay. And then lastly for me I\u2019m not sure if you can comment but on the cover of the One Main S(1) it lists the proposed maximum offering of being $50 million in size. That seemed very small and I was wondering if there\u2019s any color you can provide us on how we should expect the disposition to proceed in the year ahead. John Gerspach : Sure. I would describe that as a filing and again, I think our stated intent all along in this is to go towards a process that drives this business in terms of best price, best terms to the right buyer. I would say that kind of going in this we\u2019ll run a sale process and if we don\u2019t get a sales process to the right place then we\u2019ll pursue an IPO. But we wanted to have the flexibility to do that and if we got there we didn\u2019t want to have to wait the time necessarily to have to do all the filing. And obviously in preparation for the sale process you do a lot of those things that are requisite in the filing anyway. So it was I think convenient to be able to do that. So again, move towards the sale process and we\u2019ll always have the option to do an IPO if we want to use it. Chris Kotowski \u2013 Oppenheimer & Co.: Great, thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Mike Corbat : Great, thanks Chris. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of [Brian Klein-Hansel] with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. [Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW : Yeah, good afternoon. I just had a quick question on the strategic actions today. You mentioned that these were coming mostly from the optimized restructure market that you had identified previously, but also on that same chart you\u2019d also identified 20 markets which were the invest to grow markets. And I\u2019m assuming that you take these dollars allocated to the eleven markets and move those to the invest to grow. Kind of what are the top three markets that you\u2019re looking to invest in these days? John Gerspach : I would say as we look around we\u2019re clearly in no particular order investing in the US in several different ways; we continue to invest, we had a stated investment program that we\u2019re gearing towards Mexico. We\u2019ve talked about other markets in Asia where we\u2019ve been targeted and continuing to grow our businesses. So I think there\u2019s several places. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s a shortage of places where we can put these resources so to speak at better levels than they\u2019re being used today. [Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW : Okay, great. And just one other question on the tax rate guidance that you gave : are you assuming that all the legal charges going forward are now going to be tax deductible and that\u2019s why you\u2019re getting to the lower tax rate there? John Gerspach : No, no. We anticipate that again it\u2019s going to be dependent upon item by item as far as whether or not we would assess an accrual to be tax deductible or not. But as we look into Q4 right now we think that a 32% more or less tax rate is where we\u2019ll end up. [Brian Klein-Hansel] \u2013 KBW : Okay, great. Thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Okay, not a problem. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the call back to management for any further remarks. Susan Kendall : Alright, thank you all for joining us this morning. I know it\u2019s been a busy morning for many of you. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to reach out to IR. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Thanks, everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, Citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectation and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2013 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $350 million for the fourth quarter of 2014, or $0.06 a share. These results include the impact of $3.5 billion in legal reserves and repositioning costs, which we had disclosed in December. While these charges had the biggest impact on our results, we also saw a challenging end to the year, with macro uncertainties and falling oil prices resulting in a more difficult market environment than we had expected, particularly in the last few weeks of December. At the same time, our institutional banking franchise continued to show solid revenue growth. In consumer banking, our U.S. franchise performed well and we showed modest growth in international consumer, even as the global economic growth remained uneven. In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter and reduced assets to below $100 billion for the first time, driven by ongoing runoff in asset sales. While the overall results for 2014 fell short of our expectations, we did make significant progress towards our priorities, and while some of the steps we took were painful, I believe they allowed us to put our franchise in a position to have a successful 2015. We're doing everything we can to maximize the benefits of our repositioning costs and throughout 2014 we worked hard to improve our efficiency and reduce our cost base. We reduced our head count by almost 10,000 people, closed 95 operation sites, shrunk our branch network by over 10% while increasing digital uptake by consumers, simplified our product offerings, and increased customer satisfaction as measured by net promoter scores. We sold our consumer businesses in Spain and Greece and took important steps towards the exit of One Main. And in October, we announced plans to exit 11 consumer markets and have already signed two agreements regarding the sales of our Japanese retail business and our consumer business in Peru. These steps are part of our process to build one global consumer bank from a confederation of local banks. Our institutional banking business performed well throughout the year, as we focused on serving our core clients. In investment banking, we gained share with our target clients across most regions, generating strong revenue growth, and despite the low interest rate environment, treasury and trade solutions grew revenues as well, as did our private bank. While our markets businesses were impacted by volatility towards the end of the year, we'll continue to take steps to make sure that they are sized correctly for the environment we see going forward. After reviewing certain institutional businesses, we have decided to exit several non-core transactions businesses in order to further decrease our expense base and improve net income. These businesses will be reported out of Citi Holdings going forward. For the first time since its establishment, Citi Holdings was profitable for the full year and we reduced its assets by 16%. By utilizing $3.1 billion in DTA, we exceeded 2013's utilization by $600 million and have now utilized $5.6 billion in the last two years. Despite significant legal challenges, we were still able to generate $11 billion in regulatory capital in 2014, bringing the total to $31 billion over the last two years. During the year, we managed our balance sheet carefully. We grew our loan book in Citicorp and improved both our net interest revenue and margin from 2013 levels. We made Citi a safer and stronger institution in several ways. We invested in our risk, audit and compliant functions. We reduced our risk to asset profile by asset sales in business exits and we maintained a highly liquid balance sheet while improving the quality of our deposits. Our capital, leverage and liquidity ratios each increased over the course of the year. Returning capital to our shareholders remains a critical priority. During the year, we invested in and strengthened our capital planning process by focusing on risk identification and scenario design, improved our models, and we fostered a deeper engagement with our businesses. Last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve and we believe the submission reflects the progress we have made. We're fully committed to sustaining and building on these gains. As recent events have shown, there's no reason to think that the environment in 2015 will be any less challenging than the one we faced in 2014. While the recovery in the U.S. is gaining momentum, aided by lower energy costs, Europe is a continuing area of concern, with Russia and Greece facing the most immediate pressure. And while most emerging markets continue to grow, their economies remain the most vulnerable to external factors. That being said, we feel good about how we're positioned and to meet the challenges. This is an important year for our firm and we're committed to reaching our efficiency and return on asset targets. John will now go through the deck and then we'll answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. To start, I would like to highlight a few items from the fourth quarter of 2013 that affect the comparability to this quarter's results as shown on Slide 3. On an adjusted basis, we earned $0.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.82 in the fourth quarter of last year. This decline in EPS mostly reflects higher legal and related costs and repositioning charges versus last year. On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $346 million, or $0.06 per share, including the impact of $3.5 billion of legal and repositioning charges. Revenues declined slightly on a reported basis to $17.8 billion, but were up 2% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses grew 21% year-over-year, primarily reflecting the higher legal and repositioning charges. Core operating expenses were flat, including a benefit from the impact of FX translation. Cost of credit improved from last year. And our tax rate was significantly higher this quarter at 72%, reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals. On a full-year basis, revenues and core operating expenses were fairly stable versus last year. Legal and repositioning charges were significantly higher than the prior year, as we work to resize our operations and address legal issues. As we said in December, we believe we have put a significant portion of our outstanding legal matters behind us. Cost of credit was a tail wind, driven by lower net credit losses. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans decreased slightly year-over-year to $645 billion, as 3% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Deposits declined 4%, as we reclassified $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in Citicorp, given the sale announcement last month, and deposits continued to decline in Citi Holdings. On Slide 5, we provide more detail on fourth quarter revenues in constant dollars. In consumer banking, revenues were flat sequentially and up 3% year-over-year, driven by North America. Institutional revenues were down from last quarter, reflecting a difficult market environment and seasonally lower activity, but improved slightly from last year. And Citi Holdings revenues were down quarter-over-quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt. On a constant dollar basis, Citigroup revenues grew over $300 million, or 2% from the prior year. On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses. Legal and related expenses were over $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter and repositioning costs were roughly $650 million. Excluding these items, core operating expenses of nearly $11 billion increased in constant dollars both year-over-year and sequentially, primarily reflecting increased regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to our enhanced capital planning process, higher volume-related expenses, and certain one-time items partially offset by efficiency savings. The quarter-over-quarter increase of roughly $200 million was mostly comprised of an adjustment to accruals for certain non-income taxes, such as VAT, higher external legal and consulting fees, higher business volumes in a number of areas, and higher levels of expenses related to ongoing compliance and regulatory efforts, resulting from an acceleration of hiring and related spending originally planned for the first quarter of 2015. All of this increase from the prior quarter reflected expenses that were either non-recurring or already baked into our expected 2015 run rate. Performance-based incentive compensation was down from the prior quarter. However, this benefit was largely offset by changes to assumptions related to the recognition of deferred compensation. And on a full-year basis, core operating expenses were roughly flat, as repositioning savings, reductions in Citi Holdings, and other productivity initiatives fully offset the impact of higher regulatory and compliance and growth-related costs. On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. On a reported basis, Citicorp revenues of $16.5 billion declined slightly year-over-year in the fourth quarter, while core operating expenses grew 2% driven by higher regulatory and compliance costs, growth-related expenses, and certain one-time items I just described, partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. Credit costs improved modestly year-over-year, and the tax rate was significantly higher in the quarter reflecting the non-tax deductible legal accruals. On a full-year basis, the decline in net income mostly reflects higher legal and repositioning costs, partially offset by an improvement in credit. In Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter, with roughly $160 million in net income compared to a loss of over $400 million last year, driven primarily by lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $98 billion of assets, or 5% of total Citigroup assets. Before I go into more detail on Citicorp, I would like to provide an update on our strategic actions in global consumer banking and describe some additional actions we are taking in the institutional clients group. Starting with consumer, last quarter we announced plans to exit our consumer operations in 11 markets, plus our consumer finance business in Korea. Since then, we have executed agreements to sell two of these businesses. Our Japan retail operations and our consumer business in Peru, and we have active processes under way in the remaining markets. As we previously indicated, we will report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter. In 2014, these businesses contributed $1.6 billion of revenues and a loss of $36 million, with the loss primarily attributable to repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans. In addition to these actions in consumer, we also plan to exit certain businesses in ICG, including hedge fund services within securities services, and our prepaids cards business in treasury and trade solutions. These represent non-core businesses where we do not believe we have the scale to generate appropriate returns. We are working to exit these businesses in a timely and economically rational manner, with a minimal impact on our clients. In aggregate, the businesses generated nearly $460 million of revenues and a loss of over 80 million in 2014. However, roughly half of the operations pretax loss for the year was driven by repositioning and other actions directly related to the exit plans. We will also report these operations as part of Citi Holdings as of the first quarter. Turning back to the fourth quarter, on Slide 10, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, reflecting modest volume growth, offset by spread compression and regulatory headwinds in certain markets. Average loans grew 4% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 3%, and average deposits grew 2%. However, revenues were down sequentially, driven by lower investment sales revenues in Asia, reflecting weak investor sentiment and seasonality. Core operating expenses excluding legal and repositioning costs, grew 2%, as the impact of business growth and higher non-income taxes was partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs were up slightly year-over-year and by 10% sequentially, mostly due to loan loss reserve builds in Latin America, due to portfolio growth and seasoning. We incurred a charge-off of roughly $70 million this quarter related to our home builder exposure in Mexico. However, this charge was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release resulting in a neutral impact on overall credit costs. Slide 11 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues were up 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 25% from last year, including a gain of roughly $130 million from the sale of certain on-balance sheet mortgage loans. Excluding this gain, revenues grew 13%, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth, as well as abating spread headwinds. Branded cards revenues of $2.1 billion were flat versus last year, as we grew purchase sales and an improvement in spreads mostly offset the impact of lower average loans, reflecting the continued runoff of promotional rate balances, and retail services revenues declined 3% from last year, primarily reflecting higher contractual partner payments, driven by higher yields and improved credit costs. Underlying drivers for retail services remain positive, as average loans grew modestly and yields improved year-over-year. Core expenses declined year-over-year, but grew modestly from last quarter, driven by seasonal marketing expenses and other episodic items. Repositioning costs were higher this quarter, mostly reflecting actions to rationalize our branch footprint. We continued to resize our North America retail banking business in the fourth quarter, all while continuing to grow deposits, loans, and assets under management. Over the past year, we have sold or closed over 130 branches in North America and we have announced plans to sell or close an additional 60 branches in early 2015. By the end of the first quarter, roughly 90% of our branches will be concentrated around New York, Boston, Washington DC, Miami, Chicago, LA and San Francisco. We are focusing on our most productive branches in key urban areas and on growing high quality deposits. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, checking account balances grew 11%. Today, our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $200 million, up 17% from just a year ago. Slide 12 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, global consumer credit trends remain favorable in the fourth quarter. In North America and Asia, credit remains stable to improving, and in Latin America, as I described earlier, we incurred a roughly $70 million charge-off related to our home builder exposure in Mexico that was entirely offset by a related loan loss reserve release. Excluding this charge-off, dollar losses were flat to the third quarter in constant dollars and the NCL rate would have improved to 4.7%. Slide 13 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. We reduced our core expenses by roughly $160 million from 2013 to 2014, even while absorbing $100 million of incremental expenses related to the Best Buy portfolio acquisition. This core expense improvement reflects the significant progress we have made with head count reductions, product simplification, and branch and support site rationalization. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior year, even as we incurred higher legal and repositioning costs. Including roughly $900 million of legal and repositioning charges over the past year, our total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 56%, and pro forma for the announced market exits, the total efficiency ratio would have been 55%. Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 14, revenues of $7.2 billion in the quarter \u2013 in the fourth quarter were flat to last year, and down 17% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.1 billion grew slightly from last year and were down 5% from the prior quarter. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion were up 1% year-over-year and flat sequentially on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 6% from last year and 2% sequentially, as growth in high quality deposits and fees more than offset a decline in trade balances and spreads. Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 7% from last year on lower equity underwriting activity, and down 15% sequentially, reflecting the comparison to a very strong third quarter. Private bank revenues of $666 million grew 11% from last year driven by higher volumes and growth in investments, and capital markets products. Corporate lending revenues were $431 million, up 9% from last year, reflecting growth in average loans and improved funding costs, and down 2% from last quarter, driven by fair value marks on loans. Total markets and security services revenues of $3 billion declined 9% year-over-year, and 30% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $2 billion were down 16% from last year, and 33% sequentially, reflecting challenging market conditions, as well as seasonally lower activity versus the third quarter. The fourth quarter started with a volatile environment in early October, and ended in a similar way, with uncertainty around Russia and Greece, as well as falling oil prices in the last weeks of the year, driving increased volatility, wider credit spreads and less liquid trading conditions. Overall, our currencies business navigated well, with stable revenues year-over-year and a moderate sequential decline from a strong third quarter. However, we saw a significant revenue decline in spread products. In particular, credit and municipal products, as we continue to support our clients in a less liquid, more volatile market. Our G10 rates business was also down versus prior periods, mostly driven by the uncertain macro environment in the latter part of December. Equities revenues of $471 million declined 3% year-over-year and 38% sequentially, both driven by EMEA. Outside of EMEA, our equities revenues increased 24% year-over-year, with broad strength across products, and declined 18% sequentially on seasonally lower activity. In securities services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year on increased client balances and activity, and were down 4% sequentially, reflecting the impact of pending strategic exits. Total operating expenses of $5 billion grew 3% over last year, and were flat sequentially, as lower compensation expenses and the benefit of FX translation were offset by higher repositioning costs, as well as higher external legal and consulting fees. Credit costs grew to $163 million in the fourth quarter, reflecting an episodic write-off, as well as a reserve build driven by the overall economic environment. On Slide 15, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. In 2014, our efficiency ratio was flat to the prior year, as lower core operating expenses offset higher legal and repositioning charges. Including roughly $700 million of legal and repositioning charges, our total efficiency ratio was 59%, and pro forma for the announced strategic actions, the total efficiency ratio would have been 58%. Our full year comp ratio was also flat to 2013 at 29%. Slide 16 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues declined year-over-year, driven mainly by lower revenues from sales of available for sale securities, as well as hedging activities, while expenses increased on higher legal and related expenses, as well as higher regulatory and compliance costs, including those related to the CCAR process. Assets of $329 billion included approximately $80 billion of cash and cash equivalents, and $197 billion of liquid investment securities. Slide 17 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $98 billion at quarter end, with over 60% in North America mortgages. Total assets declined $5 billion during the quarter and $19 billion year-over-year, driven by asset sales and runoff. On Slide 18, we show Citi Holdings' financial results. Total revenues of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter were up slightly year-over-year, mainly driven by higher gain on asset sales, and lower cost of funds, and down 20% from last quarter on lower gains on asset sales, partially offset by lower losses on the redemption of debt. Citi Holdings' expenses continued to decline, driven by the lower level of assets, as well as lower legal and related costs, and credit costs continued to improve as well. On a sequential basis, net credit losses increased, as continued improvement in mortgage losses was offset by the impact of seasoning in the personal loan portfolio, as well as credit losses due to corporate loan sales. However, higher net credit losses were more than offset by higher loan loss reserve release. Mortgage net credit losses were entirely covered by reserve releases in the fourth quarter. On a full-year basis, 2014 was an important turning point for Citi Holdings. As we achieved profitability while continuing to wind down the portfolio and moving past our legacy legal issues. We sold our remaining Western European retail operations in Spain and Greece, significantly reduced our mortgage exposures, and positioned the One Main business for exit. On Slide 19, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. Our net interest margin improved to 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, reflecting lower cost of funds and our full-year margin was 290 basis points, up from 285 basis points in 2013. Looking to the first half of 2015, we expect our net interest margin to remain more or less flat to full-year 2014 levels. On Slide 20, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 10.5%, driven by a pension-related reduction in OCI, and an increase in operational risk RWA. Foreign exchange movements had no impact on the CET 1 ratio during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was flat to the prior quarter, at 6%. And our tangible book value declined sequentially to $56.83 per share, driven by changes in OCI. To conclude, I would like to spend some time on our outlook for 2015. We remain committed to delivering on our financial targets, including a mid-50s efficiency ratio in Citicorp and a return on assets of at least 90 basis points for Citigroup. We believe we can reach these targets through a combination of several drivers. First, we continue to believe we can generate low to mid single-digit revenue growth in Citicorp. Citicorp's full-year revenues in 2014 were broadly flat year-over-year. But in many ways, this understates the progress we're seeing across the franchise. In North America consumer, we saw 3% growth in the second half of the year, excluding certain one-time items, as we moved past the difficult comparisons in mortgage refi volumes, loans and deposits continued to grow, and spread headwinds began to abate. In international consumer, we also grew revenues by 3% in the second half of the year, even as we saw slower global growth and absorbed significant regulatory and spread headwinds that we see abating somewhat in 2015. In investment banking, we saw good momentum again this year, growing wallet share with our target clients and generating strong revenue growth year-over-year. And our momentum in treasury and trade solutions and the private bank was also evident, as we progressed through the year, with continued volume growth translating into stronger revenue performance. In total, our current expectations for continued volume growth and somewhat abating headwinds provide good line of sight for revenue growth in these businesses, which account for over three quarters of Citicorp revenues. And in markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment, with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients. Going into 2014, we knew we would face difficult market comparisons in the first half of the year, which was certainly true. But in the back half, total markets revenues broadly stabilized, even with continued challenging market conditions. Second, we believe we can drive a meaningful reduction in total operating expenses as a result of continued expense discipline to offset higher regulatory and compliance costs, the full realization of cost savings from the actions we took in 2014, and a significant reduction in legal and repositioning costs from the levels we saw in the past year, although on legal, as we have said before, nothing is certain until the matters are resolved. Higher revenues and lower operating expenses would naturally result in positive operating leverage in Citicorp. We expect credit costs to increase in 2015 driven by loan growth, as well as lower loan loss reserve releases, and our tax rate should be in the range of 31%. We believe that Citi Holdings will stay at or above breakeven on a full-year basis and we expect to keep balance sheet disciplined, staying at or below our current size. We expect the combination of these factors will help us deliver on both our efficiency and ROA targets in 2015. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. John, I was hoping you could try to give us a sense of how much of the one-time items you had in the fourth quarter core expense figure of the 10.9 core operating expense. You mentioned a number of items that were either pulled forward or that you characterized as one-timish. Can you give us a feel for how much that might have been of the 10.9 billion core expense number? John Gerspach : Well, let's focus on the $200 million. Because we basically \u2013 the guidance that we mentioned as of the end of the third quarter would have been that we would expected the operating expenses in the fourth quarter to be roughly flat. We saw about a $200 million rise, which I gave you some of the component pieces. I would say that somewhere between 50% and 75% of that 200-plus million dollars would be non-recurring, so call it two-thirds is non-recurring. John McDonald : That includes the CCAR expense? Some of the CCAR expense? John Gerspach : Some of the CCAR expense in the fourth quarter \u2013 overall in the second half of the year, we incurred CCAR expenses of about $180 million. And roughly two-thirds of that should be non-recurring as well. But that's split, John, between the third and the fourth quarter. John McDonald : Okay. And any sense \u2013 John Gerspach : I would say, John, John, back up. Two-thirds of that should be recurring. One third of that is non-recurring of the CCAR expense. John McDonald : Okay. Those expenses are in the 10.9 that that jumping off point in the fourth quarter expense number, correct? John Gerspach : Yes. John, maybe what's simpler is if I took you through where we stand with delivering the repositioning saves that might get you closer to where you're looking to \u2013 to try to get to. John McDonald : Okay. John Gerspach : If you think about our repositioning expenses, over the last nine quarters, we've taken roughly $3.1 billion of repositioning charges in Citicorp, including the actions that we announced back in December of 2012. We expect that the, all of those actions should produce about $3.4 billion of annual savings. Roughly $2.7 billion of those benefits are already included in our fourth quarter expense run rate. Or maybe said another way, the fourth quarter expenses are lower by about $700 million, resulting from the cumulative impact of those actions. So these savings will continue to accrete each quarter and we expect the vast majority of those remaining benefits to be reflected in our expense base by the fourth quarter of 2015. John McDonald : Okay. So if we actually tried to talk about it in terms of the 10.9 you're running right now exiting the year just under $44 billion in core operating expense. You hope to have that number lower in absolute dollars in 2015 with the savings building? John Gerspach : John, again, we're committed to delivering that efficiency ratio in the mid-50s for Citicorp. John McDonald : Okay. John Gerspach : And as we said before, we think it takes, some low to mid single \u2013 low single-digit revenue increase. We need to deliver on these expense initiatives. We've got the path to get there. I don't want to get into an absolute level of expenses. John McDonald : Okay. And John, in terms of the repositioning, unlike the legal costs, the repositioning, as you and Mike have said, are 100% in your control. So do you expect to have any repositioning in 2015? And should it be a lot lower? Could you give us any kind of sizing perspective on any additional repositioning we should expect in 2015? John Gerspach : I would never use a word like we won't have any repositioning, because we're constantly looking at the business. But it certainly shouldn't be at the level you saw in, in 2014 where we had in Citicorp something like $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion worth of repositioning costs. What we said, John, when we set up those efficiency targets, don't forget, is we said we thought that in a normal year, we would have about 200 basis points of our revenue consumed by legal and repositioning. So we certainly aren't looking to run repositioning anywhere near the level in 2015, anywhere near the level that we ran it at in 2014. John McDonald : Okay. Okay. Got it. Thanks John. John Gerspach : No problem, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning guys. My question is on the strategic actions. There's a lot of moving parts there. And you mentioned, I guess number one that you expect Citi Holdings to remain at breakeven or better next year or 2015. But we have \u2013 you're adding businesses that have been losing money. There's the pretty clear that you guys are looking to sell One Main. Is all of that contemplated in that comment? How do we think about that? John Gerspach : It's all contemplated in that comment. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Perfect. And then have you \u2013 can you guys help us a little? We can all pick our own guess on what maybe what the capital gain could be in One Main or anything else. But with all these actions, is there any kind of a way to think about the RWA reduction potential coming out of One Main, as well as the strategic changes? John Gerspach : No. One Main has about $9 billion worth of GAAP assets in it. Jim Mitchell : Right. John Gerspach : Obviously, it's higher than that on an RWA basis, but I don't want to get into the capital accretion that might come from a One Main exit. As we get closer to that, again, that's going to be dependent upon which path we go down. We're obviously working a dual path exit strategy for One Main. And so let's think about which path we actually go down and then we'll be able to talk about what the implications are. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. And maybe just one last sort of bigger picture question. You guys obviously are a global company that's been I guess a source of some fear in the market. How are you feeling about the international aspect of your business, the economies there, given what we're seeing with the volatility outside the U.S.? Has anything changed? If you look at consumer revenues in international, they are still positive, but she slowed a little bit versus 3Q and maybe that's just seasonality. You're still expecting growth. What do you see as the risk to that expectation of growth outside the U.S. and how are you thinking about it? Mike Corbat : Well, I think the balance of where growth is going to come from, with the move in oil, has probably, or most certainly shifted over the last couple of months. So I think what you've seen is revisions in terms of many of the developed economies up and some of the emerging economies, and in particular, those that are most dependent on oil export as a big part of their economy. I think when you take the aggregate of those two and add them together, you can look at the growth rates being projected that we're projecting higher growth rates in the global economy in 2015 than we had in 2014. I think when you think of, or as we think of the potential winners and losers and how that impacts our business, I would probably break the world into \u2013 or countries into one of three buckets. Those where there's a clear benefit from the reduction in terms of oil prices, those where there's a clear detriment or headwind that comes as a function of lower oil or energy prices, and then there's a bucket in the middle where it probably becomes a bit more complex. And that is where you've got different combinations of where economies overall benefit, yet you have governments that are quite dependent on oil export for revenue generation against their budgets. And so clearly, when you look across the world today, the big beneficiaries are the U.S. They are Europe. They are China, Japan, India, and you could take that list forward. You look at those that are probably most negatively affected, countries such as probably Saudi Arabia, Russia, Venezuela and Nigeria. The countries that I mentioned in terms of being positive probably account for an excess of 65% of our revenues. And you could measure that in 2013 or 2014. If you look at the companies or the countries that are most negatively affected, those countries probably constitute somewhere 2% or less than 2% of our revenues. But that being said, I think we all have to recognize that it's going to create unevenness. It's going to create some uncertainty. It's certainly going to create volatility. And I think we all need to be mindful of that. Jim Mitchell : Great. Okay. That's helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Matt O'Connor: Hi, guys. John Gerspach : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: If I could follow up on the low to mid single-digit revenue growth, just trying to better understand how you get there. I guess if the NIM's relatively stable and the balance sheet is flat to down, and obviously net interest income is about 60% of revenues how do you call it 2% to 4% of revenue growth, when half of the revenues, or more than half the revenues aren't really growing? John Gerspach : Well, you've got that revenue momentum already in the second half of the year, Matt. So when you're looking \u2013 when you're looking at it, you need to focus on the second half of the year and the momentum that we've gotten. So every one of those businesses, has both interest earning revenues and also fee earning revenues. And we are seeing growth in those businesses in both the NIM, both the near, the net interest revenue, as well as the fee components. Some of it, when you take a look at the full year numbers, it's going to be masked a bit. Don't forget when you take a look at non-interest revenues, a lot of that impact year-over-year \u2013 come from the mortgage refi boom. When you take a look at mortgage refi, that's fees, those gains that we would have gotten are in 2013 in the first half of the year. They didn't replicate this year. So year-over-year, our fee-related revenue from that is down, I don't know, 700 or so million dollars. So there's a lot of those types of items that are just buried in the results. But we're focused, we certainly are looking through the full year comparisons and looking to what we see in the businesses today as we're operating them. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, can you remind us how the foreign exchange movements impact, I guess you said it doesn't impact regulatory capital. It does impact tangible book. Just remind us if that's the right way to think about it? And then why is there a mark? Why is that something that you can't hedge, because it seems like what happened last year, the dollar strengthening is something that might continue? John Gerspach : Well, Matt, we do hedge. So let's start with P&L. P&L and we have had these discussions over the years. And there's a slide in the back of the earnings presentation. I think its Slide 26, that actually talks to \u2013 which is it? Susan Kendall : 28. John Gerspach : 28. Sorry. 28. I was off by two. That actually shows you the impact of FX on the various line items. So the dollar strengthening or weakening or different currencies strengthening and weakening has an impact on our revenue line, our expense line and our cost of credit line. However, as you can see in no individual quarter does it have what I would consider to be an outsized impact on our pretax earnings. And in fact, this quarter even with all the volatility, the net impact was close to zero. So that's, that's P&L. When it comes to capital, we do hedge our capital that's invested in foreign currencies, but we hedge it with a view towards protecting our CET 1 ratio. And that's why, when you look at how foreign exchange movements occur they not only impact your capital invested, they will impact your assets. And they will also impact some of the assets that you have, such as the intangibles that serve, then, as direct deductions against your regulatory capital base. So we factor all of that into a hedging program that, gives us fairly good results. And this quarter, with all the movement we had, the combination of our hedging program and then the natural hedges that we have resulted in a zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. However, because we do not hedge every dollar of capital, you will then have an impact through OCI on tangible book. But, if I'm going to run the company with an eye towards where do I have exposure, I want to protect my CET 1 ratio. I don't want to run an FX position through that ratio. And so in a quarter where the dollar strengthens, we may take a reduction on tangible book. But I've protected the ratio. If I go the other way, if the dollar weakens, and we have had quarters where the dollar is weakened, then I may really enjoy the impact that it has on my tangible book, but it's going to destroy my CET 1 ratio. And as you know, that is one of the key measures of regulatory strength that we have. So we think that it's really important that through our hedging program, we focus on that CET 1 ratio. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That's very helpful going through all the detail. Appreciate the color. Thanks. John Gerspach : Not a problem at all, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Guy Moszkowski with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your question. Guy Moszkowski : Thank you. Good morning. My question is very much a CCAR related one. I think to paraphrase, Michael, you have said in the past that you recognize that a qualitative path with a very, very ultra conservative capital return ask would not really be a win in your eyes. And I'm sorry if I've paraphrased you incorrectly, and go ahead and correct it. But I guess the question is, having now been through the process for this year and done the submission, is that still the way that you feel about it? Mike Corbat : I think, Guy, we are aiming for, looking for, we worked towards what we would want to be an unqualified path, both qualitatively, as well as quantitatively. I think as we've said all along, capital return is something you work towards over time. But again, we think that our capital ask is the appropriate one. And when all the results come out, we'll obviously let you be the judge of it. But we've felt given everything that it's appropriate and it's right. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. And is there any change in the way that you would sort of answer that question versus what you said, say, at a conference last month? Mike Corbat : No. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. I guess the only other question that I have today is in light of the weakening in certain emerging markets and you were very good about giving us a sense for where your revenues come from in terms of markets that are more and less affected by energy prices. But generally, given some of the weakness that we're seeing in more of those markets, what have you done on both the credit side and on the trading risk side, if anything to say increase the level of scrutiny and protection? Mike Corbat : I think you saw back beginning with Gipson, I think as different challenges around the globe in the macro economy have presented themselves. I think we've come out and tried to be very transparent with what our exposures look like. I think in this environment, you can imagine, we continue to watch Europe closely. Clearly, Russia, and we can speak to some pretty significant reductions in terms of risk in Russia. John and I had both mentioned Greece earlier. And clearly, with what I described as those economies that come under pressure either from the broad perspective of just big exporters of energy and suffering that impact or those where governments are extremely dependent on the revenues from energy to fund public and social programs, we obviously have a very close eye towards those and we think we're watching from a risk perspective very closely and monitoring that. Guy Moszkowski : Okay. That's helpful. Thank you very much. John Gerspach : Thank you, Guy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Wanted to follow up to that, which is \u2013 John Gerspach : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Oh, hi, can you hear me? John Gerspach : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So one's a follow-up to the question we just had on just the outlook for economies where they are a little bit weakish. I know you mentioned earlier in the call, Europe, EM could be weakened, even though they are beneficiaries of oil pricing. And obviously we saw a presence in those markets. So if the top line is coming in weaker than you think in some of those economies, do you have room to manage expenses down a little bit more? I know you outlined you hit the targets at year end 2015 on the expense ratio. But just wondering where you might be able to pull some resources out if the top line disappoints. John Gerspach : Betsy, as we've said, we're committed to hitting those targets. We think we've got some level of flexibility obviously, to the extent that we see certain countries or certain businesses, underperforming what the expectations are. And if our view towards the targets change at any given point in time during the year, we'll have that discussion with you. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then you mentioned at the beginning of the call about the concept of moving away from a confederation of banking organizations to a true global organization. Is the steps to get there what you outlined last quarter, which is just exit the 12 consumer businesses, or is there more to do? Mike Corbat : No. I think we said as we did that, as we looked at the exit of the 11 consumer businesses, that the remaining 24 we thought were the right mix of businesses in the right places, with the right client demographics. And so we feel that the consumer portfolio is at a point in time today where it is, it is the right portfolio, the right mix. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Just want to be clear on that. Then lastly, there's some action taken today by the Swiss Central Bank. Just wondered how you're thinking about that action and how it impacts your business. Mike Corbat : Well, I think there's a couple ways we think about it. One is a move of that magnitude and you hear a range of potential standard deviations moves, but it's big. And clearly, those types of one-off moves affect the markets in a couple different ways. One is there's P&L ramifications from the trade. I think there's also longer term ramifications from just people being surprised. There's talk out in the marketplace of \u2013 some of the high frequency traders suffering a fair amount of pain on that. We'll see how that plays itself out. And we've seen in these pockets of one-off volatility that it actually causes people to potentially pull back from the market and we see volumes abate as a result of those. We'll see, we'll see what this move does, but I think clearly, based on market reaction, it came as quite a big surprise. Betsy Graseck : Right. I mean, from a competitive perspective, there might be some opportunities for you, or no? Mike Corbat : I think there could. We are, as you know, a big player in foreign exchange. Our business in the fourth quarter actually performed quite well. We think we're well positioned. And if some of that pain is out there and people can't find their way around it or through it, I think we've got the ability to step in and potentially take share or potentially do more business as a result of that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Mayo : Hi. I think if we take your target of a 90-basis point ROA in 2015 that would imply that Citi would beat consensus expectations for 2015. So I think that's the way of saying the market doesn't believe you if. I could just go down a couple issues, especially after page 1 of your press release that 2014 was disappointing. So first, on efficiency, just to be clear, John, you have $700 million more of restructuring benefits to go. Would that be in 2015 or over a couple of years? John Gerspach : No. A bit low, Mike, not every dollar of that will be in 2015, but the vast, vast, vast majority of it will be in 2015. Mike Mayo : And is that why you guys are confident, I mean, these are big moves in global consumer efficiency from 56% down to 49% to 52% in 2015 and ICG from 59% down to 53% to 57% also in 2015. I mean, what \u2013 you're reiterating that guidance today. What gives you confidence in addition to those restructuring benefits? John Gerspach : Well, as we said, it will take \u2013 there's some revenue lift baked into at least our initial expectation. But again, it's low single-digit revenue growth. So we're not, I don't think, overreaching for that. But, 2014 was such a noisy year. And we did \u2013 it was impacted by $11 billion worth of legal and repositioning charges that I think sometimes that masks some of the progress that we actually made. If you look at 2014's results, let's take it on the operating results. And we had pretax earnings of $18.6 billion of pretax earnings. Now again, when you take a look at the Citicorp level of legal and repositioning charges that we had, that \u2013 there's over $6 billion of legal and repositioning charges that impacted Citicorp's results. That's about 900 basis points of Citicorp's revenue. So if we had been able to hold legal and repositioning to what we would consider to be the more normal level, say the 200 basis points of revenue that we would have mentioned previously, if you adjust for those two things, take out the 6, substitute in the 200 basis points, the Citicorp efficiency ratio in 2014 would have been 59% and the overall ROA for Citigroup would have been in the mid-80s. So it's not that we are that far away from the targets. Again, if you normalize for the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had this year. And therefore, we think that given those levels, the 59% efficiency ratio in Citicorp and say the mid-80s ROA for Citigroup, the combination of the steps that Mike talked about earlier, the low single-digit revenue growth, the continued delivery on the expense reduction actions, the careful attention to the balance sheet, all of those things should get us, and keeping Holdings at or above breakeven should be enough to get us to the \u2013 to both the goals that we laid out. Mike Mayo : That partly begs the question. You said you had $3.1 billion of repositioning charges over the last nine quarters. You had another big hit in the fourth quarter. How much more should we expect of these repositioning charges? John Gerspach : We don't expect to be talking to you next year about significant levels of repositioning. Mike Mayo : Okay. As it relates to project Rainbow, which does tie into efficiency and also going from a confederation to a global firm, how far away are you guys in having your systems connect and finishing project Rainbow, which really stretches back long time? John Gerspach : Mike, we are \u2013 as we've talked on these calls in some of the forums before, Rainbow is, due for delivery in completion. Again, it's not a one-and-done. We've been continuing to bring countries on, but it's a 2016, largely a 2016 completion date. Mike Mayo : And then lastly, again, the math works. We can all, work this out on paper, but then it comes down to execution. Mike, especially after what you called a disappointing 2014 or results below expectations, is this the right team on the field? And I ask that because there have not been really major management changes despite some of the shortfalls. And we know what those were. But how do you think about the team you have on the field? John Gerspach : I feel very good about the team on the field. As you and I have spoken, we've spoken before on the CCAR. At the end of the day, that's my responsibility and I look at these other things that we're trying to work and put behind us from legal issues, to continuing to shape and exit businesses and use repositioning to drive costs out of the firm. I think we've got the right team that's focused on delivering on our targets and delivering on behalf of our shareholders. Mike Mayo : All right. I guess it's a different story if you were not to pass the fed stress test. Is that fair? John Gerspach : I'll let the Board be the judge of that. Mike Mayo : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. I appreciate -- John Gerspach : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello. I appreciate the earlier answer when you spelled out the different markets and revenues associated with the beneficiaries and the losers in the oil tug of war. Just curious, how different would those percentages look if we talked about it as a percentage of exposures versus revenues? Do they match up or are they pretty different? Mike Corbat : It's, it's interesting that I pulled these a while back, but if you look, I talked about the four countries I spoke to, Saudi, Russia, Venezuela, Nigeria, which at the end constitute and again, you can go back and look over a number of years pretty consistently somewhere 2 to \u2013 just under 2% of our revenue. They actually, in each of those years as I went back and looked, as a percentage of our end-of-period loans are actually slightly below those percentages on a year end basis, or end-of-period basis. So again, those countries that I just talked about would probably have end-of-period loan balances of less than 1.5% of our outstandings. Glenn Schorr : Great. Thank you. Just a quickie on CCAR. Did you remediate all the MRAs from last year? I know that was one of the contributing factors from the prior year. So I'm assuming you had a playbook that they said fixed all this stuff. Were you able to address all the MRAs? Mike Corbat : We certainly worked to address all the MRAs. The fed will be the ultimate judge as to whether or not the MRAs were in fact remediated. Glenn Schorr : Got it. In other words, it's not a black and white answer. So I've asked this of the other banks. I do want to get your color. Your disclosure on energy-related exposures is very broad. I think it includes petroleum, energy, chemicals, metals. Can we talk more specifically on what you would deem oil-related and how it breaks down in terms of investment grade, non-investment grade, collateralized, things like that? John Gerspach : Yes, Glenn. We're going to provide more in-depth information on this topic at next week's fixed income investor review. We'll lay things out for you pretty clearly, but just to get the conversation started, we've got roughly $60 billion of combined funded and unfunded ICG exposure to energy companies. That's including those classified as energy in that conglomeration that you mentioned, PECM, as well as energy-related clients in other disclosed segments. And that $60 billion amounts to about 11% of corporate ICG exposures, just to give you a frame of reference. And as with the rest of our book, the exposure is predominantly investment grade. Certainly over 80%, and as we keep on saying, it's reflecting the focus that we have on large multinational corporations, including the global integrated energy companies. From a geographic point of view, about three quarters of the exposure is in developed markets and the largest exposures there would be in North America and the U.K. And roughly 35% of the exposure represents funded loans. So the ICG has just over $20 billion of funded exposure to energy and energy-related companies. It represents funded exposure. I've moved to funded exposure. And that represents roughly 3% of our total funded loans. And again, about 80% of the funded loans are investment grade. So that gives you a fairly good overview, I think, of the portfolio. Again, $60 billion investment grade, predominantly investment grade, 80% investment grade. Three quarters of the book in developed country most of that North America, U.K. Glenn Schorr : Definitely helpful. I appreciate it. Last one, you commented in FX is pretty good, given the volatility. Rates I think was pretty good in general. And those two businesses are bigger pieces of business for you. And you commented the softness is in credit and munis, as you paraphrase facilitating client flow in times of stress. I know this is a hard one and I know you're not alone here. I thought with your business mix you might have had better or less performance down in FIC given your mix. Is facilitation \u2013 were there large losses associated with that in this type of environment? Or is it a volume thing? How much can we attribute to inventories? I was just scratching my head a little bit on how that contributes to weakness. John Gerspach : The biggest impact that we had year-over-year, Glenn, really is in the spread products business. So and that really is a result of taking marks on inventory positions that we've got to support the customers. And again, I don't think, as you just said, I don't think that we're alone there. We do have probably a slightly different mix than, than many of our other competitors, but even within there, we've got a fairly large muni book, probably a little bit larger than with some of the other banks would have. And so that certainly adds then to the results that we're getting out of the spread products. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate all the answers. Thanks. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brennan Hawken : Good afternoon. John Gerspach : Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : Following up on the question there from Glenn on exposures with oil, when we look at the last few years in DCM volumes in the energy business, looks like you guys have a bit more bigger market share there. Is there any reason why that wouldn't be a bit of a headwind for your DCM business here if we assume that there's a slowdown in energy-related issuance? John Gerspach : Some of these things will certainly have impact. I would say that global energy has certainly been a robust area for the last four years and clearly, our investment banking franchise, as with other institutions, has seen significant growth in episodic business as a result from that sector. And you're going to have some impact for lower, lower commodity prices and lower equity valuations. That is certainly going to have an impact on equity offerings and IPOs. But energy, energy is a broad business, and some sectors are going to be impacted more than others. And so we continue to see bust activity in some sectors where we're a leader, and I think you'll see the upstream in the energy services sector certainly see significantly less activity. So we'll just see how the whole mix continues. Brennan Hawken : Okay. All right, thanks. And then shifting gears to Mexico, there was some noise and speculation, color in the market on Banamex and the fact that there would be a bunch of bidders for it and such. Is that \u2013 is the reason for that noise because you all were having dialogue? Or is this just from companies hoping to bid for an asset if it happens to come on the market? Mike Corbat : We rarely comment on things. And in that case, we felt compelled to go out and comment and say that we are not a seller of Banamex. And I don't think we can be any more clear about that on these calls and in the forums. I've spoken directly to it and the importance of the franchise and why we're so constructive on our position in Mexico and why we think Banamex is the right way to express that in Mexico. So we have a terrific franchise. We're committed to it. And we think there's very good things ahead coming out of that business. Brennan Hawken : That's clear. Thanks. And then in equities, right, I know you guys called out the weak cash revenues in EMEA. But was there anything else behind the equities' weakness? Also, more broadly, is there maybe an updated plan for the equities business because it does seem like there's a pretty regular stumble in that business, whether it's derivatives or in this case EMEA or what have you. How do you feel about it currently and where do you want to take it in the next couple years? John Gerspach : We're committed to the equities business. And this has been a business that we have spent a lot of time working on. And I think the \u2013 outside of EMEA, this quarter we've actually got performance that shows the progress that we've made. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, excluding the performance in EMEA, the rest, we had 24% revenue growth year-over-year, in every other region, North America, Latin America, Asia all saw double-digit growth. It's not that there's just one region that's driving the action here. This is a good franchise. We have an issue with our equities franchise in one region. And we have certainly begun to take actions there. We've made management changes, beginning in the late second half of 2014 and we do expect that region to be a much better performer in 2015. Brennan Hawken : And given the fact that it was so strong in other regions, were there some sort of risk management or facilitation losses there, or was it purely just volume-driven? John Gerspach : No, it's a combination. We had volumes, and we had strong performance in some of our equity derivatives business. Asia had a very good performance in equity derivatives this year for one in the quarter. So did Latin America. So it was pretty broad-based good performance. Again, the one difference would be \u2013 the one exception to that would be in EMEA. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then last one for me, you gave some helpful color on the fact that ICG expenses, you took down the incentive comp. But there was an offsetting assumption to the deferral, deferred comp piece. Could you maybe give us a little bit more color on those changes? Was that tied to repositioning that you guys are planning? Or is it a change in the timing of the deferral schedule? Are you shifting to more cash oriented comp? What's driving that? John Gerspach : No. It's a combination of factors, as so many other things are. And as you go through the year, you make assumptions both on the absolute, the dollar level of deferred comp that you're going to have. And don't forget, every country has got some slightly different rules. We also need to make assumptions based upon the level of forfeiture that we'll have coming out of deferred comp as people leave. And, we've got \u2013 we had slightly less turnover this year, in the non \u2013 outside of the actions, of course, that we instigated. So we had to change the view that we had towards the forfeiture percentages and as well as the absolute amount of deferred comp that we were going to have. And so all of that we cleaned up in the fourth quarter. Brennan Hawken : Got it. Thanks for the color. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Steven Duong : Hi, everyone. This is actually Steven Duong in for Gerard. Just starting out on the credit, where do you guys see your net charge-offs going in 2015? And what would be the drivers of that? John Gerspach : I don't want to get into any individual line item forecasts. Obviously, what we said in the prepared remarks is that the cost of credit is likely to increase. That's going to come from a combination of both. We're likely to have slightly higher NCLs. I can't tell you \u2013 just as we continue to grow the book, it's not because we see credit quality weakening anywhere. And we continue to benefit this year from loan loss reserve releases and that is certainly likely to lessen next year. So the combination of those two items will largely cause an increase in our actual reported costs of credit. But we don't see any diminution in the credit quality of the portfolio. Steven Duong : Okay, great. Thank you. And just switching over to Volcker Rule on trading. Volcker Rule's been here since July. Are you guys seeing your traders maybe being a little more cautious so that they are not doing any prop trading? And just a follow-up to that, where do you see the Volcker Rule impacting liquidity in the fixed income markets? Mike Corbat : I think Steven \u2013 it's Mike. We haven't been a proprietary skewed institution for a long time. And so I would say no, that we really haven't seen those impacts, that ours is predominantly a client-facing organization. I think ways that you're going to see \u2013 I think we've already seen it manifesting itself probably comes in the form of liquidity, that there's just things we're not in or there's types of trades we're not going to do, and in times of market disruption, I think the buy side finds it quite difficult to find liquidity in certain types of assets or in certain asset classes. And I think that's a reality of some of those changes. And so again, we've talked a bit about that we're probably going to see heightened periods of volatility as a result of that. I think you're going to see more price fluctuations around certain types of asset classes as I think bank and broker balance sheets have become more refined and defined in terms of what they do, and I think that just manifests itself in just less liquidity. Steven Duong : Great, thank you. And just last question, can you remind us in your Citi Holdings, how much of your home equity book goes to full amortization of the principle and interest in 2015 and 2016? John Gerspach : We will update those disclosures when we publish the Q, but it's roughly $4 billion of HELOCs that become fully amortizing in 2015. And then I think there's $5 billion that go fully amortizing in 2016 and again in 2017. Steven Duong : Okay, great. And just looking back at \u2013 in 2014, even though that's not that large, but, have you guys seen any \u2013 what the early credit metrics have been on home equity book? John Gerspach : You mean as far as the home equity loans that that have gone to full amortization or just in general? Steven Duong : Correct. Yes, just the full amortization portion. John Gerspach : Just the full amortization portion. They have been fairly consistent with the results that we've gotten for that over the last couple of years. Slightly higher levels of delinquencies, slightly higher NCL rate. Everything is either on track with or slightly better than the assumptions that we have built into our loan loss reserve model. Steven Duong : Great. Well, that's all our questions. Thank you again. John Gerspach : Not a problem, Steven. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your questions. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. I'll follow up offline. Thanks, John. John Gerspach : Okay, Eric. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : I had a quick question on the revenue growth targets that you gave out there for Citicorp. What's the trading revenue growth assumptions that you have built into those targets? I mean if trading revenues decline year-over-year, can you still hit that revenue growth target? John Gerspach : What we've said, at least what I think I said in the prepared remarks was that our trading markets will perform in line with the market. And so, we're not, we're not giving any view towards what trading revenues will or won't do in 2015. So we're expecting \u2013 as we said, we had basically flat revenues on those businesses in the second half of this year compared to the second half of last year. We'll see how 2015 goes. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just one thing in the North America cards. You've mentioned for a couple years ago that the runoff of promotional balances has been a headwind. Is there any way you can size what that promotional balance as a percentage of the total or may be say that when you expect to actually what quarter kind of the headwind will be? John Gerspach : No. We haven't talked to that publicly. And I quite frankly, I don't have those numbers right in front of me right now anyway. It's not going to continue forever, but I just don't have it. Sorry. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. John Gerspach : Sorry. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question. Steven Chubak : John, I just wanted to clarify something that you had mentioned relating to the efficiency target of 55%. One of the things that -- John Gerspach : Hold it, hold it, Steven, Steven, Steven. Steven Chubak : Yes. John Gerspach : Mid-50s. Steven Chubak : Mid-50s, okay. I suppose after applying all the adjustments that you had talked about relating to the strategic actions on a pro forma basis, contemplating some of the restructuring benefits, the majority of the $700 million that you alluded to, I still get to about a mid single-digit revenue growth number. And I suppose is the growth \u2013 the low single digits that you're referring to, is that off of the reported revenue base from this past year, is it a pro forma revenue base, which should include some revenue attrition as you exit some of those non-core businesses? John Gerspach : It would be a low single-digit growth off of where we performed in 2014. You can pro forma \u2013 I'm not going to go into every \u2013 I can't help you with your model, Steven. Steven Chubak : I guess the low single digits seems reasonably conservative, but if you have all the pro forma actions that are taken to drive that improvement in the efficiency target, it feels as though the revenue growth actually needs to be a little bit better than that. I just wanted to confirm whether that was the appropriate way to think about it or not. John Gerspach : No, I don't think so. Steven Chubak : Okay. Then just one more for me on a topic that's garnered some attention in the press relating to the growth in your derivatives book, at least through the first nine months of 2014. I actually wanted to just inquire as to whether you're managing that \u2013 how \u2013 I guess how much more growth you can support or whether one of the important considerations we should have is the potential risk that the growth and derivatives book over the last nine months could potentially move you into a higher adjacent bucket, based on the inputs that have just come out from the fed. John Gerspach : Yes. All very good questions, but first, let's start with the fact that what everyone's been focused on is not the growth in our book, but the growth in notionals. And notionals, as you well know, really are not any sort of measure really of risk or necessarily of counter party engagement, net counter party engagement. It's a reference sum on which then other things are calculated. So we have been working to compress the trades and what you'll see when we publish results at the end of the fourth quarter is a reduction in the reported amount of gross notionals. Those are the notionals that we had at the end of the third quarter I believe were about 65 trillion of notionals. And that's being reduced now to 60. Steven Chubak : Okay. Actually, that's really helpful. Thank you for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem at all. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just one follow-up and then I'll jump offline. But John, I just wanted to confirm some of the numbers you were saying before in terms of the cost reductions that are currently in the fourth quarter run rate from the repositioning exercise, were 700 million. That's not 700 million of incremental cost benefit. That's what's currently in the run rate right now, with another 150 to come over the next year-plus. Is that how we should be thinking about it? John Gerspach : More or less, yes. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks very much. I'll jump offline for my other questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Erika Najarian : Yes. Just one quick one for me. As the full CCAR process is now behind you, do you feel that the feedback that you've got \u2013 the specific feedback that you got on the steps you have to take in order to remedy what the fed is looking for on the qualitative side, was it more robust and specific this year versus last year's process? Mike Corbat : Well, I think first, Erika, I would say that the CCAR process is never behind you, right, that the CCAR process is just part of what we do and how we run the firm. So we in essence put a submission in, but the process continues and obviously us wanting to continue to improve and continue to embed. I would say that we had terrific engagement from the fed at every level, from our onsite team to the horizontal work teams to Washington and so I think that the communication was quite good. And, again, at the end of the day, our submission is our submission, but we feel like the communication is good and we felt that we knew what it was we needed to do and obviously, we felt like that we've accomplished what it was we set out to do, but more to do as we go into the future and I think as I said in my opening remarks, I feel good about our submission. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is a follow-up from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. John McDonald : I'm all set. Asked and answered. Thanks. John Gerspach : Hey, great, John. Thanks. Operator : And we have no further questions at this time. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please follow up with Investor Relations and we'll talk to you soon. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectation, and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Susan, thank you. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.52 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we accomplished a great deal by executing against our top strategic priorities. We tightly managed our expenses, helping to achieve positive operating leverage in Citicorp, and we're on track to hit our financial targets for the year. Citi Holdings was profitable again, earning a $149 million. We also announced the sales of the largest business remaining in holdings, OneMain, as well as our credit cards business in Japan, and our consumer business in Nicaragua. We have now signed deals to divest over $30 billion of the remaining assets in Citi Holdings, which were already reduced 19% over the last four quarters. After utilizing $3.3 billion of our deferred tax asset during 2014, we utilized another $1.2 billion of DTA during the first quarter. This helped Citi generate $5.3 billion in regulator capital during the quarter, helping increase our common equity Tier 1 ratio to 11% on a fully implemented Basel III basis, and increase our supplementary leverage ratio to 6.4%. The Fed did not object to our capital plan, so we can now begin meaningful capital return to our shareholders. This reflects the improvements we made in our capital planning process, as we build a safer and stronger institution. We continued the transformation of our credit cards business, setting us up for growth in the U.S. with the Costco announcement, and solidifying an important global relationship with MasterCard. We've simplified our products, improved our technology, brought in new talent, and have built a solid foundation to invest in. While some businesses, such as markets in international consumer faced revenue headwinds, we had solid overall performance from our core business during the quarter. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, and gained wallet share among our target clients. In ICG, our banking business had a very good quarter, led by investment banking in the private bank, and treasury and trade solutions revenues were up as well in constant dollars. In markets, as we previously disclosed, we saw a slow start to the year in parts of fixed income, including credit, but our rates and currencies franchise continued to see strong client activity, and equities was roughly flat to last year. Our U.S. consumer business posted good performance, driven by growth in retail banking, and international consumer revenues were flat, but loans, deposits, and purchase sales all continued to grow, and some of the headwinds in that business should abate as we go through the year. While I'm pleased with our first quarter accomplishments, the environment, both macro-economically and legally remains very challenging. Interest rates remain low, economic growth is uneven, and market sentiment lacks conviction. That highlights the need for us to continue simplifying our company by focusing on our target clients and markets, while driving our finite resources to where they can generate the best risk adjusted returns. Regarding our capital planning, we're committed to building on our progress to ensure we have a sustainable process that satisfies the expectations we place on our institution; a bank with unique global reach. We recognize the need to keep strengthening the CCAR process, and are continuing to invest in our compliance and regulatory functions. Overall, we expect to reach a headcount of 30,000 people in these functions by year end, and as an example, we're very focused on resolution planning, and have 600 people dedicated to it. We're maintaining discipline across our company, whether it pertains to our balance sheet, risk management, and expenses in light of the environment. I believe we have the right people in the right jobs to meet these challenges and our targets. As you may know, Steven Bird will succeed Manuel Medina-Mora as Head of Global Consumer Bank. Francisco Aristeguieta will follow him as CEO of Asia, and Jane Fraser will replace him as CEO of Latin America, including Mexico. Between them, these three Citi veterans have been in our company for nearly 50 years, and reflect our deep bench talent. I also want to acknowledge the contributions of Brian Leach, who is retiring from Citi at the end of the month. He's worked practically non-stop for the firm over the past nine years, and I know we would not be where we are today without him. John will now go through the deck, and then we'll be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I'd like to highlight a couple of items; CVA/DVA, and a prior period tax change that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned $1.52 per share in the recent quarter, compared to $1.30 in the first quarter of 2014. On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $4.8 billion, generating a return on assets of 105 basis points, and a return on tangible common equity of 11%. Net income grew by over $660 million year-over-year, with about one-third coming from our core improvement in Citicorp, and two-thirds attributable to lower legal and related expenses in Citi Holdings. Revenues declined on a reported basis to $19.8 billion, but increased slightly year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by modest growth in Citicorp. Expenses declined 10% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses improved, offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year to $621 billion, as growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings. Deposits also decreased 3%, driven by Citi Holdings, including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held-for-sale in the fourth quarter of last year. On Slide 5, we provide more detail on first quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up 2% year-over-year, driven by North America retail banking, and continued strength in our institutional banking franchise, partially offset by lower markets revenues. This growth in Citicorp was partially offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings, mostly reflecting continued asset reductions. On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses. In total, Citigroup expenses declined 6% year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by a significant decline in legal and related costs in Citi Holdings. Citicorp expenses grew 1% year-over-year as growth related expenses and higher regulatory and compliance costs were partially offset by efficiency savings. On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp net income grew 5% year-over-year in the first quarter. As I just described, we generated positive operating leverage in Citicorp, with 2% growth in revenues, and 1% growth in expense in constant dollars, and we achieved an operating efficiency ratio of 54%. Turning to Citi Holdings; we were profitable again this quarter, with nearly $150 million in net income, compared to a loss of roughly $290 million last year, driven mostly by the lower legal and related expenses. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with $122 billion of assets, or 7% of total Citigroup assets. On Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars; revenues were roughly flat year-over-year in the first quarter, reflecting modest volume growth, offset by spread compression, ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets, and the impact of prior period asset sales. In Latin America, we grew revenues in Mexico on higher loan and deposit balances, as well as a rebound in card purchase sales. However, this growth was offset by the impact of prior period divestitures in other markets. In Asia, we saw modest growth in our retail banking franchise, and wealth management revenues were stable year-over-year. However, card revenues declined as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. In total, average loans grew 3% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 7%, and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 2%, as the impact of volume growth and higher regulatory and compliance costs were mostly offset by ongoing efficiency savings. Credit costs declined from last year, driven by a modest net reserve release. Slide 9, shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Net income grew 12% year-over-year, on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by a lower net reserve release, and the impact of a tax benefit in the prior year period. Pretax earnings grew 21% from last year. Total revenues were up 4%. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 18% from last year, reflecting continued loan and deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity, and improved deposit spreads. This quarter's results include a gain of roughly $110 million on the sale of our Texas branches, as compared to a gain of $70 million last year, on a sale/leaseback transaction. Branded Cards revenues of $2 billion were down slightly from last year as growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans, mostly driven by the runoff of promotional rate balances, and higher payment rates. Retail Service revenues grew slightly from last year on higher average loans, and improved spreads, partially offset by contractual partner payments. Total expenses declined 6%, driven by ongoing efficiency savings, as well as lower legal and repositioning costs. We continue to resize our North America retail banking business in the first quarter, while also growing our average deposits, loans, and assets under management. Since the beginning of 2014, we have sold or closed nearly 200 branches in North America. We are focused on deepening relationships with our target clients in urban areas. Today, roughly 90% of our footprint is concentrated around seven key markets. While average deposits grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter, checking account balances grew 10%, and assets under management grew 7%. Today, our average deposit balance per branch is roughly $218 million, up over 20% from a year ago. Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, credit remained favourable in the first quarter. In North America and Asia, trends remained stable to improving; and in Latin America, the NCL rate increased somewhat from last quarter on a normalized basis, however, the delinquency rate continue to improve, which we expect to result in lower NCL rates later in the year. Slide 11 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 55%, including over 200 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. In the first quarter, these charges were minimal, and the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 52.6%, down from nearly 55% in the first quarter of last year. We currently expect to improve the total consumer efficiency ratio to 52% or below for the full year of 2015. Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 12; revenues of $9.1 billion in the first quarter were down slightly from last year and up 27% sequentially. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion grew 4% from last year, and 3% from the prior quarter. Treasury and trade solution revenues of $1.9 billion were down 2% versus prior period on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 4% from last year, as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 14% from last year, and 12% sequentially, driven by strong M&A and debt underwriting activity partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private bank revenues of $708 million grew 6% year-over-year, driven by higher client volumes and growth in capital markets products, and corporate lending revenues were $445 million, up 7% from last year on higher average loans and improved fair value marks. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.8 billion declined 6% year-over-year and grew 62% sequentially. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by spread products partially offset by growth in rates and currencies. As we previously disclosed, we saw a slow start in spread products this year as compared to a strong first quarter last year, with lower activity levels across distressed credit, non-investment grades CLOs, and municipals. We did see strong client activity in investment grade credit; however, these flows tend to come at lower spreads. Turning to rates and currencies, client flows were very strong this quarter in both G10 and local markets, driven in part by Central Bank actions and a pickup in FX volatility. Excluding the modest loss we incurred on the Swiss franc revaluation, rates and currencies revenues would have improved by greater than 20% from last year. Equities revenues of $873 million declined 1% year-over-year, as growth in prime finance was offset by lower cash equity revenues. Sequentially, revenues grew 86% on seasonally higher activity and improved trading performance in EMEA. In security services, revenues were up 12% year-over-year and 7% sequentially, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operating expenses of $4.6 billion declined 5%, driven by FX translations, lower legal and repositioning expenses, and ongoing efficiency savings, partially offset by higher regulatory and compliance costs. On Slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. Over the last 12 months, our efficiency ratio was 57%, including roughly a 140 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges; and our comp ratio was 28%. Currently expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015. Slide 14 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues were down slightly year-over-year, while total operating expenses increased, driven by higher legal and repositioning charges. On a sequential basis, revenues improved, driven by hedging activities as well as the absence of losses from the sale of available-for-sale securities. And expenses were down as more regulatory and compliance costs were absorbed directly by the businesses. Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings' assets, which totaled $122 billion at quarter end, including $31 billion of assets, which had been reported in Citicorp until this quarter. Over the past few months we've made great progress in divesting these and other assets in Citi Holdings, including the announced sales of our consumer businesses in Japan, Peru, and Nicaragua, as well as OneMain Financial. We expect these sales to close this year, totaling roughly $32 billion of assets, and we have several other active sales processes underway. On Slide 16, we show Citi Holdings' financial results for the quarter. A significant reduction in legal and related expenses drove most of the earnings improvement year-over-year. Total revenues of $1.8 billion were down 7%, while core operating expenses fell by 13%, reflecting the continued wind down of the portfolio. And credit cards improved as lower net credit losses were partially offset by a lower net reserve release. On Slide 17, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has begun to shrink. Our net interest margin remained flat sequentially at 292 basis points in the first quarter, and was up slightly from a year ago on improved funding costs. In the second quarter, we expect our net interest margin to decline perhaps by two to three basis points similar to the trend we've seen in prior years. Looking to the second half of the year, our results will depend in part on the timing of divestitures, including OneMain and our Japanese retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly seven to eight basis points before using any part of the associated gains to redeem high cost debt. On Slide 18, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented Basel III basis. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to 11%, driven by retained earnings, and approximately $1.2 billion of DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.4%, and our tangible book value grew to $57.66 per share. In summary, we delivered solid results in the first quarter with modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, significantly lowered legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends. We continue to wind down Citi Holdings in an economically rational manner including several announced divestitures that we expect to close by year end. And we also strengthened our capital position, ending the quarter with a CET 1 ratio of 11%, and a supplementary leverage ratio of 6.4%. On a full year basis, we remain committed to delivering our financial targets, including a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid-50s, and as Citigroup return on assets of at least 90 basis points. In Citicorp, we continue to expect modest revenue growth in 2015. In consumer, we saw healthy growth in North America retail banking this quarter, as volumes continued to grow and deposit spreads improved. However, international consumer revenues were flat year-over-year. This trend should improve somewhat as we progress through the year, driven by continued volume growth, as we expect the pace of regulatory change and spread headwinds to abate in certain markets. Turning to our institutional franchise, we saw good momentum this quarter across corporate lending, investment banking, treasury and trade solutions, security services and the private bank. Together, these businesses represent over half of our institutional revenues, and should continue to grow this year with some quarterly fluctuations. And in markets, we expect our performance in 2015 to reflect the overall environment with a goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients. In Citi Holdings, we remain focused on winding down the portfolio, while staying above breakeven on a full year basis. Overall, we continue to expect credit cards to increase in 2015, driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases. And we expect to keep balance sheet discipline, staying at or below our current size. Our first quarter results provide a solid start to 2015, better demonstrating our underlying earnings power and the impact of the actions we've taken to simplify and streamline our operations. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead with your question. John McDonald : Hi, good morning, John. I had a question on the expenses. In terms of the core expenses, trying to get a sense of how much of your cost saves you achieved this quarter are reflected in the core operating expense, somewhere at the $10.8 billion? Or I guess another way of asking, is that number sustainable and a good jumping-off point for expenses from here? John Gerspach : Yes, John, as we ended the fourth quarter of 2014, I think what we told you then is that all the repositioning actions that we had taken during the previous nine quarters we expected to generate cost savings, annual cost savings of about $3.4 billion. And as of the fourth quarter of last year, about $2.7 billion of those cost saves were already embedded in our expense base. That left about $700 billion of annual saves to realize then during 2015. And in the first quarter we generated an additional -- just over $200 million of that remaining $700 million. So we've got some more to go this year, but we feel pretty good about the level of expenses that we're currently running at. John McDonald : Okay. And is the first quarter typically high on expenses because of the seasonality of the investment bank revenues? John Gerspach : No, we don't -- I wouldn't say it's typically higher in the first quarter, it's a little bit higher maybe in the first quarter, but pretty much, expenses stay fairly consistent during the course of the year, again depending on certain fluctuations or episodic items. You saw at the end of last year we had some expense growth associated with our focus on CCAR. So those items do give us some quarterly fluctuations, but again, I think the first quarter is a pretty good jumping-off point for the rest of the year. John McDonald : Okay. And then, could you also just clarify the comments about the NIM, and then interest margin in the second half of the year, John. You're selling some businesses now have an impact on NIM, but it sounded like there might be some actions you could take to mitigate that? John Gerspach : Yes, well, John, what we said even in the earnings release that -- not in the earnings release, even in the press release that we put out in connection with signing the deal for OneMain Financial is that our intent is to invest some of the gains that we get from that sale to redeem high cost debt that are used to fund the businesses. Redeeming that, that high cost debt will then serve to improve the NIM, somewhat mitigate the impact of the NIM loss from OneMain. John McDonald : Okay. And just on a related point to that, John, I was hoping I could ask Mike a question in terms of the CCAR. Mike, you passed the CCAR, I presume you've heard back from regulators in terms of how you did, and maybe new MRA. Could you share any thoughts on what kind of feedback you received and what you'd work on for next submission? And then related to OneMain, is it too early to ask if the OneMain transaction goes through as planned, would you consider maybe making an off cycle request to add on to your existing approval, with an update for capital that might get released when OneMain goes away? A - Mike Corbat : Sure, John. Starting with CCAR, I think it was -- first off, I should preface it by saying that not only we believe the industry or the submitting banks haven't yet received formal response in terms of feedback, and so we've gotten verbal response, but I would categorize the responses we've received so far as having put a lot of work into it, made a tremendous amount of progress, but on an industry basis the large SIFI banks have more work to do. We've recognized we have more work to do, and we view 2015 as an important year to do that. And Barbara Besoer, and the team are obviously committed to doing that. From a OneMain perspective, it's early in the year. I would say, we're not big fans of going through the processes of one-offs, but let's get through the year and see how things go, and we'll make a decision at some point later in the year. John McDonald : Okay. And the timing, expected timing, just as an update on OneMain? A - Mike Corbat : Second quarter -- I'm sorry, third quarter, John. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning guys. A - John Gerspach : Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a question on the big jump in the SLR, that seems to imply, if my math is right, that you made some progress on the denominator. I guess, first, is that the case? And does that have also positive implications for the Tier 1 leverage in CCAR when we think about next year, or is that just purely an SLR phenomenon? A - John Gerspach : No, it's primarily focused on SLR, and we did make progress in reducing the denominator of SLR, that will have knock-on effects against other ratios. And again, it's just something that we are focused on. It's against all categories of the various SLR computation. And so it does have knock-on effects for other calculations. Jim Mitchell : Do you think there's more to go there? A - John Gerspach : Well, we're always looking to optimize. I feel pretty good about where we are right now, at 6.4%, but we'll always strive to run the most efficient balance sheet that we can. Jim Mitchell : Yep. Fair enough. Maybe just a follow-up question on fixed income; you guys, and I think some others have mentioned a slow start, particularly in spread products. Maybe if you can give us a sense, you've disclosed the [indiscernible] rates and effects as a bigger proportion of your business, and some others you had a competitor today show significant, or decent year-over-year growth in FIC despite arguably a lower concentration in FX and rates and a similar decline in spread products. So I'm just trying to get a sense, was it really the issue with the Swiss franc, or just had a particularly bad, tough time in spread products; just trying to get a sense why we wouldn't have seen a little bit more of a improved result there? A - John Gerspach : Yes, well, Jim, as you know, I mean when you're trying to do growth rates, or you're trying to do anything year-on-year, you have to look at the composition of both periods. Jim Mitchell : Sure A - John Gerspach : And so, if you go back to the first quarter of '14 that was on a relative basis compared to our peers, a very strong quarter for our FIC businesses. It was especially strong for us in spread products. The first quarter of '14 gives us a tough comp. Spread products, historically, have accounted for about 40% of our FIC revenues, but if I look back to the first quarter of '14, spread product revenues was significantly above that level. Then, if look at the current quarter, year-over-year, our spread products' revenues are down significantly. They're down significantly to the point where the revenues per spread products this year are below the historical percentage that we would normally expect them to be of our total FIC business. So it's been a significant impact on us. And I mentioned some of the underlying factors during the prepared comments; lower activity levels across the distressed credit, as well as non-investment grade CLOs, and munis [ph]. So these are what I would call, \"Normal fluctuations,\" that you would expect in an uncertain rate environment, and just reflective of the lack of distressed opportunities. Rates and currencies, just to segue over, rates and currencies benefited from extremely strong customer flows throughout the quarter, especially in our FX business. And that's why we said that, excluding the reval impact that we had, the modest loss stemming from the Swiss franc, rates and currencies revenues would have been up over 20% compared to the first quarter of '14. So I characterize the first quarter of '15 as a strong quarter for rates and currencies -- our rates and currencies franchise, but a down quarter for spread products. It's exacerbated by a tough comp backed [ph] to an extremely strong 2014. Jim Mitchell : That's all fair. I appreciate the color. Just any more color on how things progress throughout the quarter. You mentioned as slow start, does that imply that things got better each month, progressive month? A - John Gerspach : It was a slow start and things evened out during the course of the quarter, but I wouldn't say that we finished with a big upswing in spread products. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Thanks for all the color. A - John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. A - John Gerspach : Hi, Matt. A - Mike Corbat : Good morning. Matt O'Connor: Just from a consolidated point of view, if we look at net interest income, it was down about $500 million versus last quarter, is that mostly the impact of FX and day count? A - John Gerspach : Matt, I missed you. I'm sorry, there was -- what was down, 500 million; I'm sorry? Matt O'Connor: Sure. If you look at consolidated net interest income dollars, they were down about 500 million Q-Q? A - John Gerspach : Q-on-Q, well, don't forget there is a two-day impact. The fourth quarter has got 92 days in it; the first quarter has 90 days. Matt O'Connor: Right, and I assume some FX impact in there as well or\u2026 A - John Gerspach : There's going to be some impact on that as well. You can see the -- on a constant dollar basis, you can see the comparison in net interest revenue per day on slide 17, and as you can see on a per day basis, fourth quarter on constant dollars, first quarter net interest revenue is spot on with the net interest revenue that we had in the fourth quarter of last year. Matt O'Connor: Okay then in terms of the outlook, I mean, you gave me some color on the NIM down a couple of bits potentially in 2Q, but we should pick up a day, and then some balance sheet growth, so those net II dollars should be up, I guess, as we think about 1Q to 2Q? A - John Gerspach : I hate to get that deep into it, Matt. The expectation is that NIM is going to be down, as it has been every second quarter for the last couple of years, down two to three basis points. There's a certain amount of seasonality in that. You can see though, again, if you look back, as far as our net interest revenue per day, it stays pretty constant. So that's more of a denominator factor than anything else. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then maybe a bigger-picture question on Mexico. I know, it was a couple of years ago, there had been some de- risking there in terms of the credit profile. And then more recently, some control issues had been flagged. Just where are we, and, obviously, there's that change of management as well. How are you feeling on Mexico overall in terms of, both the new leadership that you have there, and as well as the strategy from the fundamentals? A - John Gerspach : Matt, I would say we feel quite good. As you referenced, we made some material changes to management leadership in Mexico, both from an operations and from a control perspective and feel like we've got the right people in place. We did fairly broad-sweeping reviews of our control processes in Mexico. And as we've said, as a company, we are extremely bullish on the economic prospects of Mexico, and Banamex's position in terms of helping to fuel that growth for the country. We see a lot of opportunity in Mexico. Matt O'Connor: Okay, just lastly if I can squeeze in. I assume you can't tell us anything more on the Costco deal than what's out there, but anything on the timing in terms of when you'll have more details to share? A - John Gerspach : No, Matt. That will happen during the ensuing couple of quarters and we'll put those details out when they are available. Matt O'Connor: Okay, all right, thanks for taking the questions. A - John Gerspach : All right, thanks, Matt. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead with your question. Glenn Schorr : Hello there, thanks. So I liked the improvement on the efficiency ratio targets, and liked the commitment to the target ranges. Just a quick, curious question on -- I don't think of you as the biggest rate beneficiary, but it helps, but what type of rate scenario do you have embedded in there, or I like your tone from last quarter of, we're going to hit them, one way or another. A - John Gerspach : Yes. You know Matt, as we -- not Matt, Glenn; sorry. You just overwhelmed me with what you liked, and I was focusing on that. Glenn Schorr : We'll get to the [indiscernible]. A - John Gerspach : Yes, yes, yes. Look, as going into the year, what we said was that we were expecting a continuation of the difficult environment that we experienced in 2014, and unfortunately, I think that's where we're heading into; certainly that's the way 2015 is playing out. We weren't expecting to be bailed out by any sort of significant rate increase, and again it doesn't look like that's going to happen. So we said that we thought that our Citi core businesses could generate low-to-mid single-digit revenue growth this year just based upon the fundamentals, and that is, in effect, what we experienced in the first quarter, with a 2% growth rate in Citicorp. So we don't really have any sort of significant rate increase baked into those revenue projections. And our commitment is to deliver Citicorp that mid-50s efficiency ratio, and then the ROA target for overall Citigroup, no matter what the environment. Glenn Schorr : Very much appreciate that. A strong dollar didn't seem to have a huge P&L impact, and broke all out -- you broke out for us all the places that hit both revenue and expenses. It also impacts the G-SIB buffer, and I know those rules aren't finalized, but is there a way to hedge that, or do you give up P&L neutrality if you wind up hedging that as an either/or scenario? A - John Gerspach : One, I wouldn't even propose putting on hedges for rules that are not even fully baked in yet, so\u2026 Glenn Schorr : Yes. A - John Gerspach : That's not something we're looking at. The difficulty with anything to do with the G-SIB calculation is that, not only is it linked to changes in the FX rate, it's linked to what 79 other banks are doing, and I don't know how to put a hedge on against 79 banks' activities. That's just not something that I know how to control at this point in time. From an overall, what we can focus on, what we do know what to do, is hedge the CET 1 ratio, and you can see, again, that despite all their fluctuations in the dollar, it had zero impact on our CET 1 ratio. We laid that out for you in Slide 37 in the back of the deck. So we've got a very effective ratio hedging program on to protect the capital ratios that are significant. And you can see that once again, as you said, the dollar fluctuation doesn't really impact our revenue or -- well, it doesn't impact on net income performance. Again, we laid that out for you in the back of the deck as well. Whether the dollar is going up or the dollar is going down, it all nets out to somewhere of plus or minus $100 million dollars of pre-tax earnings. Glenn Schorr : Yes, I appreciate that. Last one, on credit, which has also been great. I'm just curious if there's anything within, whether it would be Russia/Ukraine exposure, or energy exposure that is getting internal rankings going higher, or should I say internal downgrades that we should be thinking about throughout this year. A - John Gerspach : We've been actively managing the exposure, obviously, to Russia on an ongoing basis and -- excuse me I apologize. As you can -- As you have seen, we've continued to manage down the exposure that we have in Russia. The consumer business in Russia is actually performing, I'd say, better than what we had expected; so that's good. When it comes to energy-related matters, we gave you a lot of details as far as our energy exposures when we did fourth quarter last year. Well, we'll give you more details on that when we do the Fixed Income Investor Presentation next week, but in general, our energy-related exposures on a funded basis are steady, fourth quarter to first quarter. Total exposure is down slightly. We mentioned last quarter that about 85% of our exposure energy companies was investment grade. We had some minor downgrades in that, but I think it's reduced by a couple of 300 basis points, or maybe it's down to 82%, so it's still very strong. During the quarter though, in connection with those downgrades, we did take about a $100 million reserve, no credit loses, but we did take a $100 million credit reserve and that you'll see reflected in the ICG results this quarter. Glenn Schorr : Great I appreciate all that, thanks. A - John Gerspach : Not a problem, Glenn. Operator : Your nest question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, guys. On holdings, thinking about the $30 billion in sales that you've inked, or equivalent of $30 billion in assets tied to sales that you've already inked, how should we think about revenues and expenses that are tied to those? John Gerspach : Well, when you take a look at holdings, we -- again, our commitment to holdings is to be able to run that business at least on a breakeven basis over a full year period, and we believe that even with the sales that we've got lined up for the balance of this year, we still should be able to produce holdings at breakeven during the balance of this year and into next year. Brennan Hawken : Okay, all right. Thanks for that, John. And then, how about on the capital front, can you help us think about what potential capital impact might come from those deals? John Gerspach : Well, we don't go into deal-by-deal basis on these things. Holdings, at the end of the first quarter has got about a $179 billion worth of risk weighted assets, now about $49 billion of those assets though are op risk assets, so individual sales are not going to impact op risks. So, say, you've got a $130 billion dollars of mostly credit risk, some market risk, but mostly credit risk, risk weighted assets sitting there in Citi Holdings, and if you think about the businesses that we've got on tab, including OneMain and Japan, they total as we said about $32 billion worth of GAAP assets, but on a risk weighted asset basis, it's much lower than that. They only account for about $16 billion worth of the risk weighted assets, and that's just because of the concentration of HQLA [ph] type assets that are concentrated in Japan. So you are not going to get a significant drop-off in holdings risk weighted assets just stemming from the combination of those deals. Brennan Hawken : That's helpful. And then, you mentioned, John, I believe a decline in trade revenues, we heard -- a competitor mentioned lower demand in trade finance, could you give maybe a little bit of colour around that business and what trends you are seeing there? John Gerspach : Yes, I'd say that our commentary would be similar. There certainly is a lower demand. Some of the trade finance businesses obviously is in connection with energy-related type of projects. So when you get the price of oil dropping by 50%, you are going to have a significant drop in your demand for trade finance. Importantly, what we're evidencing in that business is a discipline, we are not just going to chase volume at any cost, because chasing volume just doesn't give you the type of returns that you want. So we are maintaining good relationships with our clients, but shifting the business to, some to be -- we'll facilitate the deal, but not look to hold the asset itself, and so that has a reduction in our trade revenues for now, but we are maintaining we think overall market share in the trade finance area. Brennan Hawken : Okay, that's helpful. Last one from me, Argentina, we've seen a lot of noise coming out of the situation there with the bond payments and the like, is that just how you think about that market from here? A - Mike Corbat : If you look at our franchise in Argentina, we just in actually 2014 celebrated our 100th anniversary of being in the country and it's a place that we've got a history franchise. Clearly, we're challenged that today, or if you go back to March 12, sitting between the district court ruling here in the U.S. and the Argentine government is not a place we want to be. And as a result of finding ourselves in that position, made the decision on our own that we would like to exit the custody business. And so, we are in conversations with the Argentine government in terms of trying to execute against that process. Many of these things are complicated, but we think that's the best course of action for us to take. Brennan Hawken : And limit it to the custody business at this stage? A - Mike Corbat : Absolutely. Limited to the custody business. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. Thanks for all the color. A - Mike Corbat : Yes, no problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead with your question. Betsy Graseck : Hey, thanks. One follow-up and one on expenses; just on the RWA discussion around Citi Holdings so to get RWAs down more significantly from here is that just a function of the U.S. first and second-lien resi portfolio fading, is that necessarily [ph] the next driver, or is it some of these others that are on tap to be sold? John Gerspach : I'd say still the U.S. mortgage portfolio in Citi Holdings, you can see that it's got the lion share of the GAAP assets, and in similar fashion, it has the lion share of the remaining risk weighted assets. Betsy Graseck : Yes, and that's a natural state over four years, is that how we should think about it? John Gerspach : Well, we've done there some opportunistic asset sales. We continue to run that portfolio down. You've seen the reduction that we achieved in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. So that's a combination, both of pay downs as well as asset sales, and we will continue to do that where the economics makes sense. Betsy Graseck : Sure, okay. And then, separately on the expenses which I would say looks fantastic this quarter, you indicated earlier that there's about [ph] $700 million left in the cost saves to come through, $200 -- well, I should say $500 million left, 700 beginning of the year, 200 used this quarter, 500 left to go; is that going to manifest itself mostly through non-comp lines as it comes through. I'm just thinking about it relative to the comments you made on ICG group, with the expense target going from 57 to 55, and a comp ratio of 28 looks extremely efficient already on the comp line? John Gerspach : Yes, the bulk of the remaining annualized savings, and I want to just be clear, Betsy, that roughly 500, little bit less than 500 -- that's on an annualized basis. So you'll get that in the expense based during the remaining three quarters, but that will show itself. But the bulk of those savings are split between comp costs as well as real estate costs, because we got real estate actions that we've also got embedded as we continue to take streamlining actions. We're consolidating sites along with some of the personnel actions that we've taken. So you'll see it on both the occupancy line as well as on the compensation lines. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just lastly on the repo costs, you've mentioned for couple of quarters here that you would expect repo activities would be -- repositioning activities would be fading. We had a smaller run rate this quarter, obviously repo costs, is that the kind of expectation going forward here, or are we just taking a pause before you dig into the next round? John Gerspach : Our overall guidance has been that we expect legal and repositioning costs to run about 200 basis points with Citicorp. And we said that was a pretty good target to go forward for 2015. So when you look at the overall level of legal and repositioning in the quarter, I think it ran something like a 175 basis points. So roughly in line with that 200 basis point target. Well, I think that during the course of the year, you will continue to see some level of repositioning; even in this quarter, while Citicorp I think shows a repositioning charge of one, there was actually gross repositioning charges of something around $30 million, but that was largely offset by the release of some previously established repositioning reserves from prior periods. But we still will continue to do some repositioning. But yes, we do think that the bulk -- certainly the largest portion of our repositioning efforts are behind us. Betsy Graseck : And the 500 million is coming through roughly evenly spread next three quarters, or is it backend loaded all? John Gerspach : I'd say that we got a little over 200 million in the first quarter. There's probably a little bit more to come that will be -- you'll see in the third quarter with the second and fourth quarter somewhat evenly split. Betsy Graseck : Okay thank you. John Gerspach : Very well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mike Mayo : Hi, I'm trying to reconcile two thoughts; the positive thought comes from the CEO letter, where Mike you say, all that we accomplished over the last two years has been in preparation for this year. That's a pretty positive statement, but then I've heard a few I think negative statements on the call; the ICG efficiency ratio was 51% in the first quarter, and you're guiding the 55% for the year. So I guess that won't maintain. Trading typically peaks in the first quarter. You talked about a lower margin after the asset sale, so is this as good as it gets, or is this a false start for Citigroup, or is there a lot more ahead? A - Mike Corbat : Well, Mike, I would say that you're right, there is cyclicality to the business, but if you look at the quarter I think there's a couple of stories or a couple of themes in here that are important to call out. John talked about the diversification of our earnings base, and if you look at the banking piece of it, we had good earnings growth in banking at the same time offsetting some softness around parts of our markets business, if you look at what's going on in terms of North American consumer. So we believe, and you look at the earnings power of Citi, and how and where we make it, depends upon certain revenue streams. Hopefully you see and believe that there's more diversity to what we're doing. And I think a lot of that's the work that we've done and continue to do. From an overall efficiency perspective, and from an ICG perspective, we are committed to our targets. And yes, ICG did have an efficiency ratio of in the low 50s, but again we've got investments that we need to make in that business, and we can't be starving these businesses, and we're already -- when you compare us against our industry peers, we're already leading in terms of what we're doing. And by the way, when we talk of an efficiency ratio of 54% for the quarter in Citicorp, when you take that and overlay it over Citigroup, it goes to 55%. So it's not that there's a bunch of things that are away from that. So, completely committed to the targets, diversification of earnings, and I think a continued story going forward. John Gerspach : Mike, let me just -- the other things, I just want to make sure that you picked up on some of the other things we've talked about, which is that, we did recognize that we had headwinds in our international consumer business during this first quarter as well. So in a quarter where we had headwinds in both our trading performance as well as in international consumer, we still are able to post overall strong results. And as Mike said, I think that really speaks to the balance and strength of the overall business model. And we fully expect international consumer to generate growth in the second half of the year and return to positive operating leverage. So I just want to make sure that you captured all the positive statements. Mike Mayo : Got it, that addresses the operating efficiency. On capital efficiency, Mike, you said that you don't really believe in a lot of one-off to buyback capital, but you can now repurchase stock, which is different; actually if you could let us know when you're allowed to start buying back stock, and also if you can buyback stock at such a discount to tangible book value, why wouldn't you sell off additional non-core assets? I mean if it was me I could -- if I could buy dollar bills for a discount, I'd be buying as many as I could. I mean I'm looking at my office, I'd be selling my water bottle, my stapler, you know, maybe my desk chair, I'd stand -- I'd do whatever I could to raise that additional capital buyback stock and I'd make the request to regulators. And the question before, why not take the proceeds from OneMain or anything else that you can sell for a gain and buyback stock right now? A - Mike Corbat : Well, two things. One is we have started buying back stocks. Our permission gave us the ability to start that on April 1, and we did. So that's underway. And I think if you've seen, Mike, we've been very disciplined, and I think quite transparent in terms of the way we look at our businesses. And those businesses that over the intermediate term, we don't believe there's a pathway to be accretive to our franchise in the industry. You've seen us take action against those. And so we'll continue to review those, but we believe today that franchise away from holdings has largely positioned the way we'd like it to be. And if you look at the returns of those businesses, both institutional and consumer, they're accretive to our shareholders. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. A - Mike Corbat : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead with your question. Q - Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. So John, I just wanted to start off with maybe a follow-up to Glenn's earlier question on the G-SIB surcharge [ph] calculation. Recognizing, of course, as you said the Fed's proposal has not been finalized, assuming the current draft and some of those FX considerations relating to the calculation, or [ph] not amended, can you maybe just speak to some of the actions that you can take to help mitigate the G-SIB score. And in addition to that, whether you have any plans to actually manage to a specific target and say, \"No,\" it's unclear whether you've moved up a bucket from the 3.5% to the 4%? John Gerspach : Thanks, Steve. I'd say it's pretty clear that we have moved up to afford it to the 4% bucket. I mean that's certainly our estimation, just given -- again, given the change in exchange rates and everything else we'll get confirmation of that, but we're pretty sure that we're in that 4% bucket under the current proposed rules. And we'll have to see how those play out. And as we've said, you saw some of the impact that we've had by managing down some of the components of the SLR denominator. And so, again, we're looking to manage down various elements of both the SLR and the G-SIB calculation. We focus on the OTC -- derivatives that are trading on OTC, the PFE associated with derivatives; things that we can control, we're bringing down. We haven't seen the disclosure yet, but we brought our derivative notional down another $3 billion or so in the quarter, $3 trillion, sorry. And so where we can, we will. What I don't know is what impact that has on the calculation, because I don't know what everybody else is doing. And I don't know where FX rates are going. So we will look to optimize our footprint, but the way the calculation is currently structured, I can't tell you that it will have any impact. Steven Chubak : Have you had any dialog with regulators with regards to the approach, and whether -- it seems fairer balance giving some of those FX considerations as well as the fact that it's a relative calculation as you noticed? John Gerspach : I believe that there were a series of comment letters already submitted to the Fed, and I'm sure that the Fed is giving those due consideration. Steven Chubak : Understood; and maybe just one more on risk weighted assets, also follow-up to Betsy's question with regards to Holdings' RWA specifically; just looking at some of the 10-K disclosure that you guys provided, it looks like 30% of Holdings' RWA consists of operational risks, so call it $54 billion or so. And just given the long look back for op risk, I just want to get a better understanding as to what happens in an accelerated unwind of Holding? Should we expect that 5 to 6 billion of capital is actually released, or does it persist or linger because of the significant look back? John Gerspach : Steven, so the updated number that I mentioned earlier is we would say that of the $179 billion at the end of the first quarter of risk weighted assets that's in Holdings, that $49 billion of that is op risk. And right on to your point, we don't expect that op risk RWA to dissipate just because we've gotten rid of the Holdings' assets. That will stay with us for sometime. I can't tell you how long, but it will be with us for sometime. Steven Chubak : Okay, that's really helpful. Thanks, John, and congratulations on a strong quarter. John Gerspach : Thank you, Steven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead with your question. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. John Gerspach : Yes, good afternoon. Gerard Cassidy : John, you mentioned that your deposits per branch here in the States I think were up 20% even though you've obviously downsized the branch structure that you have here in the States. Are you now at the optimal level in the seven cities that you've identified, or is there further reductions that we should expect? John Gerspach : Well, we're concentrated around those seven cities. Are there still some branches outside those seven cities that we might consider doing some further pruning on? Perhaps, and there's probably other opportunities that we have to open up additional outlets in some of those seven cities as well. So the number 788 that we currently have, that could go up a little, could go down a little, I wouldn't necessarily just focus on it, but again whatever we do, we will be consistent with that strategy of concentrating our efforts on those seven urban areas. Gerard Cassidy : Following up on your comments that you talked about with after OneMain is sold, obviously the NIM will come under some pressure, but you do get the capital gain hopefully from the sale, and you can pay down some of your high cost debt. Will some of the gain be also used for stock repurchases, or is it all just to reduce that higher cost debt? John Gerspach : Under the CCAR, the thing that -- the CCAR submittal, we've already received approval over the next five quarters to buyback about $7.8 billion of our stock. And so, those actions are currently underway, as Mike indicated earlier, beginning on April 1 as to whether or not we would do anything specific with the OneMain gain, while it's probably too early to give you a definitive answer, I would not expect us to. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Early in your comments, I think you guys said that by the end of the year, you might have about 30,000 folks working in regulatory and compliance. Where's that number today? John Gerspach : I think at the start of the year, we were looking at something around 26,000, may be a little bit over that. So I think in terms of slightly more than 10%-12% growth during the course of the year. Gerard Cassidy : And do you guys have a ballpark and what that cost is, if you use an average salary of 60,000 or something like that for the folks that are in that division or that group? John Gerspach : I'm not going to address the 60,000 number that you just drew out, but now I can't give you a specific cost of that. We've made comments that obviously the cost associated with regulatory and compliance efforts has continued to increase. It's consumed a fairly significant portion of the efficiency savings that we've been generating in the business. We've given you that math before. We've said that, of the $3.4 billion of expense saves that we expect to get in specifically of the now $2.9 billion of expense saves that we've gotten through our efficiency efforts, approximately 50% of those savings are being consumed by additional investments that we're making in regulatory and compliance activities. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thanks. And obviously, General Electric made that announcement about exiting the financial services business in a big way by selling couple of hundred billion of assets; is any interest on your guys' part and looking at any of those portfolios? John Gerspach : I think as we've shown, Gerard, we're always willing and interested to look at assets at the right price, so, if things fit in strategy, happy to look at it, but I don't see us breaking into new areas that we're not already in. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just finally, coming back to -- John, I heard your comments about the G-SIB NPR, and obviously everybody has made their comments and letters. To your recollection in the past on NPRs, does the Fed ever come back to you guys, you and your peers for added commentary after the official closing of the letters posted and all that? John Gerspach : I don't believe that is within the rule. They may seek additional commentary to other means, but I don't believe that while the comment and review period is underway that they can have individual discussions. But again, I'm not a rules expert. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon, gentlemen. Just I guess administrative question, it looks like there's a really sizable increase in other revenue in your reported income statement. I guess I'm just trying to get a little more color as to what the change was there in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter? John Gerspach : Sorry, Matt; can't do that one. I'll give you the usual line, if you call our crack IR staff after the completion of this call, they will get you that information. I apologize. Matt Burnell : I appreciate that's a little bit in the weeds. Just to pull up a little bit from the weeds; you mentioned on July 24 that there was a transfer of a portion of a liquidity portfolio from corporate into ICG, at the same time you also increased the allocated TCE into that business. What was the size of that portfolio that you transferred and what effect might that have going forward on ROCE in that business? John Gerspach : I can't recall the exact size. It was a fairly sizable number, something like a $130 billion or so. Again, we can get you the exact number. Again, that's more reflective of some of the deposit taking activities that are resident in the transaction services business. While we had the -- they tend to generate then high quality liquid assets that we hold, we were -- those things used to be resident in our corp other segment. And so, we felt that there was a better measurement to act from a performance point of view to actually push those assets into the business themselves. And I think you can see that it's had a small impact on the capital than attributed to ICG. That capital is up a couple of billion dollars from quarter-to-quarter. It's going to drive down their ROA. But we think it's a better measure of what the real ROA is that we have coming out of that business. Matt Burnell : And presumably it doesn't affect the overall Citicorp -- that you are reporting and tracking again? John Gerspach : No. From a Citicorp, or from a city group point of view, it's a right pocket left pocket, we just thought that it was a better way of measuring performance. Matt Burnell : Okay, Thanks very much. That's it from me. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. Q - Erika Najarian : Yes, good afternoon. My question have been asked and answered. Thank you. John Gerspach : Thank you, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead with your question. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Hi, Mike and John. A question on just CCAR and the limitations, it's clear that CET 1 was not so much limited [ph] as much as Tier 1 in total. You guys have previously talked about raising about 4 billion preferred this year as a helper on that side of things. I'm just wondering just post this year CCAR, can you give us some thoughts about just the outcomes around limitations and any views that you might have that maybe different around the magnitude of preferred issuance you might need to think about for this year and looking ahead? A - Mike Corbat : No, we still think that $4 billion is about the right level of issuance that we'll have this year. We'll give you further guidance next week when we conduct the Fixed Income call, but I don't expect that number to increase. The important thing about the CCAR, don't forget CCAR is an exercise that goes out over nine quarter. And so it's really what gets reflected in the various CCAR calculations is the totality of your capital plan, including issuances as well as redemption, the use of capital repurchases over that nine-quarter period. We're still comfortable with the guidance that we'd given as far as the level of preferred stock issuance that we need to do. Ken Usdin : Okay, understood; great. And then second question, you spoke to the drag that have been impacting the international consumer businesses from the spread compression and the regulatory changes, can you talk a little bit more about just qualitatively the international markets, LATAM and Asia, and any impact you are seeing from FX not so much in the translation effects because that's pretty clear that that's a net neutral, but just in terms of the economies in general, organic and secure growth, and how you are feeling about those businesses? Thanks. John Gerspach : Yes. I mean we still look -- obviously -- globally, GDP growth is less than what we would hope for, and I don't think we are alone in that, but we still see good opportunities in markets; India for instance, is doing very well. It's likely that India is going to emerge as the economy with the strongest GDP growth this year as it outdistances China, but we continue to invest on our franchises throughout Asia, and we are getting good driver growth, the deposit levels, the loan levels; so we feel really good about the strength of our overall Asia franchise. Unlike so many other things these are patches that we have to manage our way through, where you are going to get some regulatory headwinds, you are going to have some slowdown in GDP, so that might mitigate some of the -- it might cause you to lessen the pace of some of your investments in those countries, but it doesn't stop the fact that we are still looking to grow our Asia consumer business. Ken Usdin : And then, last just clarification, John, you earlier had mentioned that maybe China offset, or keep key holdings profitable on a yearly basis this year into next year, and I'm just wondering is the potential debt pay down considered after the sale of OneMain considered in the helping part of next year as well? John Gerspach : Yes, very much so, very much so. Ken Usdin : Okay, understood. Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead with your question. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. John Gerspach : Hi, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, how are you, John? Just a couple of questions; first, as it relates to the Costco portfolio, can you just describe how the price discovery works on that? John Gerspach : I'm not quite sure that we've released the contractual terms on that, but just to say that there is a process put in place by which a purchase price can be set between the two parties, and we ultimately feel that we will reach agreement on an appropriate purchase price, because we think it's in both of our best interest to have the portfolio transferred. Eric Wasserstrom : And I guess what I'm trying to just understand is to the extent that there is obviously a difference in view on pricing, how does that -- what is the mechanism for resolution? John Gerspach : There is a mechanism, and mechanism leads to a choice as to whether or not the portfolio ultimately is transferred. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. John Gerspach : Although we don't think that's where it's going to go. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And then on a different topic, and there has obviously been some press speculation about legal authority and their interest in getting one of your legal entities to plead guilty to an issue. And I guess I'm not asking obviously to comment directly on that, but I guess my question is to the extent that, that does happen for your banking entity in the United States, how does the investment community think about the operational risk that, that creates for you? For example, does it create risk to your licenses? Does it create risk to certain counterparties who may or may not be able to interact with you on a go-forward basis? How do we frame our understanding of those risks? John Gerspach : Eric, we don't comment on individual litigation or regulatory matters. Our specific reserving actions unless it's related to specific settlements that we are announcing and since we don't comment on these things because they ultimately are hypotheticals, I'm really not going to comment then on your hypothetical. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, I understood. Thanks very much. John Gerspach : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Please go ahead with your question. Chris Kotowski : Yes, hi. I wonder if you could just talk how do the redemption of high cost debt work, so just hypothetically let's say is that the proceeds or is that the gain that is the driver and how much you can do? So, if hypothetically you sell a business for $1 billion in proceeds and you have a $100 million gain, can you buyback a $100 million of debt or a billion or is the constraining factor, that is got to be -- the redemption cost have to be less than 100 million? John Gerspach : Your last one, the constraining factor is the cost of the redemption. So if I've got a $100 million dollar gain, I should be able to retire debt that would generate a $100 million loss that would cancel out the gain and the loss, producing a zero impact on net income, and we would have the ongoing benefit of the debt being retired, therefore lessening interest charges in the future periods. Chris Kotowski : Okay. And this is either presumably part of the CCAR capital plan or doesn't require specific approval for all that, right? John Gerspach : Either one. Chris Kotowski : Oh, okay. All right. Thank you. That's it from me. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead with your question. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, I just have one quick question; with regards to what you mentioned about -- potentially looking at some of GE's assets relative to your guidance at the balance seems to be at or below its current size over the year. Does that mean your guidance excludes any potential acquisitions? A - Mike Corbat : We would say that there is something that we think is extraordinary and creates real value. We would certainly be willing to put that on if it's accretive in the ways we want a look at it, but the other levers we pull is that we've maintained a flat balance sheet while investing in our business in loan growth by the continued shrinkage of holding. So depending on the size of the asset and the nature of it, we might be able to create room through holdings, or if it works extraordinary or something we thought of merit, we could certainly add it to the balance sheet. John Gerspach : I just want to be clear; I mean the comments that I made as far as the balance sheet size is related to this year. I'm not saying that we will never grow the balance sheet in '16, '17, '18; that was a very specific comment as related to the other comments on the balance of the year. It will be doubtful that any significant portfolio of assets we would actually be able to close on this year. So the guidance stays for this year. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. And just one follow-up question; was there any gain from moving out OneMain and the held-for-sale? John Gerspach : Is there what, I'm sorry? Brian Kleinhanzl : Any gain from moving -- you said I think the OneMain operations have moved the held-for-sale? John Gerspach : Oh, yes, no, no, no. There's no gain associated with the movement from -- into held-for-sale. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, thank you. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations, and we look forward to speak with you again soon. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Regina. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.7 billion for the first quarter of 2015, or $1.45 per share, excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. It was a strong quarter overall, and we continued to make good progress towards our strategic and execution priorities. With half the year behind us, we\u2019ve remained on track to hit our financial targets in terms of return on assets in our efficiency ratio. We again achieved both positive operating leverage and strong loan growth in our core Citicorp businesses. Citi Holdings was profitable again during the quarter and we continued to wine down its assets which are down 22% from a year ago and Holding\u2019s assets now comprise only 6% of Citigroup\u2019s balance sheet. We continued to utilize DTA this quarter bringing the total to $1.5 billion for the first half of 2015 and we added $3.5 billion to our regulatory capital during the quarter even as we returned roughly $1.7 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends. Our tangible book value increased to $59.18 and our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to a 11.4% on a fully implemented Basel III basis. We submitted our resolution plan to the Fed and the FDIC which details how we would resolve Citi without the use of tax payer funds or harm to the financial system, viable resolution planning is critical to our making Citi as simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution. In terms of our businesses, we saw balanced performance for the quarter across our institutional and consumer segments. In ICG, we\u2019ve grown our investment banking wallet share year-to-date and our Private Bank continued to show strong rise in revenue growth. Treasury and Trade Solutions saw a revenue growth on a constant dollar basis. And our Markets and Securities Services revenue grew from a year ago driven by rates in currencies and security services. In consumer banking, high quality checking deposit growth improve spreads and higher mortgage originations drove revenue growth in the U.S. while we\u2019ve optimized our branch footprint to focus on seven cities. And internationally, we also grew revenue, despite continued spread headwinds with growth across investment sales, deposits, loans and purchase sales. We\u2019ve remained focused on our expenses and driving efficiencies throughout the organization. Despite significant investments in our regulatory and compliance functions, we continued to lower our overall headcount and we\u2019re reducing both our real estate footprint and our employees in higher cost locations. These actions help to keep our expenses lower than they were a year ago even before the benefit of foreign exchange. While I am pleased with our results for the first half of the year, the environment remains challenging and unsettled. Growth forecast continued to be downwardly revised and we still don\u2019t have clarity on when interest rates will begin to rise. While some volatility may create trading opportunities, we would much prefer to see growth strength inconsistently across the developed and emerging markets. But whatever the economic conditions are we will remain focused on our clients and executing our strategy on behalf of our shareholders. John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, I\u2019d like to highlight a couple of items CVA, DVA and the prior period mortgage settlement that affect the comparability of our results to last year. Excluding these items, we earned a $1.45 per share in the recent quarter compared to a $1.24 in the second quarter 2014. On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the second quarter, we earned $4.7 billion generating a return on assets of 101 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 10.1%. Net income grew by over $700 million year-over-year driven by core improvement in Citicorp. Revenues declined on a reported basis to $19.2 billion, but increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars. Expenses declined 7% year-over-year mostly reflecting a lower legal and repositioning charges as well as a benefit from FX translation and net credit losses improved offset by a lower net loan loss reserve release. The tax rate in the second quarter was 29% somewhat lower than the 31% outlook we had provided on a full year basis. Turning to the first half of 2015, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 56%. Net income grew by 17% year-over-year, we generated a ROA of a 103 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 10.5%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $632 billion as 4% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wine down of Citi Holdings. Deposits also decreased 1% driven by Citi Holdings including the reclassification of $21 billion of Japan retail deposits to held for sale in the fourth quarter of last year. On Slide 5, we provide more detail on second quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up 5% year-over-year mostly driven by growth in our institutional franchise and revenues declined in Citi Holdings reflecting continued asset reductions as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of last quarter. As a result of the HFS accounting treatment, OneMain loans are classified as other assets. As such approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction to other revenue during the second quarter. This lowered both revenues and cost of credit by an equal amount and therefore had a neutral impact on earnings. On Slide 6, we show more detail on expenses in constant dollars. Citi core expenses were down 1% as ongoing efficiency savings and lower legal and repositioning cost will largely offset by higher regulatory and compliance cost. And Citi Holdings expenses also declined on lower assets. On Slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp net income grew 22% year-over-year in the second quarter. And as I just described, we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with 5% growth in revenues and 1% decline in expenses in constant dollars. And for the first half of 2015, we achieved the Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55.1%. Turning to Citi Holdings, we were profitable again this quarter with over a $150 million in net income. Citi Holdings ended the quarter with a $116 billion of assets or 6% of total Citigroup assets. On Slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 25% year-over-year driven higher revenues, lower operating expenses and an improvement in credit cost, partially offset by a higher effective tax rate. Revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the second quarter, reflecting volume growth, partially offset by spread compression and ongoing regulatory headwinds in certain markets. In Latin America, we grew revenues 3% driven by modest loan and deposit growth in Mexico, partially offset by the impact of selling our consumer franchise in Honduras last year. And in Asia revenues were roughly flat year-over-year as 3% growth in retail banking revenues including wealth management was offset by lower card revenues. Asia card loans and purchase sales both grew year-over-year by 4% and 5% respectfully but this growth was offset by lower spreads driven by continued higher payment rates and the impact of regulatory changes in certain markets. We continued to believe these headwinds will abate somewhat in the second half of 2015. Asia card revenues grew by 3% sequentially in the second quarter. In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchaser sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 4%. Operating expenses declined 5% as lower repositioning cost were partially offset by the impact of volume growth, higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments and credit cost declined from last year. Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Net income of $1.1 billion declined slightly year-over-year as higher revenues, lower expenses and lower net credit losses were more than offset by a decline in the net loan loss reserve release. Total revenues grew 1% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 11% from last year, reflecting continued loan and checking deposit growth, higher mortgage origination activity and improved deposit spreads. Branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 5% from last year as 5% growth in purchase sales and improved spreads were more than offset by the impact of lower average loans mostly driven by the continued runoff of promotional rate balances and higher payment rates. And retail services revenues were flat to last year with improved spreads being offset by the continued impact of lower fuel prices and higher contractual partner payments. Total expenses declined 3% mostly driven by ongoing efficiency savings as we have continued to rationalize our branch footprint and capture the benefits of our global scale in cards. Our retail banking results reflect the strong progress we\u2019re making in North America. Over the past year, we have reduced our branch count by 15% to 779 branches. And at the same time, we've improved the overall productivity of our network, concentrating our resources in 70 markets and deepening our relationships with our target clients. Despite the branch reductions, we grew checking account balances by 7% year-over-year. Card acquisitions per branch were up 10% year-over-year on a same store basis and we continued to enhance our retail mortgage origination platform reducing our reliance on third parties and better integrating our operations. Over 80% of our growth in origination volumes year-over-year came through retail channels. Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Overall, credit remained favorable in the second quarter. In North America and Asia, trends remained broadly stable and in Latin America. the NCL rate improved in line with a lower delinquency rate. Slide 11 shows the expense trends for the global consumer banking. Over the last 12 months, our consumer efficiency ratio was 54% including overall 150 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. For the first half of the year, the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 53.3%, down from 56% last year. We now expect the total consumer efficiency ratio for 2015 to be somewhere in the range of 52% to 53% consistent with our plans to begin gradually increasing the level of investment spend during the second half of the year, primarily in the U.S. branded cards. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 12; revenues of 8.6 billon in the second quarter grew 2% from last year and declined 6% from the prior quarter, total banking revenues of 4.4 billon were roughly flat to last year and up 4% sequentially. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billon were down 1% year-over-year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 5% from last year as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. This represents the sixth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. And while trade revenues continue to present the headwind this quarter, we see some early positive signs that spread maybe stabilizing. Both cash and trade revenues increased sequentially up 3% in total. Investment Banking revenues of 1.3 billon were down 4% from last year as higher M&A revenues were more than offset by lower underwriting activity as compared to a very strong second quarter last year consistent with overall market trends. Year-to-date, investment banking revenues were up 4% driven by strong M&A results and we have gained overall wallet versus 2014 particularly in North America. Private Bank revenues of 746 million grew 13% year-over-year, driven by strong growth in investments and capital markets products as well as higher loan and deposit balances. And Corporate Lending revenues of 445 million were down 2% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues grew 4% from last year as higher volumes were partially offset by lower spreads. Total Markets and Security Services revenues of 4.2 billion grew 4% year-over-year and declined 12% sequentially. Fixed income revenue of 3.1 billion were down slightly from last year as continued strength in rates and currencies was offset by lower revenues in spread products. Rates and currencies revenues grew by double digits year-over-year in the second quarter as investor client activity and market volatility were improved versus last year, G10 rates was the key driver of growth. In North America in particular as we saw strong client activity and a favorable trading environment offset by a small decline in G10 foreign exchange. Local market rates and currencies grew modestly year-over-year driven by our franchise in Asia. In spread products however, activity levels declined versus last year in credit products in particular resulting in lower revenues. On a sequential basis, fixed income revenues declined 12% driven by seasonal factors as well as the lower rates and currency activity as compared to a strong first quarter. Equities revenues of 653 million were down 1% year-over-year and down 25% sequential. Our equities revenues this quarter included a charge of 175 million for valuation adjustments related it certain financing transactions. And as of today, we have a remaining exposure with respect to these transactions of less than a $100 million. Excluding the adjustments, equities revenues would have increased by 26% from last year, driven by growth and derivatives, improved trading performance EMEA and strong client momentum in Asia. In Security Services, revenues were up 7% year-over-year and 3% sequential reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operative expenses of 4.8 billion grew 2% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were partially offset by ongoing efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation and credit was a positive in the quarter. On Slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. Over the last 12 months, our efficiency ratio was 57% including roughly 140 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges and our comp ratio was 27%. We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio closer to the mid-point of the 53% to 57% target range for the full year 2015. Slide 14 shows the result for the Corp and other. Revenues were higher year-over-year and sequential, driven mainly by gains on debt buybacks as well as real estate sales in the recent quarter, partially offset by hedging activities and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Slide 15 shows Citi Holdings asset which totaled a $116 billion at quarter end, down 22% from a year ago. We have continued to make great progress in winding down these assets. During the quarter, we closed the sales of our consumer businesses in Peru and Nicaragua and we have signed agreements to sell an additional $32 billion of assets including our consumer businesses in Japan, Egypt, Costa Rica and Panama as well as OneMain Financial. On Slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Revenues of 1.7 billion declined by over 300 million from last year, driven by the reduction in assets as well as the impact of classifying our OneMain business as held for sale at the end of the quarter. As I described earlier, as a result of the HFS accounting treatment, approximately $160 million of net credit losses were recorded as a reduction in revenue during the second quarter. The HFS treatment had no impact on expenses which declined 13% year-over-year, primarily due to the asset reductions. On Slide 17, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to strength. Our net interest margin increased sequentially to 295 basis points, driven by a higher than expected contribution from trading NIM which can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter. Excluding this impact, our net interest margin would have been closer to 291 basis points and we expect to maintain roughly this level for the third quarter. Looking to the fourth quarter, our results will depend in part on the timing of divestiture including OneMain at our Japan retail business. We estimate that without these businesses on a combined basis, our net interest margin would be lower by roughly 7 basis points before using any part of the associative gains to redeem high cost dept. We believe we can ultimately mitigate more than half of this NIM pressure through a combination of the upcoming debt redemption actions as well as the April acquisition of the Costco portfolio. On Slide 18, we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented Basel III basis. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to a 11.4% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7% and our tangible book value grew to $59.18 per share. In summary, we continued to make progress in the second quarter with revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Citicorp, lower legal and repositioning expenses and continued favorable credit trends. For the first half of 2015, we are tracking well to our financial targets with a Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55%, a Citigroup ROA of a 103 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 10.5%. Of course we would expect our results to be stronger in the first half of the year given the seasonality of our markets business. But for the full year, we continued to expect to deliver a Citicorp efficiency ratio in the mid 50% range and a Citigroup ROA of over 90 basis points. Finally, we ended the quarter with a strong capital position improving our CET 1 ratio to a 11.4% and our supplementary leverage ratio to 6.7% even as we returned roughly $1.7 billion of capital to shareholders in the form of buybacks and common dividends this quarter. Turning to the second half of this year, we continued to expect modest revenue growth in Citicorp. In consumer, in North America, we expect continued underlying revenue growth in our retail banking franchise, although comparisons for the prior year will be impacted by certain onetime items that benefited our mortgage business last year as previous disclosed. And the North America cards, revenue will likely remain under pressure in the second half of the year as it will take some time for our incremental investment spend to drive top line results. In international consumer, we continue to believe we can generate revenue growth and positive operating leverage year-over-year in the second half of 2015, driven by continued modest growth in Mexico as well as continued volume growth and abating spread headwinds in Asia as we begin to lap some of the spread compression and regulatory changes we absorbed last year. Turning to the institutional franchise, we continued to see good momentum across Corporate Lending, Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services and the Private Bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half of the year in constant dollars. Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market, but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise generating 4% year-over-year revenue growth in the first half with overall wallet share gains versus 2014. And finally, in markets we expect our overall performance to reflect the market environment with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients. In Citi Holdings we remained focused on winding down the portfolio, while staying above breakeven. As I\u2019ve described earlier we have signed agreements with a sale of $32 billion of assets virtually all of which we expect to close by year-end. And in particular, we continue to work towards a late third quarter sale of OneMain financial. We expect credit cost to increase somewhat in the second half of the year driven by loan growth as well as lower loan loss reserve releases and we expect to keep balance sheet discipline staying at or below our current size. And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey good morning, guys. Mike Corbat : Hi. Thank you, Jim. Jim Mitchell : May be we could take a little bit just about the expense trajectory from here, you highlighted higher regulatory expenses in some investments in U.S. cards, but maybe you can kind of give us, but you\u2019ve also haven\u2019t seen much of a decline in markets expenses in the corporate bank yet, seasonally we should expect some decline revenues. And then layering - maybe layering on top of that date on single operating platform in the global retail business and what that could mean for expenses longer term? Thanks. John Gerspach : Lots of mouthful Jim, okay. Jim Mitchell : Yeah. John Gerspach : It\u2019s alright, that\u2019s okay. I\u2019ll try to take it one at a time. As we\u2019ve said we\u2019re really focused on operating Citicorp towards an efficiency ratio and so we\u2019re committed to operating Citicorp overall in an efficiency ratio in that mid-50% range for the year. And so that\u2019s you know \u2013certainly near term that\u2019s what you should expect us to do. Regarding some of the items that you mentioned, I do think that as we get further into next year, certainly we begin to see some of the regulatory cost growth, those trends begin to abate. So we think that we are towards the end of that growth cycle, but that\u2019s something really for 2016 story, I don\u2019t see that for the second half of this year. As for everything else, we\u2019re focused on being the most efficient that we possible get can, we\u2019ve given you the efficiency targets for those different businesses. And certainly in a different rate environment, we would certainly expect our efficiency performance to be even better. Jim Mitchell : But ex-rates you would say 55 is sort of your steady state? John Gerspach : You know we said mid-50s for this year, could we do something more sure, but you take a look at the progress that we\u2019ve made already, we\u2019re operating Citicorp at 55%, we\u2019re operating Citigroup overall with an efficiency ratio of 56%. I\u2019d say that to date we are certainly well ahead of what most of our peer institutions have been able to do. So I feel pretty good about the work that we\u2019ve already done and while, we can continue and we always will continue to get better. I don\u2019t know that we want to get much better. We do want to make sure that we\u2019ve got enough power to make important investments in those Citicorp businesses. Jim Mitchell : Now that\u2019s fair. And then maybe one just accounting question on the DTA you used 1.2 billion last quarter, it seems like that dropped the values using up 300 million this quarter, yet looks like North America net income was pretty similar to last quarter, why the balance, why not using more DTAs this quarter? John Gerspach : Well the answer there is three initials OCI. When you take a look at what happened on the available for sale portfolio which some of their rate rise that we had, OCI ended up impacting us. If you take a look at the contribution from earnings, the contribution from earnings on DTA was roughly similar to the first quarter both Citicorp and Citi Holdings combined to use roughly $800 million of DTA in both the first and the second quarter, but the difference in the way the two quarters pan out really has to do with OCI. Jim Mitchell : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. First one is just the timing and the puts and takes you mentioned OneMain be in the late third quarter hopeful. Can the debt repurchase coincide with that, how long of a delay there and then also Costco coming in. I am just more of timing the good guidance you give us on the puts and takes on the NIM in the back half and going as a next year? John Gerspach : Yeah, I mean you know Glenn, what we\u2019re working to would be to do the best job we can of matching up the cost of the debt buybacks with the gain recognition on OneMain, that\u2019s a very much our focus and that\u2019s what we are going to try to do. And then as far as Costco, you know as we\u2019ve said that contract is due to kick in April 1st of next year, so that will be something towards the second quarter. Glenn Schorr : Great, I\u2019ll look for a simple clarification on the equities and the 170 as I think you said charge on the valuation side, what were you financing, why is get revalue, I am just curious of the mechanics, I understand that it\u2019s not going to repeat I hope? John Gerspach : No, these are just financing transactions that result from the processing and funding of client treating activity primarily on our prime brokerage business. And the charge that I mentioned was related to a very limited number of financing transactions where we just felt that was necessary, they were just the value of collateral to reflect the current estimate of its liquidity characteristics. Glenn Schorr : Is that - is that means there is some realized losses related to PB balances because it\u2019s a - actually don\u2019t think I am in real \u2026? John Gerspach : No, no, no - no, no, this is not they do is realized losses at all. As matter of fact I would say that given what we know today based upon everything that we\u2019ve got, what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve just took an appropriate and a prudent charge to revenues. We continue to work with the parties involved and so this is still very much a work in process. As of today all the promise payments have been made on schedule and we anticipate that these financing transactions will be resolved hopefully over the next several weeks. And to your question is as long as the remaining schedule payments are received, we will not realize a loss and therefore the charge that we\u2019ve actually taken would actually be reversed back driven. Glenn Schorr : Good, here is a last one. I thought given all the volatility and pick and your EM heavy franchise, the local markets franchise, I thought the performance is good concerning all the disruption late in the quarter. I am just curious, was there disruption late in the quarter and the things that happened late in the quarter, have we seen a reversal of any of that so far in July? John Gerspach : You know I\u2019d say we had a couple of periods of disruption during the quarter that we manage to work our way through. And I think it\u2019s a little bit early right now to make comments on the overall tone what\u2019s rating will be for the balance of the third quarter, but we managed to work our way through a series of events. Glenn Schorr : Alright, thanks a lot John. John Gerspach : Alright. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning, John. John Gerspach : Hi. Brennan Hawken : Just to clarify, you guys sort of adjusted the GCB target for the full year versus last quarter but is there any impact to your target that you are shooting for to exit the year or does that still remain in the previous rate? John Gerspach : No, the - what we would say is we haven\u2019t adjusted the target. The target is remains that we believe that business should be able to operate it in an efficiency ratio of 49% to 52%. However given where we are in this year and given the fact that we do want to begin to put some additional marketing spend against U.S. branded cards in the third and fourth quarter which we think is the right thing to do from a top line - future top line growth point of view. The overall efficiency ratio for the business for this year is likely to be slightly higher than 52% somewhere in that 52% to 53% range. We\u2019ll give you guidance on next year and where we expect that business to be when we are talking about the third and the fourth quarter. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thanks for that. And I know that sequential quarter doubt is can be somewhat difficult, but is it possible to provide some color on what drove the pickup in Citicorp expenses quarter-over-quarter on a constant dollar basis and maybe the quarter-over-quarter uptick in quarter efficiency for GCB? John Gerspach : Yeah, most of the expense increase that we are seeing really has to do with pressure coming out of regulatory and compliance types of cost. I think that\u2019s something that you are probably here throughout the industry at this point in time. Brennan Hawken : Okay and those regulatory and compliance costs are captured in the quarter expense as opposed to be considered legal and repositioning right? John Gerspach : Absolutely. Brennan Hawken : Perfect. John Gerspach : They are in our core operating expense and everything is in our efficiency ratio. Brennan Hawken : Got it, got it. And so is that way you guys highlighted on the expense front in international GCB that you had the up west from volumes but you didn\u2019t see that translation into revenue, is that because of that regulatory headwind? John Gerspach : Well that\u2019s not the - that\u2019s not an expense headwind but that is a different type of regulatory headwind. As I think I mentioned in the past, what happened in Asia especially last year and it continues somewhat into this year, almost every country has passed some form of what the U.S. did back in 2010 with the Card act and so they put in a series of debt caps and interest rate caps. So those are headwinds that are impacting us on a revenue point - from a revenue point of view and we now believe, we do believe that those spread headwinds are beginning to abate particularly in the second half of the year as we lap the imposition of those new regulation. But that\u2019s what\u2019s impacting us on the revenue line. That\u2019s a little different from the other regulatory and compliance headwinds that we faced on the expense line. Brennan Hawken : Okay, terrific. Last question from me, thinking about Holdings and the North American mortgage book, as of last quarter, about 24 or so billion of the 54 billion mortgage was second lean which is might saying that it\u2019s basically not market above, so I am just kind of curious of the remaining roughly 50 billion of mortgage that is first lean. How much of that do you carry the core responding second lean on your balance sheet and therefore you probably wouldn\u2019t want to sell those mortgages to put yourself kind of orb yourself negatively in the structure, I just trying to think about sizing what\u2019s left to sell in mortgage? John Gerspach : You know Brennan I don\u2019t have that particular figure either with me or in my head, so I can\u2019t answer that question for you right now. We do have as you can see later in the deck, of the mortgage that remaining 51 of mortgages, about 23 of that is home equity. And as you can see that\u2019s declining at a fairly steady rate of about $1 billion a quarter. Obviously we\u2019re going through the reset period now \u201815, \u201816 and \u201817 are the year where virtually about 13 billion of 12 billion of that portfolio go through rate reset. And the rate resets are performing well now. What we\u2019re hopeful of is that the market begins to get a sense that the rate reset issue is not really a big detuned that perhaps a market for home equity loans will open up if not later this year then perhaps earlier mid next year. And then that might give us the opportunity to work down those balances in home equity loans at an even faster rate. Brennan Hawken : Thanks a lot for all the color John. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. John Gerspach : Hi Matt. Matt O'Connor: The color on the NIM - the color on the NIM in terms of OneMain and some of the houses was helpful. Just as I just try and put all together and thing about the earnings impact and the capital impact of those three things, one there in Costco debt restructuring. Any color there you can give us? John Gerspach : No, I really haven\u2019t put the whole capital impact a story of each of those things into my head, so I apologize for that. Obviously we are not doing, OneMain is something that we\u2019ve focused on for some period of time, so that is all part of the holding story and trying to continue to wind down holding, so we would look at that as something is exiting a what is really a good business but if one that just doesn\u2019t fit with our strategy and Costco we continue to believe that that is something that will be accretive to next year. So we feel well about that. But I can\u2019t link the capital story for you of those three separate things, I am sorry Matt. Matt O'Connor: Okay, are the earnings impact, you said past that a way is to have the NIM drag but obviously there is some credit cost and expenses and things like that especially to OneMain as well? John Gerspach : Yeah, OneMain you know again, OneMain is part of Holdings. You know what we are trying to do with Holdings and our target for Holdings is to remain above breakeven. OneMain certainly is a contributing of significant contributor to Holdings profitability but it\u2019s by no means the only profitable business that exists in that portfolio. And so we continue to believe that we can even with the disposition of OneMain, the earnings of the remaining portfolio plus the effect of the ongoing expense reductions as well as the continued retirement of high cost funding and we\u2019ll have other episode of gains and losses. So we think that that will enable us to maintain Holdings into next year at no worse than breakeven on an annual basis. Matt O'Connor: Okay and then just within North America retail banking you mentioned that passes spreads for improving and that was a key driver of the revenue. What\u2019s driving their deposit pressure that just mix of what is that? John Gerspach : Yeah, we\u2019ve been - if you take a look at our overall focus on deposits, deposit quality and cost of something that we\u2019ve been focused on for the better part of two plus years at this point in time. We see a definitive tradeoff as far as what you can do to be able to optimize your deposits. When it comes to optimizing deposits, we look at both making sure that we are improving the liquidity value of the deposits as well as then optimizing the cost, but there is a lot of situations where we\u2019re actually willing to pay more for high quality deposits if it gives us the ability then to shed low quality non-operating deposits. The whole - this whole topic of non-operating deposits is something that again we\u2019ve been focused on now for five, six quarter and we\u2019ve been steadily driving down our non-operating deposits. You know that\u2019s benefited us both from terms of a liquidity point of view and I think from and our ability then to overall fund the franchise. Matt O'Connor: Okay, thank you very much. Operator : You next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. With regard to your efficiency ratio, you are at 55% for Citicorp, you mentioned the growth and some of the regulatory growth should abate next year and you also said it should be better if and when interest rates go up, so and you saw project Rainbow actually if you give an update on that? So where should the long term efficiency ratio go and at what point would you think about being more aggressive with that target and again an update on project Rainbow? Mike Corbat : Mike I think a lot of and John touched on it a bit where we go with our efficiency ratio is going to be function of the environment. We would be pushing towards in a rising rate environment. Obviously we\u2019ve talked about our sensitivity the rates and the impact in terms of revenues and our belief that we could get a lot of those revenues to the bottom line as rates begin to come up. And so we\u2019ve tried to be mindful, we said when we set to mid-50s that was predicated on a low to mid-single-digit revenue growth environment which is unfortunately proved to be the case as that revenue environment changes we would adjust our efficiency of that again trying to deliver positive operating leverages a result of that. Mike Mayo : And what about your ROA target, I mean you added over 100 basis points low and is 90 basis point. At what point would you consider increasing that target and I am not saying to do away with the concrete targets over a concrete timeframe but for next year or long term normalize so where should the ROA be? John Gerspach : You know Mike, let me just jump in for a second because I think it\u2019s going to be hard for us to give a long term guidance as far as return on assets until we get more clarity around some of the regulatory rules that still need to be set including especially the TLAC. So it\u2019s possible that all financial institutions including us might actually as a result of TLAC, we force to put on levels of debt that would serve no other purpose - no other purpose but is certainly serve the purpose to end up grossing up our balance sheet which could therefore inhibit any bank\u2019s ability to improve ROA. So before we give longer term targets on ROA, we\u2019d like to see the rules under which we\u2019ll need to be operating. Mike Mayo : And then just going back to my earlier question, one factor that\u2019s more unique to you guys project Rainbow as you consolidate your systems, you think it had more efficiency gains from that how much you are going to reinvest some of the savings, where do you stand with that? Mike Corbat : You know Rainbow continues on its path of implementation, we continue to go live in countries around the world. And as we\u2019ve talked about historically when we launched Rainbow, we launched it with the premise that it would be an expense savor for us and in essence have rationalized the target that. What we\u2019ve seen is a combination of not just expense save but also some revenues gains as we\u2019ve got the system in place. We\u2019ve talked about from timeframe perspective, we continue to roll that out and fund it organically. And so work in progress but the result so far are quite positive. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Mike. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of John McDonald with Sanford Bernstein. Please go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Hi this is [indiscernible] on for John. John Gerspach : Hi. Unidentified Analyst : Just had a quick question on revenues, the revenue in corp other has jumped up a little bit last few quarters and I know you mentioned some gains. So just if you could talk a little bit about what level at you are a little bit more sustainable at? John Gerspach : Yeah, I think that you know longer terms you\u2019d probably expect Corp other revenues to be something in the 100 to maybe 200 range, so somewhere maybe even 150 to 200. So this is at somewhat higher levels right now. And we noted the fact that it included some gains on the sale of real estate and continued debt buybacks. Debt buybacks, the hedging activities that\u2019s all what we consider to be normal type of activity that could go into Corp other. The sale of the real estate gains and that generated about a $140 million of gains this quarter. So that\u2019s what I think you are really seeing is pumping up Corp other. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And then somewhat follow-up, looking at international consumer loan growth, it looks like trends are pretty good, ex-Korean, just wondering sort of what your outlook was there? John Gerspach : For international consumer or for Korea, I just want to make sure. Unidentified Analyst : For international consumer more broadly. John Gerspach : Okay. Well again we think that the drivers that we have in that business continue to reflect pretty well on the strength of the franchise. We would continue to expect to see both growth in deposits and average loans. And hopefully investment sales will continue, obviously investment sales are somewhat depended upon the overall state of the markets. And as I mentioned, we\u2019ve gotten I think reasonable - in the current environment reasonable growth coming out of the retail banking piece of the franchise. We had 3% revenue growth this quarter. We need to get the card\u2019s franchise back contributing and that\u2019s really more matter of just being able to lap those regulatory changes and make sure then that we\u2019ve seen the abatement in the spread pressure that we\u2019ve otherwise been facing, which is why we are more confident on the revenue growth of that franchise going into the second half of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, thank you. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. John Gerspach : Hi Steven. Steven Chubak : Hi. John I had a one quick question on capital. I was hoping you could give us some inside or incremental color on what contingency plans you might have in place if the Fed were to incorporate GCB surcharges in CCAR, just given that it could have a pretty meaningful impact on your return profile as well as your payout capacity? John Gerspach : Yeah, if the - let me approach it this way, one, if that would have to happen it would impact the entire industry not just us. So we\u2019d really have to take a look at what the entire industry response is. Secondly, it will depend upon what GCB surcharge they were to add to the CCAR requirements. I don\u2019t know how the GCB surcharge will be calculated, I guess we\u2019ll all find that out Monday and that should be informative. If they give us the opportunity, if they come up with a GCB surcharge that we can actually manage and therefore take effective actions against then certainly part of our action plan would be to really focus on managing down our GCB surcharge. Thirdly, if they were to add the GCB surcharge into CCAR, I don\u2019t know what changes they might also make in the CCAR process itself. Don\u2019t forget some of the things that they build into CCAR such as the market shock actually serve the purpose of putting more stress on the larger institutions already. So you would think that if they were going to put the pressure on the capital then to be fair, they might take some of the pressure of the CCAR calculation themselves. So there is a lot that is unknown about what may happen and so contingency plans at this in time are somewhat dependent upon the scenario in which we\u2019re ultimately dealing. Steven Chubak : I understand. I appreciate that color John. And maybe just one more picky question on DTA, I did appreciate the color you had given surrounding the AOCI impacts of weighing on the pace of consumption. But just wanted to get a sense as to what drove the increase in the net operating losses, just given AOCI hedge are typically a timing DTA as you and it did increase by north of 500 million which is not immaterial? John Gerspach : No. No, no, no, you\u2019re absolutely right. What the - that roughly 500 plus million dollar increase that you see in the back of the investor deck during the second quarter was actually cause by a $900 million in state and local net operating losses. That all resulted from audit settlements that we concluded during the quarter. So that influx of the state and local NOLs was partially offset by the utilization of roughly $500 million of FTCs in the quarter and the difference is it has to do with the general business credits. But the NOLs that we added in as a result of the audit settlements have got a 20 year life on them. So we\u2019ve got every confidence in the world that we\u2019re going to be able to generate use of those that $900 million of NOLs. And importantly the FTCs that were utilizing or the FTCs that will actually near term expiration dates in \u201817 and \u201818. Steven Chubak : Okay, thanks for clarifying that John and thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem Steven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John Gerspach : Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Just a follow-up question on the expense ratio and just a little bit of different angle on asking about the consumer where you\u2019ve indicated that for the near term the expense ratio would rise as you are reinvesting in the business. I know just you didn\u2019t change the overall company expense ratio, so just wanted to see if what you are saying is you\u2019ve got other cost saves even further ahead of plan happening elsewhere in the organization that\u2019s funding, this investments spend in consumer or you are saying we see good payback relatively good timeframe and as a result we\u2019re just going to let this rise up a little bit as reinvesting, we\u2019ll get it back next year? John Gerspach : Yeah, I\u2019d say it\u2019s some combination of all of that Betsy. When we take a look at trying to manage Citi, overall Citi to an efficiency ratio, it\u2019s very much as you say we\u2019ve got several things to look at, the performance of the ICG which from an expense point of view, even at efficiency ratio point of view this year has been quite good. We\u2019ve got consumer which has made great progress on its expenses but with the performance of the ICG and the performance of other things that we see in some of the staff functions, we feel that we\u2019ve got a little room then to let consumer and run this year at slightly higher efficiency rations and still bring the full firm in at our overall target. And we thing that letting consumer go a little bit higher in this year especially because of some higher levels of marketing and investment spend will actually then have much better payoffs in the future exactly as you outlined. Betsy Graseck : And so when you are thinking about where you putting your incremental dollar to work, as you as considering the best place right now? John Gerspach : We\u2019re very focused on U.S. branded cards. We think that U.S. branded cards is an excellent business. And consumer overall we think gives us excellent returns, we obviously have a lot of things going on with Rainbow and what not, so you don\u2019t want to overload activity into anyone area, but focusing specifically on branded cards, we think that there is good payback to begun from branded cards. As a matter of fact well all the investment that we\u2019ve made in order to I think that Jud and his team have done a great job as far as completely restacking the product offering that we have in U.S. branded cards in order to get the maximum amount of the work that they have done, we need to put a little bit more marketing dollars at work. Betsy Graseck : And then just lastly on card, you indicated that you are likely to get back some of the NIM compression from some of the - from the exists impart from portfolios like Costco, you know it\u2019s - you know understanding that there is some other portfolios out there that could be of interest to, could you just give us a senses to how you are thinking about, what kind of financial hurdles and goals you have in mind when you are looking at portfolios for purchase? John Gerspach : Well, we look at each portfolio standalone. We understand the targets that we\u2019re working towards. And it\u2019s not just a matter of looking at a portfolio and seeing does it make economic sense, it has to be a portfolio that really fits in with the business, that\u2019s one of the reasons why Costco was so attractive to us just because of the incredible client strength that they bring and it meshes is very well with the client profile that we\u2019re looking at. So for us Costco was a natural fit, other portfolios may not have that same good client mix. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi good morning. John Gerspach : Good morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My question is on how your best in class capital ratios particularly on the leverage is impacting your client conversations in markets. Do you get a sense that some of your competitors that held for example a much lower SLR and therefore have a less balance sheet to give are being less aggressive with in terms of competing in market or not really as competition really as curious as ever and the leverage ratio differences aren\u2019t really making an impact? Mike Corbat : Erika, it is Mike. I would say that competition is fear so I am not going to dismiss that. But we don\u2019t have some of those same constraints and I would say we probably see it more pronounced in Europe where the European banks by enlarge our constrained by their leverage ratios. And I think we\u2019ve been able to consistently be in front of our clients and smartly trying to use our balance sheet with them which obviously drives the ancillary revenue. So we have seen that and have tried to take advantage of that as an opportunity. Erika Najarian : Got it and just a follow-up question. John, the way you sort of answered Steven\u2019s GCB question on the CCAR, I am assuming also that until we get final rules in TLAC, we won\u2019t see you guys lagging in any potential issuance ahead of having the rules finalize in the U.S.? John Gerspach : You know we\u2019re continuing to do debt issuance if that\u2019s request and obviously we\u2019ve matter of fact when we take a look at the amount of preferred and the amount of debt that we issued last question, I\u2019d say was quite substantial. We issued roughly - roughly we issued $2 billion of preferred, we did $3 billion of sub-debt and we did $5.5 billion worth of senior debt. So we did $10.5 billion worth of issuance last quarter and of course we also bought some debt back but overall we were in net issuer of 8 plus billion dollar worth of offerings. Erika Najarian : And based on how you are understating the proposals, could you give us a range on what your TLAC is at the end of the quarter, the TLAC ratio? John Gerspach : We\u2019ll give you more guidance on that next week when we do fixed income call, but the numbers that I\u2019ve seen would suggest that our TLAC ratio now is a - instep a little bit over where it was last quarter, I think we\u2019re at 21.3% as of the end of June, but we\u2019ll form up all the numbers for you when we do the fixed income call next week. Erika Najarian : Got it, thanks so much. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon, gentlemen, thanks for taking my calls - my questions. John, just a question on the U.S. branch system, that\u2019s down about 15% year-over-year, however you\u2019ve got sort of expense reductions at least for part of this expense reduction is down about 3% year-over-year, is there more to go in terms of the U.S. branch count or are you pretty much done with that? John Gerspach : I\u2019d say we\u2019re pretty much done. There is still probably some slimming that we could do as far as completing the focus of the branches on the seven focus cities. I think we\u2019re a little over a 90% now of branches that are in our seven focus cities. So there could be some additional but I think also importantly there is probably some case to made for opening up some additional outlets in some of those cities as well just to make sure that we\u2019ve actually got the proper coverage. I used the term outlet as opposed the branch because I am not sure that in the future every outlet that we open will look like one of the branches that are out there today. It\u2019s much more likely that the branches of the future will be somewhat smaller in line with the fact that many more of our customers who are transacting with us by alternate mean is using mobile banking and the Internet. Matt Burnell : And then from my follow-up, just a question on your comment in terms of investment banking taking market share, it sounded like you were taking more market share in North America perhaps then at least in this quarter than you did in outside the U.S., is that also true in the markets business because a number of other banks this quarter have implied that they continue to get market share at least on the market side of the equation outside the U.S. to a greater degree than they are getting it in the - within the U.S.? John Gerspach : You know you take a look at market in wallet share on any individual quarter. We try to look more at market share in longer term trends. We are continuing to add market in wallet share especially against our focus clients in both investment banking as well as with our markets business. And we see that as a strength of our franchise but I can\u2019t tell you whether we actually took market share in a particular business during the quarter. I don\u2019t track it quarter-to-quarter, I tend to look at more trends on a trailing 12 months basis. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally, you did 26% increase in equity markets if we exclude the valuation adjustment. How much of that was the result of improved activity in Asia? John Gerspach : A very piece of it that stem from Asia, Asia was one of our primary engine for growth. I don\u2019t have the percentage in my head but it was - it was the primary driver. Matt Burnell : Great, thanks very much John. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. John, just a couple of clarification questions please. One, I just want to make sure on the efficiency guidance for GCB, was that new guidance than what you had previously stated? John Gerspach : I believe it was. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And so can you just repeat that? John Gerspach : Previously, just to be clear, I believe that the when I spoke last quarter we would have said that we thought that GCB would be end the year with have an efficiency ratio for the full year near the top end of the range that we had set out the 49% to 52%. But with the some of the incremental spend what we are looking to do particularly in U.S. branded card that\u2019s going to knock that just slightly above. So that\u2019s why I wanted to make sure you were aware of the fact that it\u2019s likely to end they have for the full year an efficiency ratio slightly above where I would have said at the last time. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. Great, thanks for clarifying that. And just on the debt repurchases and the debt issuance that you went through with Erika a moment ago, where those consistent with the plan for this year or they - is the plan different than the one that that we talked about last quarter? John Gerspach : No, it\u2019s consistent with the plan. I mean we may have pulled forward some of the issuance into the second quarter that we otherwise would have planned to do in the third quarter, but we\u2019re still on our plan and we\u2019ll have more to say about debt issuances on Tuesday. Eric Wasserstrom : Sure. And the pull forward presumably was because of rate and market opportunity? John Gerspach : Yeah, we have the opportunity to do some larger amounts than we otherwise would have given on the heels of certainly the first quarter results that we had and I think you\u2019ve seen kind of continues with the second quarter results, we found a favorable market for debt and we didn\u2019t want to disappoint any investors. Eric Wasserstrom : Great, thanks very much. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi John. John Gerspach : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : John, can you remind us putting off to the side for a moment the possibility of GCB being included in CCAR, can you remind us what the binding constrain on the capital ratio, which ratio were you guys looking at as that binding constrain? John Gerspach : Yeah, right now, if the GCB surcharge comes in at the 400 basis points that we would currently estimated to be, it\u2019s sort of running neck and neck between the CET 1 ratio including the GCB surcharge. And what we would look at as far as the CCAR requirements. And that is somewhat dependent upon the scenario that you might get out of CCAR et cetera but it\u2019s pretty much neck and neck CET 1 with GCB and CCAR. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, thank you. You\u2019ve talked about growing the card business and you\u2019ve had success with acquisitions, now you are putting more muscle into growing that business organically. If you - as you go on the offence from the defensive position you\u2019ve been in the past, are there other areas you guys are looking to grow possibly through acquisitions separate from cards? Mike Corbat : I would say that when we think of acquisitions as John spoke earlier would need to be very much in strategy and it would be probably much more bias towards portfolios rather than business acquisitions. So again around our framework fitting in business and having the right accretive attributes where worldwide open to portfolio purchases. Gerard Cassidy : And then my final question, overall credit continues to improve for you folks and the industry but I did notice that nonaccrual area incorporate North America sequentially had a jump in your nonaccruals whereas Latin America had a significant improvement. Could you give us some color on both of those line items? John Gerspach : Yeah, the - let\u2019s start with the Latin America line item, that really refluxed an asset sale that we had done, so we actually exited a nonaccrual loan during the quarter so that - you see that reflected in bringing down the nonaccrual loans in Latin America. And then as far as the increase in nonaccrual loans in North America that\u2019s largely driven by some additional classifications of nonaccrual loans coming out of our energy portfolio. Gerard Cassidy : And was that as a result of the Shared National Credit Exam, I assume or nowhere something separate? John Gerspach : Well, it\u2019s in connection with the Shared National Credit, we had decided to classify good portion of those loans is nonaccrual. And then what happens, so that let\u2019s leave it like that. But again so from an overall energy exposure point of view, our energy exposure actually declined during the quarter, as far as the exposure that we have to the producer type of client other than that we added to the energy exposure in what we consider to be more the high grade energy processors as far as our multinational clients. So we saw an overall increase in the energy exposure but a decrease in the exposure that we have to the exploration type of clients. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thank you. Yeah, most of my questions have been answered, so I have one follow-up questions related to the North America cards and the additional investment spend. I mean we think about it from a receivables point of view I mean where you have additional investment spend, I mean what are the expectations around receivable growth? I guess so differently, is that investment spend needed just to stabilize receivables or you expecting growth above from the arm what you have already because from 1Q to 2Q you saw 8% growth annualize, so you looking to get even further beyond that with those additional investment spend? John Gerspach : I am not quite sure but that 8% number that you referenced that doesn\u2019t quite ring with me, but we would expect then that the incremental market. When you are thinking about cards, it is somewhat of a time sensitive process and so when you spend marketing dollars, the first thing you are doing is you are acquiring accounts then you make those accounts active then those accounts get into spending and then from that spending you end up growing receivables. So marketing dollars spend today are likely to be growing receivables more in the 2017 range than early on in 2016. So it\u2019s not a case of you just add marketing dollars and you certainly sprout receivables. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great, thank you. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Hilder with Drexel Hamilton. Please go ahead. David Hilder : Thank very much. Just a quick question on the Citi Holdings assets, I think you said that Citi Holdings is at 6% of total assets and it looks like from the footnote, it\u2019s more like 13% of your risk weighted assets, so it looks like the risk weighted assets in Citi Holdings are not coming down as fast as total assets, do you think that kind of relationship will continue and is it related to any particular type of asset to the Holdings? John Gerspach : Well when you take a look at Citi Holdings in particularly, as we got out of the risky assets in Citi Holdings early on we were very focused on making sure that we got out of the most risky assets in Citi Holdings. That relationship between risk weighted assets and GAAP assets in Citi Holdings has been steadily declining. So we\u2019ve got now a $116 billion worth of GAAP assets sitting there in Citi Holdings. The RAP assets, the risk weighted assets associated with Citi Holdings earnings $169 billion. So you know David, we\u2019ve been de-risking the Holdings portfolio all along and so there isn\u2019t a big multiplier effect anymore associated with that holdings asset. Within that 169 billion, $49 billion of the risk weighted assets are there for operating risk. So it\u2019s really a $120 billion worth of credit and market risk RWA associated with $116 worth of GAAP asset, so it\u2019s virtually a one to one relationship at this point in time between credit and risk - market risk, risk weighted assets and GAAP assets. David Hilder : Great. Actually the reference or explanation on operating risk is actually quite helpful. Thanks very much. John Gerspach : Very, very happy to help you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : John, I was very curious in your comment, most of the banks are getting ask about G-SIB in the inclusion in the CCAR, but now so we had done, there was some talk about counter cyclical buffer side the very beginning of this going into G-SIB. If you look at the counter cyclical buffer average for the money some of banks have 2.5%, the credit loss is in CCAR averaged 2.7%, you look at the G-SIB buffer average for the money center banks kind of looks like now it\u2019s around 3% and if you look at operational loses, it\u2019s actually 3.1%. So your concept of well what through the overall G-SIB buffer in the CCAR then they had have to make some adjustment to operational losses. I think I just was going to ask you to kind of think about that and expand on that concept? John Gerspach : Yeah, I wasn\u2019t focused so much Marty on operational loses but there are other aspects of CCAR such as the market risk shock that we all go along with. That market risk shock is really targeted against the major banks. And because the way that market risk shock actually impacts the banks there is a doubling up effect on PPNR reduction and market risk shock. It\u2019s something that it\u2019s known by I guess CCAR [ph] autos and I mean - and again if there was going to be some add on the I can call it the denominator the capital, the I am going to say hope or my thought process would be that we could explore some reduction then in some of the add-ons that go into generating the losses. But I agree with you, it wouldn\u2019t be operational risk, it\u2019s really just in the way that the CCAR calculations are done and the scenarios are constructed. Marty Mosby : Just on saying that that would be coincide then all that these buffers are almost equaling the losses in CCAR and then when you look at the non-money center banks, they have very little operational loss at all and then have any G-SIB buffer. So it\u2019s just the parallel calculation seem to be more than just reveal? John Gerspach : Yeah, maybe, I don\u2019t have any inside into how the Fed has come up with some of their models, but I am sure they are quite good at it. Marty Mosby : Last thing I am going to ask is, and I appreciate the time. As you look at your tangible book value, you\u2019ve without these extra charges because you\u2019ve tied a lot of thing reserved and those what\u2019s are ahead but just assume that less of the head versus what we\u2019ve seen in the past, are your ability to repurchase add or below tangible book value when the returns improving, growth this quarter annualize the tangible book values about 8%, it just seems like that acceleration could continue into the future and just want to see your thoughts on that? Thanks. John Gerspach : Well, agree with you that we do think that overtime we have the ability to grow tangible book, obviously as I mentioned before one of the items that you are always focused on with tangible book is the impact of rates on your AFS portfolio and you\u2019ve seen that there were times when that can have a - that can play a heavy hand in dampening down the growth, but we do believe that if we can continue to perform we should the way we have been, we have the opportunity to continue to grow tangible book. It\u2019s one of the reasons why we think that continuing with stock repurchases is the right thing to do from a capital return point of view. Marty Mosby : Thanks again. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Christopher Wheeler with Atlantic Equities. Please go ahead. Christopher Wheeler : Yes, good morning, gentlemen. David Hilder set my question out really well, he is colleague of mine. I actually do with the rundown of Citi Holdings that how that impacts this weighted assets because you mentioned the 34 billion which you basically got baked in and you just touched on the relationship between the GAAP assets and the RWA. So if we were to be looking at what is going to happen to the 12.79 billion of RWA you had fully faced at the end of the second quarter, I mean obviously I would imagine that a minimum would be 34 billion coming of that pro forma. And I supposed to question I am asking is how much more might come off in respect of the uplift between the GAAP assets and RWA? And also perhaps how much you think you might use in actually growing the business during that period? Thank you. John Gerspach : Thank you, Christopher. Let me pass through some of those questions. First, just to be clear the assets that we\u2019ve got under contract is 32 billion, I think I heard you say 34. Christopher Wheeler : I must - I think that\u2019s just me, I went too many bank results obviously in few days. John Gerspach : Sorry, I don\u2019t mean to add to your numbers, but I just wanted to make sure that you\u2019ve focused on the 32. As much as I said that overall there is a virtually a one to one relationship between credit and market risk RWA and GAAP RWA that obviously is not the same with each asset that we have and included in that $32 billion worth of assets that I mentioned of course is the sale of our Japan retail bank. On our Japan retail bank would be one of those situations where the RWA associated where actually be much less than the GAAP assets. So I can\u2019t guide you to how much RWA is associated with the overall 32 but I wouldn\u2019t immediately jump to the conclusion that the 32 is one for one reduction in RWA. Mike Corbat : And John the piece I would add to that is from an expectation perspective, John mentioned the $49 billion of assets associated with operations, as assets come down you can\u2019t simply release the ops RWA, it\u2019s going to take time to work through that, so you should expect to see as a percentage of Holdings RWA as we reduce assets that ops piece continuing to growth both as a percentage. Yeah. Christopher Wheeler : Both as a percentage. Okay, thank you very much, that\u2019s very helpful, thank you. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Susan Kendall : Great, thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions please feel free to follow-up with Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes your conference for today.

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Regina. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today, and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the risk factor section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael L. Corbat: Thank you Susan and good morning everyone. Earlier today we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the third quarter of 2015 or $1.31 per share excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. The quarter had more than its fair share of volatility and our results speak to the resilience of our franchise globally. And despite the revenue headwinds we once again proved our ability to manage our expenses and will remain on track to deliver our full year efficiency and return on asset targets.  I feel good about the quality and consistency of the earnings that we have demonstrated through the course of the year. We have also made strong progress against our other core priorities. We achieved both positive operating leverage and continued loan and deposit growth in our core businesses. We continued to improve the quality of our balance sheet by replacing legacy assets from Citi Holdings with high solid loans in Citicorp.  Citi Holdings was profitable again this quarter, Holdings assets declined 20% on a year-over-year end basis and we will end at 110 billion for the quarter which represents only 6% of Citigroup's balance sheet. We expect to close an additional 31 billion of asset sales during the fourth quarter. We utilized an additional 700 million in deferred tax assets this quarter bringing the total utilization to $2.1 billion through the third quarter which has contributed $3.5 billion to our regulatory capital. In total we generated $14 billion of regulatory capital so far this year and have been able to return over 4 billion of that capital to our shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends.  We grew our tangible book value to over $60 per share and our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio increased to 11.6% on a fully implemented basis. With one quarter to go we are on track to hit our financial targets in return of assets and our efficiency ratio and we also earned a 10% return on tangible common equity so far this year.  Turning to the results of our businesses, while the uncertain environment clearly dampened client activity in our market products, we made good progress in other areas. With revenue growth in treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank equities also grew. And while our total fixed income revenues were under pressure we saw continued strength in our emerging market franchise. We also continued to see momentum in M&A year-to-date as a result of investments we\u2019ve made in that business.  Internationally our consumer banking business was also impacted by slowing growth and shifting consumer sentiment most notably in Asia. In the U.S. our retail franchise continued to grow revenues, loans, and deposits even as we continued to sharpen the focus of our branch footprint. And in branded cards we are seeing growth in active accounts and purchase sales although it\u2019s going to take some time for the full benefit of our investments in this business to be reflected in our results.  As we look to the end of the year, we still don\u2019t have clarity on many important issues. Predictions on the timing of an interest rate increase seem to change every day. We don\u2019t yet know the long-term impact of recent volatility on consumer and business sentiment. And in many large markets, there are high degrees of political risk which have economic ramifications. I think that this quarter showed that we are well equipped to handle what the world throws our way whether it\u2019s managing our risk, our expenses, or our capital. Challenging environments have become the norm and the work we\u2019ve done to make our firm simpler, smaller, safer, and stronger has given us a resilient and sturdy platform from which to operate. John will now go through the deck and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John. John C. Gerspach: Hey, thank you Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA, DVA, on our reported results. Excluding this item we earned $1.31 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.95 in the third quarter of 2014. On slide 4, we show a total city group results. In the third quarter we earned $4.2 billion generating a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity of 8.9%. Revenues of 18.5 billion were down 8% from last year mostly reflecting an impact of foreign exchange translation.  In constant dollars revenues declined 2% year-over-year as the slight improvement in Citicorp was more than offset by lower revenues in Citi Holdings. Expenses declined 18% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as the benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a significantly lower net loan loss reserve release.  Turning to the first nine months of 2015, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 56.5%. Net income grew about 22% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 99 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 10%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined to 1% year-over-year to 622 billion as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued line down of Citi Holdings. And deposits were flat versus last year at 904 billion also reflecting 4% growth in Citicorp offset by a decline in Citi Holdings.  On slide 5, we provide more detail on third quarter revenues in constant dollars. Citicorp revenues were up slightly year-over-year and Citi Holdings revenues declined by nearly 30% mostly reflecting higher gains on asset sales in the prior year including the impact of selling our consumer operations in Spain and Greece. On slide 6, we show more detail on expenses in constant dollars. Citicorp expenses were down 13% year-over-year driven by significantly lower legal and repositioning cost. And Citi Holdings expenses also declined on lower assets.  On slide 7, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Year-to-date Citicorp has contributed over 97% of our net income while Citi Holdings although profitable has had a limited impact on total earnings. As I just described we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter in Citicorp with revenues up slightly and expenses down 13% in constant dollars. And for the first nine months of 2015 we achieved a Citicorp efficiency ratio of 55.4%. Citi Holdings remained profitable this quarter and ended the period with $110 billion of assets.  On slide 8, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total international consumer banking revenues grew 2% year-over-year. In Latin America, excluding the gain of approximately $180 million this quarter on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico, revenues were roughly flat versus last year as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression.  Card loan balances in Mexico remained under pressure this quarter reflecting both slower economic growth and ongoing shifts in consumer behavior. However, we were able to offset this impact with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. Overall, we are maintaining a strong share of consumer loans and deposits in Mexico and importantly credit continues to perform well which I will discuss more in a moment. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower investment sales revenues as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressure in cards. We saw an industry wide slow down in activity in Asia during the quarter reflecting changes in consumer sentiment driven by slowing economic growth and the recent volatility in the capital markets.  In retail banking we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance, and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by lower investment sales revenue. And in cards we saw a slower than expected growth in purchase sales this quarter. Card loans still grew modestly year-over-year but this growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates. And regulatory changes remained a headwind as well although we continued to believe this will abate somewhat as we go forward.  In total, average international loans grew 3% from last year, card purchase sales grew 5%, and average deposits grew 4%. Operating expenses grew 1% as higher regulatory and compliance cost and technology investments were mostly offset by lower legal and repositioning cost as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit cost increased 7% from last year driven by our loan loss reserve build in Latin America. Our NCL and delinquency rates continued to improve this quarter in Latin America. However, given the macroeconomic environment we did build another loan loss reserves in particular in Brazil. We have taken a cautious approach in Brazil for several years now including the sale of our mass market credit card business, Credicard in late 2013. At less than $3 billion, the Brazil consumer portfolio now represents just 1% of our global consumer loans and we do not expect it to have a material impact on our total consumer cost of credit as we look forward.  Slide 9 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of 1.3 billion grew 3% from last year as continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads were partially offset by the impact of $15 million mortgage repurchase reserve release in the prior year.  In branded cards revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and rewards cost as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. We feel confident that we now have the right products to drive high quality account growth.  We expect the investments we are making today to generate higher net interest revenue overtime as growth in active accounts, better customer engagement, and higher purchase sales translated to higher full rate balances. We feel good about our progress to date of nearly 6% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 12% growth in purchase sales in our core products. Of course this has the revenue growth in cards will take some time and the full benefits of our actions may not be completely reflected in our results for perhaps another two years as we build new loans to offset the continued run off in our legacy products. In the interim we will benefit from inorganic growth next year with the acquisition of the Costco portfolio.  Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 2% from last year reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices as well as higher contractual partner payments, as we continued to share some of the benefits of higher yields and lower net credit losses with our retail partners. Excluding the impact of loan loss reserves, pretax income grew 7% in retail services. Total expenses of 2.3 billion in North America declined 6% as incremental investments were more than offset by lower repositioning cost and ongoing efficiency savings, as we have continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint.  Since the beginning of 2014 we have closed or sold over 200 branches and plan to exit roughly 50 more by the end of the first quarter of 2016 including our Boston area branches. With these actions we are concentrating our presence in our most productive urban markets and also adjusting our model to reflect a significant shift in transaction activity to digital channels requiring fewer branches and lower headcount per branch. This shift also improves our ability to retain customer relationships as the physical footprint changes. Even when we exit the market entirely, we have found that we are able to retain a significant portion of the consumer deposits overtime. Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Asia credit was stable again this quarter with a loss rate of roughly 80 basis points. The loss rate in North America continued to decline to 2.2%. And both the NCL and delinquency rates improved again this quarter in Latin America driven by favorable trends in our Mexico cards portfolio that we expect to continue.  Slide 11 shows the expense trends for global consumer banking. For the first nine months of the year the total efficiency ratio for global consumer banking was 53% down from 55% last year. And we expect the ratio to be roughly 53% for the full year. Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 12, revenues of 8.4 billion in the third quarter declined 3% from last year. Total banking revenues of 4 billion excluding the impact of gains on loan hedges were down 7% versus the prior year, mostly reflecting lower investment banking activity. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 1.9 billion were flat year-over-year on a reported basis. In constant dollars TTS revenues grew 7% from last year as growth in deposit balances and spreads more than offset a decline in trade revenues. This represents the seventh consecutive quarter that we\u2019ve generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues of 937 million were down 25% from last year. Equity underwriting revenues were down 43% reflecting lower industry wide activity this quarter.  Debt underwriting revenues were down 17% driven by high yield and leverage loans, products where our core clients were less active this quarter than in the prior year. And M&A revenues were down 24% compared to a very strong quarter last year. Year-to-date in 2015 we have continued to gain momentum in M&A with 16% revenue growth, sustained wallet share gains, and a strong share of announced value. Private bank revenues of 715 million grew 8% year-over-year driven by strong growth in managed investments revenue as well as higher loan and deposit balances. And corporate lending revenues of 403 million were down 9% on a reported basis.  In constant dollars lending revenues declined 4% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads and the impact of loan sale activity. Total markets and securities services revenue of 4 billion declined 5% year-over-year. Fixed income revenues of 2.6 billion were down 16% as we saw lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in the recent quarter particularly in securitized products in G10 FX. The revenue impact was most significant in North America and Western Europe and was partially offset by strong performance again this quarter in our emerging markets franchise where our fixed income revenues grew 4% year-over-year. Our G10 rates business as roughly flat year-over-year for the quarter but we did see significantly lower than expected revenues in the back half of September.  Turning to equities, excluding the impact of reversing $140 million of the valuation adjustment we recognized in the second quarter, revenues increased by 12% from last year driven by growth in derivatives with particular strength in North America and Asia. And in security services revenues declined 4% on a reported basis and were up 7% in constant dollars, reflecting increased activity and higher client balances.  Total operating expenses of 4.7 billion decreased 4% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance cost were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. Total credit costs were 309 million up sequentially reflecting a net loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release last quarter.  In both quarters we built reserves for energy related exposures. However the build was more than offset last quarter by reserve releases in other portfolios. In the third quarter we built energy related reserves of roughly $140 million or about half of the total ICG build. The remainder was split between other portfolios and the impact of overall volume growth. Of course we are working closely with our clients to mitigate the risk of losses actually being realized. Total net credit losses were $34 million this quarter and while corporate non-accrual loans increased during the quarter, more than two thirds of the loans we added remained performing.  On slide 13, we show expense and efficiency trends for the institutional business. Over the last 12 months our efficiency ratio was 57% including over 100 basis points attributable to legal and repositioning charges. And our comp ratio was 27%. We continued to expect to achieve a total ICG efficiency ratio in the range of 55% to 56% for the full year 2015.  Slide 14 shows the results for corporate and other. Revenues were higher year-over-year driven primarily by gains on debt buybacks and expenses were down mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Slide 15 shows holdings assets which totaled $110 billion at quarter end, down 20% from a year ago. We have continued to make great progress in opening down Citi Holdings with signed agreements to selling additional $37 billion of assets, $31 billion of which we currently expect to close in the fourth quarter. By year-end we currently expect Citi Holdings assets to be somewhere in the range of $70 billion to $75 billion.  On slide 16, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter. Revenues of 1.4 billion declined 32% from last year mostly reflecting lower gains on asset sales as well as divestiture activity. Expenses also declined driven mainly by the lower assets and cost of credit remains favorable driven by the North American mortgage portfolio where the total NCL rate improved to 1.2%.  On slide 17, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars showing a consistent growth trend year-over-year even as the contribution from Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 294 basis points in the third quarter, roughly in line with the prior quarter as trading NIM continued to be higher than expected.  Looking to the fourth quarter, our net interest margin will depend on a number of factors including the level of trading them, the timing of expected divestitures in Citi Holdings, and a magnitude in timing of any debt redemption actions. Given all that we currently expect our net interest margin in the fourth quarter to be in the range of 285 to 290 basis points.  On slide 18 we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.6% driven by retained earnings and DTA utilization even as we return $2.1 billion to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and common dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.8% and our tangible book value grew to over $60 per share.  In summary we continue to operate well in a challenging environment this quarter with continued cost discipline, significantly lower legal and repositioning cost, and great progress towards the wind down of Citi Holdings. Three quarters into the year we have an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 55.4%, a Citigroup ROA of 99 basis points, and we earn the return on tangible common equity of 10%.  We continued to utilize our deferred tax assets this quarter and we ended the period with a very strong capital position. We are certainly seeing the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results, but we feel good about our ability to manage risk through this cycle. We are remaining disciplined on target client strategy and feel strongly to focusing on these higher quality and more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment.  Looking to the fourth quarter, in North America consumer revenues will likely be roughly flat to the third quarter and in international consumer we expect revenue to be slight to slightly higher than last year on a constant dollar basis as we expect continued modest volume growth with Asia revenues beginning to stabilize. Turning to the institutional franchise, we continue to see good momentum across treasury and trade solutions, security services, and the private bank which together generated 8% year-over-year revenue growth in the first nine months of the year in constant dollars.  Investment banking revenues will depend in part on the overall market but we continue to feel good about the strength of our franchise particularly in M&A. And finally in markets we expect our overall performance to reflect the market environment with the goal of continuing to gain wallet share with our target clients. In Citi Holdings there are series of transactions that will impact the fourth quarter. As I noted earlier we currently expect to close roughly $31 billion of previously announced asset sales including our retail and cards businesses in Japan and one main financial. We will continue with other ongoing portfolio of sales and we also plan to redeem high cost debt.  As we have said previously we expect the net gain on the sale of OneMain to be roughly $1 billion including the cost of planned debt redemption actions. In addition, we expect to incur gains and losses on other sales including some that maybe recognized through the cost of credit like and we expect to see higher transaction related repositioning and other expenses as we are up. And so on a net basis including the impact of all of these other transaction related items we would not expect the full $1 billion gain on OneMain to fall through the bottom lot.  Finally for total Citigroup we expect our cost of credit to be roughly flat to the third quarter excluding any impact from the portfolio of sales out of Citi Holdings. And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good morning guys. Just maybe a model question. Michael L. Corbat: Good morning Jim. James Mitchell : Hey good morning. Just the asset sales, 31 billion this quarter, potentially 37 billion in total, can you help us think about the impact on capital ratios when they are done? John C. Gerspach: Well when you take a look at, I gave you that where I thought that Citi Holdings would end up on a total asset basis, GAAP asset basis for the end of the quarter or somewhere in that range of $70 billion to $75 billion of assets. So, we will certainly see a reduction but as we have said in the past particularly the Japan retail business is not risk asset heavy. So, associated with that is $31 billion worth of sales, you are looking at something that might be roughly half of that in risk weighted assets. James Mitchell : Right, okay. That is helpful, and I guess as we think about even though that is not a huge impact is that, I mean your capital ratios have expanded pretty significantly over the past 12 months. I know this is not a easy question to answer but if you look at your capital return, payout ratio is still below peers with the improvement in ratios sort of now better than most with asset sales, do you think you can get closer to peer payout ratios next year in CCAR or is there anything else we should be thinking about? Michael L. Corbat: Jim, it is Mike. I would answer that a couple of ways, one is as long as the stock continues to trade below tangible book our primary actions are going to be focused on share buyback rather than dedicating that right now towards dividend. And again we -- as our capital numbers speak, we had another strong quarter, we have had a strong year-to-date in terms of capital generation, and we have got to position the firm overtime to bring that capital back or we are simply creating our own denominator problem. So, we are focused on it. We don\u2019t know CCAR scenarios, we don\u2019t know all the processes yet but again we are very focused on it. James Mitchell : Okay, fair enough, I will stop there, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. John C. Gerspach: Hi Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. I guess I wanted to start with credit and energy specifically. I mean the performance overall has been great. I hear your comments, and I have heard past comments about mostly investment grade, largely large corporate. I am just, I am sitting back and I listened to some of our energy team and they talked about the death and destruction in the oil patch and I see the large numbers that large banks like yours have and I am trying to square the circle there and say why should we feel good about future reserves or current reserves on the energy books. So, I guess let's just revisit why we take comfort in your exposures and then maybe you could help with talking through what you do have reserved away exposures are, I would appreciate it, thanks? John C. Gerspach: Alright Glenn, so again as we have said in the past, and I will give you a bit of a run down, our energy related loans, the total exposure remains about constant to where we were last year at about $60 billion worth of total energy related exposure. The funded book has actually gone down slightly to $21 billion during the quarter. And the book does remain primarily investment grade. We have had some downgrades, we have also taken on some new business which in this market you can imagine is not necessarily at the same high level. But the overall book remains two thirds investment grade, down a little bit from -- the funded book remains two thirds investment grade and the overall exposure is still about 80% investment grade. So we feel very good about the credit quality.  Having said that we continue to work with our clients. We have been building reserves because it certainly is prudent in this environment. We told you that we took a 140 of reserves this quarter, that is roughly equal to what we took during the first half of the year. We took about 100 in the first quarter, 40 in the second. So this is something that we are looking at every day and we are adjusting the provisions accordingly. But it still remains a very high quality book and not one that is necessarily dramatically dependent on the specific price of that. Again our exposure, to what you would consider to be close to the well head you know still remains fairly small. Roughly confident about a funded book of about $6 billion and we\u2019ve worked our way through a lot of the reconsideration events of the taking a look at reserve levels. So again all I can say is that it is something that we are looking at and it is something that we still feel really good about. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s always helpful. One other question I had is just a more high level of which ways do we see your SLR premium ratio as an advantage and there is lot of downsize in Europe, lot of people trying to optimize their own balance sheets, where can we see that playing the role as a positive to help you bring on books of business and just be like basically the high bid? Michael L. Corbat: Well we don\u2019t always want to be the highest bid there. We like to get business at a reasonable price but you are right we do have a certain advantage with the SLR ratio and we feel that we are using that appropriately. Of course SLR is one ratio, you also take into account what we are doing on all the other ratios. But for instance the strength that we have got on our SLR ratio has enabled us to pursue a little bit more growth in the prime brokerage area and we see that as a way of getting additional penetration into some of our key investor clients. So again we are using it where appropriate but everything that we do is carefully thought out on several plains as you can imagine. Glenn Schorr : Yes, I appreciate that, okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matthew O'Connor: Hi, can you just elaborate a bit on why the NIM will be down 5 to 10 basis points what the assumed timing of the OneMain and balance sheet restructuring is part of that? John C. Gerspach: Why NIM is downsided. Matthew O'Connor: I am sorry, I think the outlook for 4Q is for the net interest margin percent to be down 5 to 10 basis points and there is obviously a lot of moving pieces that\u2019s going to impact that. But how do we think about core NIM overlaying the impact of OneMain to debt restructuring. I am trying to figure out if it is down that much because of those transactions or is that down that much kind of on a core basis? John C. Gerspach: No, what we\u2019ve said in the past Matt is that both the Japan retail business as well as OneMain are high NIM producing businesses. So those are high NIM producing businesses and as we shed those businesses that\u2019s going to have an impact on our NIM and take it down several basis points. I can\u2019t remember the exact number that we gave you last quarter.  Unfortunately I can\u2019t predict the timing of the sales when they will occur in the fourth quarter. So the fourth quarter is going to be somewhat of a transition quarter regarding NIM which is why I am giving you a range of 285 to 290. Once we cross the fourth quarter we\u2019ll be able to give you better guidance as to how NIM will progress in the future including don\u2019t forget we\u2019ll be bringing on the Costco portfolio in the second quarter of next year, so that would give us the ability to recapture a portion of that NIM that we are losing through the OneMain sale. And we will also make some of it back through debt buybacks, etc. but I apologize, the fourth quarter is going to be a little bit noisy from a NIM point of view and it is really going to be dependent upon the timing of all of those actions. Matthew O'Connor: So as you think about the exit level of this year of the net interest margin, essentially a good kind of 1Q 2016 level, just holding rates, holding mix, and holding all that steady how would that NIM compare to the current third quarter NIM or what you are expecting in 4Q? John C. Gerspach: Again I\u2019ll be in a much better position to give you that type of guidance and we will give you that type of guidance when we get finished with the fourth quarter and I know when these sales have closed and what impact they will then have on our reported NIM. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, and then just separately the Costco deal you mentioned the portfolio coming on in the second quarter has that been finalized in terms of pricing and everything? John C. Gerspach: No, it still hasn\u2019t been finalized yet. Obviously we are still in a process, working through a process with AMEX and with Costco and with Visa, all being guided by the terms of the contracts that exists currently between AMEX and Costco and that is really all I can say about that. Matthew O'Connor: Okay, alright, thank you. John C. Gerspach: Alright. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Michael L. Corbat: Hi. Brennan Hawken : So in the -- just following up on the Holdings questions in the sale of assets that you expect to close here in the fourth quarter, is there an updated sense about how much of the expense base of Holdings should come out on the back of this? John C. Gerspach: We haven't given that guidance. We will give you a better sense again after these deals close. You can imagine that associated with certain of these deals there are continuing transaction service arrangements where for a period of time we will be in a position of supporting the buyer with that business which means that we will retain a certain amount of the expense base into the future for which we will be paid. So, again once we determine the timing of all of these transactions and we finalize the terms of the sale including any ongoing service arrangements, I will be in a much better position to give you guidance on the impact on the Holdings expense base. Brennan Hawken : Okay, thank you. And then thinking about another exit but more recently announced Boston, can you give some color maybe on how much you think that might impact the North American GCB efficiency ratio or any other metrics? John C. Gerspach: Well I told you where we expect to end the year with the efficiency ratio global consumer and that's really what we are focused on. We intend to end there at 53% of that that we basically have now. And we haven\u2019t given any future guidance on operating efficiency ratios but it is safe to assume that in the current environment we are looking to maintain those efficiency ratios in the ranges that we have said that are our targets. So the exit of Boston is part of that overall consideration and so I wouldn\u2019t think about it as being any more accretive to the year-end target of 53% that I gave you earlier. Brennan Hawken : Sure, I wasn\u2019t referring to a go forward rather than the year end but let me try a similar idea but maybe in a broader scope, so when we think about the efficiency ratio here and if we think about a revenue environment which is clearly difficult, I know you made reference in the past to the efficiency and then the need for revenue. But if the environment remains difficult, do you have the ability to pull levers and work the efficiency ratio down further from here or are we going to be in a waiting game until the revenues can come through, just how should we think about that? John C. Gerspach: I don\u2019t want you to feel as though you are in a waiting game but what we have said is that we intend to operate the business with an efficiency ratio. And the efficiency ratio target that we have put out for Citicorp and we have put this out more than two and half years ago now, when we were looking at what we thought would be a difficult environment in 2015 and the environment has actually proved to be even more difficult I think than we thought at that point in time when we said we can operate overall Citicorp with an efficiency ratio of in the mid 50s. And that's where we are. And given this environment we still feel, again we haven\u2019t worked our way all the way through our budget considerations and everything else but in this type of environment we think that that is a pretty good efficiency ratio to be operating under. And it takes a lot of management in this type of environment to continue to operate at that efficiency ratio and still have room to make the investments that you want us to make so that when the environment improves we can generate even higher levels of revenue growth. So, all of that is tied up in those efficiency ratio targets that we have put out there. Brennan Hawken : Okay, I guess last one from me then if we think about your new card offering how is it that you would recommend we measure success based upon the change, the new products that you\u2019ve put out the \u2013 the offering what metrics would you guys us to look to if some of the components of the environment for revenue remain challenging? John C. Gerspach: The metric that will guide you to and will begin to give you more of this probably next quarter, we\u2019ll be taking a look at our active accounts. I think that is where we\u2019re seeing the big difference. I mentioned active accounts are up 6% year-over-year and that\u2019s a big change for us. As I said we were struggling before to maintain a steady state of active accounts and so to see active accounts up 6% this year now basically compared to last year, that\u2019s pretty sizeable growth for us.  I talked about the fact that acquisitions on our core products were up 37% on a year-to-date basis. But having those acquisitions is good, having those acquisitions really transition into active accounts is where we need to be, and that\u2019s clearly where we have gotten to now and where we are going to keep on driving. So we\u2019ll give you metrics on active accounts. Brennan Hawken : Thanks for that John. John C. Gerspach: Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Thank you. John, just wondering on expenses, the year-over-year constant dollar expense trends look good. You are down 13% year-over-year. It is harder for us to kind of tease out how much of that was from lower legal and repositioning to compare to core expense, could you shed any light on that on how the core expenses trend on a constant dollar basis? John C. Gerspach: You know core expenses are up slightly and again it\u2019s in line with the plans that we had going into this year when we thought about what we needed to do in order to generate the efficiency ratios that we were targeting. So again a plus slightly but all included in the efficiency ratio target that we gave. John McDonald : Okay and as you look ahead to the fourth quarter any thoughts on the core expenses, we can probably be in the same neighborhood are there any puts and takes to think about? John C. Gerspach: Well it is going to vary business by business and everything. For instance in some of the businesses where we\u2019ve seen some of the revenue challenges, for instance some of the international consumer businesses, you can imagine that we have already begun to look at the core expenses there and have begun to adjust the trajectory. So these are all things that we look at. I am not going to give you specific guidance on exactly where core expenses is going to be. But again what we\u2019re committed to is to deliver on that mid 50s of efficiency ratio for Citicorp. John McDonald : Okay and then this question is for Mike following up on your comments about using excess capital and trying to avoid the denominator problem. You have become more interested in trying to grow assets in organically as your capital grows and perhaps you get more comfortable with the regulatory rules and whether its card portfolios or consumer books. Is that something that you look more to in trying to grow through portfolio acquisitions? Michael L. Corbat: I think John we\u2019ve been open to those acquisitions whether it was best buy or whether it will be Costco. But all of those need to be in our targeted segments. You are not going to see us going out breaking into a new products or things that we don\u2019t view today as really being core who we are as a franchise and whether that\u2019s the client segment or whether that\u2019s by geography or industry or whatever it maybe. But we are wide open to those portfolio acquisitions and if they hit our ROA and our return metrics and we think risk adjusted they make sense. We\u2019ll certainly look at them but again what we have really tried to build our business model around is just really driving our own organic core growth off of our existing platforms. John McDonald : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, when will we hear about new targets for 2016 and what -- can you give us a preview? Michael L. Corbat: Sure, well first as you can imagine in this environment we are really focused on delivering 2015 and our targets around that. So it will be some time as we get into the new year. We haven\u2019t set a date as to when we will do that. John said we are heading into budget season and we will be looking both at 2016 and some planning beyond that. I would say that some preview around that Mike is that, as John said, that when we went into these targets two to three years ago we said it is a tough environment. It is probably stayed as tough or tougher both from an economic or regulatory just overall backdrop than we had even thought at the time. It certainly doesn\u2019t feel like it is going to get a whole lot better here for a period of time. So I wouldn\u2019t expect big changes to those targets. Our goal is to manage the institution well through the environment we are in and be in a position to deliver strong performance, strong operating leverage, and all the things you would expect as the environment at some point in the future starts to turn. Mike Mayo : So how much does getting where you want to be depend on higher U.S. interest rates? Michael L. Corbat: Well it is certainly -- it certainly hasn\u2019t been a help in terms of where we are. And where we are as we said we would get and run the institution to the mid 50s and again I think as you look across the industry it leaves us in a reasonable position. We have talked about changes in interest rates and as of now roughly 100 basis points upward shift of rates translate somewhere into about 2 to 2.1 of revenue which we would hope we believe largely translates into EBIT and so they are tailwinds that can come out of some of those shifts. But again as we have seen, as the Fed has contemplated its move you would want those moves to come on the back drop of perception of economic strength. And if economic strength is there you get the double tailwind of not just the rate push but you get some stability, you get some markets trending, you get some confidence back in the market that I think would be welcomed by both consumers as well as the institutions and corporate. Mike Mayo : I mean is it fair for us to expect to a little bit higher returns. I mean you are shedding some non-core assets, you are repositioning the firm, you just announced you are retreating some from Boston and I guess Korea has passed some of the restructuring. I mean is it fair for us to expect a bit more if you look out? Michael L. Corbat: I think a lot of that Mike depends on the environments there. But what you can expect is that we are going to continue to closely manage the place and we are going to keep an eye. And management has a strong eye towards the targets that we have put out there delivering on those and continuing as I said in opening remarks not just around expenses but around risk of capital to try and manage the place smartly. Mike Mayo : And then last follow-up. The IMF and other forecasters have reduced their growth rate for Asia and this quarter saw some pull back in China markets but here you are saying on this call that Asia consumer is stabilizing, so can you help me with that disconnect? John C. Gerspach: When you take a look at the IMF, they have lowered their growth forecast but they are still forecasting growth. And when you take a look at our Asia consumer revenues we believe that they will stabilize. They are stabilizing now and they should stabilize going into the fourth quarter and then into next year. So, I don\u2019t think that those two things are inconsistent. I would like to get more growth out of Asia but with the lowered -- with everybody sort of living in a lower GDP environment, getting high levels of growth is going to be difficult even with the levels that you are seeing, that we are seeing now. Again we are still getting good engagement on loans, on deposits, so it is not that we are not seeing some levels of growth even at this point in time. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning guys. Can you show where -- the Citi Holdings as you bring the assets down, I think you pointed out that today the assets represent about 6% of total assets and 13% of risk weighted assets. So clearly there is more capital supporting the Holdings suite we have always known about. Do you think that when you bring it down actually to zero, will all that capital be freed up or is there some operational risk that the regulators will require you to maybe keep more capital in there as the assets are no longer there? John C. Gerspach: Yes I\u2019d say that is the most likely case Gerard. So when you think about Citi Holdings, Citi Holdings at the end of the quarter had about $157 billion worth of risk weighted assets, at the end of the third quarter Mike. It was $157 billion of risk weighted assets and in that $157 billion consistent with what we said at the end of the second quarter there is about $49 billion worth of risk weighted assets associated with operating risk. And I just don\u2019t think that we\u2019re going to get to a point where even if we shut holdings down that we are going to be able to relieve ourselves of that $49 billion of risk weighted assets. So that may come overtime but it\u2019s going to be time not a quarter or two. So I think it is really, you really need to look at the $108 billion then of credit and market risk assets that are supporting to the holdings as really being the opportunity that we have now for further capital reduction and as we wind down the balance of the holdings. Gerard Cassidy : Would there be -- thank you for the clarity there. Would there be any operating expenses that have to stick around with that 49 billion of the operating risk assets, when Citi Holdings assets all go to zero would you still have to have some operating expenses to support that 49 billion? John C. Gerspach: No, we shouldn\u2019t. We have been pretty good at making sure we attack any stranded costs in holdings as we\u2019ve gotten rid of the assets. And this 49 billion it will be driven based upon model. At some point in time we had businesses that generated of operating risk events and it is just going to take time then to have that fade into the past. And then the time frame is just one that we\u2019ll have to work through our own models and then certainly with some of our regulatory friends. Gerard Cassidy : Great and shifting gears you mentioned in your prepared remarks about card loans, they grew modestly year-over-year but the growth was muted by the impact of continued high payment rates than regulatory changes. They both remain headwinds but you then went on to say that you think that the regulatory changes there might be some abatement in this in the upcoming year or was that more just due to the high payment rates that you think that could slowdown to help the growth? John C. Gerspach: And I think you quoting me from the comments that I made about Asia specifically. And in Asia we had almost every country in Asia implement some version of the U.S. Card Act during the past two years. And so what we have been doing is working our way then through those impacts on the Asia card book, whether that\u2019s higher payment rates, whether that\u2019s lower debt ceilings, items like that. So that has been working its way through the book and what we are looking at now is that the impact of those regulations are abating both because there are not so many new regulations coming new, and also because we are lapping the impact of the changes that were put in place a year or two ago. So both of those factors give us again some of the confidence that those impacts will be lessening as we look forward. Gerard Cassidy : And then finally on cards you mentioned that the revenues in branded cards was down about 9% and this was due to the increase in acquisition and reward cost. How long did they last and is that primarily from when you buy a new portfolio or is there an ongoing cost as well just going out reaching out for new customers? John C. Gerspach: No, this is the cost of growing accounts organically. Two different models as far as inorganic and organic growth but when you get into an organic growth model which is where we are right now predominantly we will get as I mentioned a boost from inorganic growth we had in the Costco portfolio so that will be a big plus. But from an organic point of view the first thing we did is we had to restructure the product offering in cards which I think we have successfully done. And we have gotten a nice balance now of new products dealing with both the value product, rewards product, the value product will be simplicity, the rewards product would be thank you.  We have introduced double cash giving us a cash back product and so we got a nice balance there between cards that appeal to spend oriented consumers and revolve oriented consumers. We have got a nice balance on our product portfolio between proprietary cards and co-brand cards and now it is a matter of putting investment dollars at work to grow -- to first acquiring new accounts, have them transition into active customers, and then gross spend and revolve behavior on each one of those cards. And so the first phase that you run into once you have restructured is you get into a rebate and reward phase where as you add in those accounts there are certain amount of cost that you incur upfront to acquire the account, all those rebates, and they basically hit your revenue line. As well as then the rewards cost that you pay as they continue to drive spend early on and that also was a, is a muting factor on your revenue line as well. So, once we get through with the -- that will eventually pace itself out and we will go from rebates and rewards and then we will get into a revolving period as well. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you for the clarity, I appreciate it. John C. Gerspach: Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, and just one quick follow-up from me, the roughly 400 million that you called out John and quarterly increase in corporate non-accruals in North America and EMEA, what percentage of that increase quarter-over-quarter was related to energy? John C. Gerspach: Roughly 80% of the net add was energy related. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. John C. Gerspach: Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, thanks. John, just on the debt buyback front can you help us understand as to how much the benefit was this quarter and if the premise of doing more in the future is also baked into your expectation for the future NIM? John C. Gerspach: The impact of the debt buybacks is incorporated in my 285 to 290 range. You know obviously debt buybacks you get a certain benefit in the quarter in which you do it but it is usually more of a forward-looking benefit. And debt buybacks is just one of the tools that we use as far as active management of our long-term debt portfolio. We find series of debt that just are not particularly trading well and that gives us an opportunity then to buy that back and then usually it ends up giving us the opportunity then to reissue that at better rate. Ken Usdin : And was that a modest benefit this quarter? John C. Gerspach: We had certain, I haven\u2019t been able to isolate it in my head anyway the impact of debt buybacks on this quarters NIM but I am sorry, it is blended in with our overall cost of funding which did come down. And that is something that is really going to -- that is going to trickle in over many, many quarters. Ken Usdin : Got it, so it has got a card order which is going to be my follow-up, because I would think you would see a kind of -- you really see it in the cost of debt on the liability side of the average balance sheet page. So I was just wondering if how much benefit you could still get from that going forward? John C. Gerspach: Well again a lot of that is going to depend on how markets perform and everything else. We have been fairly successful in the past dealing with the debt buybacks. It is something that we look to do. If it is there it is there. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. And then just a follow up question on the international consumer banking side and to your point about flat year-over-year constant dollar, and your comments about the investments sales slowing, any sense if that investments have slow down, was kind of just customers freezing given what was happening this quarter and what are you seeing just in terms of the international consumer activity aside from revenue just in terms of the behavior and activity as you look ahead? John C. Gerspach: Activity level obviously it is going vary a little bit region by region but a lot of our wealth management business its concentrated in Asia and there it's very much to your point. What we see in times of market volatility and market uncertainty is that our wealth management clients are not as active as you would imagine. It is just not as active in putting more of their funds to work in the markets and that therefore has an impact on our investment sales. So it\u2019s a little bit of market sentiment, it\u2019s a little bit of consumer confidence, its all of those things and as far as how does what do we think about it going forward at the markets sort of clear themselves as people become a little bit more confident again, they know where they are going. We see that activity come back but this was a particularly tough quarter for investment sales. Ken Usdin : Right, okay, got it. Thanks very much. John C. Gerspach: Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. John I had a quick question on risk weighted assets and just wanted to clarify couple of things relating to the disclosure in the release or in the presentation. So it looks as though the headline number has declined about 4% year-on-year but just looking at the capital impact disclosure which maybe reflect some FX related impacts, its looks as though the RWA on a constant dollar basis have been relatively stable. I just wanted to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about it in 2016 where maybe you don\u2019t have the offset of the holdings run off and you still have continued core growth in Citicorp, should we expect those RWAs to begin to trend on an upward trajectory? John C. Gerspach: Let me help you. Let me deal with the sequential decline in risk weighted assets, alright. So, on a sequential basis risk weighted assets dropped from I don\u2019t have the page open 12.79 to 12.58, about $21 billion. And roughly half of that decline was FX related, alright. So, don\u2019t forget we take that into consideration as part of our overall capital hedging program because our capital hedging program is built on a ratio hedge. So we hedge to our CET1 ratio. And so just as our capital in various countries is going to be impacted by fluctuations in FX rates, we also know that our risk weighted assets are going to be impacted by that as well. So all of that is baked into capital hedge. But that means that for the quarter we actually saw a non-FX related reduction in RWA of about $10 billion. So that\u2019s what's baked into that number and some of that is in holdings and some of that is in Citicorp. In general again we do expect to see Citi Holdings continue to reduce. That should give us room to grow Citicorp. We have not worked our way through our overall 2016 plan as yet. so I cannot give you guidance as to where we are going to think about what we are going to think about RWA levels going into next year. But we\u2019ll take all of that into account as we finalize the budget and as the budget gets finalized around both our efficiency targets as well as our ROA targets and our ROPCE targets as well. Steven Chubak : Well thank you for detail there John and just wanted to switch gears for a moment. I appreciate the color that you had given on Brazil in terms of some of the consumer exposures there, one of the things I was hoping you can give some priority or detail on as rolling into corporate exposure specifically, well it looks like Brazil is about 5% of the total loan book. I know in the past the disclosures you\u2019ve given suggest that the majority of those corporates are actually based in Brazil in lieu of other regions or maybe its predominantly multinationals. I want to get a sense as to how your -- what the credit trends look like today, how they are performing, and whether you start to reserve for any potential losses within the institutional segment. John C. Gerspach: Our Brazil book is structured in a very similar along the line of every other country in which we operate which is that it is a book that really again focuses on those large multinationals and again it is somewhat similar. We take all of that into account, we certainly been on the wait to see that S&P downgraded Brazil before we began to take a look at some of our Brazil book and build the appropriate reserves.  But again it is a consistent strategy, large multinational corporates, global investors. At the end of the third quarter we had total exposure of $14.5 billion or so in Brazil and most of that, 75% of the corporate lending book is as you said is the Brazil based companies and a large portion of the book, more than half, well more than half, I think it is like 60%, 70% is TTS related. So it is trade related loans. So you have a combination of short dated secured loans on TTS, large multinationals, I am not going to tell you that the book will never have an NCL but we feel pretty good about the quality of the book. Steven Chubak : Excellent and then just one more from me John and obviously you are getting a bit knit picky here but it did sound as though the guidance you have given on the full year efficiency range for ICG is 55% to 56%. I do believe on the last quarter's call you had said the midpoint of the 53% to 57% target range which is just maybe some upward pressure on the efficiency ratio and I just wanted to guess as to whether that is a reflection of revenue pressures. I know that revenues on a constant dollar basis were down about 1% year-on-year through the first nine months or more a function of what you are seeing in terms of the performance thus far, maybe your outlook ahead of the fourth quarter? John C. Gerspach: Yeah, I think the language that we had last time was closer to the midpoint as opposed to specifying the midpoint. So, you can assume that this is, I am thinking that we are going to be slightly above where I would have targeted at the end of the last quarter and it very much reflects the revenue pressure that -- Steven Chubak : Okay, well thanks for clarifying that John. And\u2026 John C. Gerspach: Having said that it is somewhere between 55% and 56% compares really well with our peers. Steven Chubak : Tangible [ph] rate, thanks John for taking my questions. John C. Gerspach: Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John C. Gerspach: Hi Betsy. Betsy Graseck : So, just a couple of follow-ups, one is on corporate, I was going to ask the question about corporates in Asia, you mentioned the slightly softer growth coming out of the consumer, just wanted to get a sense as to how corporates are trending because what we are hearing from folks is that there is a little bit of softer demand given China is not doing as much? Michael L. Corbat: Betsy, it is Mike. I would say that that's accurate. That there is this activity on the corporate side of the loans and just overall calendar has slowed a bit. That being said, John talked about other parts of our business there in particular our EM sales and trading businesses and our EM sales and trading business in Asia has actually been quite strong. So while headline volumes have slowed, you can imagine through our TTS business, our foreign exchange business in some of those markets, more activity as company's try and position and spend more time focusing on the balance sheet directory running in those companies. So, a bit of in and out but yes, the region is not escaping the slowdown. Betsy Graseck : And then just a question on your bond portfolio that you manage globally, I am just wondering are there any opportunities to optimize your investments across geographies or the investments are really just -- in each of the countries that you are generating that deposit flow from? Michael L. Corbat: You know Betsy, it is a little bit of both. Alright, so obviously we have got a bond portfolio that is at the top of the house but we do have bond portfolios in each of the countries. And so within each of the countries we look to optimize within the country and at the top of the house we look to optimize across the institution. Betsy Graseck : And is there any more that you can do here, I am just thinking about the relative rate environment, could there be some opportunities for incremental optimization and lower rate environment? John C. Gerspach: You are having the budget discussion that Mike\u2019s going to have with me is to whether or not my treasury unit is doing the right job, did he subcontract this out to you? Michael L. Corbat: Thank you Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay thanks. John C. Gerspach: The answer Betsy is we look at all this stuff all the time and we\u2019re always finding new things that we can do. So, it is something that we do look at every day but I can't give you a specific answer to is there a lot more than we can do. We think we are doing a lot right now. Betsy Graseck : Okay and then just lastly on the U.S. credit card environment you mentioned that the two years forward is when with the new accounts you get to a better lending environment obviously because at first you get the new accounts in and they spend and then they borrow, I just wanted to understand was that two years to what you think is average run rate in borrowing or in revolving for the accounts that you are looking for, or is that, when you start to see the beginnings of borrowings. So I am just trying to understand what the two year number was about? John C. Gerspach: We should see as even as early as next year, we should begin to see growth in our overall loan portfolio. So you should start to see average net receivables. First they will stabilize, maybe that will be very early next year and then we should begin to see some growth. But it is going to take almost that full two years before you see the real full impact of everything that we are doing. We\u2019ll be able to show you metrics along the way so that you will be able to gauge just how well we are progressing. I mentioned to one other caller about giving active accounts but you will also see the growth in ANR. But given the heavy impact of that reward and rebate on the top line revenue it is going to take some time. If you think about the 9% down that we have got year-on-year in cards just to maybe give you an example, I\u2019d say about 10% of that decline is environmental, some hangover from regulatory. About 30% of that decline is just the impact of the run off portfolio, the legacy portfolio is running off, and again that will begin to abate as well. But then 60% of that decline is really being caused by this instrument activity that we have. So it won\u2019t always be at that high level but it is going to be at a level for some time. Betsy Graseck : I got it, okay, thanks that was very helpful. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matthew Burnell : Good afternoon, thanks for taking my questions. Just one question on loan growth and sort your outlook into fourth quarter. I guess following up on an earlier comment it seems like while there is continued growth expectations across many of your international markets growth expectations are coming down and you reported core loan growth in Citicorp is being at about mid single-digit, are you expecting that to continue at mid single-digit levels over the next quarter or two or are there markets where you think that could slow down substantially? John C. Gerspach: You know I don\u2019t want to get into a specific guidance point on loan growth in Citicorp on constant dollars but we do think that again, this quarter it did present certain challenges. I don\u2019t think the environment is going to change dramatically in the fourth quarter. So I wouldn\u2019t look to the fourth quarter as being radically different from what we\u2019ve seen on a sequential basis looking at the third quarter. But again we\u2019ll have to just see how everything continues to develop off of there. What is happening, it is not just of course of the fact that you get loan growth but what also matters is where you get the loan growth and in what loan products do you get loan growth in. And so the key for us is to begin to see the loan growth in those higher margin credit card products. We like to see the loan growth in the retail bank that\u2019s fine but those loans are usually slightly lower margins because they\u2019re securitized. Then there is a fixed payment scheme as opposed to revolving behavior that you have on cards. So loan growth is one thing and I feel pretty good about our ability to grow loans but I feel better when we begin to see even better growth coming out of the card products. Matthew Burnell : Okay, John thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a very quick follow-up, I just want to make sure I heard you correctly in terms of your commentary about credit cost in the fourth quarter, I believe you said that those would be relatively stable with the levels of the third quarter, is that correct? John C. Gerspach: Other than whatever asset sale impacts we have, some of the asset sales that we\u2019ll be doing out of holdings actually you know the gain or loss gets recognized in that cost of credit line. Outside of those activities it should be stable. Matthew Burnell : Okay, fair enough. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi, good morning. I just had two quick questions. On the hedge gains that you called out were those related to the specific sector meaning energy or they region like in Brazil or somewhere else that shows the big gain this quarter? John C. Gerspach: Well I am not going to go into specific things but in general the hedges that we\u2019ve got on our loan book that\u2019s just part of our ongoing risk management efforts. We use loan hedges to manage credit risk concentrations primarily and to the extent that we can and for the most part we do we use single name CDS to hedge those concentration risk. So it is not because we\u2019re worried about any particular name but because we are just trying to manage again our concentration of risk in a particular sector.  And so in the third quarter as you saw what happened in the environment, credit spreads were generally widening and that had two impacts. We had gains on those loan hedges and at the same point in time we took provisions on the loans. And it shouldn\u2019t be -- that\u2019s in line with the way that you should expect them. I am not going to say it is always going to line up correctly but I think if you go back to the last two quarters what you\u2019ll see in each of the last two quarters to the extent we had small losses on the loan hedges, that gave us then the opportunity it usually matched up with an opportunity to release reserves in the corporate portfolio and to the extent where we had a small gain, we usually had a small build in the loan loss. Again I am not going to say that its perfectly co-related, but it certainly has been somewhat co-related over the last three quarters. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, that\u2019s helpful, thanks. And just switching gears to the mortgage banking, I know you said you wanted to increase the market share there, back to where you were historically or getting closer to it but looks like Q on years not much changed in the market share, as they just left emphasis on growing markets -- market share and mortgage bank or is it just function of the market? John C. Gerspach: It is not less emphasis it really is very much a function of the market itself. And there is also so it\u2019s a combination certainly of the market. You\u2019ve also seen I think everyone has seen some of the gains on sale being reduced in the mortgage books. So that\u2019s also having an impact on the overall revenue stream that we are getting out of mortgages. But we\u2019re still focused exactly as we were. We are not trying to be one of the top three or four producers of mortgages but we do want to be in a position to be able to support our retail clients when it comes to their mortgage needs. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good, thanks for taking my questions. John C. Gerspach: Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. John, I just maybe want to consolidate my understanding of your answers to several of the questions that have come before, so just to preface for a quick second, it seems as if the\u2026 John C. Gerspach: You are not going to go through all 40 questions that have been asked so far are you? Eric Wasserstrom : No, it's just 37 cause couples are repeats. John C. Gerspach: Okay alright. Eric Wasserstrom : So it seems as if the overall sort of dynamics is some rebasing of NIM because of change in asset mix and a fairly constant efficiency ratio given the challenges of revenue generation and reinvestment and putting aside maybe some of the volatility in capital markets, it seems then that the primary lever on the income statement for some acceleration in earnings is therefore asset generation, is that correct. John C. Gerspach: That is one way of looking at it, yes. Eric Wasserstrom : And so the -- and so within that, I just want to make sure I understand, it seems that if what you are pointing to as the primary drivers of incremental asset generation meaning beyond the current run rate trends are card in the U.S., retail loan in international consumer, and treasury, PSS, and private bank in ICB is that broadly correct by category? John C. Gerspach: I think what you have isolated on is what we would consider to be our core banking activities which is exactly where we were focused. And don\u2019t forget, everything that we do starts with having a clearly articulated strategy that we have been consistent with for the past five to six years. And that strategy really guides us along the way.  The second thing that we are very, very proud of is the strong balance sheet that we have built and so when you start with a well defined strategy and a strong balance sheet that again then gives you the opportunity to pursue appropriate levels of growth. We have gotten to the point now where our core banking activities; cards, retail, PPS, security services, private bank, corporate lending all of those account for more than 75%, close to 80% of our revenues. And that is where we continue to see our growth coming from in the future. Eric Wasserstrom : And just in corporate banking, we didn\u2019t hear too much about it on the call, but is there any reason to expect some change in trends line there on quarter review from asset generation perspective? John C. Gerspach: From asset generation we will continue to support our clients as they need assets whether those be corporate loans or debt or equity underwritings. But our ability to generate assets is really governed by the needs of our clients. Michael L. Corbat: And John what we may see to Eric's question is that if and as the markets remain volatile we may see corporates choosing to access the loan market versus the capital markets and maybe transition that over time. So, we have seen some periods of volatility. We will probably be asked to put our balance sheet to work and so you could see loan growth coming through the corporate sector in that form as well. Eric Wasserstrom : Very interesting, thanks very much. John C. Gerspach: Okay. Operator : At this time there are no further questions. Susan Kendall : Thanks Regina and thank you all for joining us here today. If you have any follow-ups please reach out to Investor Relations. Thanks.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take your questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2014 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.4 billion for the fourth quarter of 2015 or $1.06 per share excluding the impact of CVA and DVA. And for the full year, we earned $17.1 billion or $5.35 per share. I'll go into more detail on the year after making a few points about the quarter. Overall, our institutional businesses saw improved performance from the fourth quarter of last year. Revenues increased in Treasury and Trade solutions, Investment Banking and our private bank, as well as across our equities and fixed income businesses. In Consumer, our North American performance continued to be impacted by investments we're making in our branded cards business, but we saw continued underlying growth and efficiency gains in retail banking. And internationally, market sentiment clearly affected our investment sales contributing to lower overall revenues from a year ago. However, we did continue to see growth in deposits, loans, and card purchase sales and credit continued to be stable in our cards and our retail portfolios. We had a substantial decrease in Citi Holdings assets during the quarter largely driven by the closing of the sale of OneMain and consumer franchises in several countries. Holdings assets ended the year at $74 billion or a 43% reduction from the previous year. And importantly, we believe the actions we took this quarter will enable Citi Holdings to be marginally profitable in 2016. Overall, we had strong performance in 2015. The $17.1 billion we generated in net income was the highest since 2006 when our company was very different in terms of headcount, footprint, mix of business and assets. Over the last year, we grew revenues 3% in constant dollars while holding our core operating expenses flat. And as we committed, we significantly reduced our legal and repositioning costs and we drove loan and deposit growth of 5% in Citicorp, while reducing the overall size of our balance sheet. We also made significant progress on DTA utilization, generating significant regulatory capital and ending the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12% on a fully implemented basis. I'm especially pleased with our progress over the last three years. In early 2013, in addition to announcing my execution priorities, we set several financial targets we hope to reach by the end of 2015 in terms of return on assets, a Citicorp efficiency ratio and a return on tangible common equity. At 94 basis points, we reached our target in terms of return on assets, while at 57.1%, the Citicorp efficiency ratio was just over our target and it was more than 300 basis points lower than in 2012. Excellent progress that I think compares very favorably to that of our peers. Although we weren't able to begin to return meaningful capital to our shareholders until 2015, we were still able to increase our return on tangible common equity to 9.2% for Citigroup and we reached 11% excluding the capital which supports our disallowed DTA. In addition to these financial targets, we made significant progress against each of my execution priorities. We've become a simpler and smaller company. We've made the tough decisions regarding what businesses couldn't generate the returns our shareholders expect and deserve. And as an example, we've exited or are in the progress of exiting from 19 consumer markets. We said we'd wind down Citi Holdings and drive it to breakeven and now consists of only 4% of our balance sheet and not only as holdings broken even, it\u2019s been profitable for six straight quarters. Overall, we've reduced headcount by 28,000 people, assets by over $130 billion and reduced our legal entities by over one third. We've shrunk our real estate footprint by almost 20%, including 182 operation centers as part of our efforts to establish shared service centers and mine the efficiencies in our opportunities of our business model. The other side of the coin is to make sure that we allocate these finite resources to where they can get the best returns. In our Institutional businesses, we've successfully focused on our target clients, achieving wallet share and market share gains. In Global Consumer, we've reduced our brand's footprint by 25% to concentrate our presence in the fastest growing cities, while investing in our mobile channels. We've simplified our branded cards portfolio reducing our offerings by 60% and are preparing to launch the Costco card this year. Our customer satisfaction is measured by net promoter scores has improved meaningfully. We are unquestionably a safer and stronger company. As 2015 shows, we've significantly improved both the quality and consistency of our earnings. We said we would begin to consistently utilize DTA. After it increased to $55 billion in 2012 we've utilized over $7 billion of DTA in the last three years. This contributed to the generation of $50 billion of regulatory capital over the last three years. Last year, we were able to begin returning some of that capital to our shareholders and we've reduced our outstanding common shares by over 70 million and increased our common dividend. We've already exceeded regulatory thresholds for the Common Equity Tier 1 and supplementary leverage ratios. We continue to invest in our capital planning process to ensure that it's sustainable and can meet the increasing expectations placed on a bank of our scale and scope. We've also made the necessary investments in our compliance, risk and control functions which are critical to maintaining our license to do business. Everyday we work to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. While as the early days of 2016 have shown, the environment hasn't gotten and isn't likely to get any less challenging. And while there are bright spots such as the US, Mexico or India, growth globally remains muted and makes other factors, whether they be the price of oil or interest rates, difficult to predict. Volatility may present some trading opportunities but more often keeps investors on the sidelines and dampens consumer sentiment. As I discussed earlier, we've worked hard to transform our company and the changes we've made have put us in a strong position to navigate the current environment. We've continued to reduce our exposure to lower return consumer markets. We run a very balanced and tightly risk managed loan book. We've become even more disciplined in our focus on target clients. And our capital and liquidity are amongst the highest in the industry. John will now go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our reported results. Excluding this item, we earned $1.06 per share in the recent quarter compared to $0.06 in the fourth quarter of 2014. On slide 4, we showed total Citigroup results. In the fourth quarter, we earned $3.4 billion. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 4% from last year, mostly driven by gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings, as well as growth in our institutional franchise, partially offset by the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues grew 9% year-over-year, including 3% growth in our core Citicorp business. Expenses declined 23% year-over-year driven by lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And net credit losses continued to improve, offset by a significant loan loss reserve build this quarter largely in Citicorp compared to a net release in the prior year. On a full year basis, the total efficiency ratio for Citigroup including Citi Holdings was 57.3%. Net income grew by nearly 50% year-over-year. We generated an ROA of 94 basis points and our return on tangible common equity was 9.2%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans declined 1% year-over-year to $618 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was more than offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $908 billion. On slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $15.7 billion were down 2% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were up 3% from last year driven by growth across our institutional franchise. Citicorp expenses declined 24% reflecting significantly lower legal and repositioning charges, as well as a benefit from FX translation. And cost of credit grew 29% from the fourth quarter of last year driven by the net reserve build. Turning to Citi Holdings, we accomplished a lot this quarter. We completed the sales of OneMain, our Japan retail and cards businesses and other assets driving a $36 billion reduction to the end of the year with $74 billion of assets. We executed buybacks for roughly $10 billion of outstanding debt and we position Citi Holdings to remain at or above breakeven going forward. The net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion this quarter, better than we previously expected, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit. While Citi Holdings did outperform our expectations in the fourth quarter, the greatest driver of earnings growth for the full year was our Citicorp franchise. Citicorp earned $16 billion in 2015, an increase of over $4.8 billion from the prior year, driven by growth in our operating margin, as well as a continued decline in net credit losses, partially offset by the impact of changes in loan loss reserves. On slide 6, we provide more detail on Citicorp results for full year 2015 in constant dollars. Now going into the year, our goals were to generate top line growth to deliver modest positive operating leverage on our core expense base and to significantly reduce the earnings drag from legal and repositioning costs. And as you can see on this slide, even in a continued challenging environment, we did achieve each of these objectives for the full year. Citicorp revenues grew 3% while core operating expenses grew only 2%. And our total legal and repositioning expenses fell from over 900 basis points of revenues to roughly 200 basis points. As a result, our operating efficiency improved from 65% to 57% for the full year 2015. And importantly, we were able to deliver results that better reflect the underlying earnings power of our franchise. Turning to each business. On slide 7, we show results for International Consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, International Consumer banking revenues declined 2% year-over-year. In Latin America, revenues were flat to last year, as a modest increase in loan and deposit balances was offset by continued spread compression in cards. Card purchase sales continued to grow up 10%, but card loans were flat year-over-year in Latin America driven by higher payment rates in our Mexico cards portfolio. We expect the cards payment rate in Mexico to remain elevated as we continue to focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. We were able to offset this impact however with growth in personal loans and other retail banking products. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year driven by continued pressure on investment sales revenues, as well as continued high payment rates and ongoing regulatory pressures in cards. We saw slightly better momentum in card volumes in the fourth quarter. Payment rates remained fairly stable sequentially and we continued to work through the impact of regulatory changes across the region. And in retail banking, we continued to see year-over-year revenue growth in lending, insurance and deposit products. However, this was more than offset by the lower investment sales revenues. In total, average international loans grew 2% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 5% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 3% as higher regulatory and compliance costs, technology investments and certain one-time items were partially offset by lower legal and repositioning costs, as well as ongoing efficiency savings. And credit costs increased 8% from last year and 17% sequentially. In credit cards and other retail loans, our NCL and delinquency rates remained broadly stable versus last quarter across the emerging markets. However, we did see an up-tick in net credit losses in certain markets in our Commercial business, which serves small and mid-size companies. And we had a modest reserve build this quarter, as reserve releases are largely behind us as credit has stabilized. Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer banking. Total revenues declined 6% year-over-year and were flat sequentially. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 6% from last year including the impact of $130 million gain on the sale of a mortgage portfolio in the prior period. Excluding this gain, retail banking revenues grew 4% reflecting continued loan and deposit growth and improved deposit spreads. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 9% from last year, driven by a modest decline in average loans and an increase in acquisition and reward costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. We continue to feel good about the investments we are making with 8% year-over-year growth in active accounts and 13% growth in purchase sales in our core products. We achieved modest year-over-year loan growth this quarter in our core portfolios, which account for roughly 80% of our total US branded card loans. And with continued momentum, we believe we should return to growth in both total loans and revenues in the latter part of 2016 before the benefit of acquiring the Costco portfolio. Finally, turning to retail services, revenues declined 1% from last year mostly reflecting the continued impact of lower fuel prices on both loan growth and purchase sales. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America declined 6% driven by lower repositioning costs and ongoing efficiency savings, as we continued to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we plan to exit roughly 50 branches in the first quarter of 2016, including our Boston area branches. With these actions, over 90% of our branch footprint will be concentrated in our six key markets where we are investing to deepen our customer relationships and continuing to adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior in digital channels. Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit was broadly stable in North America and Asia again this quarter with loss rates of 226 and 84 basis points respectively. And in Latin America, we did see an up-tick in the NCL rate to 4.8%. But as I described earlier, the increase was concentrated in the commercial portfolio including losses on a wind down portfolio in Brazil, most of which were offset by the release of previously established reserves. Our overall credit outlook remains favorable in Latin America driven by continued stability in our Mexico card portfolio and the benefit of ongoing credit discipline across the region. Slide 10 shows the expense trends for Global Consumer banking. The total efficiency ratio for Global Consumer banking in 2015 was nearly 54%, above our previous outlook of roughly 53%, driven mostly by lower than expected revenues in our international business, particularly in Asia. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 11. Revenues of $7.4 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year with broad based growth across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.2 billion, excluding the impact of loan hedges, grew 3%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars driven by growth in high quality deposits and spreads. This represents the eighth consecutive quarter that we've generated both revenue and operating margin growth in TTS on a year-over-year basis. Investment banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 6% from last year, while our equity underwriting revenues rebounded somewhat from the third quarter, they were down 18% from last year on lower overall industry activity. Debt underwriting revenues were up 12% from last year with share gains across debt and loan origination and M&A revenues grew 15%. Private bank revenues of $691 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by higher loans and deposits. And corporate lending revenues of $401 million were down 7% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenues declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. Total Markets and Security Services revenues of $3.2 billion grew 9% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $2.2 billion were up 7% from last year with growth in both macro and spread products, but were down 14% from the prior quarter, reflecting seasonally lower activity as well as the impact of continued macro uncertainty. Turning to equities, revenues grew 29% from a difficult fourth quarter a year ago, driven by growth across products and improved performance in EMEA. And in Security Services revenues grew 2% on a reported basis and were up 12% in constant dollars reflecting increased activity and higher client balances. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 1% year-over-year as higher regulatory and compliance costs as well as compensation expense were more than offset by lower repositioning costs, incremental efficiency savings and the impact of FX translation. Total credit costs were $641 million, up from $309 million last quarter, mostly reflecting the impact of loan loss reserve builds. A little more than half of the cost of credit this quarter was energy related. We incurred roughly $75 million of net credit losses on a limited number of credits in the energy portfolio this quarter, about two thirds of which was offset by related reserve releases. Excluding the impact of these specific reserve releases, we built roughly $300 million of energy related loan loss reserves this quarter, reflecting our view that oil prices are likely to remain low for a longer period of time. And we built a similar amount of reserves for other areas of our portfolio. About half of which was related to volume growth and overall macro adjustments, roughly a quarter was related to non-energy credits in Brazil and the remainder was disbursed across other regions and sectors with no particular concentration. With these actions completed, we currently believe ICG cost of credit in the first half of 2016 should be more in line with the run rate we saw in the third quarter of 2015 or in other words, credit costs of roughly $600 million in total for the first half. Taking a step back and looking at the full-year for ICG, we feel good about the progress we are making in our core products. In fixed income, despite the volatile back drop our rates and currencies revenues grew 4% over the prior year with momentum in both local markets and G10 products. Our local markets rates and currencies business was remarkably stable and profitable franchise again in 2015 generating revenues in the range of $1 billion per quarter. In equities, we grew 13% year-over-year with revenues approaching our near term goal of $800 million to $900 million per quarter. M&A revenues grew 16% with sustained wallet share gains for the year. And we saw mid to high single digit revenue growth across TTS, security services and the private bank. So while we face certain industry wide headwinds in areas like credit and securitized products, we remain focused on our target clients and continued to gain wallet share across the franchise in 2015. On slide 12, we show expense and efficiency trends for the Institutional business. The total efficiency ratio for ICG in 2015 was 56.7%, a little higher than our previous outlook of roughly 56%, mostly driven by lower than anticipated revenues in the fourth quarter, as well as higher repositioning costs. And our comp ratio was 27%, down from 28% in 2014. Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate Other. Revenues were higher year-over-year due in part to gains on debt buybacks, and expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. Slide 14 shows Citi Holdings assets. GAAP assets totaled $74 billion at year end, down over 40% from a year ago. Risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down significantly as well by over $50 billion to $134 billion, with more than a third of this year end amount relating to operational risk. As of today, we have signed agreements to reduce Citi Holdings GAAP assets by an additional $7 billion in 2016 and we'll continue to pursue other sales as well. On slide 15, we show Citi Holdings financial results for the quarter, which reflect the net gains on asset sales, as well as the impact of our debt buyback activities, legal and repositioning charges, and other episodic items. As I described earlier, the net result of these actions was a pre-tax contribution from Citi Holdings of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter, greater than we had anticipated, driven by higher net gains on asset sales, as well as improved credit. But even more important than the fourth quarter impact is what we believe these actions will enable us to achieve in 2016. We currently expect the benefits of lower funding costs, the exit of loss making portfolios and other repositioning efforts to offset virtually all of the operating earnings previously contributed by OneMain. As a result, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable in 2016, and the assets should continue to come down as well with a corresponding benefit to RWA. On slide 16, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while City Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points in the fourth quarter, somewhat higher than we had anticipated due mostly to trading net interest margin, and our net interest margin for the full-year was 293 basis points. Looking to 2016, our net interest margin will reflect the loss of OneMain earnings partially offset by the benefit of debt buybacks for a net reduction of about 8 basis points. We should recover about 3 basis points of this impact when we acquire the Costco portfolio which we currently expect to occur closer to the end of the second quarter. We also expect to see a benefit from higher rates as we move through the year, but this rate benefit could be all or partially offset if trading NIM normalizes in 2016. Given all of these factors, we would expect our net interest margin to be in the range of about 285 to 290 basis points for the first half of 2016 and then it will reflect Costco in the second half. On slide 17 we show our key capital metrics on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12%, driven by net income and a reduction in risk-weighted assets, partially offset by movements in OCI, as well as $1.8 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our DTA balance grew in the fourth quarter by approximately $600 million, driven by movements in OCI, partially offset by operating earnings. But on a full year basis, we utilized $1.5 billion of DTA. And importantly within our DTA, we reduced our foreign tax credits by roughly $2 billion, thereby fully utilizing FTCs that would have expired in 2017. Our supplementary leverage ratio increased to 7.1% and our tangible book value grew to $60.61 per share. To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the coming year. As we look to 2016, we see both opportunities and challenges. We expect the operating environment to remain difficult with uneven global growth, sustained low commodity prices and a slow trajectory for US rate increases. But even with this backdrop, similar in many respects to 2015, we believe we can achieve low single digit revenue growth in Citicorp, while staying disciplined around our target client strategy. We also believe we can drive continued efficiency gains in our core businesses, as we continue to streamline our operations, adjust capacity, and capture the benefits of scale. However, we need to carefully balance these ongoing efficiency efforts with the opportunities we see to invest, particularly in highly efficient, higher ROA segments of our franchise. The most significant of these planned investments for 2016 are in US cards, including the continued effort to grow active accounts in A&R and branded cards, which as I said earlier, should allow us to return to growth in both loans and revenues by the latter part of 2016. The completion of the Costco portfolio acquisition for which we are already ramping up operations, but do not expect to acquire the portfolio until around mid year. And finally, the impact of renewing some important partnership programs in a competitive environment. Together, we believe these investments are important for growing our cards business and for improving our overall Citicorp efficiency and returns over time. However, they will cause a near term drag on our results. We currently believe the efficiencies we can drive in our core businesses combined with certain other actions will be enough to fully offset the impact of these investments on our efficiency ratio in 2016. This would mean that our Citicorp efficiency ratio should remain relatively unchanged at around 57% this year, before improving in 2017 and thereafter. Turning to credit in Citicorp. We do expect credit costs to be higher in 2016 as loan loss reserve releases are largely behind us now. But the run rate for full year 2016 should be somewhat lower than we saw in the fourth quarter of 2015. As I noted earlier, we believe Citi Holdings should be marginally profitable for the year and we expect our tax rate to remain in the range of around 30% to 31%. Finally, we expect our ROA to remain at 90 basis points or above. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning, guys. Michael Corbat : Good morning, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just a follow-up on credit. I think if you look at the last two quarters and then your guidance for the next two, it seems like you're adding, depending on what we assume for charge-offs $1.34 billion of reserves in the corporate book. It seems a little bigger than your peers. Generally we've talked about your exposures to larger multinationals that you wouldn't expect to see this kind of stress. So if you could just walk us through what you're seeing in your portfolio, where the stress is, maybe more specifics? That would be helpful. John Gerspach : Yes, thanks, Jim. As you can imagine, most of the stress that we're seeing obviously is in the energy portion of the portfolio. And the guidance that I gave you as far as the roughly $600 million worth of cost of credit in the first half of the year, that's really based on a scenario where oil prices remain at the - at least current levels when I walked into this meeting, of around $30 a barrel and staying there for a sustained period. Beyond that, as the portfolio is in excellent shape and mirrors the overall strategy that we have. But obviously, there is some pressure in the energy related markets at this point in time. Jim Mitchell : Well can you help us with any sense of what you view as the worst case if we stay at $30 a barrel for 18 months, 2 years, with how much more it might be beyond that? John Gerspach : Well I'm not going to go into scenario-by-scenario. The scenario I've given you is what our cost would be with oil at $30 for a sustained period. And think of sustained period as being something over a year, okay. If oil were to drop to say $25 a barrel and then stay there for a sustained period of time, then that first half cost of credit number that I gave you might double. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one other question on the balance sheet. I think outside the asset sales it came down pretty nicely. Is that just the environment or do you think is that real progress in shrinking the balance sheet? And we saw one of your competitors lower their surcharge. Any update on that or the ability to shrink your surcharge? John Gerspach : Yes, we've been managing our balance sheet carefully for some time. You've seen our balance sheet gradually reduce. One is we've wound down holdings and then as we always adjust our balance sheet to the needs of our clients. And as we continue to try to make the balance sheet more efficient and that's clearly been something that we have worked on for several years. You've seen us address the LCR ratio. We've got, I know others are talking about massive reductions this year in their non-operating deposits. We came into the year with less than $100 billion of non-operating deposits and we exit the year with less than $50 billion of non-operating deposits. So I can't reduce my balance sheet by hundreds of billions of dollars of non-operating deposits because they're not there. As far as from a GSIB point of view, if you recall, I'm doing this a little bit from memory, in 2014, when the topic of GSIB first came out, our estimate was that we would actually be in the 4% bucket. However, the continued efforts that I just referenced to improve the efficiency of our balance sheet resulted in us actually appearing in the 3.5% bucket by last year end. And as you can see, we've continued to make progress in 2015 on improving the efficiency of the balance sheet and those efficiency efforts naturally also do have some impact on our key GSIB drivers. So I would now estimate that our score puts us very deep into the 3.5% bucket. And if you want some specifics, during 2015, we've reduced our OTC derivative notionals by 21%. We reduced our Level 3 assets by 21% and as I think I remember, we've reduced our short-term wholesale funding score by 19%. Now there's still elements of the calculation that are still being finalized such as our cross jurisdictional claims and liabilities. So I can't comment on the final surcharge calculation today. But clearly our continued efficiency efforts have had an impact. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. That's very helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. Michael Corbat : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : I know this is a tough one, but I want to see how you think about it. With the benefit of hindsight obviously, we look back in '08 and saw the hidden leverage, now see the hidden leverage related to a decline in housing, and obviously there was a lot of products in CDL land and things that lead to the destruction that we saw. This is not the same. There are not products like that. However, curious to see how you think about the potential hidden leverage or maybe the follow on impacts in other sectors of the lower oil prices. So while I think you're doing a conservative job the way you described it in reserving for specific energy credits, I'm curious on how you even begin to stress and think about it across the rest of the portfolio? John Gerspach : Yes, fair question, Glenn. And it's something that we look at constantly and we're always doing that. One of the reasons, we haven't seen any real knock on effects as yet broadly across the rest of the portfolio. But frankly, if part of what I had commented on earlier, I mentioned that we had a $600 million reserve build, about half of that had to do with energy, and then of the other $300 million, roughly half of that is money that we've put away just for macro concerns. Where we don't see specifics in portfolios, but we're trying to make sure that we've got something there because again, just as you, there may be knock on effects that appear later that just aren't there right now. And that's one of the reasons why we do things like put up macro reserves. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate that. And then there were specific declines in one of the slides, it showed, you showed in your appendix the specific declines in consumer credit receivables in both Korea, Brazil and I guess Russia. But I'm just curious, are those specific actions you're taking to manage risk or is there pay down, charge off, just curious on those specific markets? John Gerspach : Yes. Let's start with the last one that you mentioned. Russia, obviously as you know, Russia has been going through a bit of turmoil over the last several years probably at this point in time, at least 2 years. And we've been tightly managing our book there. We actually feel very good about the way the credit portfolio has performed in Russia over that period of time. Yes, we've had some elevated losses compared to what we would assume to have in normal times. But the portfolio in general has actually performed much better than we had originally modeled. And again, I think that's by and large a theme that you'll hear as I talk about every country and whether I'm talking about consumer or the ICG, is that overall, our very tightly focused customer strategy in each of our businesses gives us a credit portfolio that is quite resilient when it comes to times of trouble. Doesn't mean that we're going to be completely immune from having to take some losses, but we think that it produces a very resilient book of business. So with Russia, it's a little bit of just - there's less business there. We are carefully managing credit lines and really nothing more than that. With Brazil, there's certainly - that's another country that we look at very, very closely. And again, the reductions in Brazil, some of that comes out of a wind down of a commercial portfolio that we have in Brazil. You'll recall that I mentioned the up-tick in Latin America NCLs in the fourth quarter. The largest part of that up-tick is related to some losses that we took in the CCB, in our commercial business and that is really centralized in Brazil and it's this portfolio. We're winding it down. Those NCLs were offset by reserve releases and again, we feel pretty good about the way the overall portfolio is operating in Brazil. Michael Corbat : John, if I can chime in and you think about, Glenn, the countries that you mentioned interestingly, they fall into some different buckets. So you've heard us on this call for quite a while talk about the restructuring in Korea. And I think you see the balance sheet in Korea reflect the tightening branch closures, tighter target market in Korea. In Russia's case there's a couple levers that naturally occur. One naturally occurs and the other come as an after of that. And so you've had a currency depreciation. So in dollar terms, your loans, your local currency loans tend to naturally shrink. But at the same time as those economies slow and you stay focused around your target client, your client acquisition, your asset acquisition, your lending, just tends to naturally slow as part of those economies and as you stay disciplined, that's what you would expect to see. And in the case of Brazil, in some ways a combination of those, a restructuring of what's gone on there, John talked about the commercial portfolio. You've heard us talk historically about the sale of our Credicard business, which was the mass merchant card business which didn't fit, which in hindsight was a terrific sale, and just staying disciplined around those things. So I think its part of our natural credit and business process. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Well I appreciate it. And I guess that the bottom line is you're still able to grow international consumer a couple of percent a year right now. So I guess stay disciplined. Thank you. Michael Corbat : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Thanks. Good morning, guys. John Gerspach : Hey, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : So could you give some color, obviously there's a lot of investor concern over emerging market health, maybe given your unique position allows you to comment on it. Could you give some color on what you've seen as far as spending trends and credit trends in Asia and LatAm? Obviously John, you already weighed out very clearly that the majority of the up-tick in the credit losses was the wind down in Brazil. So we need to half that roughly at least. But maybe some additional color and some spending color might be helpful too? John Gerspach : Yes, let me start. Again, when I mentioned earlier, I talked about Latin America specifically regarding CCB credit but we also saw a slight up-tick in Asia. You'll see that the up-tick got us from 79 bps to 84 bps. But it was there. And again, when you take a look at what's going on in the commercial portfolio certainly outside of Brazil, we've got some deterioration in SMEs. But most of that is in areas that are really tightly related to either commodity prices or perhaps some GDP concerns coming out of China. So its - but we really haven't seen globally yet any clear patterns of consumers being stressed due to any of these weaknesses. Lower oil prices in particular are a benefit to customers on a broader scale probably than any impact on the SMEs. So we just don't see that there. Now obviously if the economies go south due to the fact that and driving higher unemployment, then we'll likely see some natural follow on in the consumer portfolios. But we don't see that today. And as I had mentioned in response to Glenn's question, even if that were to happen, we still expect our consumer portfolios to be more resilient than the broader market given our focus on higher quality segments, and which we think is really the right strategy for us. So when you take a look at our EM consumer exposures around the world, we continue to feel good about the underlying credit quality overall. And again, that's driven by our target client strategy. We took actions early on. Mike mentioned the sale of the Credicard portfolio in Brazil. We've exited other portfolios in other countries. We reshaped the portfolios in India, in Mexico, in Korea. And there's a lot of good also regulatory controls that exist in Asia, that while it may dampen our revenue prospects from time-to-time, they actually form a pretty good basis then for a solid credit story. And you think about Asia. Asia accounts for 70% of our total International Consumer portfolio and we've seen loss rates under 100 basis points in Asia for the past 4 years. And even as we've seen slowing economic growth and other pressures in the region, we're under 100 basis points. And again, I hate to bore you, but that's a function of our target client strategy. Over 80% of our originations are to borrowers that would be comparable to 700 plus FICO scores in the US. And as I mentioned, we've tightened the client focus in Korea and India to really focus again on these higher quality segments. I mentioned about benefiting from some of the strict regulatory issues. Mortgage loan to value is probably a good example of that. Our mortgage portfolio in Asia, the mortgage outstandings have got an updated LTV of less than 50%. And our historical NCL rate on our Asia mortgage portfolio is close to zero. So again, I feel pretty good overall about the consumer picture. And if you want to go in Latin America, Mexico is by far and away the largest market for us in that region. And even though we've got more mass market borrowers in Mexico, the credit story has really improved because we've again, tightened the focus to a much narrower client segment over the years. So again, pretty good. And spending patterns, you've seen the growth in purchase sales. It's still there. It's somewhat muted because of the overall economic environment, but it's still there. Brennan Hawken : Great. Thanks for that, John. And then, switching over maybe to holdings. I know there's a lot of noise this quarter. But could you maybe set for us how we should think about now at this point from where we are, and I know it's a fluid situation because as you announced, you've still got several billion dollars of sales already inked here for 2016. But what's the right way to think about the revenue and expense rate jumping off point from here in holdings? John Gerspach : You know, it's a great question and I'm sure it frustrates you as you try to come up with how you want to model holdings out into the future. And the truth is holdings is somewhat - it just doesn't lend itself to a good model. A lot of what goes through Holdings, as you can imagine, is episodic. There's just episodic numbers that hit whether we have a gain on sale. We move something into a held for sale. When you look at the cost of credit line in holdings this quarter and it looks extremely high. And it's like wow, how come you had such a high cost of credit in holdings? Well, we moved a couple of large, about $8 billion of loans into held for sale. We expect that we'll be able to get rid of these loans somewhere in the first half of the year. But the way accounting works, the loss that I expect to take on that loan sale I have to run through my loan loss reserve. So there was $160 million of loan loss reserve build that I had to have in holdings this quarter just because I took $8 billion of loans and moved them into held for sale. So it's really tough. The best guidance I can give you, Brennan, is the guidance that I tried to give you during the call, which is think in terms of holdings being marginally profitable on an EBT point of view in each quarter next year. That's really what we're striving for. Brennan Hawken : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Hi, thank you. John Gerspach : Hey, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Can you talk about the outlook for DTA consumption and maybe some of the levers to pull if there's continued headwinds either related to OCI or just macro environment impacts to the actual earnings? John Gerspach : Yes, our look at holdings, if you take a look at DTA for the full year this year, consistent with what we've said, we got about $2.5 billion of DTA reduction out of our - out of our businesses. So our earnings consume $2.5 billion of the DTA. And when we take a look at our DTA planning for a given year, we're focused first and foremost on what are we going to get out of the core businesses. So that was pretty good I thought. And then, I can't do much to control OCI. But don't forget what happens through OCI really impacts timing differences of DTA. And so that will, you know, especially when you think about the impact on our available for sale securities, those are losses that we need to take today that will largely accrete back to us over time. And so that's just merely a timing difference. The more critical elements for us in DTA are the foreign tax credits because those are items as we've said before that have got a time slot connected with them. There's an expiration date associated with that. And so we felt really good about our ability to utilize $2 billion of net foreign tax credits during 2015. Maybe the better story within that is I mentioned that we fully utilized the $1.9 billion of FTC that we had coming into the year that was going to expire in 2017. But we also utilized a $0.5 billion of the FTCs that are starting to - that would otherwise expire in 2018. So we've gotten a little bit of a head start on 2018 as well. And that's really from a DTA planning point of view. That is our first and foremost most important objective, utilize FTCs and focus on utilizing FTCs that have a near term expiration date. The one thing that we never want to do is we never want to go into a year and have FTCs set to expire that year. So that's really how we think about DTA planning. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just separately, you mentioned about investing in high ROA businesses and obviously spent some time going through the US credit card effort. Are there other businesses that may not be as high in the pecking order or not represent as big of an investment that you had highlight? I think there had been an article in one of the papers recently about the equities business. If that's one or if there's other areas that you had mentioned? Michael Corbat : Yes. So Matt, you're right to call out equities. Equities is one of those places where we think we've got continued upside. We talked about wanting to get equities in that $800 million to $900 million per quarter range. We got real close to that. We think we've got more we can do and so we're investing in there and people and research, electronic trading platforms and other things you've probably seen and read about. Obviously our Treasury and Trade Solutions business, we think continues to be an area where we can continue to take share around our target clients. We think some of the disruptions amongst the European banks and other things out there, given people may have more balance sheet constraints than we do, that we can use our balance sheet smartly around some investments in parts of that business. Our security services businesses, our private banks, private bank. A lot of the things where you've seen this year where we've had good growth but think there's more. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And lastly if I can squeeze in, you've obviously made a lot of progress, huge progress de-risking. A lot of progress refining the portfolio of businesses. You probably wouldn't tell us which ones they would be. But is there another cut at looking at the geography, looking at the businesses, overlaying those and coming up with another handful of businesses or a handful of markets to reposition? Michael Corbat : Yes. We've consistently talked about, we've got a methodology that we've applied consistently to our businesses around our invest to grow, optimize and grow, stay the course or restructure mentalities that we've applied towards businesses. And what we've said is we need to see our businesses and our geographies on the right trajectory to be accretive to our company and to our shareholders. And we are constantly reviewing that and those buckets and businesses continue to evolve around capital and balance sheet efficiencies. And that's work I think in some ways that never ends. So we've made progress. And as I said to our team, I'm pleased but not satisfied in terms of where we are and we've got more work to do. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. John Gerspach : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple quick questions. One is on the outlook for capital excess capital and capital return. I don't think we spoke too much yet about that. And with the OneMain sale, could you speak to how much RWA you're able to move off and to the degree that you can speak to how much excess capital you think it generates that you could potentially ask for in the upcoming CCAR? John Gerspach : Betsy, let me - this is John. Let me talk to OneMain and then Mike can talk to the capital distribution broadly. When you take a look at OneMain, we said it was about $9 billion worth of the GAAP assets. But it was actually part therefore of the GAAP asset reduction that you saw in holdings. And in the same fashion, it was part of the roughly 30 billion - $23 billion worth of reduction in RWA that we had in holdings this quarter. So overall Holdings came down 23, risk-weighted assets in Citi Holdings came down $23 billion this quarter and OneMain was part of that. So when you look, we've made continued progress in driving down holdings. We've made continued progress on the rest of the balance sheet as well and all of that leaves us to the 12% CET1 ratio that we have at the end of this year. And Mike\u2026 Michael Corbat : So Betsy, what we do know is we know our numbers, we know our ratios. You've seen our capital generating capacity net of approximately $6 billion capital return. We still generated 140 basis points of CE Tier 1 in the course of '15 and we think we continue to have significant capital generating power going forward. So we feel like from where ratios are, we're coming into this year's exercise or this year's submission in a stronger place. We also know that we're going to be using - the industry is going to be using a Gen-4 balance sheet. We think that's for us a good balance sheet, but what we don't know is we don't know the scenarios. And so we feel good about our drivers, but until we know the scenarios and how those impact us, it's tough to put any kind of number on that. But going back to what we've said before, we recognize our capital generating capacity and power and we've got to position the institution and affirm to continue to ramp up and more meaningfully be returning capital to our shareholders. Otherwise we're just going to be faced with a denominator problem. Betsy Graseck : Okay, I appreciate that. And then just one clean up question on energy. Did you give a ratio of your energy reserves to your energy exposure and if you could split it between oil and gas and metals and mining, wondering if you have that handy? John Gerspach : One, Betsy, I didn't give that ratio and I don't really intend to give that ratio. But obviously, we've taken what we think are the appropriate reserving actions for it. Metals and mining is actually outside of energy. So metals and mining would not be specifically covered in any of the energy related comments that I gave. But consistent with the energy story, we've also taken a good look at the metals and mining. Now don't forget, metals and mining we don't report that separately. Metals and mining is part of the larger sector that we report. But when you think about the metals and mining, our exposure overall to metals and mining is about $14 billion and that includes about $5.6 billion worth of funded loans. And again, it's another portfolio that as you can imagine is run consistent with the overall strategy. So good investment grade rating. I think it's somewhere around over 70% in metals and mining. And there's nothing special to talk about from a reserving point of view in metals and mining this quarter. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. John Gerspach : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, can you share with us, obviously, you guys have a very strong capability of generating capital as you just explained. We don't know what the final capital ratios will be for our G-SIFIs. But what buffer do you think you're comfortable with, maybe its 2 years from now. Again, we don't know what these final numbers will be. But how much are you going to carry in capital above whatever the final requirement is for you guys? Michael Corbat : I think based on what we know today, we think a buffer is somewhere in the range of 50 to 100 basis points. That obviously could evolve over time, but I'd say based on what we know today, we think for a company with the construct of our balance sheet, risk profile, et cetera, that's probably the right range for now. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you. And then, John, you mentioned in the Equities business, that you might be taking some market share from some of your competitors or potentials, particularly the European banks. I saw on your slide 33 in the appendix how your local markets rates and currencies, you are doing well there. Are there any banks that you're seeing that you are able to take market share from in Europe or Asia? Michael Corbat : Well, it's Mike, Gerard. We're not going to get specific but obviously around a number of those banks that there is questions in terms of strategy going forward. Oftentimes in those banks what you'll see is the binding constraint around leverage, and rates and currencies very often is one of the areas where leverage for obvious reasons causes some of the tougher challenges and where I think we've seen people pulling back balance sheet. So again, around scale, around local presence, we've had the ability to take some of that share. And I think that the slide you call out on page 33 is a great illustration of one of our franchises that happens to sit in a trading business, but has tremendous stability to its revenue generating capacity and capabilities. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. And then you mentioned I think you're going to close 50 branches right off here, a bunch of them up in Boston. Can you guys talk to us about the success you've had in other areas where you've just shut branches down? But you talked about or touched upon the mobile channel. How you're able to keep some of these customers because of mobile banking inroads that everybody is making. What kind of success are you seeing in keeping these customers where maybe you physically have left the market? John Gerspach : Yes, I mean, again, and we've, as you know, exited a few markets across the country. And in general, we find that we're now able to retain slightly over 50% of the deposits from those customers even as we pull back on the branch banking in those areas. That's one of the reasons why we're trying to make an even bigger push into digital or mobile banking. We think that that's more responsive to the way people are really going to access their bank in the future. And so, we think that that gives us a lot of opportunity and it's something that we're spending money trying to improve our capabilities there. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just finally, I know John, you talked about the pretax contribution that your actions in Citi Holdings had in the quarter, about a $1.3 billion. What was the actual gain on the sale of OneMain? I don't think I heard you say. I don't know if you're going to disclose it. John Gerspach : You've never heard me say it and we're not likely to disclose it. So it's in the results for holdings for the quarter. And again, we utilized a fair portion of that gain to buy back a high coupon debt that was supporting the rest of the holdings business. So again, to us it's not whether or not we made a big gain on that. It's overall what's the cost of exiting everything that we've got in holdings. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Thank you, I appreciate it. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I think I heard the positive comments about 2015. You had an ROA of 94 basis points, an ROTCE of 9.2%, efficiency of 57% and your tangible book is up to $61. I don't think anybody cares today and that leads to my question. John, you mentioned you're not seeing a knock on effect from what's taking place in China and commodities. At least not enough to change your reserve guidance more than you've already done. But I just think it would be helpful to have some more data on the exposures in energy, in China and just perhaps Mike, a bigger picture perspective on what you think is taking place in the markets right now. Michael Corbat : Sure. John, do you want to start on China and we can talk a little bit about and I'd love to that point to call everybody's attention. I think the information we've got on the combination of slides 29 and 30, if you spend a little bit of time with it, is in some ways quite informative. We talked a bit about some of the consumer numbers earlier and the diversifications there and the mix between North America and International. I think it's interesting when you take that consumer exposure and you transition to page 30 and actually look at the balance, look at the balance of our portfolios, the lack of concentrations, the mix of loan composition. And so, when we go to the EM exposure, I'd actually call your attention to the $113 billion of loans in the EM. We're actually over a third of those are in the Treasury and Trade Solutions space. So in the Treasury space, the very short term nature, they are largely to multinationals and the Trade Solutions space, they're largely collateralized. So a little bit in my mind, Mike, like going back to when we went through all of the disclosure and GIPS [ph] $1 of loan can take on or $1 of exposure can take on very different meanings. And I think in our case, you really need to drill into these and see that of the $113 billion in EM, actually $49 billion is in corporate lending. And John has talked historically about the multinationals and what the credit quality of that books looks like. 37% or $42 billion of that is in short term or collateralized space and $23 billion of that happens to be probably in the private banking related space. So don't think of those loans as being all the same and we take comfort from that. John, do you want to add to that before we go\u2026 John Gerspach : Again Mike, to close out on Mike's thought. When we take a look - the way that we run our business in the emerging markets is the same way that we run our business everywhere else around the world. And it's focused on those large multinationals and some very top tier large local corporate\u2019s. And the overall portfolio has got - it's over 80% investment grade. So we do think it's a resilient portfolio. You mentioned China though, so let me - you mentioned China, let me try to build off of what Mike talked about a little bit in China. One of the things that we do Mike in our 10-Qs and 10-Ks is we lay out for you the top 20 emerging market countries as far as where we've got lending exposure. And we put that - it's on page 91 of our September 30 10-Q and we'll update that when we file our 10-K. And if you take a look at page 91 of the 10-Q, it says that we've got $20.5 billion of aggregate exposure to China. And then we break it out for you as far as how that is between trading account assets and investment securities. And you'll see that as of September 30th, those two amounts totaled about $6.8 billion and those were largely dealing with sovereigns. So again, it's a pretty good book. And the sovereign securities in this quarter came down by about $1 billion. So you'll see that reflected when we update this page in the 10-K. When you then take a look at the consumer loan book, the consumer loan book is about $5 billion and I think that's pretty much what you'll see when we update it. But you heard me mention before about the high quality mortgage portfolio that we have throughout Asia. Well, about half of that $5 billion is a high quality mortgage portfolio. Now the difference between what I gave you for Asia and China is that I mentioned that Asia in aggregate has an updated LTV of less than 50%. In China, the updated LTV is less than 40%. And again, it's underwritten to a high FICO equivalent, 700 plus. That leaves you with about $1 billion in credit cards and personal loans, same thing, very high FICO equivalent in excess of 700, and very good loss performance. Then we've got about $1 billion of commercial loans in China and we have been reducing the commercial exposures to China year-over-year as we've seen the economy slow. But again, even here this portfolio has been broadly stable. So that leaves me with the last category that we give you which is the ICG loans of $8.8 billion. And the corporate book was flat to last quarter as well. And as we said in the past, more than half of that portfolio, as Mike talked about, the way it works around the world, it works the same way in China, more than half of that portfolio is either TTS loans which are generally short term secured financings or they are in the private bank. So that leaves about $4 billion in what you would consider to be a traditional corporate lending book and over 90% of that corporate loan book in China is to either subsidiaries of large multinationals domiciled outside of China or to large state owned Chinese companies. So as you would expect with a portfolio of that nature and consistent with our overall ICG strategy, the vast majority of this portfolio is also investment grade. Mike Mayo : Well that's helpful. Can we move to energy though? I don't want you being the only bank not disclosing reserves to energy, oil and gas loans. I mean, I think most others have disclosed that who have reported so far. And I mean, your stocks down 7%, the whole market is down a whole lot. But even if it's a low number it can't hurt too much more from here. So how much in oil and gas loans do you have and what are the reserves taken against that? I know you were asked this already but I'm going back for a second try? John Gerspach : When you take a look at the overall portfolio Mike, we've reduced the amount of exposure. Our funded exposure to energy related companies this quarter is down 4%. It's about $20.5 billion. The overall exposure also came down about 4%. The overall exposure now is about $58 billion and that includes unfunded. When you take a look at the composition of the funded portfolio, about 68% of that portfolio would be investment grade. That's up from the 65% that we would have had at the end of the third quarter. And the unfunded book is about 87% investment grade. So while we are taking what we believe to be the appropriate reserves for that, but I'm just not prepared to give you a specific number right now as far as the amount of reserves that we have on that particular book of business. It's just not something that we've traditionally done in the past. Mike Mayo : Well, if I can just test your conviction. You gave guidance of $600 million in loan loss provisions for ICG for the first half of the year, and so that would be half the run rate from the fourth quarter. So something - I guess you're feeling pretty positive contrast to the market about those expectations, unless if oil goes to $20 as you said before. What's your level of confidence in that guidance? John Gerspach : That level - I feel very confident at that level of guidance with oil at $30 a barrel. And I feel very confident about the additional guidance that I gave you should oil fall to $25 a barrel. Mike Mayo : And then last follow up and maybe this is back to you, Mike. One theory that was put out there is that we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity, not due to Citigroup, not due to the banks. But you have a lot of bought investors that have been burnt, whether it's junk bond or private equity or liquidity funds. And to the extent that liquidity dries up, you could have pressure on some of your borrowers even though it's not due to you. Do you think we are in a vicious cycle of liquidity or are you seeing any evidence of that? Michael Corbat : I think Mike, that liquidity today I would break into strata by credit segments. And I think you've seen that the bond markets throughout this, big financing done the other day, almost record setting financing in the investment grade space. So I think around investment grade credits the market's open. It will have its ups and downs but those windows will continue to largely stay open. I think as you go down the credit spectrum and on the back of Fed, on the back of uncertainties and unevenness in the world, I think you're going to see lower segments of the credit spectrum continuing to be challenged. And that will certainly be challenged in various forms of liquidity and most notably, illiquidity in some of those instruments. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Michael Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi, good afternoon. Just one question, John, I believe you were talking about the still seeing that ability to grow Corp revenues this year. And I'm presuming you're talking constant dollar basis. So I was just wondering, obviously, a lot of uncertainties that we can caveat. But as it stands now, how much do you expect rates to inform that growth and how would you break the growth potential between NII and the fee side? John Gerspach : Well let me try to answer that in a couple different ways. One, again we're talking about low single digits and that's somewhat consistent with what we have here. There's not a heavy rate component in that guidance of 3% revenue growth. So we've had about, we certainly have had the first 25 basis point increase and that's good and we're counting on that and that's performing pretty much the way that we would have expected as far as the impact on our businesses. We've got a modest level of rate increases built into the tail end of the year, maybe a rate increase somewhere towards the middle of the year and one right at the very end of the year. So again, there's not a heavy increase in rate element of that low single digit number, equivalent to effect the - we had 3% this year, we'll see what low single-digits will look like next year. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then one question on balance sheet size, still things coming out of averages after the sales this quarter, the pending sales going forward. Do you have some type of view on where average earning assets balances out, where the kind of settle out point is after you've worked through the last part or the lingering parts of what you're planning on getting rid of? John Gerspach : You mean for the overall - for holdings or the overall firm, I just\u2026 Ken Usdin : I was thinking more overall firm because I'd presume that holdings kind of just dwindles back to the point where at some point you put it back into the overall firm. But I'm thinking more just big picture top of the house? John Gerspach : Yes, from a top of the house, I think what you've seen is that we adjust the size of our balance sheet based upon the opportunity that we see, and more importantly, the needs that our clients have. And so neither Mike or I have ever put an absolute cap that says we will not grow the balance sheet. Where we see that our clients have needs and we can provide solutions, we're more than happy to put our balance sheet at work. It's one of the advantages that we have given the capital level that we have and more importantly, given the supplemental leverage ratio that we have, and given the LCR that we are currently running at, which is at 112%. So we do think that we've got a lot of capacity to put to work if and when we get faced with client need. Ken Usdin : Right, okay. So we'll see a little bit of push up but you're not necessarily seeing a major shrinkage and you'd give yourself room for it to grow again, you're not capped out? John Gerspach : No, but what you will consider, continue to see us do is try to make our balance sheet ever more efficient. And that means running off the low ROA assets and trying to gather more of the high ROA assets. That's the exact theory behind and the plan behind the investments that we're currently making in the US branded cards book. Ken Usdin : Understood. Thank you very much. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. John, a question for you on the Asia regional consumer and sort of your outlook there for operating leverage improvement. It looks like on a year-over-year basis you were able to generate some operating leverage with revenues down a little bit less than costs. But I guess, I'm curious, given your comments about continued challenges on the regulatory front and the potential for slowdown in many of those economies, what's your thinking about potential operating leverage within the Asia consumer business in 2016? John Gerspach : Yes. I'd prefer, I mean, Asia and Latin America are going to be interesting next year and from a revenue perspective they both kind of have the same story which is more of revenue stabilizing in the first half of the year. And then as volumes grow during the balance of the year, we'll begin to see then a sequential growth in revenue, which will get us then to year-over-year revenue growth in the latter part of 2016. And when I think about the expense story, again, I'm trying to manage, we're trying to manage the two together. And so from an international, overall international consumer point of view, I'd expect as we continue to make investments in selected growth investments, whether its technology or I mentioned digital and infrastructure, I'd say that we're going to pace the revenues against the revenue growth. And for the international GCB overall, we would look to return then to positive operating leverage in the latter half of the year. Matt Burnell : Okay. So it sounds like that guidance really hasn't changed very much? John Gerspach : No. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just back stateside, given your strong capital levels and where you sit relative to your minimum requirements. I guess, I'm just curious if you're thinking even more aggressively about potentially using some of that capital to focus on non-organic growth in some of your US businesses as a way of accelerating use of the DTA? Michael Corbat : You know Matt, what we've said there is that we don't and will not look at transactions and rationalize the transaction or a purchase around DTA utilization. DTA utilization is the benefit that comes out of good transactions and that was the case in Best Buy, we believe that's the case in Costco. And we're wide open as John said we've got the resource balance sheet capital capability around things that are accretive to our firm to step into large situations and we're open to that. Unfortunately in this environment there's not a lot of those out there, but we'll continue to look. And again, staying true to our strategy, staying true to our target client base, if those opportunities present themselves, we'll try and take advantage of it. Matt Burnell : Okay. Fair enough. And finally, an administrative question. John, you'd mentioned in the past when holdings was a much bigger portion of the overall balance sheet that maybe at around 5% of assets you would think about folding holdings back into at least the reporting of the company. How are you thinking about that now that you're at about 4%? John Gerspach : Yes, and actually we've had conversations like that. The question always becomes where would we put it? And I don't want to take the assets that are in holdings and simply put them back into the businesses quote, from whence they came. Otherwise we would spend the entire call with you explaining how much of anything that happened was related to legacy assets. The alternate construct would be just to take and put it all into Corp/Other, but I almost get to the same point where I'd think then you'd all want to have more detail as far as what is in Corp/Other related to those legacy assets. So it's still something that Mike and I talk about all the time and at some point we will likely collapse it into say Corporate/Other. But it's probably still just a little bit too big to put into Corporate/Other just to avoid basically splitting it all out again just so that you guys will have a clearer picture of it. So it's a bit annoying to have it out there as something separate, but we're not ready to combine it yet with Corp/Other. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. A quick question on the Costco. Was it right that you said it was expecting, the portfolio acquisition was expected to close late in the second quarter? John Gerspach : Yes, we said later in the second quarter. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, is there any risk though that since it's an April 1 cutoff for the contract that you've started the contract without actually acquiring the portfolio? And why did it get pushed back past the contract date? John Gerspach : No, as you can imagine, we're involved in a rather intense discussion with both the current owner of the portfolio as well as Costco. And as we have gone down trying to figure out what is the best way to affect the handover. What we determined in running down this process is that a date where we can get a concurrent closing of the portfolio as well as then a conversion of all of the operations is probably the simplest and most efficient solution for everybody. And it's probably the best way to ensure a seamless customer experience as well. So then as we looked at various dates, something in June just seemed to work best as far as a date that we could point to when we could not only transfer the portfolio, but then also make sure that there's a nice clean hand off of all the operational aspects of the portfolio as well. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then just a second question. I know you laid out the macro conditions and how they are deteriorating somewhat across the globe, but I mean, doesn't that argue for a period of belt tightening as opposed to renewed investment? I know there's attractive opportunities you're saying, but I mean, isn't there other places that should be cutting as well at the same time on expenses? Michael Corbat : Well, as you look around the globe, we're forecasting somewhere, depending how you build China into the forecast, somewhere GDP growth, somewhere between 2.5 and 2.8. 2% out of developed markets, 4% out of developing markets. And if you look at the US, the US has a candidly, a pretty good feel to it. And so, I wouldn't argue to belt tightening there. If we look at what's going on in Europe and we talked about what we see, not just some of the absolute, but some of the relative opportunities there, that feels pretty good. And then you start to look at pieces and parts of the rest of the franchise. A lot of these franchises on the ground are TTS franchises and different parts and pieces there. So we're going to continue to be very mindful. You've seen us, we talked about the overall headcount reduction which is net of significant investment into controls and we're going to continue to be mindful and to make sure that we are scaling and sizing our company to what we think the opportunities are. And I think that we've shown we haven't been afraid at the right times to make the investments and we haven't been afraid at the tougher times to pull things back, and I think that will be the case in '16. John Gerspach : And don't forget, I mean, with the investments that we're planning, our guidance is that we intend to hold the operating efficiency ratio constant with this year. So therefore, our goal is to fund those investments through additional operational efficiencies. As I mentioned, we're constantly looking to make the place more efficient and adjust the capacity level. So all of that will continue and all we're saying is that we're going to use those savings to fund these investment programs which we think are beneficial for the future. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Great. Thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes, hi. I just wanted to slip one quick question in as a follow-up to Betsy's question on CCAR. Mike, we appreciate that you're coming into this year's CCAR with strong ratios and of course, we don't have the parameters yet. You've always talked about the progress on the qualitative side as just that, progress. And I'm wondering if you're satisfied enough with your progress in terms of your qualitative report card to feel confident about a step up in ASK [ph] this year? Michael Corbat : Again, I think the ASK, there's a couple components there because you layout to the ASK. And one is what do your numbers tell you and second is, how do you feel from your process? We have continued [Technical Difficulty]really ever gets to an end state, we'll see. But I feel better today than I felt a year ago given our investments about where we are qualitatively and I hope I feel better a year from today than I feel today around that. So long winded answer of saying feel better about where we are qualitatively, but more work to do. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Good afternoon. John Gerspach : Hi, Steven. Steven Chubak : So I have actually a follow-up to Erica's question. Just thinking about the upcoming CCAR submission, recognizing it's still early days. But within the submission itself, Mike, you mentioned that you like how the fourth quarter balance sheet looks, but does Costco and the additional receivables have to be contemplated as part of your submission? John Gerspach : Steven, we'll assume in CCAR that we go ahead with the Costco acquisition. We think that that is responsive to the rules as they currently exist. But again, the acquisition date will be somewhat later in June. And so we'll have to see what stress tests look like as far as what the condition of the portfolio would be in when we acquire it in June. Steven Chubak : Understood. And just switching over to the risk-weighted asset size within capital. I appreciate a lot of the guidance that you've given in terms of the holdings trajectory and the reduction that we're expecting on the coming year. But it appears as though that benefit is now going to be exhausted or largely exhausted in terms of RWA shrinkage and yet you're going to be continuing to grow Citicorp on a core basis. And just want to get a sense as to how we should be thinking about the RWA trajectory for 2016 given all of those moving parts? John Gerspach : Yes, we rarely give guidance on the RWA. But again, there is several things that would go on there. One, as you mentioned, we will continue to wind down holdings and we will continue to get some benefit there. Currently, we would look to see that, that should more or less give us some ability then to manage growth in the rest of Citicorp with the exception of course of the addition of the Costco portfolio. But then you've got on the other hand, we continually, as I said before, looking to make sure that we're running even a more risk efficient balance sheet. So I think you might see some increase in RWA coming into 2016, but I wouldn't guide you to some huge amount of growth. Steven Chubak : Understood. And just given the market risk proposal that came out and recognizing you've only had a mere 24 hours to digest the release from BASEL. But do you have any preliminary expectations or takeaways from what came out yesterday, and what's a reasonable expectation for even a range of potential market risk inflation? John Gerspach : My initial impression, not that I have gone through the whole thing, but from people that I've spoken to here that actually have begun to go through it, is that they still need to do a lot more work. And so we will continue to try to pass appropriate commentary on to the right parties to see that that work is done. But if you take a look don't forget, our risk-weighted assets coming out of market risk currently are $77 billion. It's roughly 6% of the total RWA. So while this proposal could have a significant impact on our market risk RWA, you've got to gauge it in the fact that we're talking about 6% of our total RWA. Steven Chubak : Got it. And then just one ticky tack question on the NIM guidance. John, you mentioned that any rate benefit, which sounds like it'll be relatively modest that's contemplated within the guidance for '16, is going to be offset by a reduction in trading NII. I just wanted to get a sense as to what's driving that? Is it a function of lower inventory levels, issuance tied to TLAC or is it something else? John Gerspach : No, trading NIM is something that is largely variable, and only because you - the composition of your portfolios change constantly. And so this year, I would just say that we've had a larger than expected contribution to NIM coming off the trading book than we would have experienced in years past. And I haven't gotten yet to the point where I'm comfortable saying that that's the new norm. And so, if trading NIM reverts back closer to where it was in the past, then it could offset some of the - all or some of the benefit that we expect to get out of rates. But you know, I'll certainly have more to talk to you about as we get further into '16 and we see whether or not we've actually got the trading NIM really working consistently at this point in time. Steven Chubak : Thanks for clarifying that, John. And appreciate you taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. John Gerspach : Hey, Eric. Eric Wasserstrom : Hi, how are you? Mike, I just want to bring together some of your comments to make sure I understand sort of the strategic imperatives as it comes to a lot of the repositioning that's occurred. So on the four quadrant slide that you first introduced that seems to still describe your approach. Is the bar getting higher for the businesses that are in the upper left hand quadrant or is that more or less a static standard? Michael Corbat : I would say at the time we introduced that, we also - at the time we introduced that firm wide was also coincided with it at the point in time we put our targets in place. So I would say that those have largely been the same or consistent over the 3 years. Clearly, leverage has been introduced, supplemental leverage has been introduced since then. There's been the evolution of CCAR and CCAR returns. And so today, I would say that actually we're looking at it in some ways consistently, but in other ways with the additional view of some of the lenses I just mentioned. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And is anything that's going on in the broader macro economy causing some business lines or geographies to fall out of that segment and into the lower right segment? Michael Corbat : No, I would say not right now. You'll get some things that have some aberration. So an example I would give you is we have in parts of our cards portfolio, we've got gasoline cards. So simply spend on gasoline cards have come down by a third when volumes are the same. And so you're not necessarily going to take a short-term view and say that gee, gas cards is a bad business. It may not be what we wanted at this point of the cycle or at this inflection point in oil prices. But again, in here, we're not taking short-term views around these. So I would say at this point not. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And John, one quick balance sheet question. You talked about the debt buyback as a consequence of the OneMain sale and the fact that you have so little non-operational deposits left. At this stage, is there any real balance sheet optimization opportunity left to you or have those been largely exhausted? John Gerspach : Well, I'd say there's always some opportunity. I mean, obviously, we've taken a good chunk of the opportunity so far and become more and more efficient. But there's still ways of optimizing the balance sheet. So not necessarily making it more efficient by making it smaller, but there's still elements of balance sheet optimization such as shifting more of the balance sheet towards those higher ROA businesses. So I'd say that maybe the word going forward will be optimization rather than making it more efficient. But in anyway it's still targeting our focus on improving the overall ROA. Eric Wasserstrom : Got it. Excellent. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions in queue at this time. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you, Brent, and thank you all for spending the time with us today. If you have any follow up questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take any questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.5 billion for the first quarter of 2016 or $1.10 per share. These results reflect a difficult macro environment, which was more challenging than we anticipated when we entered the year. That said, we continue to make progress in key areas. We grew loans and deposits in our core businesses, utilized different tax assets, generated and returned capital to our shareholders and reduced our expenses while absorbing a significant repositioning charge. In our institutional businesses, market sensitive products clearly suffered from weak investor sentiment during the quarter. This primarily impacted our trading and investment banking revenues. However, our accrual and transaction service businesses posted 7% year-on-year growth, consistent with recent quarters. These businesses are gaining market share and now contribute almost half of our institutional revenues. Investor sentiment was also impacted our consumer business including wealth management and especially in Asia. And while U.S. branded cards showed stronger performance across key indicators, both top and bottom-line results remained lower due to the investments we are making in that business. Overall, credit trends remained very stable in our consumer portfolios as we continued to focus on our targeted segments. Our global consumer bank is now entirely focused on our priority markets of the U.S., Mexico and Asia, and we see real path for growing our franchise. We\u2019ve been optimizing our footprint in terms of countries and branches to make sure we are allocating our resources to areas where they can generate the best returns. In the last three years, we have exited or are in the process of exiting from 19 consumer markets. And in February, we announced we would sell our consumer businesses in Brazil, Argentina and Colombia and focus solely on our growing institutional business in South America. During the quarter, we also reduced our branch footprint by 82 while increasing our average deposits in our nearly 2,700 branches globally. We also took a repositioning charge in the quarter. Repositioning is part of our effort to make share Citi is appropriately sized and structured for the current environment. We have identified opportunities for greater efficiencies in our regional models including additional delayering and shifting staff to our service centers which now host more than half of our people. That will drive an additional reduction of headcount which was down 3% during the quarter to 225,000, almost 40,000 fewer than when I became CEO. We also drove another significant reduction of assets in Citi Holdings, which were down 10% from the end of last year and down 44% from one year ago. For the seventh quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable. And while our work isn\u2019t done with Holdings assets now accounting for just 4% of our balance sheet, we won\u2019t report Holdings results -- we won\u2019t report Holdings separately after this year. And being able to do, this is a testament to the excellent work of the Holdings team, which we expect to remain intact and continue to unwind the remaining assets. The wind down of Citi Holdings is a significant milestone for our institution and it\u2019s been a long time goal. We said, we take Citi Holdings to a point where its assets weren\u2019t meaningful enough to merit separate reporting and that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Another area we\u2019ve focused on is shrinking our deferred tax assets. In the first quarter, we utilized an additional $1.6 billion in DTAs, which contributed to a net increase of $6 billion in regulatory capital and our CET1 ratio increasing to 12.3%. We continue to return capital to our shareholders, repurchasing 31 million in common shares during the quarter, bringing the net reduction of outstanding shares to just under a 100 million over the last four quarters. Our tangible book value per share increased almost $2 to $62.58 in the quarter. We continue to make progress in our efforts to be a safer and stronger institution. And earlier this week, we learned that neither the Fed nor the FDIC found any deficiencies in our 2015 resolution plan. And last week, we submitted our capital plan to the Federal Reserve. We believe that the combination of an even stronger capital position and the improvements we\u2019ve made in our capital planning process as well as in our risk management, compliance and control functions have allowed us to make a strong submission. While 2016 didn\u2019t get off to the start we\u2019d hoped for, the environment stabilized in the second half of the quarter. Volatility decreased as some of the more pessimistic scenarios failed to materialize. However, the outlook is still right with risks from political elections to interest rates. I think as we\u2019ve shown in this quarter, we can manage through challenging times. We think we have -- where we have too much capacity, we\u2019ll reduce it, while still serving our clients. We think certain sectors are showing science of weakness, we\u2019ll manage our exposures even more tightly. John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we highlight the impact of CVA/DVA on our prior period results. Beginning this quarter, we adopted Fed B\u2019s new accounting standard on the reporting of DVA or debt valuation adjustments. Under the new rule, changes in DVA that relate to Citi\u2019s own credit spreads are no longer recognized in earnings, but instead are reflected in OCI. So, we longer need to adjust our reported revenues in net income to exclude this item. Going forward therefore, we will speak to reported results in our earnings presentation, which should be largely comparable to the historical results excluding CVA/DVA. On Slide 4, we show total Citigroup results. In the first quarter, we earned $3.5 billion. Revenues of $17.6 billion declined 11% from last year, mostly driven by lower industry-wide activity in markets and investment banking, a continued wind down of Citi Holdings and the impact of FX translation. In constant dollars, revenues were down 9% including a 6% decline in our core Citicorp businesses. Expenses decreased 3% year-over-year, driven by the wind down of Citi Holdings, lower legal expenses and the benefit from FX translation, partially offset by higher repositioning costs and ongoing investments in the franchise. And net credit losses continued to improve offset by a loan loss reserve build this quarter compared to a net release in the prior year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 1% year-over-year to $619 billion, as 5% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 5% to $935 billion. On Slide 5, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp revenues of $16.1 billion were down 9% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, as I mentioned, revenues were down 6% from last year, mostly driven by capital markets related businesses, fixed income, equities, investment banking and Asia Wealth Management as well as the impact of our continued investments in U.S. branded cards. Citicorp expenses increased 2%, reflecting the higher repositioning charges and ongoing investments in our franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the benefit from FX translation. And cost and credit grew 29% from the first quarter of last year, almost entirely driven by the energy sector. Otherwise, credit quality remained favorable. In ICG, we saw very little net cost of credit outside of energy this quarter. And in consumer, our NCL and rates, both continued to improve, although we are not benefiting from reserve releases as we had in the prior year. Citi Holdings contributed pretax earnings of $477 million this quarter, mostly driven by gains on asset sales. For the remainder of the year, we expect Citi Holdings to be closer to breakeven. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by $8 billion this quarter and in the period with $73 billion of assets or just 4% of total Citigroup with signed agreements in place to sell $10 billion of this remaining amount. And as Mike noted earlier, 2016 is the last year we\u2019ll report Citi Holdings as a separate segment. Turning now to each business, on Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, international consumer banking revenues decline 2% year-over-year. And Latin America consumer, which is now comprised solely of our Mexico franchise, revenues grew 2% as growth in retail banking continued to be partially offset by pressure in cards. We saw good momentum in retail banking drivers, including 11% growth in average deposits and 9% growth in average retail loans. However, card balances remained under pressure in Mexico, as continued growth in purchase sales was offset by higher payment rates, reflecting our focus on higher credit quality segments of the market. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues decline 4% year-over-year, driven by weak investment sales revenues, as well as continued but abating regulatory pressures in cards. Outside of wealth management, retail banking revenues continued to grow year-over-year. And in card, we believe we are through the most significant regulatory headwinds, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment. In total, average international loans grew 1% from last year. Card purchase sales grew 4% and average deposits grew 5%. Operating expenses grew 4%, driven by higher repositioning charges and an increase in technology investments, primarily in Mexico, while core expenses in Asia were roughly flat. And finally, total international consumer credit costs increased 7% from last year, reflecting the impact of reserve releases in the prior period. Net credit losses declined and the NCL rates improved to 1.6%. On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. The first quarter is historically a strong period for wealth management in Asia with higher transaction activity driving strong investment sales revenues. Given weak investor sentiment during the quarter, we didn\u2019t see the typical rebound in transaction activity and therefore our wealth management revenue declined significantly from last year. However, we have seen consistent net inflows in our assets under management, as you can see on the slide with the declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. Therefore, we remain well-positioned to serve these clients as market confidence improves in the future. Turning to cards, card purchase sales have slowed in the current environment but payment rates have stabilized and as a result our average card loans have continued to grow. As we begin to cycle past the most significant regulatory headwinds, this loan growth is starting to have a positive impact on revenue. So, while card revenue still declined year-over-year, the trends continue to improve and we believe we\u2019re on a path to achieve revenue growth in cards by the second half of the year. And credit trends remain favorable across the entire consumer business in Asia. Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 4% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were roughly flat, excluding a $110 million gain on the sale of our Texas branches last year as continued growth in loans in deposit spreads was offset by lower mortgage gain on sale revenues. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 6% from last year, driven by higher acquisition and rewards costs as we have continued to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products. I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment. So, we continue to feel good about the investments we are making. And in fact, we saw a year-over-year growth in our average loans this quarter for the first time since 2008. And turning to retail services, revenues of $1.7 billion increased 3% from last year, mostly reflecting gains on the sale of two small portfolios. Even including the impact of these asset sales, average loans were flat year-over-year and purchase sales increased 2%. Total expenses of $2.5 billion in North America increased 7%, driven by higher repositioning costs and marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings as we continue to capture scale benefits in cards and rationalize our branch footprint. As previously announced, we exited over 50 branches this quarter, as we continue to concentrate on our key markets and adapt to a significant shift in customer behavior to digital channels. And finally, credit costs in North America increased 17% from last year, driven by a reserve build of approximately $80 million this quarter in our commercial portfolio related to energy credits. Our energy exposure in the commercial business is significantly smaller than the corporate portfolio we report in the ICG. On a global basis, we have energy exposure of $2.1 billion in the commercial business with $1.4 billion funded, 90% of which is in North America. The credits are mostly in the E&P and services and drilling segments and are predominantly non-investment grade. We have no exposure in the commercial portfolio to junior or second lien positions and our funded reserve ratio is roughly 9%. We provide more details on this portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. On Slide 9, we show some key performance indicators for North America branded cards including year-over-year growth in average active accounts, average card loans, and purchase sales for our total portfolio. In the second half of last year, we began to ramp up new account acquisitions in our core products and these investments are beginning to have a significant impact. Growth in average active accounts and purchase sales began to accelerate late last year and these trends are now driving total loan growth as well even as our legacy portfolios continue to shrink. Card revenues were still down year-over-year this quarter but we believe we can return to growth sometime in the latter part of 2016, not including the benefit of acquiring the cost Costco portfolio. Slide 10 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. So, as we look at our consumer franchise globally, there are few things to highlight on Slide 11. First is the impact of the current environment on market sensitive businesses including wealth management as well as mortgage, which together drove a year-over-year decline in revenues of nearly $150 million. Second is our continued investment in U.S. cards, which is putting pressure on revenues today, but is also starting to drive real underlying performance improvement. And third is the impact of regulatory changes in our business particularly in Asia, which we believe is abating. When you pull back these drivers, you can see we are achieving growth, although muted, driven by overall growth in personal loans, card volumes and deposits. And we\u2019ve achieved this growth with very little change in our core expenses, in fact year-over-year the entire increase in our consumer operating expenses was driven by the combination of investments and higher repositioning costs. As we move forward, we believe, we are making the right investments to grow the higher return markets and products in our franchise and that as these investments mature and we cycle past the remaining regulatory headwinds, we will be well positioned to drive higher returns to something in the range of 20% RoTCE in a more normal rate environment. Turning now to the intuitional clients group on Slide 12, revenues of $8 billion in the first quarter declined 12% from last year, driven by market sensitive businesses, fixed income, equities, and investment banking, total banking revenues of $4 billion excluding the impact of loan hedges declined 6%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients as well as improved deposit spreads. Investment banking revenues of $875 million were down 27% from last year, driven by an industry-wide slowdown in activity levels as well as our strong performance in M&A the prior year. Private bank revenues of $746 million grew 5% year-over-year, driven by higher loan and deposit balances. And corporate lending revenues of $455 million were down 4% on a reported basis. In constant dollars, lending revenue declined 2% from last year as higher volumes were more than offset by the impact of positive fair value marks in the prior period. Total market and security services revenues of $4.1 billion declined 15% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.1 billion were down 11% from last year. Rates in currencies grew 5% year-over-year with particular strength in March as market conditions improved versus the start of the year. However, this growth was more than offset by lower activity levels and a less favorable environment in both securitized products and commodities. Equities revenues declined 19%, reflecting the impact of lower volumes in cash equities as well as weaker performance in derivatives. In security services, revenues grew 3%, reflecting a modest gain on the sale of our private equity fund services businesses. And other included a charge of approximately $180 million, reflecting the write-down of virtually all of our investments in Venezuela as a result of changes in the exchange rate. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 5% year-over-year, driven by higher legal and repositioning costs. Core expenses were down 1% as higher regulatory in compliance costs and investments were more than offset by lower compensation expense and the impact of FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $390 million were down from the fourth quarter but up significantly from last year. Nearly all of the ICG credit costs this quarter were related to energy. We built roughly $260 million of additional reserves and recognized losses of roughly $150 million in the energy sector. The reserve builds were concentrated in the E&P and services and drilling segments driven by ratings migration due to sustained low oil prices as well as the impact of regulatory guidance. At quarter end, our total energy exposure in ICG was $57 billion of which approximately $22 billion was funded. The funded reserve ratio was 4.2% including a funded reserve ratio of over 10% on the non-investment grade portion. We have very little second lien exposure in the corporate portfolio with $85 million of total exposure and reserves against roughly a third of this amount. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio as well as the nature of our unfunded exposures in the appendix to our earnings presentation. As we look at the potential for additional energy and non-energy provisions for the rest of 2016, if oil prices were in the range of around $30 per barrel, we now estimate our full-year ICG cost of credit would be roughly $1.4 billion. This is higher than our previous estimate of roughly $1 billion with about two-thirds of the increase related to the potential impact of regulatory guidance and the remainder reflecting our revised view on the portfolio. If you look across both the commercial and corporate portfolios, our total exposure to reserve based lending in North America is roughly $4 billion of which $2 billion is funded and we have a 9% funded reserve ratio against these loans. We estimate that our total RBL exposure could be reduced by roughly $500 million as a result of the upcoming spring redeterminations, and year-to-date, we have seen no material draw downs against these facilities. Turning back to ICG, we saw a significant increase in corporate non-accrual loans this quarter, up by $730 million sequentially with roughly $500 million related to energy and $90 million related to metals and mining. Our total metals and mining exposure was $13 billion at the end of the first quarter with roughly $5 billion funded, and we did not incur any cost of credit on the portfolio in the first quarter. The increase in non-accrual loans in metals and mining as well as other sectors outside of energy did not result in a material cost of credit as we have significant collateral against many of the loans. Nearly two-thirds of both the total additions as well as the energy-related additions to non-accrual loans this quarter remain performing. On Slide 13, we show the year-over-year EBT walks for ICG, highlighting several themes. First, despite the challenging market conditions this quarter, we continued to see growth in several of our accrual and transaction services businesses including treasury and trades solutions, private banks, and security services. The market environment had a biggest impact on fixed income, equities, and investment banking, which together were down 16% year-over-year. To offset these pressures, we continue to actively address our structure, reducing capacity in areas where revenues are likely to remain muted, while preserving our client facing capabilities, and these actions drove much of the repositioning charge in ICG this quarter. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on low hedges driven by spread movements and of course the higher credit cost in energy. Turning to the next slide, as I noted, we saw continued growth this quarter in many of our ICG businesses. Together, TTS, corporate lending, private bank and security services account for nearly half of total ICG revenues and they grew 7% year-over-year this quarter in constant dollars. This growth trend has been consistent over time as we\u2019ve deepened our relationships with our target clients and gained market share, particularly as some peers have retrenched and reduced their global presence. Our strategy focused on providing integrated solutions to a targeted set of clients on a global basis is clearly yielding positive results. It does not mean that we would be immune to revenue swings in more market sensitive businesses like markets and investment banking, but our mix of traditional banking and transaction services does provide a stable, growing base of revenues in more efficient, higher return businesses where we believe revenues are likely to remain muted and we\u2019re taking appropriate measures to optimize our capacity without diminishing our client capabilities, and we are remaining disciplined on credit. So, while we will not be immune to credit cycles, we strongly believe that our focus on larger multinational clients should result in better performance through the cycle. All of these reasons are why we are still confident that our ICG business is capable of producing an RoTCE in the range of 14% in a more normal environment. Slide 15 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues increased year-over-year, mostly reflecting higher investment income. And expenses were down, mainly reflecting lower legal and related costs. On Slide 16 we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 292 basis points this quarter, flat for the fourth quarter as the sale of OneMain was fully offset by the impact of higher rates. Our NIM should be fairly stable at this level in the second quarter as we continue to offset the impact of the wind down of Citi Holdings, with improvements in the core franchise. And we expect the acquisition of the Costco portfolio to provide a benefit of about 3 basis points, resulting in a NIM of roughly 295 basis points in the second half of the year. On Slide 17, we show our key regulatory capital metrics, on a fully implemented basis. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.3%, driven by net income, OCI movements and approximately $1.6 billion of DTA utilization, partially offset by $1.5 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.4%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% year-over-year to $62.58. Before we turn it over to questions, I\u2019d like to make a few comments regarding our expectations for full year 2016. Clearly, this year started with a more challenging environment than we had anticipated, resulting in lower revenues and a higher operating efficiency ratio than we had planned, even before the pull forward of certain repositioning actions into the quarter. While the expense saves resulting from these repositioning actions will help offset some of this pressure, we still expect our full year operating efficiency ratio to be higher than we had anticipated, in the range of around 58%. This outlook assumes that equity and fixed income market revenues will be roughly flat sequentially in the second quarter and then exhibit a normal seasonal decline into the third and fourth quarters. We believe investment banking revenues should recover from first quarter levels, if the environment is favorable, based on the significant backlog of deals we have pending with our clients. And we should be able to continue growing the accrual and transaction services businesses year-over-year in ICG, as I described earlier. On the consumer side, we continue to believe we can achieve year over year revenue growth in our existing U.S. branded cards and Asia cards businesses in the latter half of 2016. And of course, we will benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio in June. Turning to Citicorp expenses, there are a few things to consider. First, we believe that regulatory and compliance costs have started to plateau. And we expect the repositioning actions we took in the first quarter to payback with roughly $400 million of total savings during the remainder of the year. So, even though we expect to incur significant additional expenses related to Costco in the second half, we believe our core operating expenses in Citicorp can remain roughly flat sequentially going into the second quarter and then decline somewhat thereafter. Repositioning cost should be significantly lower for the remainder of the year. And in total, legal and repositioning costs should run in the range of about 225 basis points of Citicorp revenue this year, higher than our original estimate of 200 basis points, again due to lower revenue assumptions. While this quarter\u2019s results were disappointing, we believe we are taking the right actions to address our cost base, while at the same time continuing to invest in those areas where we have a competitive advantage and can achieve strong returns over time. We continue to demonstrate strong capital generation this quarter and we remain highly focused on resource allocation across the franchise. And with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Question on energy, I appreciate the update, but that\u2019s a $30 oil or $40 now, obviously that can move. But do you think that if we stay above 40 that the pressure would be a little less should we think but how do we frame I guess oil prices if they remain higher? John Gerspach : Yes. I think a little bit of that is going to be determined based upon where sentiment plays out. So, clearly when we set up these guidance for year and what we\u2019re looking at is the expectation, let\u2019s say oil in a band of 30 to 35. The oil consistently stays above 40 and especially on a forward curve, you see continued price increases, then yes, the credit costs that I quoted should be somewhat less. Jim Mitchell : Okay, but not dramatically so, materially higher? John Gerspach : There will be somewhat less. Jim Mitchell : Fair enough, and just maybe a follow-up on the Costco acquisition. I appreciate the color on expenses. Should we expect that overall with all the puts and takes to be -- I think you initially were hoping would be modestly accretive, is that still the expectation? John Gerspach : Very modestly accretive. I mean, I think that\u2019s a net income. I think it\u2019s really going to be roughly flat, Jim. I mean that\u2019s I think the best way to think about it. We\u2019ll generate a buck or two of net income, but really the way to think about it is flat. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : I just want to make sure I got all the moving parts, and I appreciate all the guidance. I think it\u2019s fair to assume, we\u2019re not going to model loan hedges, the hit that you took this quarter, the write down of Venezuela that happened this quarter. It sounds like with the new guidance, energy reserving could stay about this level, given your past comments to Jim\u2019s question. So, the big deltas from here over the next couple of quarters would be trading gets better and your comments about legal and repositioning being a lot lower. Have I got all the big moving pieces right? John Gerspach : Yes. And also, don\u2019t forget, we do believe that in the second half of the year, we are going to get year-over-year revenue growth coming out of the U.S. branded cards business as well as the Asia cards business, one as we see those investments begin to really kick-in on the final piece of the puzzle. We\u2019ve gotten new account acquisition, now we\u2019re seeing the receivable balances build, so that revenue growth now should be clearly visible in the latter part of 2016. And in Asia, again, credit cards, we believe that we\u2019re working our way through the last of the regulatory pressure and therefore we should get growth out of that business. But yes, I\u2019d say it\u2019s those things and then the continued growth of the accrual businesses and ICG, and the big wild card is going to be what happens with market sentiment. Glenn Schorr : Yes. And then, if we could drill down on the comments about markets. Obviously, January and February had a lot thrown at it and we all saw the weakness. Your comments for flattish markets revenues in second quarter, I think a lot of us were thinking like it\u2019s not great, but it\u2019s better than where we were in January and February. I\u2019m curious if there is more behind that conservatism besides just that we\u2019re not far out of the woods just yet? John Gerspach : Well, I think that March was clearly better than January and February. And April is kind of following along March\u2019s path. But I wouldn\u2019t call either March or early April robust, it\u2019s good, better than it was in January and February, but it\u2019s still not a robust market. So, maybe I\u2019m being a bit cautious, but I\u2019d rather be a little cautious and plan that way than say that everything is bounding back and it\u2019s all going to be a great and glorious second quarter. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. Last little one is the proxy came out, I was curious to see the elimination of the ROA target in the outset and go all in on total stockholder return. I think shareholders would like that piece, but I\u2019m curious on what brought the change? Mike Corbat : Glenn, it\u2019s Mike. Your last comment of shareholders would like what? Glenn Schorr : The fact that 100% of management\u2019s long-term incentive plan is now driven by total shareholder return, but I was curious on why the drop of the ROA component of it? Mike Corbat : Well, as John referenced in his comments, we\u2019re not walking away from targets and the disciplines in the firm having change. So John laid out the path of getting to 57 for the remaining three quarters, bringing us in somewhere around 58 in a reasonable environment through the year in firm, so ROA focused and all those. But realistically, we thought we would be transitioning here to much more of a return on equity set of targets; John spoke about some of the targets that we\u2019re putting into the businesses. And at the end of the day, really what you\u2019re looking at is the pathway to how we can get our firm to getting to the returns that you want and expect. And so maybe we were overly simplistic in the plan this year really just focusing on that. Again these plans are year-to-year will continue to take feedback and if that feedback is consistent out there, we\u2019ll think of those things as we go into the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : So, just a quick one on the return on tangible outlook that you gave for both GCB and ICG, so, the 20% in GCB, I think you indicated a normal rate environment. Could you maybe give us some color around what normal is, John? And then in ICG, it was a bit more broad than normal. So, if you could maybe just help us understand what you mean by normal in ICG too? John Gerspach : Well, I\u2019d say that we think in terms of what we consider to be a normal environment. I\u2019d say you\u2019d start with certainly having a U.S. GDP growth something closer to 3% than the 2% that we\u2019re looking at and you certainly would have a higher GDP growth then coming out of the emerging markets. You would expect market sentiment, a little less volatility, less fear, driving improvements in markets as well as investment banking activities and none of that was clearly visible in the first quarter. And I\u2019d say a more conducive rate environment with let\u2019s just say a fed funds rate of about 200 basis points or so higher than where it is today. I think that would be a good start as far as trying to defining a more normal environment. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s beyond the realm of possibility. Brennan Hawken : And then next one, I am not sure what you can say but you guys got a very, very favorable living will outcome here this week and some investors pointed the fact that you\u2019ve highlighted a commitment to increasing capital returns in your deck upfront while certainly that\u2019s not a new goal for you thinking about CCAR right around the corner. Is there anything that you can add on those fronts and on the regulatory front and how those discussions are going? John Gerspach : I think the results we\u2019ve got in terms of the resolution planning was one where the whole firm came together to submit the plan, and we were obviously very pleased with the outcome. And in many ways, it\u2019s the same way we refocused the firm around our CCAR submissions. It\u2019s what we\u2019ve really tried to build into the fabric of the place. So, our investments that we put forward, we think on the qualitative side hopefully will show themselves. And again in this kind of environment, we\u2019ve been producing lots of capital. And we know we\u2019ve got to be in the position for meaningful capital return and we want to be on that path. So, we think that the submission we put in on CCAR was a strong one and we will see in June the results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : You\u2019ve highlighted your progress, which is good reducing headcount, branches, consumer markets, holdings expenses and DTAs but the ROE, tangible ROE is still only 7%. Now, you did say that the results were disappointing and that you\u2019ll get better returns with a \"more normal environment\u201d, but from my standpoint having covered the -- for a long time, the market\u2019s not buying it. The stocks at 72% of tangible book value looks like this year will be the 10th in a row with returns below the cost of capital and note some large U.S. peers managed to have much higher returns. So, the question is why not do more? So, the tactical question, which is I think is an easy one, if the efficiency ratio this quarter was 60%, you\u2019re guiding this year for 58%, that implies the next three quarters should be much better than 60%, if you could just clarify why that\u2019s the case. And the tougher one is the strategic question, can\u2019t you accelerate restructuring more than what you\u2019ve already done? You\u2019ve highlighted what you\u2019ve done but with the stock at 72% tangible book value, you should be selling the silverware in the dining rooms or the paperclips in the desk or that the desk chairs or the whole desk to free up capital buyback stock here. And the one area in particular I know we brought it up before, but why not sell Banamex, why not sell the Mexican bank, monetize that gain, use the DTAs to avoid paying taxes, avoid integrating it for Project Rainbow and use the proceeds to buy back stocks? What else can you do? And can you give us a sense of additional urgency because with the 7% ROE and 72% of tangible book value at stock price, it seems like you guys should be doing more? John Gerspach : Brennan had a two questions limit. Let us start, Mike, maybe I\u2019ll\u2026 Mike Corbat : You go and then I\u2019ll jump in. John Gerspach : So, let\u2019s talk about efficiency ratio. So, the comments that we made on the 58%, what we said is that the expectation would be that the repositioning actions that we took this quarter should begin to drive down expenses in the second half. And I think if you followed the revenue guidance that we gave, Mike, and the expense guidance that we gave that should get you to a point of about a 57% efficiency ratio for the balance of the year, that had been our guidance for the full year, tough to recover from the first quarter that we had but we felt that it was important to get the balance of the year back on the target that we had originally set. And we think that again with the outlook that we've put forward by and large we're there. So, that's on the efficiency aspect of it. As far as how we improve the returns and everything one of the things that you need to focus on is the fact that we do have $29 billion of capital tangible common equity tied up in DTA. It's hard for us and that's impossible for us to get a return on that capital, what we do in the back of the deck is we do show you that adjusting for that DTA capital even our current business over the last four quarters in the environment that it is whether you look at Citicorp or Citi Holdings, we're generating a 10% return on the capital excluding that capital tied up in DTA, and that's not making an excuse it's just showing you where we have the issue which means that we're really focused on driving down the DTA, utilizing the DTA which should add to the capital strength and which should then give us the ability overtime to return more capital to our shareholder, so that is definitely consistent with what we have been talking about. And there's another element, we'll continue to drive down Citi Holdings. We've driven it down to where it is now at the level at it is, we've got still more assets to do, that is capital tied up in Citi Holdings that is not really earning an adequate return, we'll free that capital up, we'll return that capital to the shareholders. So, those are elements of the path forward and then the final is as we have put out we still believe that our consumer business is capable of generating a 20% RoTCE in a normal environment and the ICG of 14% in consumer we told you and we're focused, we're focused on cards and wealth management, we think that that's the right path forward, we think that's the right way to grow revenue, we think that those are both good efficiency and a high return businesses, we've got to focus on moving more of our account acquisition to digital channels that'll really benefit the efficiency ratio as well. In the ICG we've got a nice base selling in those accrual and transaction services business. 7% compound annual growth rate even in the somewhat challenging environment that we've all been operating in the last two years, investment banking we feel really good about that franchise, it's a bad quarter, there wasn't much deal volume. But we've got a very high backlog in investment banking and that's why we feel that those revenues should improve in the balance of the year. When it comes to our fixed income franchise, I don't think anybody can top our rates and currencies franchise. Even in this environment rates and currencies revenue is up 5% year-over-year and those are good performing businesses. I think our rates business really outperformed because basically foreign exchange was somewhat flat year-over-year, our real outperformance was in rates, we've got a great franchise in rates and our customers recognize that. We've got some work to do as far as adjusting capacities for our products, we're taking care of that and finally we're continuing to make investments in equities, the equities should help us overtime, it did not help us in this quarter. But that's the path forward Mike, we don't think it's the time to start selling the furniture Mike I don't know if you've got a comment. Mike Corbat : If it\u2019d help I'll just close it with the conversation on Mexico because you specifically mentioned Mexico. Mexico for us is an important franchise and as John talks about the pathway to a 20% returns in the consumer businesses, Mexico plays an important role in there, and when we look at the business in every sense of the word it's accretive to the company and to its shareholders. Second piece around it is as we look at the growth prospects for Mexico and where we think Mexico as an economy is headed we like what we see and Banamex plays an important role in the Mexican economy around that. Third and final piece is, is if we were to take some type of action against Banamex based on capital planning and submission processes. You actually don't know how much of that capital would actually be liberated or entitled to go back to investors. So, it's a good business, it's a growing business, we think it's a strategically important business and simply selling the furniture to liberate some capital here we don't think is the right long-term or intermediate term decision. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : A question you touched on a couple of times, your backlog and investment banking, can you give us a little more color if it is it more North America or is it Asia? And then the second how does it compare to the end of December, has the backlog picked up from there or is about the same? Mike Corbat : Yes, it's, backlog is up, we have probably got one of our best backlogs we've had in several years and you can think of the markets and just to put in context, yesterday was April 14th and realistically that was the opening of the IPO market here in the U.S. So, as you can imagine there's a fair number of things to do. So, when you think of that M&A, when you think of about the equity calendar, if we can get some kind of reasonable environment, I think could see a lot of transactions coming through the pipe there. From our own perspective I think there's a good balance around the globe, U.S., Europe, Asia in terms of the backlog. So again if we can get any kind of reasonable environment we think we're going to be quite active. Gerard Cassidy : And then in terms of what's going on in the UK with Britain thinking of leaving the EU, can you guys frame out if that happens what the risks could be to Citigroup? Mike Corbat : Yes we guess from a Citi perspective but more importantly from a Citi client perspective we think that the EU staying together as it is, is the best outcome, but we'll leave that to the UK voters to decide. From our own perspective as probably you know, we operate in most of the 28 EU countries, and so we have a lot of flexibility in terms of what we could do. We run a significant bank out of Ireland, we have trading, we've got people in a number of the countries so we would have options in terms of where we would choose to headquarter a European trading business or where we would put, but clearly around the UK we would still have significant resources there, so we've got contingency planning but we've got a lot of potential options if that's the path it goes down. Gerard Cassidy : And then just one last question on credit, I know you have given us good detail on energy. In the non-energy area there was some deterioration in credit, granted it wasn't as significant as energy. What type of industries was that deterioration in? Mike Corbat : I mentioned the fact that some of the non-accrual loan as were in metals and mining. And the rest were small bits in other industries, no particular concentration, and no particular geography that I'm aware of. So it was just sort of spread around. Gerard Cassidy : And actually it is continuing that, you had nice improvement in charge-offs in the consumer outside the United States. Do you expect that to continue especially in Asia and Latin America? Mike Corbat : Well we don't see it getting any worse, as we look at the delinquency statistics I mean it's running pretty well, you have a total NCL rate outside the U.S. of 1.6% that's probably close to 70 basis points lower than the loss rate that we have in the U.S. and that's all-in including Mexico. So I don't want to say it's going to get much better, I'm not quite sure how much better it can get but I don't see it getting worse. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Yes looking at the global consumer bank, in the last couple of years you've given us guidance on positive operating leverage and maybe not on a quarterly basis but on an annual basis we saw that you delivered that in both 2014 and '15, and this year, I guess the first quarter doesn't look good and then you've got all these moving parts with Costco coming in and other jurisdictions being shutdown. Mike Corbat : Yes. Chris Kotowski : Can you give us an idea what is kind of the underlying same stores sales operating efficiency or leverage. Is there a positive operating leverage or is it just the card business revenue give ups are too much? Mike Corbat : It's going to be tough to overcome for this year. Especially with the large amount of repositioning then that we did in the first quarter, so I think it is going to hard to generate that type of story for 2016, but we do think then that again, the business that we're growing and the business that we're investing in is one that is going to be capable of generating on a consistent basis positive operating leverage and higher returns, so that's what we're trying to do Chris. Chris Kotowski : Okay. Mike Corbat : It is where we are headed. Chris Kotowski : And then secondly kind of unrelated just if you can say on something like Venezuela where you, I guess you've written a investment there essentially down to zero, is there still an operating business there with optionality in case the situation business, and economic and political situation there ever turns around, or is it just basically more or less shutdown? Mike Corbat : No, we still have a good business serving our ICG clients that have particularly subsidiaries in that country so there's a -- if the country improves you should see a benefit coming out of that, and you're quite right. With the 180 write down that we took our remaining investment in that country is $4 million so it looks like it\u2019s headed for some really good ROE, if and when the business can come back. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions, just one on the restructuring and the cost this quarter and then the fade in of the 500 million that it's going to drive, so I just want to understand how much of the restructuring came in this quarter and then, I hear you that it will be coming through I just wanted to understand is the 500 million coming entirely through by the end of this year? John Gerspach : No we\u2019ll get about 400 of that in the last three quarters of the year. So that repositioning that we took in the first quarter largely we repay itself in the 2016 results. And that\u2019s exactly what Mike wanted us to achieve, so that\u2019s the way we really looked at that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And so then right, so we have a little bit of benefit still piece in 2017 and then this quarter\u2019s results reflected some of the benefit of the restructuring you took last year. Is that accurate? John Gerspach : That is correct. Betsy Graseck : And so with that restructuring you feel that within maybe a better market, not a normal market given how you define normal. You think you are at a good spot in the expense ratio that getting to 57%-56% is something you can achieve in 2017? John Gerspach : Yes. I don\u2019t want to get into setting 2017 targets, because again I am still trying to figure out what the market environment is going to be for the balance of this year. But we do think that again everything that we\u2019re doing now is positioned to improve that operating efficiency and getting us close to that mid-50, that we\u2019re still targeting for Citicorp [Multiple Speakers] go ahead please. Betsy Graseck : My basic question is just given more stabilized revenue environment the restructuring that you took this quarter feels like it\u2019s the last one you need to take of this magnitude. Is that reasonable or? John Gerspach : I think it\u2019s reasonable as long as market conditions stay where they are. I mean as we said if market conditions are weakened then there may be other actions that we need to take, we\u2019re not deaf to the need to do things in order to improve returns. We think that\u2019s the right way to run a business. So we\u2019ve got a model in place, we set the businesses with their goals, but if market conditions look as though those revenue environments are not going to come around then we\u2019ll need to take some additional actions hopefully as you said we\u2019re finished with large repositioning actions. Betsy Graseck : And then just a couple others if could you talk just one is on the card portfolio you have highlighted the fact that you\u2019ve got two positive growth in the card portfolio this quarter, which is great and that in-spite of the legacy card portfolio. Could you just remind us the size of the legacy card portfolio and over what kind of timeframe you expect that\u2019s going to be rolling off? John Gerspach : No, I don\u2019t want to split the portfolio like that I will tell you that the core portfolio that again where we\u2019ve been making the investments. Those obviously the performance that we\u2019re getting out of that portfolio is even better than what you see on Slide 9. So the purchase sales growth in the core portfolio where we\u2019re making the investments, the core products is 16%. The average open accounts is up 9%, the average card loans is up I think it\u2019s 4%. So you can see that again that\u2019s having -- that is really driving the growth, which is exactly what we would expect it to do and that\u2019s why we believe that by the second half of the year, we\u2019re going to get the entire card portfolio to the point where we\u2019ll have year-over-year growth. But again we\u2019re not finished then, because we would expect even more growth coming out of that core portfolio in \u201917 and \u201918. And again that\u2019s before we even talk about adding it in Costco. And Costco first year we have it Costco will not be contributing much just because of the way the accounting works, but we think that\u2019s a really good business and looking forward the contributions that will make in the second half of \u201917 and then into \u201918. Betsy Graseck : Last question is just on the reserving, that, not reserving, but the outlook for what could be a 1.4 billion if oil stayed at 30 a lot off caveats there and you mentioned that 400 million above what you had previously indicated two-thirds of which coming from regulatory guidance. Could you just give us a little bit of a color around, what you think that regulatory guidance is, why it might be different from what your views are, you have the other one-third of revisions of your views versus two-thirds from them? John Gerspach : Earlier this year, the OCC in particular came after the industry with some guidance first verbally and then in writing, largely centered as to how you should be treating some of the reserve based lending debt. And we still have some questions about how we are interpreting that guidance we think that in that 1.4 figure that I put out, we have taken the most conservative view as to how to interpret that guidance. But again we\u2019re still waiting to make sure that we have thought it, we\u2019ve interpreted that proper way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had two quick questions, one on transferring Citi Holdings back into Citicorp now. Does that mean that we can expect really no announcements for future sales of businesses and you kind of finally reached this end state where you are happy with all your businesses? John Gerspach : Well, we still have the consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia that are in Holdings. They may or may not be sold this year. If they are sold next year, we\u2019ll probably tell you about it. So I don\u2019t think that you've heard the last of some of the business sales but again Holdings is just becoming it's just a normal way of doing business right now almost everybody has got something whether it is a portfolio or whatever. Mike Corbat : And what you've talked about John as we've finished the quarter at 73, we've got commitments already in place for 10, so as John mentioned Argentina, Brazil, Colombia you've got an operating business to one main version for Citi Finance Canada got away from those it is largely an asset portfolio. And so you'll be able to see assets and crop other -- move up or down, and we can provide color inside around those, but we\u2019re going to keep the focus to get the transactions closed and out the door, but again I just don\u2019t think it is all that meaningful to the financials of the Company anymore. Brian Kleinhanzl : Right, I guess I'm referring to new announcements from here on out there shouldn't be doing announcements about country exits in that. Mike Corbat : Obviously we will put out press released as we sign and as we close the transaction. John Gerspach : What he is asking Mike is that are we going to have anymore sales and that's going to be dependent upon how we continue to assess the environment, if the environment says we need to scale back in some places we will be active in response to that. Brian Kleinhanzl : And there is one question on Costco I mean can you close to the close now can you provide any update on portfolio size anything besides the accretion numbers you just gave? John Gerspach : No I mean the portfolio will close on or about June 20 as it should be June 20th where the portfolio closes and everything moves over. As we get closer to that date, we may give you some more, but for now we're just focused on the June date. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Just a follow-up on the Costco deal about neutral earnings this year as we think next year and beyond obviously there was some upfront marketing investments and system investments, but any thoughts on how profitable it could be longer term? John Gerspach : Well we haven't commented on the profitability of the individual portfolio and we won't do that, we will say it and we have said that the return characteristics of that portfolio it is perfectly into the cards business that we are trying to grow. So I have said on a number of occasions that our U.S. branded cards business should be one that when we are finished with the investments and adding in Costco and everything else, we think that it is a business that should earn an ROA somewhere in the 225 to 235 range. And Costco will be an important part of that it is -- the key to our U.S. cards business is to have a balanced portfolio, balance between our core proprietary products as well as the card portfolios where we have got our partner cards. So we think that's the right way to grow that business and that's the way we're moving forward and overall that business again 224 thereabouts ROA in the future. Matt O'Connor: And then circling back on expenses, the improvement in the efficiency ratio rest of the year and it sounds like it mostly revenue dependent, I guess the question is if revenues are weaker how quickly can you adjust to that environment, I am just trying to get some sense of how variable is the cost structure. We didn't see much variable at the point or but it is also this one quarter but as you think over the next several quarters if revenue comes a little lighter, do have flexibility to bring those costs lower than flat? John Gerspach : What I actually tried to guide you to, is the fact that we think the core expenses will be actually coming down especially in the second part of the year. We don't anticipate having anywhere near the level of legal and repositioning charges that we had in the first quarter either. So we think that expense reduction in the balance of the year is an important element of getting to that 57% efficiency ratio. Matt O'Connor: Okay so you are -- right, how much of it if -- how much variable in this just coming back to the variable in this question, I mean how much flexibility is there to further bring down and I guess I was a little surprised the first quarter we didn\u2019t see much variability in the expense given how weak revenue was, obviously you took the repositioning it's just one quarter, but if the revenue is less than what you laid out today, how much kind of real time flexibility is there to bring down cost? John Gerspach : That is -- we would rest that as we see with the revenue, I am not going to give you a figure that X percent of the expense base is variable because on a longer term basis every things variable, on a shorter term basis it's not going to be as variable as you would like it to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Just one other question for you Mike, I appreciate the color that you gave during the prepared remarks on CCAR and just a follow-up to that, are you confident enough or how confident are you in terms of checking off the regulator\u2019s qualitative to do list in terms of moving closer to our peers over the next few years in terms of payout especially in light of the kind of regulatory capital growth that Citi has enjoyed over the past couple of years? Mike Corbat : Yes, that's clearly exactly Erika what we're committed to we fully understand that capital generation and capital return is a big part of the investment thesis and story and if you go back and look over the past couple of years, capital generation hasn't been our issue, and over the last three years we've generated over $50 billion of regulatory capital in the last quarter we generated $6 billion of regulatory capital and so ours is the normalization around the process and the credibility to make sure that we can get that capital back to our investors and that's exactly, exactly what we're working at and that's why so much time and energy has been put it on the qualitative side of things to be able to get to that point as quickly as possible. Erika Najarian : And just, my follow-up is, John did I look at the headlines right, during your call with the media that the same group that was in-charge of resolution planning is also in-charge of CCAR? John Gerspach : I'm sorry, Erica. Erika Najarian : Sorry, I saw a headlines on Bloomberg when you were -- held your call with the media this morning that I think it is so that you mentioned the same group that was in-charge of resolution planning is also in-charge of CCAR? John Gerspach : Yes you can't believe everything that you read online or in headlines, what I said was in my prepared remarks that during the Q&A that I had with the media, that the question came up as far as resolution planning and I said look we put a lot of hard work into developing the resolution plan and that we really carefully incorporated all the feedback that we received in late 2014 on the earlier submissions and we've embedded resolution planning into our day-to-day management of Citi. And I said that is very similar to what we've done with CCAR, so rather than think of CCAR and resolution planning as separate initiatives performed by isolated teams of people you consider both as integrated parts of our capital planning process and I said just as we have a continuous budgeting and forecasting process that is owned by our business managers, well the business managers also own the CCAR process and the resolution planning process. So, that's what I had said. Erika Najarian : I see, thanks for the clarification John, I appreciate it. John Gerspach : That's okay it's not that we suddenly have got a new management -- that's the wrong way to run CCAR and resolution. To have somebody separate -- I mean Barbara guides CCAR I guide resolution but it's the business managers that ultimately own it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : John maybe just one more quick one on energy, I presume you're at least part of the way through the spring lease termination, I'm curious what your expectations are in terms of the potential reduction of the borrowing bases across your borrowers, when that process is complete? John Gerspach : Yes, we think that our reserve base lending exposure could be reduced by about $500 million, that would be combined the ICG as well as the consumer book, and it's probably 300-200, 350-150 with the ICG being slightly bigger piece of that. Matt Burnell : Okay that seems a smaller percentage than what we've heard from a couple of other lenders, just to [Multiple Speakers] if I can follow-up just on a separate topic, the 202, no I guess 225 basis points of revenue that you're suggesting we should think about in terms of repositioning in legal costs, how far does that guidance go out, I mean it sounds like with legal amounts sort of ramping down, certainly never going to go away, but ramping down and the repositioning costs presumably are going down overtime, should we think about that ratio in '17 and '18 and on out, are you going to be continuing to reposition in depth in places like wealth management? John Gerspach : Well I would say that again, we do think that 200 basis points and certainly 225 basis points is a very high charge on the revenues for legal and repositioning and it's relevant in the near-term 2016, we'll assess 2017 when we get there, but that would not be my view as to where we would expect legal and repositioning to be certainly beyond 2017. So, we should be looking at something which is a lot smaller but I'll give you more guidance as we get closer to the end of 2016. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally from me, maybe ticky tacky a little question, there was a substantial jump in the -- other than temporary impairment losses on the income statement this quarter to 465 million, is there anything you would like to call out there? John Gerspach : Yes, Venezuela is in there, the Venezuela charge of $180 million, so that's a big piece of that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : I had a quick question on capital, John in the past I know you have highlighted operational risk declines as a meaningful source of future capital release and at the same time you've often talked about CCAR as being your binding constrain on capital, and it's something that a lot of clients have mentioned as well as a potential source of release, and what I'm wondering is because of the stress test exam only evaluates capital ratios under the standardized approach which excludes op risk from the denominator, I'm wondering whether that renders any potential benefit tied to op risk release, move going forward. I just want to get a sense as to whether we should still be crediting that as a future source of release given that is as not contemplated explicitly within the capital ratios within CCAR? John Gerspach : Actually Steven I don't know whether I misspoke or you misheard, but it's probably my fault. But I don't think -- I certainly didn't intend to indicate that op risk would be a source of capital release as a matter of fact if anything I think that the op risk portion of the advanced approach RWA is very sticky right now. There just isn't a clear cut agreement either amongst us or even of the regulatory bodies really as to how you reduce op risk, so that's one of the reasons why when you've given you the Holdings\u2019 RWA in the past and this quarter for instance the Holdings' RWA is like $130 billion and of that $130 billion, $49 billion is op risk. That's the same 49 billion that was there in the fourth quarter, that's the same 49 billion that was there in the third quarter, so we really, we tend to think overall if you take a look at the Ks and the Qs I believe that our op risk RWA is like $325 billion and I consider that to be fairly sticky for now. Because I just don't have a good methodology in place to figure out how we drive that down. It's one of the very -- it frustrates me, I think it frustrates probably every CFO and Chief Risk Officer that you would talk to at a major bank right now, but that's kind of where we are. Steven Chubak : Sorry, well thank you for clarifying that John and it certainly frustrates our investors and analysts as well. Just one question on the profitability targets, I know we spent quite a bit of time on it this morning but taking the challenging revenue by what we saw in 1Q the 100 basis point increase in the efficiency target and then the breakeven guidance for Holdings for the remainder of the year. Are you still committed to deliver on the 90 basis point ROA target that you had laid out, and I think reaffirm maybe as little as just one month ago? John Gerspach : I would say that given all of that math the 90 basis points, again given where we ended up in the first quarter, it's going to tough for us to come in at 90 basis points. Steven Chubak : And just one more quick piggyback question from me, was wondering what the stores at RWA, RWA growth was in the quarter. I did see that the balance sheet grew as well, but didn't know if you could clarify that? John Gerspach : It's a little bit of the balance sheet growth and that's also being fuelled also by foreign exchange movements, we did, don't forget these are one day as opposed to being averages and so if you actually take a look at what happened at the end of March compared to where we were at the absolute end of December. In certain currencies the dollar actually weakened particularly against the euro, so that added $4 billion or $5 billion worth of RWA to us. We had some model changes that was like another 8 billion or 9 billion, we had I think $15 billion worth of just volume as the balance sheet grew and then there was a $5 billion increase in market risk which we're still looking at, that's why these are estimated numbers at this point in time don't forget. We'll lockdown the RWA calculations as we file the Q in a couple of weeks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Just a question on total cost of credit, we talked a little earlier about losses, we talked a little about the energy outlook for the rest of the year but John relative to kind of a 2 billion on cost of credit for the HoldCo, how should we just understand how that goes especially with not really knowing what Costco will add to that? John Gerspach : Well any number that I gave you is ex-Costco, and I didn't give you a view towards what consumer would be, but don\u2019t forget Costco overall as I think I mentioned earlier you got to think in terms of Costco's revenue expense cost of credit being basically breakeven for the balance of this year and that's just due to the fact that the way the accounting works you're forced to build loan loss reserves, basically over the first year that you have the portfolio. So think about Costco as it'll impact all the ratios but from a net income point of view right now it's basically breakeven, so that's not in there, but the $1.4 billion that I gave you as for as the forward look on ICG, that was all-in that was not just energy that\u2019s all-in ICG. Ken Usdin : Okay. So that\u2019s all-in including reserve builds, that\u2019s all-in. Okay. John Gerspach : That is all in. Ken Usdin : And then do you think, I guess the last piece is if do you think, you\u2019ll continue to have any releases underneath in card or is it more just how the losses traject from here? John Gerspach : As we continue to build the card portfolio, you are likely to see small reserve increases, that\u2019d be volume driven as opposed to being driven by a weakening in credit performance. So as you build portfolios, you do have to put aside reserve dollars. But again, we continue to believe that the credit performance in consumer whether it\u2019s on the U.S. book or international should continue to be very favorable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : A question on the treasury and trade solutions outlook, obviously one area that\u2019s been sort of weak globally has been trade finance, particularly trade finance related to various commodities, which is a big portion of that, of the global total. So how do we think about that pressure relative to the pretty positive guidance and recent trend that you\u2019ve indicated? John Gerspach : Well, all of the trade performance is in that number that you see reported on whatever the slide number is 14 or 15 that is in the desk. So that\u2019s pretty much, how we\u2019re operating today. One of the things that we\u2019ve done overtime is we\u2019ve moved a lot more of our trade business, is being less balance sheet intensive. So it\u2019s we do a higher percentage of our business now on originate to sell and what that has given us is the balance sheet then to expand into the supplier finance aspects of trade. That has got better spreads and it really deepens the relationship then that we have with our client customers, so in recognizing everything you said, trade is not what I would call a tremendous growth business at this point in time. But it\u2019s got the relationship qualities to it and it\u2019s really adding to the overall franchise in a very positive way. Eric Wasserstrom : So it sounds as if the volume pressures have been offset by basically moving down the ecosystem in terms of client opportunity, is that more or less correct? John Gerspach : I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s moving down the ecosystem. I\u2019d say that we\u2019re expanding the business that we can do with our target market clients by helping them in working capital management. And what we\u2019ve done is we\u2019ve gotten out a lot of the FI kind of sponsored business which is episodic it is very low spreads. We\u2019ll still originate those things, but then we tend to syndicate and so the trade finance receivable. So what we really want to do as we want to use trade as we do in almost every one of our product areas. We want to use our trade capabilities to help our clients manage their business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : A couple of questions, firstly John, you\u2019ve given the guidance last quarter, on net interest margin at 285 to 290 for the first half. You came in a little bit above that which was really flat linked quarter and are you still expecting to go to 285 to 290 for the first half and if so what would drive that down? John Gerspach : No actually, what we\u2019ve revised our guidance to, as we think the 292 kind of holds flat in the second quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay. John Gerspach : Again as we continue to offset the impact of Holdings\u2019 run off by a better spreads on our long business is largely due to the interest rate lift that we got, in coming out of December and by the tail-end of the year as we get the Costco of business on our books, that should be another boon to our NIM and we\u2019re expecting somewhere in the order of a 3 basis point improvement from Costco. So we should end the year the second half of the year with a NIM in the range of 295. Vivek Juneja : And Mike, a question for you, the equity of business, you\u2019ve had trading loss issues several times over the last couple of years. What are your plans to fix that? Mike Corbat : Yes so as you look at this quarter, this quarter wasn\u2019t a quarter where the revenue performance was a result of trading issues. This was really from our perspective, and I think you saw across the industry but certainly for us the client volume, client flow challenges and John and I talked historically about the run rate, we\u2019d like to see the business at in the opportunity and again going back, there is no reason why as a firm we should be in the 8-9 area, we should be in the 5-6 area and we think there is an incremental couple of hundred million dollars a quarter overtime that we can add with just some reasonable investments and the investments come in a couple of ways, it comes in terms of and it comes in terms of balance sheet and given where our capital ratios are given where our leverage ratios are, client finance is an example, we think we've got that opportunities to go in and take share, and that's what we're trying to execute on. Vivek Juneja : Okay. The only think I'd say is that the peers who are reporting so far your equity trading revenues year-on-year where weaker than those? Mike Corbat : Yes they were. Operator : Thank you. We have no further question in the queue at this time. Susan Kendall : Great, thank you everyone. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations and thanks for your time this morning. Operator : Thank you.

Gerard Cassidy - RBC Capital Markets Presentation : Operator : Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; and Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brent. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4 billion for the second quarter of 2016, or $1.24 per share. These results are a significant improvement from the first quarter not just in the overall amount of earnings, but in the proportion generated from our core business in Citicorp relative to the assets were winding down in Citi Holdings. The results also show our institution\u2019s ability to generate solid earnings in a challenging and volatile environment. We grew both our consumer and institutional loan books, reduced our expenses, further reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets, and utilized additional deferred tax assets. We meaningfully improved our efficiency ratio, our return on assets, and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We generated and returned capital to our shareholders and the plan which was just approved significant increases to the amount of capital we\u2019ll return over the next year. In our institutional franchise, both our markets and investment banking businesses are rebounding client activity from the last quarter. And our treasury and trade solutions business continued to grow revenues as we won new mandates in support of our clients\u2019 needs around the world. These results really show the benefits of our global network and the competitive advantages it provides. In global consumer banking, we had positive operating leverage in our international franchise, highlighted by solid year-over-year growth in Mexico and continued sequential improvement in Asia. And as you know, we\u2019ve been investing in our U.S. branded cards business. On June 17, we acquired the Costco portfolio, gaining over 11 million cardholders in the process. And earlier this week, we announced the renewal of our partnership with American Airlines, and in retail services, we\u2019re renewing our partnership with the Home Depot. We\u2019re excited about the growth prospects of these businesses. In Citi Holdings, we drove another significant reduction of assets, which were down 10% from the first quarter and 47% from one year ago. For the eighth quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable and the $93 million in net income was just 2% of Citigroup\u2019s total earnings for the quarter. We passed a significant milestone in the utilization of our deferred tax assets, and in the second quarter, we utilized $900 million in DTA, bringing the total to $10 billion since the DTA reached its peak in 2012. While our remaining DTA does hamper, our return on tangible common equity utilization helps fuel our generation of regulatory capital. And as you know, returning that capital to our shareholders has been a critical priority of ours. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by approximately $30 million, bringing the total to 105 million shares over the last four quarters. Even so, our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.5%. In addition, our tangible book value per share increased to $63.53 in the quarter. We\u2019ve been clear about our desire to increase the capital return over time and earlier this month, we were pleased to learn that Federal Reserve did not object to the capital plan we submitted. And as a result, we\u2019ll return $10.4 billion in capital to our shareholders over the next four quarters. The plan includes more than tripling our dividend to $0.16 per share and repurchasing $8.6 billion in common stock. This result combined with the feedback we received from the Fed and the FDIC on our resolution plan shows the progress we continue to make to becoming a safer and stronger institution. Looking forward, the environment remains challenging. We\u2019re continuing to navigate the consequences of the UK referendum on the EU from its economic impact to how exactly it will structure our legal vehicles to continue to best serve our clients. And while the UK has a new leader, the U.S. is still in the midst of a unique presidential campaign and such geopolitical and economic uncertainty doesn\u2019t create a clear picture for potential interest rate increases. I think we\u2019ve navigated the most recent volatility very well as a result of our strategic client segmentation and strong risk management. Our credit quality remains very high and our institution is showing its resilience and strength of our model. While there has been a high degree of uncertainty in the wake of the referendum, the capital markets are open, strategic transactions are getting done, and we feel good about the client activity we\u2019re seeing. And while we don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming \u2013 what will come in the months as we look forward, we\u2019re always going to be looking at and continuing to optimize our resources. And I believe, we\u2019re very well-positioned from the capital, liquidity, and capacity perspective. John will now go through the presentation and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.5 billion declined 8% from last year, but expenses decreased 5%, each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. And credit costs improved, reflecting lower net credit losses, partially offset by a smaller net reserve release compared to the prior year. We earned $4 billion in the second quarter, or $1.24 per share, each down 14% versus the prior period. Our preferred dividends were higher this quarter. However, we were able to offset this impact through share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $634 billion, as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 5% to $938 billion. On Slide 4, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp is the predominant driver of profitability in the second quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Citicorp revenues of $16.7 billion were down 3% from last year on a reported basis. In constant dollars, Citicorp revenues were flat to the prior year, as growth in our institutional franchise was offset by lower consumer revenues and the absence of prior period real estate gains in Corp other. Citicorp expenses decreased 1%, reflecting efficiency savings and a benefit from FX translation, partially offset by continued investments in the franchise. And cost of credit grew 13% from the second quarter of last year, driven by a smaller reserve release versus the prior year. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise and net credit losses declined 5% year-over-year. Pre-tax earnings of $5.7 billion in Citicorp were down from last year, but improved over 25% sequentially on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and the lower cost in credit. Turning to Citi Holdings, both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year, as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings\u2019 assets by $7 billion this quarter, ending the period with $66 billion of assets, or just 4% of total Citigroup, with signed agreements in place to sell $7 billion of this amount. Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results from North America consumer banking. Total revenues declined 3% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew sequentially, but were down 4% from last year, as continued growth in consumer and commercial banking was more than offset by lower mortgage activity. Average retail banking loans and checking deposits grew 10% and 9% respectively from last year. In branded cards, revenues of $1.9 billion were down 1% from last year, as a modest benefit from the Costco portfolio, which we acquired on June 17, was offset by the continued impact of higher rewards costs in our existing portfolio, as well as higher payment rates. I\u2019ll talk more about branded cards in a moment, but we continue to see good momentum from the investments we\u2019re making in our core products. In addition, the early results from Costco have been very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at over 337,000 to-date. Purchase sales for the first 3.5 weeks totaled $5.7 billion, with roughly two-thirds being out of store, and the loan portfolio, which we acquired at $10.6 billion in size had already grown to a $11.3 billion by the end of the second quarter. Costco is a great partner and we\u2019re excited about the potential for this business. We\u2019re also very pleased with the renewal of our American Airlines partnership, which was announced earlier this week. We will continue to be the exclusive issuer of credit cards in the majority of acquisition channels, including digital and mobile channels, direct-mail, e-mail, phone and Admiral\u2019s Club lounges. At the same time, we were able to maintain a high-quality growing portfolio and attractive returns. The impact of the renewal should lower pre-tax earnings by approximately $50 million per quarter through the end of next year, primarily due to higher expenses, including the amortization of intangibles. This impact on pre-tax earnings is expected to increase somewhat in 2018 and beyond, as certain additional revenue sharing arrangements become effective. Finally, turning to retail services, revenues of $1.5 billion decreased 4% from last year, reflecting the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter, as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships, principally Home Depot. We now have all of our significant partnerships in retail services secured through 2020 or beyond. We expect revenues to remain around this $1.5 billion level per quarter through the end of next year, as expected volume growth is likely to be offset by the impact of absorbing the more competitive terms in our partnership renewals. We currently expect to operate the retail services business at an ROA in the range of 250 basis points. And we remain open to inorganic growth through new programs and acquisition opportunities, given the right strategic fit and return profile. Total expenses of $2.4 billion in North America increased 5%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, as well as continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally, credit cards in North America increased 13% from last year, mostly reflecting a reserve building branded cards, driven by volume growth and the impact of Costco compared to a reserve release in the prior period. On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues were flat and expenses declined 1% from last year. In Latin America, consumer revenues were up 4%, as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 7% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 10%, respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined 3% from last year. However, we are seeing continued signs of recovery in that business with purchase sales of 7% versus last year. And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America, mostly on lower legal and repositioning costs, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. Excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in the third quarter of last year, we expect this positive operating leverage to continue in the second-half of 2016. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues declined 4% year-over-year, driven by lower wealth management and retail lending revenues, while cards revenues were flat to the prior year, which I\u2019ll discuss more in a moment. Expenses grew 2% in Asia, in part due to higher repositioning costs. On Slide 7, we show Asia consumer in more detail. While wealth management revenues were down year-over-year, we did see sequential growth in both revenues and AUM inflows during the quarter, with a declining year-over-year trend in AUMs, driven by the impact of lower equity market values. We also saw improvements in card revenues, which were flat to last year, and we continue to believe, we are on track to deliver year-over-year growth in the second-half of 2016. Retail banking revenues, excluding wealth management were also up sequentially, but declined 2% year-over-year, mostly reflecting the repositioning of our retail loan portfolio away from lower return mortgage loans, as well as some derisking in our commercial portfolio. These actions were partially offset by 3% growth in personal loans as you can see on the lower right. The net impact was a decline in lending revenues year-over-year in the second quarter. However, we expect these revenues to stabilize in the second-half of the year with continued growth in higher return personal loans, and therefore, an improvement in the overall yield of the portfolio. In total, we expect Asia consumer revenues to return to growth in the second-half of 2016, resulting in positive operating leverage year-over-year. On Slide 8, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans, and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a positive improvement from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show solid progress in our existing franchise, with organic growth in purchase sales and average loans of 10% and 3%, respectively, and improving year-over-year revenue trend, which we expect to turn positive in the fourth quarter of 2016. Turning to Asia, as I discussed earlier, card revenues were flat to the prior year, as we continued to move past many of the regulatory headwinds in that region. Growth in purchase sales slowed this quarter in Asia, in part due to actions we took to lower the value of rewards on certain products in Australia. In response to regulation that capped interchange rates in that market. We moved ahead of the market in changing our rewards program, and this had a dampening effect on purchase sales this quarter. However, we expect these trends to recover, as peers follow suit and consumers adjust to the new programs. We also reduced promotional rate balances during the quarter, which had a positive effect on yields. But combined with the slower purchase sales growth, this resulted in more modest loan growth year-over-year. We have continued to manage well through the economic environment in Asia, which have seen slower overall market activity relative to last year. And finally, in Latin America, the trends are improving as well, with a sustained recovery in purchase sales beginning to drive loans and revenues. With continued momentum in the back half of the year, we would expect to see loan growth turn positive again year-over-year with revenue growth to follow thereafter. Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter with stable to improving NCL and delinquency rates in every region. The NCL rates in Latin America showed particular improvement this quarter, reflecting seasonal payment trend. We expect the NCL rate in Latin America to return to around 4.5% for the second-half of the year. On Slide 10, we show the year over year EBT walk for consumer on a year-to-date basis. We continue to face headwinds from market sensitive businesses like wealth management and mortgage on a first-half basis. As you can see, the continued impact of our cards initiatives on revenues as well, which should abate as we go into the second-half of the year. But the year-over-year impact from regulatory headwinds has slowed from the first quarter, and the impact of business growth has become more pronounced, driven by the momentum we\u2019re seeing in our retail and commercial businesses in North America and Latin America. Our expense growth in the first-half was predominantly driven by investments across our franchise, as well as higher repositioning charges in the first quarter, and credit headwinds reflect the absence of prior period reserve releases. Underlying credit quality has remained stable with the net loss rate declining year-over-year. Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11, revenues of $8.8 billion in the second quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by fixed income and treasury and trade solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 9% from last year in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. We continue to capture market share and saw strong momentum across payment products, such as U.S. dollar clearing, as well as commercial cards, where purchase sales grew 9% year-over-year. Our focus remains on delivering integrated working capital solutions to our multinational clients, addressing their full spectrum of supply chain, trade services, liquidity management, procurement and payment needs around the world. We\u2019re seeing the demand for our services increase, as corporations seek to optimize their resources in a slow growth environment, at the same time, some of our peers are pulling back from global strategies. Investment banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 6% from last year, mostly on lower industry-wide equity underwriting activity, but showed a significant improvement from the prior quarter, reflecting a rebound in both market conditions, as well as our wallet share in all major products. Private bank revenues of $738 million were down 1% year-over-year on lower managed investments and capital markets activity. And corporate lending revenues of $389 million were down 18%, as higher loan volumes were more than offset \u2013 more than offset by an adjustment to the residual value of a lease financing as well as higher hedging costs. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.7 billion grew 10% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 14% from last year. Rates in currencies drove these results, with revenues up 25% year-over-year, including particularly strong performance in the days following the UK referendum. We saw continued growth in activity throughout the quarter with our corporate client base, which comprises over 40% of our direct client revenues in rates and currencies. We believe a greater portion of our rates and currencies revenues are generated with corporate clients relative to that of our peers, which is directly tied to the strength of both our global network and our treasury and trade solutions business. We view this as a differentiating advantage and one that provides scale and stability to our fixed income platform. Spread product revenues declined this quarter versus last year. However, on a sequential basis, we did see a recovery particularly in securitized products. Turning to equities, excluding the valuation adjustments in the prior year of approximately $175 million, our revenues were down 4% year-over-year, driven by lower market activity, as well as the comparison to strong trading performance in Asia in the prior year. And sequentially, revenues grew 12%, reflecting improved performance in derivatives. Finally, in security services, revenues declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars, mostly driven by the absence of revenues from divestitures. Excluding this impact, underlying revenues were up 2%. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion were down 2% year-over-year, driven by repositioning savings and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Total credit costs of $82 million were higher than last year, but down significantly from the prior quarter. Total net credit losses were $141 million, with roughly two-thirds offset by related reserve releases. We also built roughly $30 million of reserves related to non-accrual loans, which increased by approximately $135 million during the quarter. The cost of credit related to energy was minimal, as net credit losses were mostly offset by previously existing reserves and the portfolio benefited from the stabilization in oil prices, as well as increased capital markets activity. Given our target client focus on high-quality corporate credits, certain energy clients were able to access the capital markets as the market environment became more favorable in the second quarter. This allowed these clients to improve liquidity, resulting in either paydowns or improvements in the credit quality of our exposures. And our reserve-based energy exposures declined this quarter by roughly $400 million in ICG, reflecting the impact of the spring redeterminations. We provide more details on our energy portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Outside of energy, the cost of credit was concentrated in a few specific credits. Looking forward, we remain cautious and the environment is uncertain, but we could see total ICG cost of credit in the back-half of the year in the range of $300 million to $500 million. On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows significant improvement from the first quarter. We continue to see first-half growth, although modest in our accrual and transaction services businesses, despite certain headwinds this quarter, led by our continued momentum in treasury and trade solutions. And with the strong second quarter performance in markets, we are now flat to last year in fixed income and equities, but remain down year-over-year in investment banking, given lower overall market activity. We remain disciplined in our core expense management, as we work to realize the benefits of the repositioning actions taken earlier this year to address the structure and capacity in certain parts of our franchise. These higher repositioning costs alone drove approximately $240 million of EBT decline year-over-year in the first-half. The remaining EBT drivers were the write-down of our investments in Venezuela, mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements, and of course, the higher credit costs in energy in the first quarter. Slide 13 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues decreased year-over-year, mostly reflecting the absence of real estate gains in the prior year, as well as the lower debt buyback activity, and expenses increased driven by higher corporate-wide marketing expenses and an increase in legal and related costs. On Slide 14, we show Citigroup\u2019s net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp, while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our initial outlook of around 292 basis points, driven by an equal combination of higher cash balances, lower trading NIM, and lower low yields. Looking to the second-half of the year, NIM should recover to around 290 basis points or slightly higher, driven by a 3 basis point improvement from Costco, as well as the normalization of average cash balances. This is lower than our prior outlook of around 295 basis points for the remainder of the year, reflecting somewhat lower loan yields, as well as the absence of a previously assumed rate increase in the U.S. On Slide 15, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.5%. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 7.5%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $63.53. Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the third quarter. In consumer banking, revenues in North America should grow sequentially, driven by branded cards, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition, which should generate incremental revenues of roughly $200 million over the second quarter. International consumer revenues should grow modestly from the second quarter, resulting in year-over-year improvement in both Asia and Mexico, excluding the gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business last year. Turning to the institutional business, we expect market revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the second quarter, while investment banking revenues should be largely stable, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our treasury and trade solutions business, as we continue to win new mandates and support our clients day-to-day banking needs around the world. Finally, to complete the revenue picture in Citicorp, Corp other revenues are expected to be close to zero, down from recent levels in the $100 million to $200 million, driven by a lower debt buyback activity and the absence of certain other episodic gains. Core expenses in Citicorp should be slightly down from the second quarter, reflecting the impact of repositioning savings, partially offset by higher expenses related to Costco and other branded cards investments. And credit costs in Citicorp should be somewhat higher than the second quarter, mostly driven by reserve builds for volume growth and the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. Citi Holdings should be at break-even for the quarter. And with that Mike and I are happy to answer any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. James Mitchell : Hey, good afternoon guys. John Gerspach : Hey, Jim. James Mitchell : Just a question on the energy credit, you \u2013 I think you said in June around $1.2 billion of, I think, energy-related credit costs. I think if I my math is right, you did about $500 million year-to-date, and now you\u2019re seeing $300 million to $500 million in the second-half, is that right? So, 8 \u2013 is that kind of way to think about $800 million to $1 billion right now? John Gerspach : Well, the $1.2 billion, Jim, that was our reference to total Citi \u2013 total ICG cost of credit, that was not specific to energy\u2026 James Mitchell : Okay, fair. John Gerspach : ...at that point in time. James Mitchell : So is \u2013 it does seem like it\u2019s a little bit of a step-down versus expectations even\u2026 John Gerspach : Well, certainly \u2013 it certainly, when you take a look at the first-half, which you know is about $500 million cost of credit in ICG. And with the second-half range of $300 million to $500 million, that gives you your comparison of $800 million to $1 billion against the previous $1.2 billion. So, yes, it is a step-down. James Mitchell : And is that just simply the improvement in the capital markets in what you\u2019re seeing in terms of experience with the energy space and then getting capital, is that the big change, or is it oil prices or just the combination of both? John Gerspach : Well, it\u2019s a combination of both. And certainly, we\u2019re benefiting \u2013 that outlook benefits from what we\u2019re seeing as a stabilization of energy cost with oil in that $45 barrel range. So I think, it also reflects the overall resiliency in our credit portfolio, which is what we\u2019ve been talking about. Now, we described to you the quality of our energy exposure in the past. First quarter, even in the first quarter, we said 73% of our energy exposure was to investment-grade names that has continued to remain at 73% in the second quarter. James Mitchell : Right. John Gerspach : The funded loan book at the first quarter was 63% investment grade, that\u2019s actually improved now to 65%. And because we\u2019re concentrated in those high-quality names, they do have access to capital markets and therefore are able to strengthen their balance sheets. James Mitchell : Right. An E&P balances were down too. So, okay\u2026 John Gerspach : Yes, I mean, when you take a look at what we\u2019ve been able to do, we traded off. We reduced the high risk portfolio and remained more concentrated in the high-quality portfolio. James Mitchell : Right. Maybe just one follow-up on Costco, it seems like it\u2019s off to a pretty good start. You\u2019re obviously going to be building reserves there. Do you expect it to be added to the earnings, neutral to earnings, as we think about the combination of expenses, revenues, and provision build? John Gerspach : Jim, our view going into the acquisition is that, in this first year in 2016, it would likely be neutral to earnings just because of the mechanics behind the reserve build. And so that\u2019s our view right now. We\u2019ll give you more updates as to how it could impact 2017, certainly as we get later in the year. But for now, I\u2019d say 2016 on EBT point of view is basically neutral. James Mitchell : Right. So still sticking to neutral. Okay, thanks a lot. John Gerspach : Okay, Jim. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. John Gerspach : Hey, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. John Gerspach : Hey, Glenn, can you speak up a little bit. We really can\u2019t hear you. Glenn Schorr : Really? I\u2019m screaming into it, sorry. John Gerspach : Sorry. Glenn Schorr : No problem, no problem. In cards, when I take a step back and I look at all the either renewal up rates or the acquisition costs, like cards is a super tough business right now, or I should say super competitive business right now. So I heard your comments about the 250 basis point ROA on the retail partner. Could you maybe talk about where the cards overall ROA and RoTCE is now and where it should be going forward, it kind of follows on, on Jim\u2019s question. I just like \u2013 just want to make sure we\u2019re growing profitability here and not just volume, important business for you guys? John Gerspach : Well, again, as we\u2019ve said, longer-term we \u2013 our view is from a branded cards portfolio, we want to be running that portfolio at about 225 to 235 basis points, which really is consistent with where we were entering into the crisis. So, what you\u2019ve seen through the crisis is a \u2013 an impact on ROA first with a severe downturn in ROA, as everybody built reserves and worked their way through the credit issues and then coming out now we\u2019ve all benefited from reserve releases. So today, where we were getting ROA in branded cards something close to 300 basis points, but a lot of that has been fueled by reserve releases. The business that we\u2019re building in branded cards is one that is set to yield in ROA of 225 to 235 basis points, where we were going into the crisis and with a better more higher quality book of business. And it\u2019s the same story with retail services that 250 basis points is what we think is a realistic long-term return with that business. Glenn Schorr : Got it, I appreciate that. You mentioned the renewal on American, most of the channels, I saw that Barclays had gotten, I think, it was the airports and on the plane, which I\u2019m not sure what that means. But what percentage of the originations in the past came from those channels, like do I care? John Gerspach : Well, I mean, it certainly is a smaller amount of the originations than what we believe that we are going to be able to achieve through the channels that we retain. The on-airline and in-airport the \u2013 I\u2019d call it the travel day type of acquisitions, that was not a particular strength of ours anyway. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I appreciate that. One last one on, which one to choose? Okay, I saw the commentary on the more preferreds coming. With capital and leverage ratios so strong, like really strong and a payout ratio still at 70%, I\u2019m just curious where the incremental preferreds \u2013 what\u2019s their purpose, where they are going and why do you need them? John Gerspach : Glenn, maybe I misspoke or \u2013 but we\u2019re not signaling that we are issuing more preferreds. We\u2019ve done our preferred issuance for now, given the capital stack that we have right now, our preferreds are where they are. But that did since we now are settled for a couple of quarters you\u2019re going to see the preferred dividend than increase over where they were prior year. Glenn Schorr : Oh, no problem, I got it. John Gerspach : Okay. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate it. John Gerspach : So if you take a look at Slide 32, that just sort of, we just want to level set your expectations as to where preferred dividends will be reflected. But all these preferred dividends reflect issuances already done. Glenn Schorr : Totally appreciate it. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks. John Gerspach : Okay, Glenn. Thank you. Glenn Schorr : Bye, John. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. As Mike noted, the earnings came in nicely better than the first quarter. Just wondering, John, what are some of the items that got better since the early June guidance that earnings looked kind of flattish with the first quarter? John Gerspach : I\u2019d say several things improved, John. Clearly, the markets \u2013 markets revenues were improved. What we found is during the month of June, we were able to engage with our corporate clients. They were seeking advice as to how to handle a volatility, both leading up to the UK referendum and then certainly subsequent to the UK referendum and that that gave us a great opportunity. But at the same point in time, because the capital markets remained open during the month of June, we did benefit from a lot of our energy clients then being able to access the client, so that produced a much lower cost of credit than I think Mike had probably indicated when he spoke at the conference at the early part of June. And finally, we saw improved momentum in Mexico in the retail bank during the month of June. We noted that overall consumer revenues in Mexico grew 4% year-over-year that was higher than what we had thought that was going to be when Mike spoke. So we had momentum building in Mexico. We had good engagement with clients throughout the whole UK referendum. And then we benefited from the lower cost of credit again because of the high-quality of our book. John McDonald : Okay. And you mentioned the corporate credit getting better and you gave an outlook for the cost of credit for ICG looking ahead. How should we think, John, about the provision trend in cards and overall consumer going forward from here? John Gerspach : Well, again, that\u2019s going to intend to increase for two reasons. One is, as we build additional ANR and we\u2019re definitely in a growth mode when it comes to our card \u2013 our branded cards book. We\u2019re going to meet to build reserves just because of the volume. And then with Costco, again, when you get into purchase accounting, you\u2019ve got a heavy front-end build on LLR. John McDonald : Okay. And then just one final thing on Costco, as you mentioned, that\u2019s starting to grow and you\u2019re getting the accounts. There have been some press stories and anecdotal reports of difficulties in the initial roll out. Were there some operational snafus that occurred? Have they been fixed and is everything running right now? Could you just give us an update on that? Michael Corbat : John, it\u2019s Mike. I would say that we experienced extremely high calling volumes in the early implementation of it. We\u2019ve put a lot of resources at it, questions around card activation, questions around statements, questions around where to send payments. And so we\u2019re working through that. We\u2019re gaining on it. We\u2019re very focused on it. We\u2019ve got a lot of resources deployed against it and it\u2019s something we can fix in the short order. John McDonald : Okay. But you did mention John that the accounts are growing, sign-ups have been good? John Gerspach : It\u2019s definitely are growing. I mean 330,000 new card acquisitions just since we took over the book that far exceeded our expectations by a factor of 2 and 2.5 times. So, again, we\u2019re really excited about. I think it speaks to the quality of the value proposition that that we put forward with that card in partnership with Costco. John McDonald : Right. So just dealing with the volume operationally is what you\u2019re still working through? John Gerspach : Yes, again, as Mike mentioned, the call wait times are coming down, but it\u2019s, yes, it\u2019s probably it\u2019s not the largest, it\u2019s got to be one of the largest portfolio implementation transfers on a single day that\u2019s ever been attempted. And that\u2019s not to give us excuses, I mean, we should be performing better than we are, but we\u2019re working on that. But again, it\u2019s a massive program. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brennan Hawken with UBS. Please go ahead. Brennan Hawken : Good morning. Thanks for taking the questions. John Gerspach : Hi, Brennan. Brennan Hawken : On card another one here, the velocity in North America has been really, really good in both purchase volume and ANR. How long should we think about that sustaining and given some of the deals you\u2019ve just walked down from a modeling perspective how long can that sustain? John Gerspach : Well, that\u2019s a great question. We don\u2019t anticipate the same level now. You\u2019ve got two things, two factors. One is Costco obviously is going to benefit as now for the next year, so we\u2019re going to get a tremendous pickup from Costco. As in Costco though, we will begin on an ex-Costco basis some of that growth and we have 10% growth this quarter in purchase sales year-over-year, excluding Costco. That will begin to moderate sometime around towards the end of this year, the beginning of next year. But, again, we still anticipate getting good volume growth, but you\u2019re not going to get the same bump that you have when you start an investment program. Brennan Hawken : All right. Okay, thanks. We also recently heard about some of your competitors widening out their credit box in card in recent years. Have you guys done that too? Have we seen a shift down within the Citi portfolio a bit of an expansion as far as credit, or can you maybe give a little color on that? John Gerspach : We\u2019re still focused on the same target client that we had going in. If we moved by a basis point or two in FICO, that\u2019s about it. But when you take a look at where we\u2019re focused right now, it\u2019s still on that same target clients that I described to you in the past. And with the renewals that we\u2019ve done and with the new partnership with Costco, I think that speaks to the type of clients that we\u2019re really looking to build on. Brennan Hawken : Terrific. Just wanted to make sure. And then last one from me, the card trends in Asia, I appreciate your comments on the lower rewards in Australia. But when we look at the loan balances, it doesn\u2019t look like Australia is really all that big. Can that really move the needle? Can you help us understand how that would actually drive that those metrics? John Gerspach : Well, again, it\u2019s not going to drive in this quarter in ANR, but it is going to drive purchase sale. So we have a lot of usage coming out of Australia. So the drop-down in Australia itself cost us a full percentage point on purchase sale growth year-over-year. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And then that will probably just sustain for a year that lower volume, because it sounds like that\u2019s probably pretty structural, given the changes in that market? John Gerspach : Well, what I would actually think is that as the other card issuers in Asia also adjust their rewards programs, what you\u2019ll see is less of an impact where people stop using their Citi Card. And as the programs become more consistent and more competitive with each other, we should get a pickup back again. So I don\u2019t think that this is more than a one or two quarter blip down in purchase sale growth in Asia. Brennan Hawken : Okay. And have you seen competitors move yet or just you\u2019re just anticipating it? John Gerspach : I don\u2019t have anything particular in front of me that that would indicate what we\u2019ve seen yet on behavior. We\u2019ll get back to you. Brennan Hawken : Sounds good. Thanks a lot. John Gerspach : All right. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. John, you touched on Mexico earlier, but can you talk about Mexico or more generally where do you see it in its profit cycle in addition to just consumer what you said is improving. And then a question for Mike, under what circumstances would you consider a sale of Mexico? I know that that\u2019s in the past, but your discount tangible book keep getting steeper and steeper especially as your tangible book value continues to cost? John Gerspach : So to handle the first part of that question, Mike, there we were seeing good momentum throughout our Mexico franchise. We\u2019ve actually had great momentum in our ICG business in Mexico throughout the past year, year-and-a-half. It\u2019s consumer where we had a bit of a slowdown in that momentum, which we\u2019re now working our way out of, which is why we find getting 4% year-over-year revenue growth to be a nice start positive operating leverage this quarter, positive operating leverage in the back-half of this year. We anticipate having positive operating leverage coming out of the consumer business in Mexico straight on through 2017. So we\u2019ve got an improving cards picture. We\u2019ve got a vibrant retail banking picture going on in Mexico. So we see that as an engine for growth out into the future. Michael Corbat : And, Mike, from the strategic perspective, it really dovetails off of what John just described we like \u2013 as we have talked about. We like the demographics of Mexico, the growth prospects, where they are now post reforms. The position of Banamex in terms of its retail and consumer franchise, the scale of that our ability to compete. And so in a world that we see, at least, for the future ahead of us right now growth in the world\u2019s are pretty tough thing to find. We think Mexico offers that. So based on what we see and what we think the opportunities are in the franchise, we think it\u2019s accretive to our shareholders. The return are solid, and we think we\u2019ve got the ability to continue to expand those. So right now, I really don\u2019t see a scenario, where we would contemplate selling. Mike Mayo : The spirit behind the question and I know you, you understand this. I mean tangible book is close to 64 and the stock price is $44, and at some point the best investment is buying back your own stock. And but you created asset sale gains to, be allowed to buyback more stock, it\u2019s not something you should consider and you\u2019ve made a lot of strides. You discard many consumer operations outside the U.S. You reduced the size of Citi Holdings. Can\u2019t you reaccelerate some of that restructuring? Michael Corbat : Well, if you look we just announced a pretty meaningful capital return. We\u2019re in the market and we\u2019ll be buying back $8.6 billion worth of stock over the next four quarters. As you look at our math and you look at our capital return capacity, we\u2019re going to have a lot of ability to buy stock back. And when you think about the trade-offs between the stock buyback and growth, you\u2019ve got to find the right balance. So, again, if we can execute on the things that we want to execute, create the earnings, continue to liberate the DTA, we\u2019re going to have a lot of firepower against the stock, and I\u2019d like to keep investing and making sure, we\u2019re finding and continuing to build on growth. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Michael Corbat : Hey, good morning. Erika Najarian : So because of your capital excess in both CET1 and SLR, your name keeps coming up as someone that can continue to take market share, particularly in ICG. And I\u2019m wondering if there are limitations on growth or balance sheet allocation that we\u2019re not thinking about. And I guess the real question here is, where are you in terms of your scoring range on your GCIB surcharge? And is keeping your surcharge where it is today a bigger priority than potentially growing the balance sheet in a greater way to gain market share, given how volatile that that score can be? Michael Corbat : Great question, Erika. And one that we contemplate every day. There\u2019s a series of constraining factors that we constantly try to optimize against, GCIB score is one of them. LCR, CET1 stress test capital call that CCAR capital, there\u2019s just many and all those ratios on both an advanced approach basis as well as a standardized approach basis. So it\u2019s a constant trade-off, but the GCIB is certainly one of those things that we look at when we\u2019re making decisions. And to your point, as was previously disclosed, we got into the 3% bucket last year we work to get there. And we ended the year now, I\u2019d say in the very high end of that score range. And one of our goal is to remain in a 3% GCIB in a 3% bucket at year-end this year. And so, we\u2019re actively managing each of the many elements of the score in order to optimize the returns of the franchise. And you\u2019re right, those indicators can fluctuate quarter-to-quarter, but it\u2019s something that we\u2019re trying to actively manage. When I look at the preliminary results that I have for our 630 GCIB score, we come out right at 630. So we\u2019re right in that range of where we need to be and we\u2019re going to keep on working to make sure that we end the year below that 630 target. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just a follow-up question on the margin appreciate the color that you gave in terms of the puts and takes of Costco for the next \u2013 for the second-half of the year. If the slope of the curve persists or there\u2019s continued pressure on the long end, how should we think about how the marginal progress from that 290 level? John Gerspach : One more weighted especially short-term to the short end of the curve. What we\u2019ve told you in the past is, if the rates move by a 100 basis points, we\u2019ll generate an additional around the world of $1.9 billion of additional net interest income. And most of that $1.9 billion will be concentrated in the U.S. which is I think about a $1.4 billion. And most of that $1.4 billion is focused on the short end. So the long end of the curve, especially in the near-term the next year, year-and-a-half doesn\u2019t really impact us all that much. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. No problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. John, we saw a progress this quarter in the efficiency ratio as you mentioned. And I was just wondering is the prior comments you had made about 58% in Corp for the year still relevant, given the trends that we\u2019ve seen, or is there anything that kind of coming out of the second quarter with the 57 that makes you feel any better about the second-half, I know there\u2019s some seasonality? John Gerspach : I feel pretty good about the second-half. But what we had said at the end of the first quarter is that our target would be to do 58% efficiency for the full-year, given what we \u2013 the given the first quarter results. And I\u2019d say that still is where our target is, is at or around that 58% efficiency ratio in Citicorp for the full-year. Ken Usdin : Okay. And I know it\u2019s hard to talk about seasonality and given the flurry that we just had of activity in the markets business in June. But how would you characterize how we should think about quote, unquote seasonality or normal seasonality in the summer for the business. And do you \u2013 have you seen any change in activity as things have kind of calm down post the initial reaction of f Brexit? John Gerspach : The \u2013 it\u2019s still very, very, very early in the third quarter. So it\u2019s a little hard to comment on activity for an entire quarter after just eight, nine trading days. But the activity levels are fine that I think it\u2019s good. And we\u2019ll have to see how everything holds up into the month of August, but again the beginning part of July looks fine. Ken Usdin : Great. One last or one for me just in terms your NIM comments and then just that we know that Costco is going to full quarter in the third, it\u2019s a pretty good line of sight in terms of being able to grow NII from here? John Gerspach : I like the prospects of growing NII, I mean, obviously with Costco coming on, that gives us the big boost. I talked about the momentum that we got in for the consumer businesses in Asia and Latin America with branded cards. So, yes, we \u2013 I don\u2019t have a prepared comment on guidance on NII. I don\u2019t like to give guidance on individual line items of the income. But, yes, we feel very good about the NII, and that\u2019s why we feel that the NIM should improve back up to the 290 or maybe a little higher range in the second-half of the year. Ken Usdin : Okay, understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks. John, a couple of questions. The first is on Slide 28, where you have the ICG unfunded corporate energy exposure? John Gerspach : Yes. Eric Wasserstrom : The double and single B component looks like, it actually grew by close to $1 billion versus last quarter. And I\u2019m wondering, if that\u2019s from actual additional exposure or is that from the down \u2013 the ratings migration of existing exposures? John Gerspach : Well, and some of that is migration. There\u2019s a variety of factors that that go into that. But there\u2019s nothing in there that would indicate that there\u2019s something deteriorating, or anything else it\u2019s just a series of puts and takes. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. And the \u2013 I think you previously indicated that 65% of the total of about $35 billion is either investment-grade or has credit support. Has that figure changed at all? John Gerspach : No, I don\u2019t have that in front of me. So I apologize for that. We\u2019ll have to get back, yes. I don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any big deterioration there. I just don\u2019t have that with me. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay, great, no problem. And then just following up on sort of several of the questions and your responses, we think about the back-half of this year. It sounds like what you\u2019re pointing us towards is balance sheet expansion driving NII growth with perhaps a little bit of a lift also from NIM, continued positive operating leverage from lower repositioning costs and some improvement in the provision guidance, although still incremental build, but potentially some lesser degree of trading revenue. Is that broadly correct? John Gerspach : Well, I\u2019m not going to comment on what you might pull out of your own model. But in broad strokes I would be cautious about thinking that I\u2019ve guided you to balance sheet expansion. Balance sheet expansion is not really something that we\u2019re targeting. As I said, we still believe that we can optimize our balance sheet. So I wouldn\u2019t factor in undue expansion of the balance sheet. Eric Wasserstrom : Okay. Yes, I was sort of speaking of within Citicorp, but rather than broadly. But would Citicorp still be broadly low like, I mean, I think it was up about 1% in the period? John Gerspach : The balance sheet growth? Eric Wasserstrom : Yes. John Gerspach : I\u2019m not prepared to give forward guidance on the balance sheet. Let\u2019s just say that, again, from the overall level of about $1.8 trillion for the overall Citigroup, that\u2019s broadly the area that we still believe that we should be operating. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Michael Corbat : Morning. Steven Chubak : So, John, I had a quick question on CCAR, maybe a bit of a follow-up to Erika\u2019s earlier question. The results are priced very positively in the latest round. As you prepare for some of the tougher elements like GCIB surcharge inclusion, how are you thinking about the capital minimums or targets that you need to amass to day to day as part of your allocation process? I\u2019m just trying to get a sense as to whether this has changed significantly just given the favorable results that we saw in the latest stress test round? John Gerspach : Well, first of all, Steven, I wouldn\u2019t know what to do about GCIB surcharge in CCAR, because unless something happen this morning while I\u2019ve been sitting here we haven\u2019t seen any proposed rule yet. So that\u2019s something that we\u2019re obviously aware of the rhetoric that\u2019s out there. But, again, we just don\u2019t know, so that has not impacted our planning as yet at all. Steven Chubak : Okay, got it. And I recognize, John, that you don\u2019t want to give explicit guidance on balance sheet growth expectations, but with the price of RWAs come down in the quarter and given the growth in both loans and assets, I\u2019m just trying to get a better handle as to what was driving that. I know that there\u2019s some FX translation impacts that could influence the moves in RWA. But given how much Holdings has shrunk, is it reasonable to assume that RWA growth will wrap Citicorp growth going forward in terms of\u2026? John Gerspach : Well, actually, if you \u2013 yes, Steven, if you look Holdings RWA declined by about $8 billion or $9 billion in the quarter. And if you look our RWA overall dropped by about $8 billion in the quarter. Steven Chubak : Got it, okay. One more quick modeling question for me on legal and repositioning costs. You\u2019d guided to the 225 basis points for Citicorp for the full-year. It looks like there has been a higher run rate in those expenses in the first-half. What\u2019s a reasonable expectation for what we should be modeling for the second-half for legal and repositioning? John Gerspach : I would still say that for the full-year, the 225 is still a pretty good number. Steven Chubak : Perfect. Thank you very much. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Well\u2026 John Gerspach : Hi, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Just stepping back bigger picture, you\u2019ve done a lot of work in the credit card businesses, a lot of upfront investing, obviously renewal of some contracts, gaining some contracts. So there\u2019s still obviously the execution to do, but it seems like the heavy lifting has been done from an investment point of view. If you look at the rest of the franchise across the products and the markets, are there other areas that you want to focus on increasingly so on investment dollars, or do we start to see maybe some moderation in some of the spend? Michael Corbat : For the investment perspective, Matt, I think we remained largely consistent with the things that we talked about before. So we talked about equities and we talked about what we\u2019re trying to do there the combination of prime brokerage, the combination of cash derivative Delta One and investments in people balance sheet, et cetera. So those continue. Investments in our network and our cash management business in that investments in digital and our interface on the consumer side. So, again, things that we\u2019ve consistently spoken about those investments continue. Matt O\u2019Connor: And just how you think about? Michael Corbat : I would describe it\u2019s outsized. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Is it fair, I mean, it feels like the credit card and some of it shows up in expenses and some of it\u2019s a contra-revenue. But it seems like that was a pretty big effort to get behind you. And are these other things more kind of in a run rate or business as usual? Michael Corbat : I would say from a technology perspective, we probably need to think of a lot of those investments ongoing as business as usual. I think of the equities investment is probably being slightly different in terms of \u2013 there\u2019s a life to it and there\u2019s a set of expectations that we\u2019ve got to make sure we achieve out of those investments. John Gerspach : I think, Matt, what you\u2019ll see is, we\u2019ll continue to invest where we have the prospects for growth. So you\u2019re likely to see still we\u2019ll have investment spending in Mexico, but that is captured in the guidance that I gave you as far as our belief of generating positive operating leverage in the second-half of this year and positive operating leverage in consumer in 2017, so that\u2019s embedded in that. We\u2019ll continue throughout U.S. to spend money to enhance our digital capabilities. So we do have investment dollars at play. So I don\u2019t want to tell you that, we\u2019re not going to be investing. Just to keep our TTS network in place, we spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year, that is not going to stop. But I think the spirit of Mike and I are trying to answer your questions, we don\u2019t see any large lumpy dollar where we\u2019re going to tell you that this is going to be some negative impact on our financial performance for the next several quarters. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s what I was getting at. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. John Gerspach : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : So a question just on capital creation, because clearly you are creating capital faster than earnings, thanks to things like Holdings shrinking and the DTA utilization and all that. And I\u2019m wondering, do you get any credit from the regulators for this in your opinion? And is there an opportunity, do you think at some point, maybe it\u2019s once we get through the CCAR buffer for GCIBs that\u2019s coming. But do you think there is a point when you\u2019ll be able to talk to them about the DTA utilization and the incremental capital from that going towards share repurchase as opposed to factoring into the whole CCAR process? Michael Corbat : When we think about capital generation and in particular capital returns, we don\u2019t as you reference think of that in terms of earnings, because we\u2019ve got the capacity and I think Slide 33 shows the drivers of capital and DTA that we\u2019ve got this ability through the utilization of DTA and again $10 billion used we since it peaked to generate regulatory capital at a kind of pretty significant rate. So we understand that if we\u2019re not returning all of that excess capital and so if we measure ourselves, we measure ourselves against finding capital constraints, and today that would most likely be CCAR. What do we need to run the institution, what do we need is a buffer, and it\u2019s our intention over time to return all of that excess back to our shareholders that we can\u2019t use. And in this environment that\u2019s probably the bulk of earnings and DTA liberalization. And when you think about the difference between our TCE and our CE Tier 1, it\u2019s largely the $29 billion of disallowed DTA. And so as we liberate that, we\u2019d like to return them. I think it\u2019s part of that conversation that\u2019s not nor will be a prospective conversation. But as we liberate it, we then want the ability to return that in arrears. And we\u2019ve been in conversations with our regulators about that and that will I think continue to show itself over time. Betsy Graseck : So, I guess, is it \u2013 this upcoming rule that we\u2019re waiting for from the Fed regarding the GCIB buffer, GCIB surcharge increase for the folks like you that we\u2019re waiting for you get through that and then maybe the ask can go up? I\u2019m just wondering how you think about timing around that? Michael Corbat : We\u2019ve consistently talked about walking the ask up. This year was a tripling of the dividend and meaningful increase in terms of buyback and it\u2019s our intention around the right operating environment and the right results to continue to do that. And again going back to the knowing that unless we do that and we return or use all of this excess capital, we\u2019re going to have a denominator problem. And so we\u2019re committed to doing that. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question, just a couple one. First of all, John, in terms of the DTA utilization, you\u2019ve mentioned a couple of times on the call freeing up that asset. I guess, I\u2019m just curious why the pace of the DTA utilization was so much slower in the second quarter than the first quarter, given it looks like North American consumer profitability, pre-tax profitability was roughly similar quarter-over-quarter? And just looking through some of the ICG numbers, that it appears North American profitability there was also relatively similar quarter-over-quarter? John Gerspach : Yes, Matt, if it was very simple to give you the formula as far as how you drive down the DTA, I\u2019d love to lay it out. But it just doesn\u2019t work that way. It has to do with certainly where the earnings are generated, importantly, how much of that is coming out of current taxes that that are due as opposed to how much you can put against your deferral. So it\u2019s difficult to give you well if earnings are bit and the DTA will be back. There\u2019s just a lot of other things that go into it. But in general, again, we\u2019re focused on driving it down. And I think as Mike said, we\u2019re obviously been able to do that in billion dollars of utilization over the last couple of years. And we should be able to continue to utilize it somewhere in the range of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year that\u2019s going to be the pace. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just moving on to page 24 of the supplement, I realize we\u2019re looking at end of period balances, so there may be something skewing this a little bit. But the corporate loans in EMEA grew in the second quarter at a much faster rate than you\u2019ve seen them grow year-over-year. I\u2019m curious if that\u2019s sort of a one-quarter blip possibly driven by Brexit, or are you really driving market share gains on the lending side, partly because of some of the challenges of the European banks? Michael Corbat : Yes, I don\u2019t have a great answer for you on that, Matt, I\u2019m sorry. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally, John, maybe following up on Betsy\u2019s question. Looking really at this CCAR cycle, you\u2019ve obviously had some good news in terms of living will, your CCAR proposal was accepted without any change. I guess, I\u2019m curious how you\u2019re thinking about potentially requesting a de minimis or a further increase in the buyback in this CCAR cycle using the de minimis exception? Michael Corbat : Yes, Matt, in that, I would say that it\u2019s still relatively early in the year, let\u2019s see how the year progresses and where we are and we\u2019ll make that judgment or that call later in the year. Matt Burnell : Okay, thanks very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Klainhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Klainhanzl : Thanks. Michael Corbat : Hey, Brian. Brian Klainhanzl : I had two questions. First on the Costco, you mentioned that the reserving would start in the back-half of this year, but do you get from the fair value marks, does that last you to third quarter? So you\u2019re not really going to see the reserving start until the fourth quarter, or does that start as early as the third quarter? Michael Corbat : No, it actually started in the second quarter. But, again, we only had the portfolio for 13 days. But if you remember we kind of went through a similar set of discussions about LLR build when we acquired Best Buy back in 2013. And so as you correctly stated when we\u2019d purchase a loan portfolio, we acquired the receivables and they\u2019re recorded at fair value, so there\u2019s no corresponding loan loss reserve. Therefore, as new loans are originated, the LLR build. If you think about the difference between an acquired portfolio and a matured portfolio, in a matured portfolio that build would be offset by LLR releases for loans that actually paid off. However, if the acquired loans don\u2019t have an LLR, there\u2019s no offsetting releases as they pay down. So that means that your rate of build to a, let\u2019s call it normalized LLR for an acquired portfolio is actually depended on how fast the new loans are created, as well as how fast the old loans pay down. So if the pay down rate really has the predominant driver of the pace of the LLR build, as the portfolio gets replenished with new spend on existing cards. So since Costco has a high pay down rate, the LLR build on the Costco portfolio is going to be more front-loaded than with the case with Best Buy. So I actually think that what you\u2019re going to see in the third quarter could very well be the highest quarterly LLR build that we will see as a result of acquiring the portfolio. Brian Klainhanzl : Okay, thanks. That was very helpful. And then also related to Costco on the purchase, obviously the intangibles went up. What\u2019s the life of those for the amortization schedule? Is it amortized over one year, two years? John Gerspach : I believe tangibles would tie back to the contract. Brian Klainhanzl : Okay. And then just lastly, I guess going back to 2013, I mean, Mike you provided a nice update as to back in March of 2013 as to your long-term strategy of where you\u2019re going to be investing. Is there any plans to provide another one of those updates of the kind of benchmark what you\u2019ve done over the last three years, because there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been done, but kind of what you are going to do to kind of drive the company forward? John Gerspach : Yes, we plan on doing that. We haven\u2019t set a date in terms of coming out. But probably sometime over this summer or as we get to the end of the third quarter, we\u2019ll probably come out with some talk about when we\u2019re going to go up more broadly. Brian Klainhanzl : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. John Gerspach : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : John, you talked about how you had better than expected growth in the number of new cards from the Costco \u2013 new accounts from the Costco acquisition in these early days. Were the purchase sales as better than expected as the acquisition of the new accounts? Michael Corbat : Purchase sales, I can say are running roughly in line with what we had anticipated, maybe a little bit higher, but roughly in line. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And the two-thirds outside of the store, is that in line with your expectations as well on the purchase sales? Michael Corbat : That\u2019s in line. Gerard Cassidy : Yes. Is there anyway of taking this bigger with your global reach outside the U.S. than what maybe American Express could have done with Costco? Michael Corbat : I\u2019m not prepared just to talk about. Let\u2019s absorb what we\u2019ve got right now first. Obviously, we\u2019re still working through the $11 billion portfolio that we have a 11 million new card members, let\u2019s give them a delightful experience first and then we\u2019ll think about international. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Clearly, you guys have made a commitment to cards with this acquisition and your other acquisitions. Are there any other portfolios that you are aware of that might come up for bidding in the next 12 or 18 months of meaningful size? Michael Corbat : Of meaningful size. There is a couple intermediate size bites over the next few years, but there\u2019s nothing of any real significance. Obviously, like we have in the past, we\u2019ll continue to look at those, and if the numbers and returns work, we\u2019ll obviously compete for them, and if not we won\u2019t. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. There\u2019s a lot of moving parts to this question. Obviously you guys are very well capitalized. The regulators control what you can give back in excess capital similar to your peers. Is there ever a thought of if you\u2019re limited and we won\u2019t know for a couple years that you can only give back what you earn every year and nothing above it. Is there a thought with your investments in the digital consumer capabilities that you are doing, that mobile channel to pursue a more aggressive consumer business in the United States, obviously you don\u2019t have a retail branch network and you probably don\u2019t need it in the future like some of your bigger peers. But is there any thought that you guys have, as your mobile channel is very robust, very strong, can you take that even bigger to grow that faster nationwide? John Gerspach : Well, I think we have that opportunity whether or not, we have the issue that you talked about. Again, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to end up with. But even if we are able to return all the capital that we think we have, I think we still have the opportunity to grow our consumer business in the U.S. as a result between digital and mobile. Those are things that we\u2019re definitely focused on. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Shifting gears on you, I know you talked about the ICG business and obviously what went on post Brexit with the trading. Was there any significant change in the pipeline in investment banking activity post Brexit? I know it\u2019s not that long ago. But anything there to talk about? John Gerspach : Well, I think the pipeline remains pretty strong. And actually on the heels of Brexit, we saw actually quite good deal flow. You saw debt capital markets, you saw equity capital markets, you saw M&A getting executed getting announced. So I would say the pipeline for the third quarter remains pretty strong and provided we get reasonable markets. We\u2019ve got an environment in which we can continue to get these things done. So it feels pretty good. Gerard Cassidy : And then just finally, your \u2013 obviously your credit quality has improved dramatically and it\u2019s still very strong. But there\u2019s always moving parts, and so one of the questions on the moving parts is, I think it was on the supplement package on page 33, you give us the breakout of your non-accrual loans in corporate and consumer. I notice you had some real good improvement in Latin America, they dropped quite a bit. But EMEA jumped up quite a bit in the quarter on non-accrual. Was that in energy-related credit or Brexit related credit or credits? John Gerspach : Two energy-related names in EMEA caused that. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, great. And look forward to see those, Mike, those new guidelines that you guys are going to hopefully announce later on. And just I would also throw an Investor Day now that you guys are moving forward, you might want to consider that for 2017, even though Susan is probably not happy about that. Thank you. John Gerspach : Thank you. Operator : And we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Susan Kendall : All right. Thank you all for joining us for the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brian. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first, then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.8 billion for the third quarter of 2016 or $1.24 per share. I have to say that I'm very encouraged by the underlying momentum across our franchise, notably in several areas where we've been investing. In our Global Consumer Bank, we saw revenue increases in every business line and geography, excluding the impact of a one-time gain last year in Mexico. In the U.S., we realized the benefit of our first full quarter of the Costco portfolio, which is exceeding our expectations in every key metric. The remainder of our branded cards portfolio as well as retail services also delivered modest revenue growth as did our more focused retail branch network. In our institutional businesses, revenues increased 2%, as meaningful improvement in nearly every banking and markets product was partially offset by a swing in the mark-to-market value of loan hedges. Our Fixed Income franchise continued to benefit from strong client engagement across both our corporate and investor client base. And the backbone of our global network, Treasury and Trade Solutions, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the 11th consecutive quarter despite the low rate environment. In both our consumer and institutional businesses, we continued to grow both loans and deposits. Consistent with our strategy, we continue to shift our resources to where they can generate the best returns for our investors. This can mean investments like Costco or divestments of certain businesses. For example, this month, we announced agreements to sell our retail banking operations in Argentina and Brazil and plans for significant investment in Mexico. As a sign of our commitment to Mexico, a market where we have real scale and confidence in its growth prospects, we're integrating the local brand with Citi's, and the franchise will be known as Citibanamex. Turning toward our dwindling non-core assets. For the ninth quarter in a row, Citi Holdings was profitable, and its $74 million in net income was less than 2% of Citigroup's total earnings for the quarter. Assets in Citi Holdings are now only 3% of our balance sheet and down 48% from one year ago. As you know, the next quarter will be the last that we report holdings results separately. We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. This was the first quarter we began implementing our new capital plan. During the quarter, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 56 million. The amount of outstanding is 2% lower from the prior quarter and 4% down from one year ago. That acceleration in the reduction of the amount of outstanding shares is due to the increased amount of buybacks under the capital plan. In the past two years, we've lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, which is an 8% increase from one year ago, reflecting the impact of the stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings. Even so, our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6%, and we're committed to continue increasing the capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve our returns. Looking forward, while we expect growth both in the developed and emerging markets to pick up next year, the uncertainties that color the current economic environment haven't retreated. Brexit, hard, soft or scrambled, is still an open question and is likely to remain so for the near future. Here in the U.S., thankfully, we're only a few weeks away from the presidential election, and there seems to be growing consensus for interest rate increases, but the Fed has clearly been dovish up to this point. Economic projections have improved somewhat recently, particularly in places like Brazil and Russia, which may soon return to positive growth. John will now go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17.8 billion declined 4% from last year, and expenses decreased 2%, each driven primarily by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings as well as the impact of foreign exchange translations. And credit costs improved, reflecting a reduction in the provision for benefits and claims due to asset sales in Citi Holdings as well as lower net credit losses, partially offset by a net reserve build this quarter as compared to a small release in the prior year. Net income of $3.8 billion declined 8% from last year, mostly driven by mark-to-market loan hedges and the absence of one-time gains in the prior period. However, we were able to offset some of this impact through underlying business growth. We also benefited from share buybacks, which drove a 4% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $638 billion and 7% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind-down of Citi Holdings, and deposits grew 4% to $940 billion. On slide four, we show the split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the third quarter, contributing 98% of total net income. Pre-tax earnings of $5.6 billion in Citicorp declined by roughly $300 million year-over-year. However, this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges this quarter as compared to gains in the prior year as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that benefited the third quarter of 2015, including a gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico and the reversal of valuation adjustment in our equities business. Together, these items drove a roughly $900 million negative variance in the year-over-year EBIT comparison, all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenues would have grown 6% year-over-year, with broad-based growth across our institutional and consumer businesses, partially offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other. Citicorp expenses grew 3%, mostly reflecting volume growth as well as continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 8% from the third quarter of last year, driven by a larger reserve build. Most of the reserve build related to our U.S. Cards franchise, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections, which I'll describe more in a moment. Credit quality remained broadly favorable across the franchise, with stable to improving loss rates in every region. Turning to Citi Holdings. Both revenues and expenses declined significantly year-over-year as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings assets by nearly half over the past year, ending the third quarter with $61 billion of assets, and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $10 billion. Turning now to each business. Slide five shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 7% year-over-year. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion grew 2% from last year on continued growth in average loans and checking deposits of 9% and 10%, respectively. We generated this volume growth even as our branch footprint continued to shrink. We have spent the last several years reshaping our branch network, upgrading technology and deepening our focus on our core six markets, enabling us to grow revenues while reducing expenses and significantly improving the profitability of our retail bank. And now with the right footprint and infrastructure in place, we are beginning to invest for additional growth by enhancing our segmentation strategy focused on the Citigold wealth management platform, improving our digital and mobile banking capabilities and continuing to upgrade the network with smart branches and dedicated Citigold centers. Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15%, reflecting the first full quarter of contribution from the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 1% underlying revenue growth as we are beginning to lap the investment program we started last year and a portion of the new balances are maturing to full rate. Turning to Costco. The early results continue to be very encouraging. New account acquisitions have far exceeded our expectations at nearly 800,000 to date. Purchase sales have totaled roughly $28 billion to date, with over 70% being out of store, indicating that customers are using this card first for their everyday purchases. And the loan portfolio had grown to over $14 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Finally, retail service revenues of $1.6 billion improved 1% from last year. We saw better-than-expected average loan growth in retail services this quarter, up 2% sequentially, which offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.6 billion, up 12% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and continued marketing investments. Costco-related expenses were somewhat elevated this quarter as we addressed higher-than-anticipated service volumes in the weeks following the conversion. And finally, credit costs in North America increased significantly from last year. Net credit losses increased 6% to $929 million, driven by volume growth. And we\u2019ve built over $400 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter, including nearly $450 million in branded cards and retail services. Roughly a third of this amount was related to the acquisition of the Costco portfolio as we previously described. Another third was related to volume growth in normal seasoning in the portfolios. And the remaining third predominantly reflected the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third-party collections. In branded cards, the NCL rate declined to 225 basis points this quarter, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio, which did not incur any losses during the quarter as we had generally excluded late-stage delinquencies from the acquired loans. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate in branded cards has been in the range of roughly 280 basis points year-to-date. We expect the loss rate on Costco to be lower than the existing portfolio, but this benefit will likely be offset by the impact of seasoning as well as the estimated impact of the proposed regulatory guidelines I just mentioned. So we expect the NCL rate to remain in the range of around 280 basis points next year with some quarterly variability. In retail services, the loss rate has been in the range of around 410 basis points year-to-date, and we expect it to increase to around 435 basis points next year, again, primarily reflecting the impact of seasoning and the proposed regulatory guidelines. Importantly, these NCL rates are consistent with our return goals for each business, with branded cards targeting at least 225 basis points of ROA and retail services in the range of around 250 basis points. On slide six, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In total, excluding the impact of a one-time gain on the sale of our merchant-acquiring business in Mexico last year, revenues grew 4% and expenses were flat to last year. In Latin America, excluding the prior year gain, consumer revenues were up 5% as continued growth in retail banking, which grew 11% year-over-year, was offset by a decline in cards. These retail banking results reflect strong volume growth, with average loans and deposits increasing 8% and 12% respectively. Latin America cards revenues declined from last year. However, we continue to see signs of recovery in that business this quarter, which I'll cover more in a moment. And finally, expenses were flat year-over-year in Latin America, resulting in significant positive operating leverage. As Mike mentioned earlier, we are continuing to invest in our Mexico consumer franchise to drive sustainable growth, with initiatives to enhance our branch network, digital capabilities and service offerings. We expect to maintain positive operating leverage next quarter and each year throughout the investment period, driven by revenue growth as well as cost savings from upgrading and standardizing our technology platforms. Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in Wealth Management and cards, partially offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Wealth Management revenues grew 11% from last year on improving investor sentiment and continued positive AUM inflows. And cards turned positive as well with revenues up 4%, driven by modest volume growth, a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Retail lending revenues remained under pressure as we continued to shift our portfolio away from lower-return mortgage loans this quarter. While this shift drove a modest decline in average retail loans and lending revenues, our goal is to build a higher-return, more balanced portfolio over time. And finally, total credit costs grew 13% in our international consumer franchise, reflecting a modest reserve build this quarter compared to our release in the prior year, while loss rates remained favorable. On slide seven, we show some key performance indicators for our global branded cards franchise, including year-over-year growth in purchase sales, average card loans and revenues. In North America, as you can see, these trends show a significant positive impact from the Costco portfolio acquisition. But even excluding that transaction, we continue to show progress in our existing franchise with organic growth in purchase sales, average loans and revenues this quarter. As I just noted, in Asia, we have also achieved revenue growth year-over-year, which we expect to continue going forward. And finally, in Latin America, we achieved growth in both purchase sales and average loans this quarter, but revenues remained down 6% versus last year. This year-over-year comparison was affected by certain episodic fee revenues in the prior period. On a comparable basis, card revenues in Latin America would have been down 3% versus last year, reflecting the continued impact of higher payment rates. With continued growth in purchase sales and average loans, we expect Latin America card revenues to return to sustainable growth in the second half of next year. Slide eight shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter in every region. The decline in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, which, as I mentioned earlier, did not incur any losses this quarter. Excluding Costco, the NCL rate would have been flat to the prior year at 2.2%. And the NCL rate in Latin America showed particular improvement as well. However, as our loan portfolio continues to grow in season, we still expect this NCL rate to run closer to 4.5% as we go into next year. On slide nine, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the third quarter. When we presented this slide last quarter, our first half EBIT comparison was affected by several factors, including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in wealth management, the early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of this year. Now in the third quarter, you can see that we're beginning to build momentum again. We generated business growth in areas like Asia and North America cards as well as the retail and commercial businesses in both North America and Latin America. We are beginning to lap the impact of our branded cards investments on rebate and rewards costs and saw a full-quarter benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. And Wealth Management revenues continue to recover with improving investor sentiment. In total, we generated 5% underlying revenue growth in our consumer franchise this quarter. And while expenses were up as well by 7%, we still grew our operating margin by roughly $150 million year-over-year, and we believe we can operate closer to flat operating leverage in the fourth quarter. Of course, we faced credit headwind this quarter as we built loan loss reserves compared to our release in the prior year. However, some of the current quarter reserve builds were related to Costco and the proposed regulatory guidelines I mentioned earlier and shouldn't recur at these levels. So overall, while we still face some headwinds, we feel good about the direction of the consumer franchise. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide 10. Revenues of $8.6 billion in the third quarter grew 2% from last year, driven by Fixed Income, Investment Banking and Treasury and Trade Solutions. Total banking revenues of $4.3 billion grew 7% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2 billion grew 8% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in transaction volumes with new and existing clients. The TTS business remains core to our institutional strategy, delivering integrated solutions to our multinational clients and deepening our operating relationships with them across multiple products and markets. Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion grew 15% from last year on strong debt underwriting activity, partially offset by lower equity underwriting revenues. Private Bank revenues of $746 million were up 4% year-over-year, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. And Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million also grew 4%, mostly reflecting higher average loans. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion grew 11% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.5 billion were up 35%, with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew over 30% year-over-year, with particular strength in G10 Rates, reflecting strong client activity in a more favorable environment. And spread product revenues grew over 40% as credit and securitized markets continued to recover from the depressed levels we saw in late 2015. Turning to equities. Excluding a positive valuation adjustment in the prior year of approximately $140 million, our revenues were down 23% year-over-year, driven by lower client activity and a less favorable environment, particularly in derivatives as well as the comparison to a strong quarter in Asia last year. Finally, in Securities Services, revenues grew 4% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion were down 1% year-over-year, driven by efficiency savings, lower legal costs and a benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12-month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 27%. Cost of credit was a benefit of $90 million in the third quarter as net credit losses were largely offset by previously existing reserves and we also saw a net benefit from ratings upgrades, reductions in exposures and improved valuations. On slide 11, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG on a year-to-date basis, which shows continued significant improvement from the start of the year. Given the strong revenue performance this quarter, we're now showing 2% growth on a year-to-date basis in our accrual and transaction services businesses as well as markets and banking. And we were able to achieve this growth while maintaining our operating discipline, with expenses up just 1% even while we continue to invest in the franchise. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela devaluation in the first quarter as well as mark-to-mark losses on loan hedges, driven by spread movements. As part of our ongoing risk management efforts, we use loan hedges to manage our credit risk concentrations using predominately single main CDS positions against specific exposures in our portfolio. While these positions provide an economic hedge and help us manage concentrations to any particular client, sector or region, they are accounted for on a mark-to-market basis. And this year, we've seen consistent spread tightening in these positions driving mark-to-market losses in comparison to the spread widening we experienced last year, which drove significant gains. Slide 12 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues decreased year-over-year largely due to the absence of the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold this quarter. And expenses increased, mostly reflecting our sponsorship of the U.S. Olympic team this year as well as higher consulting cost related to the timing of the resolution plan submissions. On Slide 13, we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. The bars represent net interest revenue per day for each quarter in constant dollars, showing consistent growth year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings has continued to shrink. Our net interest margin was 286 basis points this quarter, lower than our previous outlook of around 290 basis points as the benefit from Costco and other loan growth was offset by lower trading NIM and higher-than-anticipated cash balances during the quarter as we supported client activity. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect NIM to remain relatively flat to this level. On Slide 14, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratio increased to 12.6%. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.4%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 8% year-over-year to $64.71, in part driven by a 4% reduction in our shares outstanding. Before I turn it over to questions, let me make a few comments on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In consumer, we expect to continue to generate year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars across North America, Asia and Latin America, although, sequentially, mortgage activity could be seasonally slower versus the third quarter. In the institutional franchise, we expect markets to reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter, but revenues still should improve year-over-year. And Investment Banking revenue should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. In Corporate/Other, revenue should continue to run close to 0. Turning to expenses. We expect core expenses in Citicorp to be down modestly from the third quarter, reflecting the absence of certain episodic costs, lower compensation expense and other efficiency savings, partially offset by seasonally higher marketing expenses and ongoing investment spend. And cost of credit in Citicorp should be higher than the third quarter, assuming that credit costs in ICG normalize versus the benefit we saw this quarter. In consumer, the LLR build should be lower in the fourth quarter. However, we also expect NCLs to be higher as the Costco portfolio begins to incur losses and we continue to see the impact of volume growth. Finally, we expect Citi Holdings to operate around breakeven. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. First and foremost, a big-picture question. I think you showed a lot of progress in turning around growth in both international consumer and cards, keeping expenses flat, credits fine, shrinking the share count, all the good stuff. So when I look at slide 19, I want help in your words interpreting it. At Citigroup, the return on tangible is not where you want it to be, not earnings, the cost of capital. Excluding the disallowed DTA, it's a lot closer at 9.2%. When you look at GCB and ICG, they're even better. So I guess, I'm curious on how you evaluate where profitability is and where it should be. Not sure you're ready to roll out goals for next year yet, but just any guidance there would be great. John Gerspach : So, I mean, Glenn, this is a perfectly fair question. What you see in Corp/Other, I think we laid this out in some of the slides we used at the Financial Services Conference early in September. We recognized that we've got a lot of capital sitting there in Corp/Other. Some of it is capital we're holding above what we would say is our target capital. And again, we're waiting to see where the whole CCAR process and the various rules as far as Basel III enhanced or Basel IV come out, but we recognize our debt capital there. And that's also where you got the DTA capital that we backed out at the bottom. So there is improvement clearly that we intend to drive in GCB. We still have the target there of 20%. ICG is closer to where we had set the longer-term goal of 14%, and we still have a ways to go in getting that 9.2% up to that overall target of 14% that we set out. A good piece of that will come from continued business growth and continued expense efficiencies. A small bit will come as we continue to wind down holdings, and the rest of it will come as we continue to increase the amount of capital that we're able to return to our shareholders. Glenn Schorr : Fair enough. Two small ones to follow up. Specifically, on the loan hedges in ICG, will they -- are they always going to be offsetting the positives? In other words, is that how the hedges will work? And we'll just have to deal with the negative line when things are going well? And then on securitized products that were up 40%, what specific products are there? And does it feel sustainable for now in your opinion? John Gerspach : Let me tackle the first question as far as -- what was the first question on the loan hedge? [indiscernible] Glenn, sorry. Just kidding, just kidding. I think that what we've seen in the last two years, but really, in the third quarter in each of the years, is an outsized movement in credit spreads. And that's really been reflecting in those loan hedges. The results that we're getting on those loan hedges, the large gain in last third quarter and the heavier losses now that we've taken in the second and the third quarter, I think that's more reflective of a wider spread, larger spread movement, then this is the way it's always going to be. Because we've had these hedges, these types of hedges on in the past. And you haven't seen -- you've seen some variability, but the volatility that we've seen in each of the last two years, I just think is a bit outsized. So I don't think -- I can't tell you when it's going to stop, but that's not something that I think that's going to be -- carry with us into the future. Mike Corbat : And Glenn, on the spread products side of things, I think what you've seen here is the years progressed and we moved more towards a more likely shift towards higher rates. I think you've seen a relatively strong calendar on the debt issuance side, which always helps fuel secondary activity, and I think people are now focusing on positioning or repositioning their credit portfolios for an environment in the U.S. of higher rates. So again, we've beaten spread products down. There's some pretty low volumes and some pretty low numbers. So it's our expectation that, again, around a backdrop of a path towards slowly increasing rates and repositioning the portfolios, volumes continue to work their way back up. We don't see any big spike back up, but we expect it to continue to work its way back up. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks very much for that. Mike Corbat : Thanks, Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Bigger picture question on cards, guys. It's nice to see the traction on the card metrics from the investments in terms of account growth, loans and revenues. Look like they're picking up now. But as you said, you've also got this upfront investment and provisioning that you're doing. I guess, bigger picture, where are you in terms of this investment cycle in cards? And where do you see maybe an inflection point with the profits, net profits begin growing and the ROA gets closer to that targeted range that you have? John Gerspach : Yes, it's a fair question, John. So we mentioned the fact that now we're beginning to lap some of the investment activity to grow the organic portfolio. When we brought on Costco, we said that just given the purchase accounting, Costco will not be really accretive to our earnings until sometime in the latter part of '17. It's going to take at least a full year to really get there before it gets accretive just because of the way the loan loss reserve mechanics come. So I'd say that we're at a point now in cards, it may stabilize. It may be, from a return point of view, be slightly down again in '17. But then I would expect it to begin to tick up. I can't give you the exact timing, John, but it's sometime either in late '17 or certainly in '18. And then throughout '19, we should see a steady drive towards increased profitability coming out of the cards business. Mike Corbat : And John, if you look at the three, in essence, things that we've been working. Again, as John mentioned, overcoming some of the regulatory headwinds that were there. We've also talked about having a number of or really all of our important renegotiations behind us, and so that's now done. And the third piece is that we've got our products in place. We've got our cash back in place. We've got our global rewards program in place, and we've built and put those out there. And now it's really supporting and driving growth, and a lot of what you've seen is now turning toward is the increase in terms of marketing and really trying to drive volume towards and client acquisition towards those cards. And that's probably the spending that you continue to see from this point forward. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. And then just as a follow-up, a separate question on CCAR. Just wanted to get your thoughts on the recent proposed tweaks in CCAR. As you've discussed, John, unlocking the value trapped by DTA requires you to eventually start returning more capital than you're generating. Do you have any increased clarity or confidence after CCAR last year and then the tweaks proposed this year that you can accelerate payouts to a level of net reduction in the next year or two? John Gerspach : So John, I'd say that everything that you saw come out from Governor Tarullo's speech, there's nothing in that speech that is inconsistent with what we want to drive towards. So we don't see any reason to think that we can't eventually get there. I think that the question is timing. And as we've said, that's something that we'll consider each year as we go through our CCAR process. You've seen us have significant increases in that capital return over the last two cycles. And that's our goal, is to continue to increase that capital return, as I think Mike said in his opening remarks. John McDonald : Okay. But in terms of the timing, there's still some uncertainty in terms of what kind of pace that we could expect over the next year or two? John Gerspach : Yes, I think you have to be somewhat cautious in that. We haven't seen -- we heard the speech and the tweaks. Clearly, what Governor Tarullo laid down in that speech, I would say, are manageable. There's an NPR that is going to be published early next year. I'd like to read that NPR before I made any comments, and I certainly would like to see what scenario we're going to be looking at in next year's CCAR test. So there's a few things that, I think, Mike and I would like to be able to work our way through before we gave you a specific answer on that question. John McDonald : Okay. Fair enough. Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning, guys. Maybe on the card business. You guys, I think, had 5% quarter-over-quarter growth in period balances. So obviously still very good momentum. Can you help us think about, was that a big flurry upfront and it's starting to slow? Or you're seeing that momentum continue? How do we think about how we think about the next quarter or two in terms of the pace of new signups? John Gerspach : Well, when you take a look -- don't forget, there was a lot of pent-up demand in Costco as far as for new account acquisition. And clearly, with Costco not issuing cards for 6 or 7 months, we've certainly captured that. I have to admit, we've been favorably, nicely surprised by the way that the Costco portfolio has grown. We bought that -- when we took that portfolio on, it was -- it came on our books at $10.6 billion. When we reported second quarter and the first 10 days, it had grown to $11.3 billion, and now it's looking at something in excess of $14 billion. So we benefited from very strong growth in the Costco portfolio. I don't think that I'd want to say that we can expect to have that type of sequential growth out into the future, but we'd still expect that portfolio to yield very good results. And as Mike and I have both said, the portfolio performance so far, the relationship with Costco, the overall relationship is just exceeding our expectations. Jim Mitchell : So would you say that in terms of the long-term accretion, obviously, the next few quarters, you won't see it. But long term, has it increased your expectation around accretion? John Gerspach : I'd say that it gives us greater confidence in pointing towards that ROA target of 225-plus basis points. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Fair. And then one last question on expenses. You gave guidance for next quarter, but as we think about next year, all the puts and takes to sort of the investment spending in Mexico, continued investment spend in retail and cards, how do we think about overall? Can you still kind of get efficiency savings to kind of fund a lot of that and keep expenses reasonably flat? Or how do we think about that? John Gerspach : Well, I don't want to commit to flat expenses yet for '17. We're going through our budget process now. I think we'll have a little bit more to say about '17 guidance when we report fourth quarter earnings. But again, we're not looking at a large-scale investment program going into next year. But there are investments that we want to make, and we think that they're important. But I -- we're not going to surprise you with some incredible amount of operating expense growth, but I'm not willing to commit to flat operating expenses at this point in time. Jim Mitchell : That's fair. But do you think it's on the repositioning and restructuring charges, legal charges? I think we're at 500 basis points year-to-date. You guys have been targeting 200. Do we start to see some at least the repositioning stuff come down? John Gerspach : I don't think I'm surprised that we're at -- that's not a number that -- Jim Mitchell : Maybe I'm doing the math wrong. I think that's what I calculated. John Gerspach : Yes. I don't think so. It's in the higher 200 at this point in time. And we'll likely -- what we said that we thought that we'd be at somewhere around 200 basis points, which is kind of where we were last year. This year, given the first quarter revenues, where they were, it's likely to be a little bit higher, maybe 225. Again, I don't want to say that we're going to stay in that 200 to 225 range next year, but I certainly don't see it growing to 500 basis points, Jim. No. Jim Mitchell : Right. I think I was doing it as a percentage of expenses. My apologies. John Gerspach : That\u2019s okay. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good afternoon. So John, in the media call, you had indicated that the equities business could increase its ranking to number 5 or number 6 globally, which, from what I can gather, implies about $3.5 billion to $4 billion of revenues versus the current run rate of about $2.8 billion. I was hoping you could speak to how you plan on closing the gap. Does it require additional investments from here as we think about the expense outlook going forward? Or can you close the gap with the current personnel and resources that you have in place right now? Mike Corbat : Steven, it's Mike. The numbers, I would say, as we look at kind of where we are, which is in 8, 9 position going, as John described, to 5 6 is, it varies a bit by quarter and will vary a bit based on some of the volumes. We're at about $250 million of revenue per quarter, so theoretically, about $1 billion of revenue a year. We feel that the investments that we've talked about in the investment -- in the equities business are largely done and primarily focused on really two key areas, one is an investment in terms of technology, which is critical, certainly to the future of the equities business and second, it's coming out of a resizing, rescaling that we've gone through in our equities business of making sure we've got the right people in the right positions and being out there and getting talent, both internally and externally, into the right seats. And I would describe that as largely done. So really, from here, it's up to us and up to our team to execute. I would say, and I don't put this out there as an excuse, but I think it is a reality that in a very challenged volume market, it's tough to take share. So we're getting the right signals in terms of some of the early KPIs around broker votes, around some of the feedback of some of the services that come back and tell you your ranking. We just haven't seen that yet translating or manifesting itself into significant changes. But I think you saw us a while back say we were going to do this in the investment bank, and we made improvements there. We said we were going to do this in the private bank, and we've made improvements there. And so this is one of those things. We're going to hold ourselves to our commitment to deliver. Our people are certainly committed around that. And obviously, it'd probably, in this kind of environment, just take a little bit of time. Steven Chubak : Thanks, Mike. I really do appreciate all the color there. And switching gears for a moment, just moving on to the capital side. I recognize some reluctance to speak to -- speak about a proposal that is not yet official. But based on some of the guidance that have been given with this new SEB calculation, I was hoping you could clarify, based on the latest CCAR results, where you think that minimum ultimately shakes out. And then given the volatility in CCAR results year-to-year, how you're thinking about the additional cushion you might want to maintain above any designated minimum. John Gerspach : Steven, I think that most of the analysts that published kind of captured where the SEB would turn out for us. I think most of the estimates call it less around an SEB of 270 basis points against a CCB of 250. And that's pretty much where we would put the number as well. We have not yet begun to really contemplate exactly how much cushion we need around that because, again, haven't seen the final NPR. So it's a little bit hard to talk about cushion against the speech. I'd just assume to see the rules before we actually get into public discussion about whether or not we need cushion. We also need to -- if this is the way it's going to be, you need then to also reassess just how variable those results are. So we'll look at all of those things. As I said, our initial view, based upon Governor Tarullo's speech, is that the proposal that he put forward seems to be manageable from our perspective. Steven Chubak : All right. Thanks, John. And then just one more quick one for me on looking at the capital denominators, it looks like your leverage exposure actually increased quarter-on-quarter even as assets and RWAs are flat. And given the strength in your SLR ratios, I know you've spoken to this in the past, where you're well above designated minimums and some of your European competitors might be more constrained. Are you seeing opportunities to deploy some of that additional balance sheet towards SLR-intensive opportunities maybe on the derivatives side specifically? John Gerspach : Yes, I wouldn't say it's focused so much on the derivatives side, but obviously, we've put some of our balance sheet capacity to work in areas like prime brokerage just to build it right back into your initial question as far as equities, where we're clearly putting more balance sheet to work there. And in this quarter, we had a little bit more, I think, increase in some of the off-balance sheet things, a few more commitments, et cetera, et cetera, but nothing staggering. And again, at 7 4, I think the word robust might even be an understatement. So -- Steven Chubak : I would agree, John. Well, thank you for taking my questions. Appreciate it. John Gerspach : Not a problem, Steven. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have two questions that relate to the trade-off between results today and results in the future. And the first relates to operating leverage, which this year is negative 400 basis points according to your slide three. That would be for both Citigroup and Citicorp. On the other hand, the linked quarter progress is decent. So I'm trying to figure out how you manage that trade-off between maybe a little less investment spend a day for better earnings versus you want it to protect the future. And I think, what I heard you say is you're in the late innings for the card investments but in the early innings for additional Mexican investments. John Gerspach : Yes, Mike, that is clearly a trade-off that we're constantly balancing. And we said going into the year that this year, because of the cards investment and the fact that the cards investments impact us both on a revenue as well as expense line, it was going to be particularly challenging this year from an operating leverage point of view. We're now -- you're now seeing the momentum come through. And again, we believe that we're going to continue to be able to share that momentum in the cards business. We've got the positive operating leverage now in our Asia consumer business and in our Mexico consumer business. And even though, certainly, in Mexico, this is two quarters in a row now of positive operating leverage. We've said that we intend to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in the fourth quarter. And then on a going-forward basis, the way we're looking at it right now, even with the investment spend that we want to do, we do believe that we'll be able to generate positive operating leverage in our Mexico consumer business in the next couple of years. Now I can only say that on an annual basis, I don't think anybody commit to quarterly operating leverage. There's always one or two things that happen. But our target next year is to produce positive operating leverage for the full year in Mexico. Mike Corbat : And Mike, on each of those, I would add to what John said. We talked about it in cards. We haven't necessary talked about it the same way in Mexico, but it holds true, that a lot of the cards spend we needed to do was catch-up, that we were in a position or weren't in a position through the crisis to be making those investments that we probably wanted to or need to, to be competitive in the U.S. And you've seen us do that. Now I would say the same largely holds true for Mexico. If you look at some of our Mexican competitors, whether they're Mexican-owned or owned by other national banks, nationalistic banks, I would argue that we've under invested in that franchise, and some of this is really catch-up. And to the latter part of your question or statement, I don't think we're necessarily forecasting that there's a lot more that we need to do from here. We think that the $1 billion over the next four years, primarily focused on technology, branches, ATMs, puts us back in a competitive position. Mike Mayo : So do you think that Citigroup will show positive operating leverage in 2017? John Gerspach : Mike, let us work through the budget, and then we'll talk to you when we announce fourth quarter earnings. Mike Mayo : And then the second question relating to the trade-off between today and the future. I know you don't like having a 7.8% ROTCE or 9.2% as you show on slide 19. What about accelerating the realization of some of those disallowed DTAs by selling appreciated assets such as Mexico? I mean, one choice is to invest in Mexico. Another choice is to sell Mexico, get the gain, redeploy the proceeds and the buyback, get the certain benefit today as opposed to less certain benefit down the road. John Gerspach : I think you framed it well in terms of today versus the future, and we remain consistently constructive in terms of Mexico at the broad level as well as our franchise in Mexico. And in a world, certainly, for my opinion, that we're growth in topline growth is going to remain tough, positions like that are to be treated well. And so we look at the intermediate to longer term prospects of our earnings and capital generation capacity or capability in Mexico as being very accretive to our shareholders. And as you've seen, we've got plenty of opportunity through our earnings and through the other things we're doing DTA and other to generate significant amounts of capital and to continue to address the denominator problem that we have in terms of continuing to take share count out. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Good morning. Thanks. I was wondering if you could just walk us through a little bit of just kind of your underlying outlook for credit outside of the comments you've made about the card normalization and just the ratios that are going to move upward as the book start to season. Can you just give us some color just maybe North America versus rest of the world? Any signals whatsoever of credit normalization? Any pockets of weakness? You did mention some GDP strengthening in a couple of specific markets. But just how does credit feel to you as you look forward? Mike Corbat : Right now, credit feels pretty good, I have to admit. We don't see -- again, we think that rates may inch up a little bit next year, but again, we're not seeing anything that would suggest some change in the cycle at this point in time. Part of that is, again, we're focused on a very specific target client, and so we don't exactly have this broad mass-market approach in most of our businesses, which might insulate us a little bit. But at this point in time, with the underwriting practices we have in place, we feel really good about credit in North America, in Latin America, in Asia. Ken Usdin : Okay, great. And then just on the ICG side, as far as just the business growth, loans have been certainly growing. A couple of peers are growing faster, but you have that non-U.S. business. So can you just talk about demand for credit and where you sit in terms of willingness to continue to push that directionally as well as you continue to grow treasury and trade and the other parts of ICG? John Gerspach : Yes. I think the way, Ken, that you characterized it there is probably appropriate in that loan demand is reasonable. But again, as we think about the extension of loans, we're facilitating a client relationship with the extension of that loan. And so as our clients need to expand and grow around the world, we're there to support them. And so as you look at a business model that supports largely Fortune 500, Fortune 5000 types of companies, and you look at global growth rates in the world, I think that the growth rates we're posting there make sense. And I think within the scheme of the environments are prudent and reasonable. And I would expect to continue to see, all things considered, similar types of growth rates into next year. If you look at the world next year, growth rates globally coming up a bit with probably parts of the emerging markets rebounding better or faster than parts of the developed economies. And I would expect loan growth to largely mimic that. Ken Usdin : Okay. Got it. Thank you, Mike Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Yes. Just a follow-up for me. John, you mentioned in the last call that the restriction in terms of taking market share or the capital restriction that we should think about is the GSIB surcharge. And in light of the continued market share opportunities and your efforts in the equities business, is there natural RWA roll-off that can continue to fund balance sheet allocation higher in ICG rather than taking it from something else that's revenue generating? I don't know if I quite articulated that question well. John Gerspach : Well, I -- the way I'm interpreting the question is does our focus on managing to a 3% GSIB surcharge, is that going to impact our ability to seize opportunities? Erika Najarian : Correct. John Gerspach : Yes, and it may, and quite frankly, in some cases, if the only thing that you view is being growth is growing revenues. Again, we're focused on improving our returns, returns on assets and specifically, return on ROTCE. And so as we look about where we're going to employ capital or where we're looking at growth opportunities, we do that with a focus on improvement in each of those areas. And so far, we haven't seen anything that would indicate that we need to step outside that 3% GSIB category right now in order to seize opportunities that are accretive to our ROA and our ROTCE. So maybe we've had to reapportion capital from something that is less -- produces lower ROA or lower ROTCE in order to move it into a higher ROA or ROTCE. But we think that's the right way to manage resources. Erika Najarian : Okay, great. And just a follow-up. I just wanted to make sure I understood your response to John's question correctly when he was asking about card. Just taking a step back, as we think about operating leverage in the North American consumer bank overall, should we interpret your answer as operating leverage is likely going to be more achievable in 2018, given the investment cycle? John Gerspach : Yes, and I'm trying to avoid getting specific in years and everything else. We're working through a lot of that right now. But in very broad terms, yes, it will be more likely to be in '18 than it will be in '17, just given everything else. But again, I'm not able to give specifics on any year at this point. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Hey, just a couple of questions. One is just to follow up a little bit on the investment spend in Mexico. I just -- I know I heard you indicate the branches and ATMs, et cetera. Is that getting it up to speed with what you've been doing globally? Or is there something else? I know that's moving it forward. Is that going to be at the cutting-edge of what you're doing globally? Maybe you could speak to also how you're tying together the network between the U.S. and Mexico as well. Mike Corbat : Sure, I'll start. So if you look at our footprint in Mexico, we've got about 1,500 branches in Mexico today, and I'd say a lot of that investment spend, if you went down there and looked, Betsy, is getting these branches up to where they should be from an appearance, from a technology perspective. The other piece is today, we\u2019ve got about 7,500 ATMs in Mexico. We want to do two things. We not only want to move towards smart ATMs as Mexico and Mexico banking move more towards digital. We also want to increase the number of ATMs. And what we've talked about is going from 7,500 to 10,000. And at the same time, going to the earlier part of your question, you'll see us continuing to employ our strategy around branch optimization. And the introduction of smart branches gives us that flexibility that you've seen us using in Asia, in the U.S. and other parts of the world around that. And so it's kind of a combination of those. And the other piece we talked about is the technology piece, and that technology piece really serves our ability to continue to bring the platforms of the historic Citi together with Banamex, now Citibanamex, and trying to make sure we're offering the best of each to each. Betsy Graseck : And that's within Mexico, the Citibanamex, the Citi piece in Mexico and the Banamex piece in Mexico coming together, not Citi U.S. linked up with Mexico Banamex? Mike Corbat : No. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then Mexico's had real-time banking for a while. I know that here in the U.S., we're beginning to launch that. I know you -- there's a press release I saw that you were going to be joining Clear Exchange. So maybe if you could speak a little bit to what your goals are there for real-time banking. And is there anything on money transfer in general between the two countries as well? John Gerspach : Well, starting at one, I don't have the statistics in front of me. But when you look at branch transactions in Mexico and the way our customers like to bank, they're very, I guess, for lack of a better term, branch-dependent or they really favor coming into the branches. And so the move towards digital is occurring certainly slower than the U.S. or parts of Asia. But we want to make sure we're there on the forefront in terms of having that technology in place and having to have the ability to convert as people care to do that. And we think that'll continue to happen over time, although, for right now, it feels like it's certainly occurring at a slower pace than the rest of the world. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just on, like, is there anything there with money transfer between the two countries or not really? John Gerspach : Well, of course, there's money transfer between the two countries. I don't know of anything and Clear Ex [ph] that necessarily promotes that. And obviously, around money-management across that border, you got to be smart about knowing your customer and your systems you have in place around KYC AML. And clearly, we continue to make investments on that front. And as part of not just Mexico but who we are, we are a large mover of money around the world, and certainly, Mexico's one of those places where it's the same. Betsy Graseck : Okay. I appreciate that. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: I'm actually all set. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Matt Burnell : Thanks for taking my call. Just a couple of quickies, perhaps. John, how are you all thinking about the potential for capital markets disruption from the beginning of the Brexit negotiations? There's been a lot of commentary about potential costs, but I guess I'm just curious on the revenue side, how you are thinking about -- how that might play out over the next couple of quarters. Mike Corbat : Matt, it's Mike. From -- we don't have a lot of answers right now. And as the Prime Minister came out, I guess, it was last week or 1.5 weeks ago, Article 50 won't be invoked until March of next year. That then starts to clock on a 2-year window. And I think it's our own belief, based on a series of elections in Europe, the combination of France and Germany, that information is probably going to be more back-end loaded than front-end loaded. And so what we've been working for is making sure, as that information comes out, we're in a position to continue to service our clients really no matter what. And when you think about our franchise, we not only have a sizable franchise in U.K., we also operate in 20 of the 27 EU countries. And so we've got flexibility. We've got our passport bank already established in Ireland. We've got the pipes connected, to, certainly, the larger countries within the EU. So we've got flexibility around that. And what we've said in the meetings that I've had with both U.K. and other European officials, we're going to watch and see this unfold, but our primary goal here is to make sure that in an undisrupted way, we can continue to serve our clients. And we think our structure today gives us time and flexibility. And when the time is right, we'll make a decision of ultimately what we're going to do. But we'd like to benefit as much information as possible before we make that decision, and we just don't have it today. Matt Burnell : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. And just, John, just a question on the card business and the investments you're making there. There have obviously been a couple of new products that have been either introduced or revamped in the U.S. market over the last quarter or so. I guess, I'm curious how you're thinking about the competitive landscape. And does that potentially put some greater pressure on you to increase investment relative to rewards in the card space? And does that have an effect on potential returns on that business over the next couple of years? John Gerspach : Yes, the cards business has always been competitive. So people introducing new products is nothing new. One of the new products that got introduced appears to be an answer -- an attempt to answer how our Prestige product, which has been out there now for maybe 5 years or so, and we still think that the Prestige card that we have is a mentally strong offering and should withstand the test. So we don't see anything there in some of these new issuance, these new introductions that would cause us to change our view as to where we can drive the cards business over time. Matt Burnell : Okay. And then just finally for me, in terms of the net interest margin, you expect that to be stable in the fourth quarter? Last quarter, you had anticipated that Costco might have a modest benefit to the margin. Where is the change in the outlook there? Is it just cash balances or is it something else? John Gerspach : Yes, you hit it, you hit it. When we -- on the second quarter NIM, as you remember, was 286 basis points. And the guidance we put out suggested that we thought third quarter NIM could grow to 290 basis points. And as we said, embedded in this assumption was that we'd get about a 3 basis point lift from Costco. And we thought an additional 3 basis point improvement by normalizing average cash balances. And we knew that we had a 2 basis point drag coming from the increase at a higher FDIC assessment that all the large banks got. So that's sort of how we got to the 290. So then you ask, okay, so what actually happened? Well, we got the 3 basis points from Costco. As a matter of fact, our loan book actually contributed a 4 basis point improvement to NIM. We got the additional FDIC assessment so that did cost us too. But as we mentioned in some of our commentary, we took on additional deposits to support client activity, and therefore, we just didn't get the improvement that we were seeking from lowering the average cash or HQLA. And then finally, we had a 2 basis point hit with the lower NIM on our trading book. And the trading book NIM is always difficult to forecast. So 4 basis points up on loans, 2 basis points down on trading, 2 basis points down from FDIC, flat. Matt Burnell : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi. Good afternoon. I have a quick question on the Costco. You mentioned the new account openings. But can you give some color on the progression of those new account openings? Like, are you at a run rate right now where you can say this is about, on average, what we're opening per week or per month? John Gerspach : No, I think we're still in the early days of this. Obviously, as I mentioned a little bit earlier, Costco had not been able to issue cards for 7 months or so. So there's been a large pent-up demand for these cards. So I certainly would have want to put the first 3.5 months and generating 800,000 new accounts as a new run rate. But it is -- it still is generating new accounts at a faster rate than we thought it was going to. And just like with everything else with the Costco portfolio, I think we'll know more and be able to give you a better sense as to sustained run rates of growth, et cetera, over the course of the next two to three quarters. It's 1.5 quarters, not even a quarter, it's 4 months today, just about since we took over the book. And it takes a while to get into the normal rhythm so you can actually have an understanding as to the way the portfolio is going to operate. And as we develop that level of comfort and understanding, we'll be happy to provide you with more color. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then I had just one -- a different question on the -- you mentioned that there was an improvement in the yield in Asia. Can you maybe give some background on what's allowing you to have improved deal? Is it a change in geographies? Or is it just new loans coming out at higher yields? John Gerspach : Well, again, we've been in the process of repositioning the cards portfolio in Asia. We got a lower amount of promotional balances now. So that's enabled us to -- some of that is because the promotional balances have run off, but a lot of that is because these promotional balances now have converted into full rate loans. And that is really, I'd say, the lion\u2019s share of the yield improvement that we're seeing in that portfolio. Brian Kleinhanzl : Can you give what percentage is promotional over remaining balance? John Gerspach : No, I can't go that deep right now. I'm sorry. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Hi. I was checking in on the DTA. It didn't seem like we get much of a pull-down in that this quarter and just was curious why not. John Gerspach : The underlying business has used about $300 million of DTA. And then given the movement in OCI, as we saw a little bit of the impact of slightly higher rates but more important, and equally as important, the strengthening of the dollar against certain key currencies, that wiped out the -- essentially wiped out the improvement that we got in DTA from the earnings. But again, I think, on a year-to-date basis, we're doing okay and we're in line with where we said we were going to be. And don't forget, when it comes to utilizing the DTA, for us, it's really being focused on utilizing the FTCs, and we remain on track to utilizing substantial portion of the FTC this year. Marty Mosby : CET1 kind of growth in the ratio, to kind of roll back 18 months, you were kind of increasing about 30 basis points per quarter. Last year, it was really down to about 20 basis points per quarter. And then this quarter, with the accelerated repurchase, you're down to about 10 basis points per quarter. Is that just kind of a normal progression? And as you kind of think about that, you kind of round out at around 13% and then you start to kind of stabilize. And is that just kind of a maybe just a top looking down kind of approach of kind of how you kind of seeing yourself kind of landing in that ratio? John Gerspach : Yes, I'd say, Marty, that what you're seeing is exactly what we want to achieve over time, which is to be able to return the capital that we're generating to our shareholders. And so over time, we'd like to be able to continue to see that, again, that CET1 ratio, either staying where it is or perhaps as we get more insight into some of the CCAR rules and some of the scenarios, even have a somewhat lower CET1 ratio. I think that's consistent with our view towards increasing the amount of capital return. Marty Mosby : And then just lastly, real quick question, on the loan loss build, loan loss reserve build in the consumer bank, you allocate most of that to Costco and to the regulatory guideline change. Could you give us a more specific number just for that? Because that really is kind of a setup in a sense of a change or unusual build that wouldn't recur as you move forward. John Gerspach : Yes, I'd say we kind of -- we try to break that 450 build in cards out into thirds. One third was Costco. Another third was seasoning and volume growth. And then the last third was predominantly due to the impact of those regulatory guidelines. So it's something less than the 150 of the other third. If you want to think about that as being something in the 120, 110 [ph] rage, I'm not going to argue with you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon, guys. Can you guys share with us -- clearly, the oil markets have stabilized dramatically from the first quarter. Are you guys seeing any opportunities to grow the energy business at this point? Or how do you feel about your energy business, understanding that the credit has stabilized and is trying to improve in many areas? Mike Corbat : Gerard, I'd say that, yeah, we do see some opportunities. Clearly, as oil has stabilized and stabilized somewhere around the $50 area, we've seen the combination of M&A conversations to combination of financing, refinancing conversations and overall activity and people starting to engage coming back. Again, as we've described, our customer or client base remains consistent to. We are largely a multinational, global-type client energy player throughout the vertical. And we're going to remain consistent to that. We think there's some opportunity for us to go back and you look historically, we've had a strong energy franchise. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then onto deposits. You guys saw some very good deposit growth in the ICG business in the quarter on a sequential basis. Did the change in the money market mutual funds have any impact on that growth? Mike Corbat : Not that we can see. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then finally, John, you pointed out that the trading markets, of course, are seasonal in the fourth quarter. Last year, I think, for you, folks, it was down about just under 20%. The year before that, those numbers declined 30% sequentially. Do you have any sense on what this year is shaping up? Well, you recognize they will be down, but any magnitude? Mike Corbat : No. I think if you look historically, you run the last two years, you'd be looking at something in the low 20% range as being kind of the norm as to whether or not this year, we're going to get that type of reduction. I don't know. But December usually is a pretty light month, and there's certainly nothing to indicate right now that, that's going to change. So I still think that you need to expect some seasonal reduction in fourth quarter trading revenues. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Appreciate the help. Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I was just looking for a clarification. You had mentioned there wouldn't be positive operating leverage until 2018, but I think you're referring to a specific area as opposed to the firm. Mike Corbat : Mike, that's exactly right. The question was had to do with North America consumer and whether or not it was more likely that we'd have positive operating leverage in '18 versus '17, okay? Mike Mayo : Thank you. Operator : Thank you, we have no further questions in the queue at this time. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you all for joining us today. That's been a busy morning. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Geena. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2015 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.6 billion for the fourth quarter of 2016 or $1.14 per share. For the full-year, we generated nearly $15 billion in net income or $4.72 a share. We finished the year strongly; and we carried that momentum into 2017. We drove revenue growth in our businesses and demonstrated strong expense discipline across the firm. We achieved a full-year Citicorp efficiency ratio of 58% as we targeted while again increasing our loans and deposits. We had excellent performance across our institutional businesses, especially in fixed income and equities, with revenue up 31% for the quarter and 10% for the entire year despite the difficult start in the first quarter. Treasury and Trade Solutions generated year-over-year revenue, margin growth for the 12th consecutive quarter. We successfully navigated the volatility in the energy sector, earlier in the year resulting in solid credit performance consistent with our target client strategy. In Global Consumer, our U.S. branded cards business continues to see the early benefits from the Costco portfolio and our other cards products also delivered revenue growth. Internationally, we again generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both Asia and Mexico. And we continued our investment in Mexico, where we had scale, a strong brand position, and the opportunity to drive improved wallet share and returns. 2016 was a very important year for Citi in several respects. This marks the last time, we'll report the results of Citi Holdings separately. We will end this chapter much differently than we began. At its peak, it had over $800 billion in assets generating sometimes multibillion dollar losses in a single quarter. Today Holdings $54 billion of assets are only 3% of Citigroup's balance sheet and for the 10th quarter in a row, Holdings was profitable with $87 million of net income. The results of Citigroup today are driven by the core franchise and we no longer need to distinguish between core and non-core. In short, the restructuring is over, Citi is a unique and resilient franchise and after a lot of hard work, we will focus on further optimizing its performance to the benefit of our shareholders. We won't take our eye off the ball on expenses and are committed to investing only in areas where we're going to drive improved returns. And in fact, we're beginning to produce the capital returns our investors expect and deserve. In 2016, we returned nearly $11 billion in capital to our shareholders. This reflected the impact of our original capital plan as well as the incremental increase we announced in November. That raises the total return to $12.2 billion for the 2016 CCAR cycle. And you're seeing the results, buybacks of common stock, a core element of the plan drove down the common shares outstanding by 181 million shares or 6% during the year and our tangible book value increased to $64.57, up 7% for the year. Even with this capital return, we ended the year with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.5%, 40 basis points higher than we started the year. And as you can see, the capability of this franchise to both generate and return very significant amounts of capital is quite powerful. We move closer to our aspiration to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. The feedback we received from the FED and the FDIC in our resolution plan was another significant milestone for our firm during the year. And we are committed to improving not just our return of, but our return on capital. Excluding the capital supporting disallowed DTA, we generated a 9% return on our tangible common equity in 2016 and given our trajectory, we expect to reach at least 10% return on our TCE excluding disallowed DTA in 2018. Looking forward, economic sentiment is clearly become more positive since the U.S. election. In general, the benefit from pro-growth policies as well as our clients. In addition, we see a path for more consistent interest rate increases and revenue opportunities in areas such as infrastructure investment. And while corporate tax reform may lead to a writing down of a proportion of our deferred tax assets, it should also result in higher net income and improved returns. At this point, no one actually knows what would become U.S. policy. But I believe that there are pent up and capital investment opportunities which corporates are poised to act on given the right circumstances. This could boost GDP growth in the U.S. and beyond given the significance of our economy globally. So we enter the year with a healthy amount of optimism about the prospects of growth strengthening. John will go through our presentation and then we'll be happy to answer your questions. John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citigroup results. Revenues of $17 billion in the fourth quarter declined 9% from the prior year and expenses decreased 9% as well each driven primarily by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, as well as the impact of foreign exchange translation. In our core Citicorp franchise revenues grew 6% year-over-year, while expenses declined 2% and in constant dollars revenues grew 8% versus 1% growth in expenses. Citigroup credit costs improved significantly driven by improvement in both ICG and Citi Holdings, partially offset by higher credit costs in consumer reflecting the loan growth as well as the shift from reserve releases last year to reserve builds in North America cards. Net income of $3.6 billion in the fourth quarter grew 4% from last year and earnings per share of $1.14 grew 8% including the benefit of share buybacks, which drove 5% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. On a full-year basis, we earn nearly $15 billion or $4.72 per share with a drag from higher preferred dividends in 2016 more than offset by lower shares outstanding. And our full-year return on tangible common equity was 7.6% on a reported basis or 9% excluding the TCE supporting disallowed DTA. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $624 billion as 6% growth in Citicorp was partially offset by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings and deposits grew 4% to $929 billion. On Slide 4, we showed a split between Citicorp and Citi Holdings. Citicorp was again the predominant driver of profitability in the fourth quarter contributing $3.5 billion or 98% of total net income. Pre-tax earnings of $5.1 billion in Citicorp grew by over $1.3 billion year-over-year mostly driven by higher revenues and lower credit costs in our institutional franchise. And on a full-year basis, despite the difficult first quarter, we were able to deliver an efficiency ratio in Citicorp of 58% in line with our revised goal for the year. Turning to Citi Holdings. We earned a small pre-tax profit in the fourth quarter with revenues, expenses, and cost of credit each declining significantly as we continue to wind down the portfolio. We reduced Citi Holdings to $54 billion of assets at year-end or 3% of total Citigroup and we have signed agreements in place to reduce this amount by an additional $9 billion. On a full-year basis, Citi Holdings contributed $600 million of net income, which we do not expect to recur in 2017. On Slide 5, we show the full-year 2016 EBIT walk for Citigroup. In total EBIT declined by over $3 billion from 2015 to 2016. Roughly half of which was attributable to lower gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings and a modest impact from FX translation. The remaining EBIT decline occurred in the core Citicorp franchise. However this comparison includes losses on mark-to-market loan hedges in 2016 as compared to gains in the prior year, as well as certain previously disclosed one-time items that also affect the variance, including a gain on the sale of our merchant acquiring business in Mexico in 2015 and the write-down of our investment in Venezuela in the first quarter of 2016. Together, these items drove a nearly $1.3 billion negative variance in the full-year EBIT comparison all of which was reflected in revenues. Excluding these items, Citicorp revenue increased 3% year-over-year in constant dollars or over $1.7 billion driven by growth in fixed income markets, Treasury and Trade Solutions, North America Card, and Mexico Consumer revenues. And our operating margin grew by nearly $400 million including the impact of significant investments in our North America cards franchise that have not yet fully matured. Of course credit cost also increased in 2016 as we grew loans in our target segments, including the acquisition of the Costco portfolio. However, most of the year-over-year variance of roughly $700 million in 2016 reflects the absence of nearly $400 million of reserve releases that occurred in 2015 as credit normalized in North America cards. Turning now to each business, Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer banking. Total revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 4% from last year reflecting lower mortgage revenues as well as the impact of certain consumer incentives offered in coordination with the launch of our enhanced retail segmentation strategy. During the quarter, we launched our enhanced Citigold integrated wealth management offering for the Affluent segment in the U.S. We also launched Citi Priority for the emerging Affluent segment and we executed significant enhancements to our mobile banking platform across all our consumer segments. We continue to rationalize our physical footprint down 7% to 723 branches at year-end, while doubling our free ATM access and we continue to grow volumes with average loans and checking deposits up 6% and 9% respectively. Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion grew 15% reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as modest organic growth. Excluding Costco, we generated 2% revenue growth as we have largely absorbed the impact of higher acquisition and reward costs and are beginning to benefit from organic volume growth. Turning to Costco, the results continue to be very encouraging. To-date, we have generated over 1 million new Costco card accounts and over $52 billion of purchase sales and loans continue to grow in the fourth quarter ending the year at nearly $17 billion. In total, we grew end of period branded card loans by 11% or over $8 billion in the second half of 2016 across our proprietary products, Costco, and other co-brand portfolios. This reflects strong engagement with our existing cardholders as well as significant new account balance growth. New accounts typically feature promotional rates for a period of time. So we would expect revenue growth to follow once these balances mature and begin to accrue at full rate. Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were roughly flat to last year as loan growth offset the absence of two portfolios we sold in the first quarter as well as the impact of renewing and extending several partnerships. Total expenses for North America consumer were $2.5 billion, up 6% from last year mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued marketing investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally, credit costs of $1.2 billion were down sequentially but increased $370 million from last year. Net credit losses increased to $1.1 billion mostly driven by Costco, organic volume growth and seasoning, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections and cards and we've built a $113 million of net loan loss reserves during the quarter compared to a release in the prior year driven by the ongoing impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition as well as organic volume growth. We continue to expect the full-year NCL rate to be in the range of around 280 basis points in branded cards and 435 basis points in Retail Services for 2017 with some variability by quarter. On Slide 7, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. Net income grew significantly from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses and stable cost of credit. In total, revenues grew 5% and expenses were down 1% versus last year. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by continued momentum in retail banking with average loans and deposits increasing 7% and 13% respectively. Cards revenues declined slightly from last year. However we saw ongoing strength in account acquisitions, purchase sales, and average loan growth which should translate to sustainable revenue growth by the second half of 2017. And finally, expenses declined 5% year-over-year in Latin America as ongoing investment spending was more than offset by efficiency savings as well as the impact of one-time items in the prior year period. We continue to execute on our investment plans this quarter in Mexico, modernizing our branches and ATMs, enhancing our digital capabilities, and upgrading our core operating platforms. These infrastructure investments should improve operating efficiency and returns over time. And we still expect to maintain positive operating leverage each year throughout the investment period. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 4% year-over-year driven by improvement in wealth management and cards. Wealth management revenues grew 18% from last year reflecting better investor sentiment and continued positive AUM influence. And cards remain positive as well with revenues up 4% driven by a continued improvement in yields and abating regulatory headwinds. Expenses in Asia grew 2% from last year, driven by investment spending, partially offset by efficiency savings. On Slide 8, we show more detail on our Asia consumer portfolios. Starting with retail loans, as we've discussed previously, we have been working to optimize the returns on this portfolio by shifting away from lower yielding mortgage loans and derisking the commercial portfolio, while growing higher return personal loans. Over the past year we have increased net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans in the retail portfolio by 13 basis points, largely offsetting the revenue impact from a 7% decline in average loans driven by mortgages and the runoff of certain non-core products. As you can see on the slide, personal loan balances have stabilized in recent quarters as underlying growth in certain markets has been offset by regulatory headwinds in others. These headwinds are abating and therefore, we believe, we can drive modest growth in total retail loans from this new base in 2017, while continuing to improve the yield on the portfolio. And turning to cards, while average card loans were flat year-over-year, we have improved net interest revenue as a percentage of average loans by roughly 40 basis points, as we have shifted a larger portion of our balances to higher yielding revolving loans. We also expect to generate loan growth in cards going forward as we invest to drive higher account acquisition and usage. We expect these initiatives, along with our continued focus on wealth management to drive sustained growth in Asia in 2017 and beyond. Slide 9 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail, across both cards and retail banking. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter. The increase in the NCL rate in North America mostly reflects the impact of the Costco portfolio, seasonality, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections and cards. Credit trends in Asia consumer remains stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America remained favorable at 415 basis points. While we continue to believe the NCL rate in Latin America should settle closer to 4.5% as the portfolio seasons, it will likely remain below this level for the first half of 2017, reflecting strong credit quality and continued loan delinquency rates. On Slide 10, we showed a year-over-year EBIT walk for consumer for the second half of the year. As we noted last quarter, the first half of 2016 was affected by several factors including the comparison to much stronger prior year periods in Wealth Management. The early stage of our organic cards investments, the expenses we were absorbing on Costco before we had the full benefit of the revenues on that portfolio, and the impact of significant repositioning charges in the first quarter of the year. As we moved into the third quarter you could see momentum building again in our consumer business and this continued through year-end. In total, we generated 6% underlying revenue growth with a 5% increase in expenses in the second half of 2016, driving growth in our operating margin of over $450 million year-over-year. Of course, credit costs also increased, reflecting volume growth and the absence of prior period reserve releases. But overall we feel good about the trajectory of our consumer business based on our performance in the second half of the year. Turning now to the institutional clients group on Slide 11. Net income of $2.5 billion in the fourth quarter grew substantially from last year on higher revenues, lower operating expenses, and lower cost of credit. Revenues of $8.3 billion grew 11% from last year reflecting solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.4 billion grew 3% from last year. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.1 billion grew 6% in constant dollars driven by continued momentum with new and existing clients. We saw strong fee growth, higher volumes, and improved spreads in certain geographies, resulting in the 12th consecutive quarter of revenue and margin growth in TTS. Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were flat to last year and higher debt underwriting revenues offset declines in equity underwriting and M&A. Private Bank revenues of $731 million were up 6% year-over-year, mostly driven by loan growth and improved spreads and corporate lending revenues of $462 million grew 7%, mostly reflecting the impact of loan sale activity in the prior year period. Total markets and security services revenues of $4.1 billion, grew 24% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3 billion were up 36% with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Rates and currencies grew roughly 30% year-over-year, reflecting strong client activity and a more favorable environment continuing on the positive momentum that begin to build in the second quarter and spread product revenues grew nearly 40% this quarter also reflecting strong client engagement. Turning to equities, revenues grew 15% year-over-year driven by an improvement in derivatives along with improved trading activity overall, particularly post the U.S. election. Finally, in security services, revenues grew 3% year-over-year as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes, and improved spreads more than offset the impact of divestitures. Total operating expenses of $4.6 billion, were down 5% year-over-year driven by efficiency savings, lower repositioning costs, and a benefit from FX translation. For full-year 2016 excluding the impact of severance our comp ratio was 26% and cost of credit was substantially lower year-over-year reflecting stabilization in commodities as oil prices continue to recover from record lows. On a full-year basis our institutional business earned nearly $10 billion with solid progress in our network-driven businesses. TTS grew 8% for the full-year in constant dollars. Security services grew 6% on the same basis excluding the impact of business divestitures, and rates and currencies grew 22% in 2016 accelerating from the 5% growth we generated in 2015. We maintained our expense discipline absorbing higher volumes without significant incremental cost. And we managed effectively through the volatility in oil prices and other factors this year, resulting in favorable credit performance consistent with our high quality target client segments. On Slide 12, we show the year-over-year EBIT walk for ICG demonstrating the strong momentum we have generated since the difficult start of the year. We saw broad-based growth this year across our accrual and transaction services businesses. And in market-sensitive franchises our strength in fixed income more than offset the lower market activity in both investment banking and equities. The most significant year-over-year drag comes from other revenue items, including the impact of the Venezuela write-downs in the first quarter as well as the mark-to-market losses on loan hedges driven by spread movements. Slide 13 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenue decreased year-over-year due to the absence of both the contribution from our equity stake in China Guangfa Bank, which we sold last quarter as well as gains on asset sales in the prior year. And expenses decreased, mostly reflecting lower repositioning cost, partially offset by higher regulatory spend. On Slide 14 we show Citigroup's net interest revenue and margin trends. With net interest revenue continuing to grow year-over-year in Citicorp while Citi Holdings declined with the reduction in assets. Citicorp net interest revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter and 5% for the full-year in constant dollars, driven by loan growth as well as the net impact of higher short-term rates. Looking forward, we believe Citicorp net interest revenue will continue to grow in 2017 with a roughly $500 million impact from the December 2016 rate hike and a $900 million benefit from loan growth and mix including the impact of our card investments maturing in the second half of 2017. However this upside should be partially offset by an increase in funding costs of roughly $100 million as we absorb the full-year impact of our TLAC related benchmark debt issuance as well as a roughly $100 million impact from lower day count. Turning to Citi Holdings. We would expect the net interest revenue of $2 billion in 2016 to decline again by roughly half in 2017. But this decline should be neutral to earnings as we continue to expect this portfolio to operate at around breakeven. Of course, we could see some fluctuations from FX translation but these are the underlying trends we expect, going into 2017. Turning to NIM, our net interest margin of 279 basis points in the fourth quarter declined by roughly 7 basis points sequentially, driven mostly by lower trading NIM, higher funding costs, and the higher mix of promotional rate balances in cards. And looking to next year, we expect the net interest margin to remain roughly flat to the full-year of 286 basis points as improvement in the core franchise offsets the continued decline in the Legacy Holdings portfolio. On Slide 15 we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined slightly to 12.5% driven by OCI movements and $4.7 billion of capital return during the quarter, partially offset by earnings and a decline in risk-weighted assets. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.2% and our tangible book value per share grew by 7% year-over-year to $64.57 per share despite the OCI pressure this quarter, in part driven by a 6% reduction in our shares outstanding. To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook. As a reminder, we are holding Citi Holdings into Corp/Other starting this quarter. So I'll reference total Citigroup results going forward. Starting with our assumptions around the environment. We ended 2016 with a far more favorable backdrop than we started the year, in terms of client engagement, capital markets activity, and commodity prices and we expect the environment to remain broadly favorable going forward. But our base case does not assume any additional rate hikes in 2017. At a high level, we expect to deliver modest revenue growth and an improved efficiency ratio for total Citigroup, even as we continue to invest in the franchise and wind down the non-core assets that will now be reported in Corp/Other. In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage on a full-year basis in constant dollars in both Asia and Mexico even as we execute on our investment plans for each region. And in North America, we expect the revenue growth as well. In the first half of 2017 this growth should mostly reflect the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition. In the second half we expect growth to be driven organically as our branded cards investments mature and more loans begin to accrue at full rate. However mortgage revenues will likely continue to be a drag on year-over-year results in a higher rate environment. In our institutional business, we expect continued growth in our accrual and transaction services businesses. We feel good about the strength of our franchises in fixed income and Investment Banking where clients remain engaged and our results will reflect overall market environment. And we remain focused on improved execution and wallet share gains in equities where we continue to see a significant revenue opportunity over time. We believe we can drive an improvement in the efficiency ratio from 59% for total Citigroup in 2016 to roughly 58% in 2017 as we continue to automate processes and enhance our digital capabilities. Our original target of achieving an efficiency ratio in the mid-50 range for Citicorp remains in place now for total Citigroup and we believe we could operate within that range as early as 2018. Citigroup cost of credit should be somewhat higher in 2017 driven by loan growth and seasoning and our tax rate should be in the range of around 31%. We also expect continued significant EPS benefits from our share buybacks during the year. As Mike described earlier, we believe we're on the right path to improve our return on tangible common equity excluding the capital supporting disallowed DTA from 9% in 2016 to at least 10% in 2018 and we should demonstrate progress towards that goal this year as we continue to drive efficiencies across the franchise and begin to see the full benefit of our cards investments in the second half of the year. We continue to believe that we are capable of producing a return on tangible common equity of roughly 14% over time as we previously disclosed. And an important milestone on that path will be achieving at least a 10% ROTCE on the full amount of our tangible common equity, which we believe we could achieve as early as 2019 depending on the rate environment as well as the outcome of tax reform. With that Mike and I will be happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey Mike, it seems like this was you've been the most optimistic on this call than you have and I think since you started. How do we think about that in the context of sort of that low modest revenue growth that you talked about, is it simply just a drag from holdings or you just being conservative? Just try to get a sense of that dichotomy? Mike Corbat : I think if you look at the business coming out of the fourth quarter and the momentum we're carrying you could tail that I would choose to split one as I look at our institutional businesses and whether it's rates and currency spread product TTS, Private Bank check them off. We think we are extremely well-positioned, very engaged and right now what we see, think about rates and currencies as an example up 22% for full-year 2016 coming off of up 5% 2015, 27% growth in two years off of two rate increases. So depending as we have said, we obviously did our plan earlier in the cycle and the early fall but right now my guess is consensus is somewhere two to three rate increases, we've got some elections and we've got some things. So long story short, we feel like the institutional business across the board markets banking, private banking all those things are pretty well set. On the consumer side of things, the second half growth and positive operating leverage in international was what we promised and what we delivered. I think if you look from a North America perspective, the investments that we made in terms of getting Costco up and going and John talked to the numbers there, $6 billion of loan growth there, $52 billion of purchase sales in the six months and million new customers. We're going to have to overcome some of those promotional balances. But the good news is we've got to overcome those that are there. And so by the second half of next year, we should see that really starting to kick in and from the branded cards perspective, again we started those investments and we've seen the revenue growth, we've seen kind of all the positive indicators there but we know that's just a bit of a longer story but the investments we're making in digital and those things across the board feel like we're well-positioned. What we don't know and I'm sure we'll get to it exactly how to think about what policy and what policy changes are going to be and really what that means for growth. Right now, so I would argue that we're obviously with no rate increases, we're certainly behind the times in conservative but we feel very good about the way the franchise is positioned. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And may be just a follow-up on the efficiency ratio target for 2018 at 55, mid-50s for the whole Citigroup. Is there what kind of a revenue growth are you embedding, it doesn't sound like a lot but I just want to make sure I understand is this absolute cost cutting or is it sort of expectations of some revenue growth with flat expenses. How do we think about that? Mike Corbat : I think it's all the pieces; it's the combination of revenues, it's a combinations of continued expense discipline. As John mentioned, it's a combination of technology and digitization so in there we're in essence really pulling all of the levers to get there. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. I will stop there. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Just wanted to kick things off and really it's little bit of media question on the DTA. But it's a topic that a lot people have focused on and John I noted, I know in the past you had spoken to under a territorial tax system with a 10 percentage point reduction in the corporate tax rate that that would result in a tangible book value right down somewhere in the vicinity of $12 billion, although the capital hit would be substantially less closer to $2 billion. And those impacts that you have relate to timing DTA specifically and I wanted to better understand how the foreign tax credits might be affected because that is an area where some have suggested under a territorial system they could potentially be at risk. John Gerspach : So let me just update only because numbers have changed a little bit since when I spoke at that conference back in November, I think it was. But at that point, what I would say right now is again just to reiterate we end the year with about $47 billion of deferred tax assets. And within that there's about $40 billion that are really U.S. federal DTAs, within that $40 billion there is about $3 billion of NOLs which you got 20-year life and there's $14 billion now of foreign tax credits that again you generally have a 10-year life. So that leaves $23 billion that really comes about as a result of timing differences and therefore have no specific time use or limitation. So those are the -- that's just the, I want to give you the context on some of the updated numbers. Everything you said when I spoke at that conference again, I went through a whole series of things including how you might calculate rate impact saying that the largest impact would be on timing differences and just to again update some of the things that I talked about if we now dropped to a 25% tax rate with the territorial system, we end up with still no reduction to our territory -- to our I'm sorry we end over combined with a territory system the P&L hit would be about $12 billion, which I think is consistent with what I quoted back in November. And that $12 billion would probably have about $3 billion reduction would amount to a $3 billion reduction in our regulatory capital and the change from the $4 billion that I talked about back in November just reflects subsequent changes due to allowable, disallowable DTA mostly coming out of the OCI. So again as I said those are all very, very raw estimates. Within that again, our belief is that we continue to expect FTC carryforwards to continue to exist post-tax reform. And under the law, FTC carryforwards can be used because there is a provision in the law that allows 50% of domestic income to be treated as foreign income. So that's in the law and we don't think, so again with the 25% tax rate and a territorial system, we don't see any hit to our ability to use FTCs. Steven Chubak : Thanks, John. Appreciate all the detail there and then just one question on some of the, on the targets on efficiency and ROTCE that you outlined, relative to expectation some of the messaging is certainly encouraging , particularly on the ROTCE target for 2019 of around 10%. I don't know if on that target contemplated a write-down in tangible book value as we think about tax policy impacts or is that based on the current steady state that exist today. John Gerspach : Well, I think that absent tax reform that we will probably get to that 10% number late in 2019 with tax reform it would be for the full-year. So there is -- there is some element in tax reform that's baked into getting into that 10% number in 2019 but it's relatively small. Steven Chubak : All right, I appreciate the color, John. Thanks for taking my questions. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. My first question, hi this is a clarification question, you mentioned that the base upon which you were giving your outlook had no further rate hikes contemplated. I just want to make sure that the -- the mid 50s efficiency ratio guidance for 2018 reflects the maturity of your investments and so any further rate hikes are structurally higher curve is that potentially upside to that mid-50s target? John Gerspach : In 2018 we've assumed one additional rate increase around the middle of the year. So I'd just to be totally transparent. There is a very, very small impact of higher rates that we've got baked into 2018 but it's a half-year of a 25 basis point increase so it doesn't really drive a lot. Erika Najarian : Got it. And second question is one of your primary competitors mentioned late last year that we could be seeing the bottom in global fixed income pools and you mentioned that the current run rate for fixed income is about 35% from peak although saying that, half of that is permanently gone and I\u2019m wondering if you contemplate your franchise, do you agree with those numbers in terms of what the potential structural upside could be from here? John Gerspach : Yes, we've long talked about being a shrinking pie. So I think that that's fairly consistent. I think it probably shrunk a little bit more than any of us thought it would during the latter part of 2015 and perhaps the early part of 2016. But again, we don't anticipate fixed to be a pool of revenues that is going to exhibit tremendous growth rates. I do think that there is potential , if you just take a look at fixed in the last say half of 2016 the pool probably grew in the second half of 2016 and shrunk a bit more in the first half of 2016. So again, I mean we are not looking at fixed some expanding pool of revenues. We do continue to believe that fixed is largely a scale gain and we think that our franchise is benefiting from our approach. We continue to consolidate share. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi thanks good morning. John, I wanted to ask you this year you had about a $1.8 billion of legal and repositioning charges a 2% drag on the efficiency ratio. And I'm just wondering as we think ahead to that efficiency ratio improvement that you're talking about for the next two years, can you separate for us a little bit what you -- what you generally expect out of that reposition in legal versus core and how much of a benefit that lower repositioning and legal might be to the efficiency ratio improvement. John Gerspach : Yes, when you look at the results for the full-year, we probably ended up at I think it's 238 basis points of Citicorp revenue legal and repositioning were about 238 basis points of revenue for Citicorp. Now that's little higher than where we had for 2015 and higher than the 200 basis points or so that we had guided to for full-year 2016 and most of that above guidance impact occurred in the first quarter, as a result of the rather large repositioning charge that we took early in the year. If you look at Citigroup and let's say, Citigroup is what we're all going to be looking at going forward, legal and repositioning for 2016 was 264 basis points about flat, I think would be with whatever we had in 2015 it was 265, 270. Going forward what we fully expect is that legal and repositioning will be a diminishing part of our story. So I would say that those charges should run about 200 basis points of Citigroup revenues in 2017 and then decline further in 2018. Yes, I looking to Mike, I'd say just as you know we're going stop reporting Holdings as a separate management entity in 2017. My hope is that we can stop reporting legal and repositioning as a separate component of expense in 2018. Ken Usdin : And therefore that guidance does contemplate that reduction right the overall efficiency ratio guidance contemplates that? John Gerspach : Yes. Ken Usdin : Okay. My second question just on credit. If you do have this improving efficiency ratio out there it does presume also that you talked about the card loss expectations for this year, but just a broader question on credit in general how much normalization, do you expect, are you anticipating seeing not just from credit from card, but just as the portfolio continues to season with other recent growth that you've seen across the -- across the globe? John Gerspach : Well, as I think we've talked a little bit about. I mean, Asia is still an incredible story when it comes to credit. So, Asia we still see our overall cost of credit in Asia bumping at most up to 1% in 100 basis points in the near-term. You take a look at where we're running right now that's well, well below that. We've given you our target for what we think Latin America will settle out at which is about 4.5 again that's higher than where we are right now. We think that's where will settle 450 basis points given portfolio seasoning. And then we gave you 2017 guidance for the two largest segments in North America branded cards and retail. Credit costs in our forward look inch up a bit from the 2018 as portfolio season and we have to think that the environment becomes a little weak, but again we\u2019re not looking, we don't anticipate a significant growth in that credit by 2018, 2019 may be branded cards ticks up somewhat above 300 basis points but it's still well within I think what you would expect a good branded performance to be. And it's reflected again of the quality of the book that that we're building up. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. John just wanted to clarify, the outlook for the net interest income dollars that you gave it sounded like may be looking at a net growth of about $1.2 billion in 2017 did I get that right and would that be assuming no more rate hikes? John Gerspach : That's correct John in Citicorp. John McDonald : Okay that's Citicorp just year-on-year 2017 versus 2016 and should we just think about that as group now or is there some holdings component we should think about as well. John Gerspach : One of the reasons no, no, John, that's one of the reasons why I mentioned if you look on that schedule that's in the deck. We generated $2 billion of net interest income from holdings in 2016 and we fully expect that amount to decline by half so we expect that amount to go down by $1 billion in 2017 because we sold off a bunch of portfolios and we have plans to continue to sell portfolios in holdings. But again, we are not expecting holdings to generate net income in 2017 because at the same time, we've told you that our expectations going forward is that holdings overall should operate at about breakeven. So whatever -- so as you look at the net interest income that we've generated this year, you kind of look at holdings as being a series of empty calories, it's there but it's not really doing anybody, any good because it's one going to go away and two it's going to get absorbed in the overall holdings breakeven. John McDonald : Got it, okay. But on the net group basis, you have maybe right now looking at a little bit of net interest income growth, so we've got to net those two. John Gerspach : Yes and again and I think if you're trying to gauge growth, where we are getting momentum and I know that we are not going to be reporting Citi Holdings any longer but again that momentum is going to come from Citicorp and we've had good consistent net income -- net interest income growth in Citicorp in 2016 and we will have it again in 2017. And we'll have it again in 2018 and it will be even higher, if we get more rate increases. John McDonald : Got it, very clear. Thank you. And just a question on the DTA, John what were the dynamics of the DTA progress in the fourth quarter, there was some OCI impact it looked like and then just, what's a reasonable expectation do you think of a DTA utilization as best you can tell as we look forward? John Gerspach : Yes in the quarter, John, the DTA that we utilized through operations of about $600 million, we utilized $600 million through operations but as you mentioned the OCI impact cost us about $1.08 billion. So we actually grew DTA by $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter. If you take a look at DTA for the full-year, full-year we utilized on a net basis including the OCI impact about $1.2 billion. But I think it's important that that we parse that out a little bit for you because of this two different components of our DTA that the series of our DTA that is time-sensitive. The NOLs, the FTCs etcetera, we utilized during the year about $2.4 billion of our time-sensitive DTA. So we utilized $2.4 billion of our time-sensitive DTA. And then it was timing difference DTA mostly as a result of the OCI movements that caused us to grow timing difference DTA by about $1.2 billion. But we continue to utilize that that time-sensitive portion of the DTA at a fairly regular pace. I'd say looking ahead to next year, we have targeted the use of about $2 billion of DTA this year and I would say that's a pretty good target to have for next year as well. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, how you doing? Mike Corbat : Good, Mike. Mike Mayo : My question relates to your targets and accountability to those targets. The short question is what are your targets for 2017 for ROA and ROE and the longer version is in three parts. Number one would be the timeframe, thank you for giving us the ROTCE target of 10% by late 2019 without any DTA write-downs but from our perspective, you missed the ROE target that you had from a few years ago now you have to carry more capital. So there's a story there. But you missed the efficiency target from last January now you revised that in April, you made revised target, but there's a story there. And then you missed the ROE target of 90 to 110 basis points, so after missed targets this decade from our shareholder perspective now we have to wait another two-and-a-half years to see if you achieve your targets, it just seems like not enough accountability in short-term for 2017. The second question does relate to the ROA, can you commit to an ROA of 90 to 110 basis point in 2017 and last year in the first three minutes of this call, you highlighted how you met that target which was good and now in 2016 it's down to 82 basis points and you don't mention that you missed the ROA target, you don't mention it anywhere on this conference call and you don't mention it anywhere in the 89 pages that were released today then the third question is ROE, what is your ROE target for 2017? Again this is down to7.6% ROTCE that's down from 9.2% in 2015. And after it's gotten worse, you now say exclude the DTA impact and that would boost up to 9%, I would say there is no credible accounting theory that would permit the exclusion of the DTA capital. If that was the case, you should have taken reserve but let's go with a 9% that's still worse in class so again, waiting two-and-a-half years seems like a long time if we wanted to hold you accountable so the timeframe waiting other two-and-a-half years after mis-targets, the ROA target where you expect that to be in 2017? And what kind of ROE target can we have in 2017 but what I'm really getting at if you were in outside trying to hold you accountable, how would you want us to hold you accountable in 2017, what specific metrics after what shareholders have been through. John Gerspach : So let's -- there is a lot in there, so let's go little bit back in time and talked about three, four years ago what we laid out, we laid out three big external goals in ROA between 90 and 110 basis points. We talked about an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s. And we talked about a return on tangible common equity of 10%. So let's pick those off, as you have cited last year, we came in 94, 95 basis points in terms of the ROA this year 82, what I would say this is not an excuse and the 90 to 110 remains the numbers and the outlook for 2017. But since the ROA target was introduced factor in TLAC, factor in LCR where our liquidity measures have come up and our funding, our funding base has changed mix precipitously and when you factor those in, it gets you pretty darn close to the 90 for the year in terms of the impact of those and some other things. So not an excuse by the way we are not backing away from it, we would love to be at the 90. The second piece I would say about ROA and why today we probably speak less about ROA than we have in the past is because I think our balance sheet is pretty darn efficient that back then we said, we got a lot of balance sheet tied up in Holdings, we've got an inefficient balance sheet in Citicorp and really what we want is rather than growing our balance sheet to optimize the balance sheet we have. And since we made that announcement like the balance sheet hasn't moved and on a net deployed basis in the client activities, it's actually gone down because of the higher percentage that's deployed in terms of liquidity and the things that are necessary there. The second piece of that is when we think about the way we run the firm and the leverage in the dials and the things that we want to optimize, ROA has become less relevant because clearly today our binding constraint is around CCAR Capital and so a great example. If we were simply focused on ROA, I would cut the balance sheet right now to rates and currencies and say, you can have what you have dedicated to that client flow business. Clearly, revenues up 27% over two years that would have been the wrong decision and that's what a strict ROA methodology would have led us to do so not backing away from the 90 which we were there, the things in there, you can choose to accept them or not. And again I think we are doing a pretty darn good job in terms of managing the balance sheet. In terms of the efficiency ratio, we did put out some revised guidance after what I think the industry would describe as an extremely difficult first quarter, we could have sat there and said you know what it is what it is but again what we want to do is we want to have real guideposts along the way by which to run the firm and to give external guidance. And again, when you compare our 58% versus the rest of the industry, I'm not ashamed of it, we're going to do better of it but I don't look at that and say that we are underperforming given our business mix and the investments that we're making. And again, we recommitted to be able to get to the mid-50s. And the third point in terms of ROTCE, we had and again I've publicly taken accountability around what happened in terms of CCAR and that was what it was. But what we've tried to do is come back from that and again quite proud of our $12.2 billion of CCAR cycle capital and by the way, the expectation is to continue to take that up as quickly as we can and to pull every lever between revenues, expenses, and capital return to get that up as quickly as we have. We made a commitment to use DTA, I remember four, five years ago, some people writing that not only would we never use it, we never stop creating it, and we have and so listen it's progress, it's not as fast as we'd like to go, the environment is not as good as we'd like to have it, it's not an excuse but I think in terms of the things that we've laid out there, we have executed against each of them in this environment, in a disciplined and committed way and that's what we're going to continue to do. Mike Mayo : Just one follow-up so for 2017 which metrics should shareholders collectively hold management accountable to? Mike Corbat : Going forward, I think the metric that makes most sense is the metric around the return on tangible common equity ex-DTA. We think that's an important milestone target you to look at obviously Mike we're still, I mean we still believe that this franchise can generate an overall ROTCE up 14%. We've said it and that is, we're going to get there. We're not going to get there tomorrow. We think near-term guideposts one, let's get to that 10% number excluding the capital that supports DTA. We've told you that we can get there in 2018 and what you should expect to see is meaningful progress towards that goal in 2017. That is also going to be supported by what we told you. As far as an efficiency ratio we're now changing the efficiency ratio to reflect all of Citi not just focusing on Citicorp we've said that Citigroup which ran at an efficiency ratio of 59% in 2016 will run at 58% in 2017 and we look to get into the range of the mid-50s hopefully as early as the next year. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim Securities. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Thanks very much. Mike, may be if you could just back up for a moment, obviously over the course of your tenure there has been profound progress in changing some strategic or some of the strategic focus of the organization certainly the geographic footprint and another things so, I'd love to understand with so much having been accomplished so what your top three strategic priorities are for the, the near to medium term. Mike Corbat : Sure, so we think about it and these will I think aligned very neatly and simply with what we've spoken about publicly. Going back to last conversation very clearly to get our first, our return on tangible common equity ex-DTA up get our return on tangible common equity up, get our return on equity up. And the focuses around those are a combination and what's necessary to do that is revenue growth and as I spoke about earlier, I feel good about our ability in ICG in any kind of reasonable environment to continue to grow those revenues. The payoff and back in terms of the investments we've made in retail from cards perspective from a Mexico perspective from some growth back in Asia good expense discipline investments in digital and capital return and what we've talked about is continuing to walk up capital return and the combination of execution against those three things, gives us the ability to hit the things that we've laid out in terms of 2017, 2018 and beyond. Eric Wasserstrom : Thank you and I appreciate that. I guess I'm trying to understand a little more operationally what we should be looking for. It sounds like continued investment in digital are certainly on the top of the list, but well should we look for in terms of sort of executional things that then translate into the financial results. Mike Corbat : Well, again just kind of taking through what we've talked about, no particular one we've talked about our investments in terms of equities people, platforms, technology, balance sheet. This year we, we started this journey at an unacceptable number eight. And this year we finished the year at an unacceptable -- we started the year, we started the journey at nine, we finished the year at eight, but very clearly closing the gap to set again, John talked about, we had revenues down 9% market was down 15%. We think there is a north of $200 million per quarter revenue opportunity to execute against any type of reasonable environment. We look at what we talked about bouncing around here in terms of Costco. We brought on $6 billion of new balances which come in with promos and come in with costs of various types, second half of next year we should start to see that and by the way we shouldn't second half of this year, we should see that and by the way, we're not, we're saying you shouldn't annualize that but at the same time you should expect to see us continue to grow those pieces. Our investment in Mexico, you look at what we've done there, not just revenue growth the positive operating leverage again that positive operating leverage and expense discipline. In spite of the public investments that we've talked about, we think that there is more to come from there. Our relationships with American Airlines with Home Depot done this year they should start to pay some fruits pay some dividends out in terms of the future. So as you look across the franchise, I think geographically product wise, segment wise there's a lot of opportunity to have positive revenue and net income trajectory. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. And may be just on the issue of Mexico obviously it's become a topic that's become little more controversial, just given what may be our new policy approach as a nation. Can you maybe put a box around what you think the risks could be from changes in either other trade policy or other kinds of policies that might affect, what could occur there? Mike Corbat : Well, as I said in the preamble, probably I like most other people don't necessarily understand because there's been nothing, no me put on the branch in terms of what the Board adjustment tax may mean or what it look like, but as I listen to what the administration has said and the common threat that really runs through everything when things come out, I tend to think of things as really trying to be stimulus around jobs investments in growth. And what I read the administration is trying to do is create the right level playing field. So that U.S. companies have the ability to compete and if there are things whether it's Mexico or elsewhere in the world that aren't there, they should be re-examined and again if you go back to our history to under 205 years and since then towards through trade was through depressions through recessions we've supported by U.S. companies all over the world. And in this we will continue to do that. I think a lot of it has -- it depends on what form any type of tariffs may take on, and it's tough to tell. One thing that's in the numbers in some ways that people miss, is that a lot of things to go back and forth across the border and in particular inbound to United States or inter-company and so when you think of an auto manufacturer for GM whoever may be manufacturing in Mexico, Brazil, wherever it may be a lot of that is simply their own products coming back, parts gets send in, parts gets assembled, parts get exported, and you've got to get through those, those numbers. So early to tell but again the stance the administration is taking we think is workable from what we've heard and again we maneuver these types of things before and we think we've got the ability to work with them in the future. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, thanks for taking my question. Couple of questions. First on the equities business, it seems like you had a decent momentum this quarter. Could you just give us your latest thoughts on how you're feeling about moving up in terms of gaining share and trying to capture the associated revenue opportunities talked you about in the past and just want to, I just have also a broader question on Mexico. And like, it seems like you have some momentum there. But I guess more broadly it's a great franchise, it's an iconic brand it lowest deposit costs in the system. But you've also been less profitable than your peers for a while, whether it be the Spaniards or some of the local Mexican banks. So what gives you the confidence that you really are turning the corner there and not in terms of regaining share, regaining business momentum and really turning the really closing the profitability gap so to speak with some of your peers. And is there a point where because of either exogenous factors or because you can't get the returns that where you want them to be that you decide hey it could be worth more to somebody else than to ourselves. Mike Corbat : Well, we start with equity so equities what we've consistently talked about as an investment in many ways is threefold it's people getting the right people in the right positions and we've done a lot of that whether it's sales, trading, research, technology et cetera. Second is getting the right technology in place and in particular technology around prime broker Delta one, where if you went and looked at we had under invested and there was better products out in the marketplace and really the third piece is around balance sheet. If you look at our balance sheet, we have been under exposed to vis-\u00e0-vis some of the bigger players in equities. We've gone out and I think systematically gone out and try to find the right people and put them in the right jobs and I think those, that work is largely in place, but we'll always look to invest there where it makes sense. On the technology side, we began those investments awhile back probably continue through this year, but I think if you look at what we've been able to do on the prime brokerage side and again we've got the flexibility around our supplemental leverage ratio and around capacity on our balance sheet smartly to take those balances on and with those balances obviously come trading flows in volumes and so that obviously continues. And so the pieces there are in place. And again what we've said in here is we're not right now positioning an expense base in a mindset of being number one but we think to get into that five, six region is the first stop and a reassessment is probably at least a $200 million revenue per quarter opportunity and you've seen. So we're now closing in on number seven and we are going to systematically continue to go at that. And so we've done it in our other businesses. And again as we've described historically these aren't new relationships to the firm. We've got very strong sales and trading relationships. We've got very strong corporate banking relationships. So we've got penetration, we've just got to show the right coverage, right product, right commitment to the business and the other pieces -- the other pieces should follow suit. From a Mexico perspective, we have admitted that that through the crisis for a period of time, we underinvested in our Mexico franchise. At the same time, we probably saw as you referenced the Spaniards and others investing and investing in a couple of ways, investing in service, investing in technology, investing in advertising, investing in credit and probably a number of our competitors have been much more aggressive with the balance sheet than we had been certainly through the crisis until more recently. Obviously we want to be smart about that, we want to stay committed to the segments that make sense for us but again our investments that we're talking about here around investments in ATMs and around branches if you have been down there and you probably have branches are tired and branch banking is still a very important, the predominance of activity still takes place in a branch, it won't be that way forever but the investments there for the branch refurbishments increase client satisfaction, the investments into the ATMs and into digital and smart ATMs gives us the ability as Mexico will transition from physical to digital, the transition 20% of the depositor base in Mexico in that shift. And we think we've got the opportunity around technology and a lot of this we have said is label this investment but candidly a lot of it in many ways is deferred CapEx and it's things that we need to do and we think we've got the ability not just to maintain but to grow share and to grow profitability and again we started to see that in the latter half of the year our ability to smartly to be able to do that. In terms of the final part of your question, would we ever get to the point I would argue when I look at the demographics of Mexico, Panamax in Mexico, very strong and I would argue as we have had the conversations with the inbound administration around a smart border policy, a smart trade policy and that border adjustments are not going to take away the labor arbitrage between Mexico and the U.S. completely. So how do we actually partner with our neighbor to create a supply chain, to create a competitive advantage around energy independence, around food independence, around technology, around as competitive a labor force that exist anywhere in the world, the creative supply chain that truly competes on a global basis and we think that's lots of stake and we think our total hold there down in Mexico gives us a unique position to benefit from that. Saul Martinez : Okay, great thanks, thanks for the thoughtful answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, John. I think you are in the midst of answering the question from floor related to which metrics -- which target should shareholders whole management accountable to in 2017? And I think what I heard you say 2017 efficiency 58% from 59%, 2018 10% ROTCE ex-DTA and efficiency in the mid-50s with only one rate hike and in 2019 you get a 10% ROTCE not excluding the DTA either for the full-year or late in the year depending what happens with the write-down, is that correct and which metrics we hold you accountable to in the shorter-term? John Gerspach : In the shorter-term, Mike that's why we gave you the 2017 efficiency ratio of 58%. I think that's a pretty clear efficiency ratio to measure us by next year. And I think Mike was pretty clear on 2018, which is in ROTCE again excluding the DTA capital but it's progress of 10% and during 2017, the expectation is that you're going to see meaningful progress towards that goal. Not going to give you an exact number at this point in time but you can expect that we have to demonstrate progress towards that goal otherwise that 10% goal in 2018 will be credible by the time we get to the end of 17. Mike Mayo : And what was the ROTCE of 14% or did I hear that wrong, is that kind of an aspirational goal? John Gerspach : That's still is what we think that the franchise is capable of producing and that is -- that is where we are going to get to. If you go to Slide 20 in the deck, you take a look at Slide 20 that kind of summarizes where we are today. We've said that we believe that the entire franchise is capable of generating an 14% -- an ROTCE of 14% or higher. We are at 7.6%. Okay. So that means that there is a gap of 640 basis points that we need to bridge, now there is going to be many actions that are going to contribute to closing that gap but you can, you can probably say that they fit into three broad buckets. Structural, business performance, and call it environmental rates, I think the structural elements are all the items that we've discussed. We need to reduce to $29 billion of capital that we currently have supporting the DTA on which we earn nothing. We need to complete the wind down of holdings and free up the remaining capital that we have caught up in the credit and market risk RWA that's in that segment. And finally, we're currently operating at a CVT1 capital ratio of 12.5%. Going forward, again, as we've demonstrated our ability to do this, we should be able to operate more in line with a ratio of 11.5% maybe even slightly lower, yes. We would expect these improvements and that's going to close roughly 40% of the gap let's say call that out of the 640 roughly 250 basis points. Now we've got plans in place for each of them, we are going to continue to utilize the DTA. We continue to wind down holdings and as Mike said, we're going to be increasing the amount of capital that we return each year to our shareholders. So that will be returning an amount of capital that is at least equal to the amount of capital that we generate each year. That's all in our plans; we would expect business performance to cover another 40% of the gap. Another 250 basis points without any benefit any, any benefit from the rising interest rates other than to say that 25 basis points that I talked about in 2018. So our Citigroup goal of 14% requires ICG to operate at an ROTCE of 14% and GCB of 20% and for Citigroup to operate in an efficiency ratio in the mid-50s. We've already talked about how we're going to get to that mid-50s, ICG generated 12.3% ROTCE in 2016, you see it right there on that page. And we would expect the investments that we made in our equities business along with the continued growth in investment banking and PTS to help us close this gap. With GCB the gap between consumers, the gap between our target of 20% and the 14% that we generated in 2016 is much larger. But again, we believe that the investments that we've made and are continuing to make our branded cards franchise as Mike mentioned in Mexico and in Asia that's going to help us significantly close this gap and we expect to show you continuous improvement in GCB's ROTCE each year from this point forward. And then the final 20% that's likely to come from race, when I think yes, I think it might be you and I that had this exact conversation a couple of quarters ago on this call when I spoke about the 14% target then I mentioned the rate environment through the fed funds rate that was 200 basis points higher than where we were at that point so we've seen the first 25 basis points we got that in December. There is talk of perhaps another three interest rate -- rate hikes in 2017 and I recognize. This is just talk, but if that does turn out to be true then we're halfway, home to the rate environment that I have described. Now we would see that until 2018 fully baked into the numbers but it is there so, that's the rough outline of how we move from 2016's ROTCE to the 14% target. And quite frankly, with the exception of the rate environment most of it is within our control. I understand that increasing the level of capital return to shareholders, requires approval from the fed but it's up to us to make the case through our performance and you've seen the progress that we've made over the last three CCAR cycles increasing our annual capital return from about a $1 billion in the 2014 cycle, $7 billion on a four quarter basis in 2015. And now $12 billion in 2016 so, we believe we're making significant progress and we expect to continue to demonstrate progress in the next cycle. So, with that as a backdrop, and then we think that those interim goals that we shared with you earlier should serve as important milestones for you to judge our overall progress towards achieving that 14% goal. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great. Thanks. And a quick question on the margin guidance you're getting with the 286 for 2017 is the right way to think about that as maybe just in the first quarter of 2017 that the increased investment spend, maybe takes away some of the benefits from the increased in rates in December I guess and I'm trying to get the trajectory over 2017 to understand where and 2017 as a good starting point for 2018. Mike Corbat : Okay. So there is, this is a couple of things that are going to be going on during 2017 during this year, one of which is of course the continued wind down of holdings. Don't forget as we disclosed, we have contracts in place to sell the Argentine and Brazil consumer franchises this year. We don't make any money there, but we do generate net interest income and we generate NIM so, that will depress our NIM as we sell those franchises in 2017. Again that's the empty calories that I talked about before. We're going to see a decline in Holdings net interest income but you're never going to miss it because it's associated with businesses on which we make nothing is not affect we lose money so, that is going to the press that one statistics called NIM. Now the other thing that\u2019s going on as you going to see continued growth in the rest of the business, particularly in branded cards. And in branded cards, if you think about what\u2019s going on. Okay, we've got Costco in place right now but if you go back to 2015, we talked about in the midway through 2015 beginning to invest in our branded cards business concentrating on growing our proprietary cards portfolio and at that time we said that those investments, they're going to yield immediate growth in active accounts and purchase sales, but it's going to be 24 months roughly two years before they reach maturity and really became profitable. The milestones we gave you milestones as far as you may be the middle of 2016 before the investments produce growth in A&R the end of 2016 before they generated year-over-year growth in revenue. And then the second half of 2015 when they begin to contribute to net income growth you hit each of the interim milestones and quite frankly, we remain on track with those investments to mature in the back half of 2017. Virtually the same point in time, we began to pursue the acquisition of Costco when we closed on that acquisition midway through 2016 in June of that year. And again I think we said that while the acquisition would yield immediate growth in accounts in purchase sales and loans because of purchase accounting it's going to be a full 12 months before the deal was accretive to income. Again pointing to the second half of 2017 as when this strategic relationship would begin contributing to net income growth. And once again, we remain on track. So what you see, if you take a look at the A&R that, that's again in the branded cards section of the supplement. We've seen growth in A&R in the fourth quarter and it's in line with our expectations. Our A&R grew about $3 billion sequentially and there's about $1 dollars of that growth coming from high spending transactors and some promo balances in Costco. And the other $2 billion is in other promo balances concentrated in simplicity our value card. Now full-rate revolving balances quite frankly in the fourth quarter were about flat even as we got growth in double cash as promo balances continue to flip to full-rate A&R and Costco was mostly offset by declines in our legacy products so, we've had good growth in the A&R. As well up I think it's 4% sequentially, but since this growth is predominantly concentrated in promo balances it really is yet hasn't contributed to growth the net interest income or to earnings. So over the next several quarters again consistent with our planning, we expect the promo balances to continue to flip the full rate receivables such as by the second half of 2017 our year-over-year growth in branded cards and A&R should be concentrated in full rate revolving balances so that's kind of the final step in having the branded cards investment program and the Costco acquisition reached sustained profitability. And like all other steps and as each of these initiatives, we expect that to occur on schedule and that flip from promo balances to full rate A&R is going to give us a nice lift in our net interest income as well. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Thanks, good afternoon. Just I guess in the interest of time, one specific question. John, you've alluded to this in over the last 90 minutes but I guess I'm, I just want to get a specific comment from you in terms of, it looks like the capital returns this year of the $12.2 billion you mentioned were roughly little over 80% of your net income and you've clearly set out a path in terms of return on tangible common equity can you give us a little greater level of detail in 2017 and 2018. How you're thinking about capital returns as you move towards 100% that you mentioned? John Gerspach : That's exactly what the goal is, is to, quite frankly, as I mentioned, we need to be able to return the capital that we generate each year, which actually is in excess of the net income that we generate. So, that's, that is the goal we have yet to see the, the CCAR scenario and everything so it's a little early to be talking about specific targets for 2017, let alone 2018 but again, you've seen the trajectory $1 billion, $7 billion, $12 billion. The goal for 2017 and I've talked longer term both Mike and I've said, we know that we've got to get to the range of $15 billion to $18 billion and we want to get into that range as quickly as we can. Matt Burnell : And is there any thought to may be have an overall 100% payout ratio. Is that something that potentially could occur in a new administration? John Gerspach : I don't think that it's something that's just only with a new administration. I mean, it's something that we will need to get to over time. I think quite frankly with the discussions that we've had with the existing, make up in the fed I've yet to hear anybody put an artificial cap on a quote payout ratio and the way that -- Mike Corbat : We think about it and we speak about it as to John's point there is -- probably really three components to our capital generation there is our earnings, there is our DTA utilization, there is holdings runoff. And so in the case of DTAs an example, a lot of that from a regulatory perspective disallowed so the argument is that that should not get trapped in terms of a capital capture that in essence belongs to our shareholders and should be returned to our shareholders and as we think about layout capital plans that's the way we think about it, and that's the way we articulate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning or good afternoon John and Mike. Mike Corbat : Good afternoon. Hope it's good evening. Gerard Cassidy : May be you guys, can you share with us some color just about on the capital market side, somehow the pipeline slowed activity levels, maybe even spread out geographically between Asia, ECM look pretty good this quarter versus U.S. and then also what your thoughts latest thoughts are on Brexit and how that is going forward? Mike Corbat : Well so we talked a bit about the aggregate numbers in terms of where we were from banking, but if you would with the term for a minute with our exit rates were quite strong. When you look at what we did from in ECM perspective, our fourth quarter was up 30% wallet down 4%, our M&A was up 24% wallet up 3%, our DCM was down 8%, but wallet was down 18% and it's not entirely appropriate to simply take a quarter these are longer cycles, but we continue to go after share take, share when we look at the backlog and look at the positioning and look at the client engagement strong. And if we think about some of the policies that the new administration is speaking about as I said in my preamble, that we haven't seen it yet , but around tax repatriation around corporate tax reform, you could see meaningful investment CapEx occurring and we think we're well-positioned to assist our clients on that front and it feels like right now we've got commodity marketplace stability, feels like there's some consensus around some rate movement and those things should create a backdrop that's open and facilitating to capital markets activity and feel like we're well-positioned against it. Second part of your question? Gerard Cassidy : And Brexit just, yes what's going on in the latest thoughts on Brexit. Mike Corbat : Yes, so we obviously all listened to and followed the Prime Minister's talk yesterday and I think very clearly laid out in terms of the stance that in essence around immigration and around law and governance in essence my words a hard exit but very open and what's the right word, very open and wanting to engage around what the right trade policy is going forward. So again, as we've said, we continue to plan contingencies. We got a lot of flexibility in terms of our own structure, our bank is European based in Ireland, we've got people in 20 or 22 of the EU countries, so that flexibility is there and we don't see a disruption and we're very focused on not having any disruption to our service of clients, but we've got, good to see here what Article 50 looks like is in the next few months and we'll continue to adjust to that very clearly not just ourselves but others continue to point towards most likely slower growth in the UK as a result of this for a period of time. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just finally, John, you mentioned that the Citi Holdings revenues in 2017 should be about half of last year which would be about $1 billion. In 2018, you think could they fall to a couple of $100 million when we look out into 2018 for Citi Holdings revenues? John Gerspach : I just want to be clear Gerard; I was referring to the net interest revenue in Citi Holdings just one component of the revenues. But and so again if you just go back to that Slide 14, you can see that the net interest revenue in Citi Holdings declined from $4.4 billion in 2015 to $2 billion in 2016 as I mentioned, it could drop, it should drop by about half again in 2017. When I take a look at 2018, it will decline. It shouldn't decline again by half but by a decent amount somewhere between 30%, 40% in 2018 and then it could stabilize after that. But quite frankly this is a fairly low number. So it would be less of a drag on the overall results. Gerard Cassidy : Great, thank you and I appreciate your patience on the length of the call. Thank you. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Thanks. John just one quick follow-up, I was hoping you could clarify how do you define mid-50s for your 2018 efficiency targets and the only reason I ask is the Street is modeling about 57%. And I'm wondering whether 57 actually confirms to how you define mid-50s or does it have a lower upper bound I will call 56%, in which case, there might be more room for earnings to surprise positively? John Gerspach : When you get to, we were at I think 57.1% last year in Citicorp and we certainly could not say that that was in the band of mid-50s. I think you as you get to the upper band of 50, the high-56s you start to stretch the band of mid-50s but so 57% would be probably just like it ticked too far but if we got to 56.8%, 56.7% maybe even 56.9% if you want to split hairs in 2018 I think that would be pretty good progress and put us in that band of mid-50s. Steven Chubak : Thanks for clarifying that. John, I appreciate it. John Gerspach : Not a problem. Operator : I will now turn the conference back over to management for any further remarks. Susan Kendall : All right. Thank you all for joining us today, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Brad. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our Web site, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan. Good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.1 billion for the first quarter of 2017 for $1.35 per share. We clearly carried momentum in many of our businesses from the end of last year into the quarter, leading to significantly better performance from one year ago. While our results were impacted by one-time gains, we increased revenues in both our consumer and institutional lines of business, while maintaining our expense discipline. We grew loans and deposits, and achieved an efficiency ratio of just under 58%, a return on assets of 91 basis points and a return on tangible common equity, ex-DTA, of over 10%, in line with our near term targets which were committed to meeting. Global consumer banking, our U.S. credit card business continued to benefit from the Costco portfolio, although we did see lower mortgage revenues. Internationally, we again posted revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Asia and Mexico, and we continued our investment plan in Mexico to drive improved efficiency and returns. The Institutional Clients Group had a strong quarter all around, as we keep gaining share among our target clients. Our Markets business performed very well with revenue up 17% year-over-year, comprised of 19% increase in fixed income and 10% increase in equities, another area we\u2019ve been investing in. Banking results were also strong; notably, in Investment Banking, which was up almost 40% and Treasury and Trade Solutions and the Private Bank were each up 9%, as well. We also continued to wind down legacy assets recording gains on asset sales including our consumer finance business in Canada and our consumer business in Argentina. This help to offset the one-time impact from exiting our U.S. mortgage servicing operations. We utilized $800 million in deferred tax assets, contributing to the $5.5 billion of total regulatory capital generation before returning $2.2 billion to our shareholders. During the past year, we reduced our outstanding common shares by 6% and returned 80% of earnings to our common shareholders. Our tangible book value per share increased to $65.94, that\u2019s 5% higher than a year ago and 14% higher than two years ago. Even still, our Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio has increased to 12.8%, well above the 11.5% upper range of what we believe we need to operate the firm prudently. So we clearly have excess capital and couldn\u2019t be more committed to returning that capital to our shareholders. Last week, we made our CCAR submission for the current cycle and feel good about the progress we\u2019ve made to strengthen our firm. We also continue to be positive about growth in general and the U.S. economy. While the details of potential policy changes in area such as tax code and infrastructure spending have yet to be worked out and will take a little longer than originally projected, we continue to believe that it\u2019s a matter of when and not if these changes will occur. As that process unfolds and outcomes become clear, I expect business will react accordingly as sentiment shifts from optimism to confidence. In the meantime, we continue to do our part to support growth and communities across the U.S. We were recently named the top Affordable Housing Finance here for the seventh year in a row, and we announced a small business lending increased to $11 billion last year, almost double what it was five years earlier. We remained confident in our model and our unique global network, which processes 4 trillion in payments a day and helps U.S. companies compete overseas. We\u2019ve built a franchise that\u2019s balanced across product and geography, and we're making targeted investments where we see the best opportunities to grow revenue and improve returns. With that, John will go through our presentation. Then we'll be happy to answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thank you, Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on slide three, we show total Citigroup results. Net income grew 17% to $4.1 billion in the first quarter, driven by higher revenues and lower cost of credit. And earnings per share grew 23%, including the benefit of share buybacks, which drove the 6% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.1 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues and Corporate/Other, as we continued wind down legacy assets. Expenses were roughly flat as the impact of higher performance related compensation and higher business volumes, was offset by lower repositioning cost. Ongoing investments were largely funded through efficiency savings. And cost of credit decline significantly, driven by a $230 million reserve release this quarter in ICG, as compared to a build in the prior year related to the energy sector. Consumer cost and credit increased year-over-year, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio and other volume growth, as well as the continued impact of changes in collection processes in U.S. cards. As previously announced, our result this quarter included a charge of nearly $400 million related to the exit of our U.S. mortgage servicing operations. This charge was recorded in Corporate/Other, with roughly $300 million reflected as a reduction in revenues and the remainder in expenses. However, we were able to more than offset this impact with nearly $750 million of gains on other asset sales, including gains of roughly $400 million on the sales of two businesses, Citi Financial Canada and Argentina Consumer, which closed on the last day in the quarter. On a net basis, these episodic items benefited our results by roughly $0.08 per share. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $629 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other. And deposits grew 3% to $950 billion. Turning now to each business, slide four shows the results for North America Consumer Banking. Total revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the first quarter. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% from last year, driven by lower mortgage revenues. Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $80 million year-over-year, reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds, as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights. Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues were up 5%, driven by continued growth in average loans deposits and assets under management. We're seeing positive early results from the launch of our enhance Citigold wealth management offering in the U.S. with year-to-date growth in households and balances tracking in line with our expectations. At the same time, we continued to transform our network this quarter by reducing our branch count to roughly 700, while continuing to roll out smart branch formats, including Citigold centers, expanding our Citigold sales force and adding new digital capabilities as transaction activity continues to shift to self service digital and mobile channels. Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.1 billion grew 13%, mostly reflecting the impact of the Costco portfolio acquisition and modest organic growth, offset by the impact of day count. We saw good engagement across the franchise again this quarter, with 4% year-over-year growth in average loans, excluding Costco. Looking at the total portfolio, despite the normal pay down you would expect in the first quarter, our full rate revolving balances remained stable sequentially. And we continued to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans in the second half of the year as our investments mature. The interest yield on the portfolio was also relatively flat sequentially at roughly 9.6% this quarter, as the recent rate increase was offset by growth in promotional rate balances as well as the impact of portfolio mix. From here, we expect yields to improve, driven by rate increases as well as the growth in full rate revolving balances in the second half of the year. Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.6 billion were down 5%, driven mostly by the absence of gains on the sale of two small portfolios in the first quarter of last year. Excluding the impact of divestiture activity, revenues were up 1% year-over-year. Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 3% from last year, mostly reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments, partially offset by efficiency savings and lower repositioning cost. And finally, credit costs of $1.4 billion increased roughly $330 million from last year. Net credit losses increased to $1.2 billion, mostly driven by Costco organic volume growth and seasoning, as well as the impact of changes in collection processes and cards. And we build roughly $160 million of loan loss reserves during the quarter to support volume growth. Looking at our card portfolios in more detail, in branded cards, our NCL rates of 3.1% was inflated this quarter by the flow through of delinquencies to credit losses related to the Costco conversion. Excluding this impact, which is now behind us, the branded card NCL rate was closer to 2.9%, up from the prior quarter due mostly to seasonality and the previously mentioned impact on collections. We believe this collection\u2019s impact is now stabilizing and so the NCL rate should improve in the second half of the year, driven by normal seasonality. This is consistent with the improvement we saw this quarter in both 90-day, 90 plus day and early bucket delinquencies on a dollar basis. Therefore, we remain comfortable with our full year outlook for an NCL rate in branded cards of around 280 basis points. The drivers are similar for retail services where the loss rate increased from the prior quarter. But given normal seasonal improvement in delinquencies, we continue to expect the full year NCL rate to be around 435 basis points. On slide five we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 12% from last year on higher revenue and slightly lower operating expenses partially offset by higher cost on credit. In total, revenues grew 3% and expenses were down 1% versus last year. In Latin America, total consumer revenue grew 4%, driven by an 8% growth in retail banking, reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits, as well as improved deposit spread. However, card revenue declined from last year, reflecting lower revolving loans, as well as a higher cost to fund non-revolving balances. Total average card loans grew 5% year-over-year. However, revolving balances have generally lagged as we have grown in high quality consumer segments with lower revolvers. The year-over-year trends are improving, however, and we expect to return to growth in revolving card loans sometime in the second half of the year. Expenses were roughly flat year-over-year in Latin America as ongoing investment spending was offset by efficiency savings and lower repositioning cost. We continue to execute our investment plans in Mexico, which we believe will drive improved operating efficiency and returns, over-time. And we still expect to maintain positive operating leverage each year throughout the investment period. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 3% year-over-year, driven by improvement in cards and Wealth Management, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Card revenues grew 6%, driven by higher volumes and improved revolve rates versus last year. Average card loans were up 3% and purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting slight organic improvement, as well as the recent acquisition of a $700 million co-brand portfolio with Coles Supermarkets in Australia. Retail revenues were up slightly year-over-year as higher Wealth Management revenues were largely offset by the continued repositioning of our retail loan portfolio. Average retail loans were stable sequentially, but down 5% year-over-year with modestly improved spreads. Expenses in Asia declined 2% as volume growth and ongoing investment spending was more than offset by lower repositioning cost. Slide six shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail, across both cards and Retail Banking. The NCL rate in North America increased from last quarter, as I described earlier, but should trend lower for the remainder of the year as the Costco conversion related losses are now behind us and we should benefit from normal seasonality. Credit trends in Asia consumer remained stable this quarter and the NCL rate in Latin America was 4.4%, up somewhat from the prior quarter, mostly driven by lower loan growth but still in line with our near term outlook. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide seven. Net income of $3 billion grew substantially from last year on higher revenues and lower cost of credit, partially offset by higher operating expenses. Revenues of $9.1 billion grew 16% from last year, reflecting solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.5 billion were up 14%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.1 billion grew 9%, driven by strong fee growth, higher volumes and improved spreads. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% from last year, reflecting a rebound in debt and equity underwriting and our continued momentum in M&A. Private Bank revenues of $744 million grew 9% year-over-year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth and improved spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $434 million were down 3% from last year on lower average volumes. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.8 billion grew 18% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.6 billion were up 19% with both rates and currencies and spread products contributing to revenue growth. Equities revenues grew 10% year-over-year, driven by an improvement in derivatives. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were down 3%. However, excluding the impact of prior period divestures, the business grew 12% year-over-year. Total operating expenses of $4.9 billion were up 1% year-over-year as higher incentive compensation was partially offset by lower repositioning cost and the benefit from FX translation. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio was 26%. And cost of credit was a benefit this quarter, driven by net ratings upgrades and continued stability in commodity prices. Slide eight shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $1.2 billion declined significantly from last year, driven by legacy asset run-off and divestiture activity, as well as lower revenue from treasury related hedging activity. And expenses were down 11% to $1.1 billion, driven by the wind down of assets, partially offset by episodic expenses this quarter related to the exit of our U.S. mortgage servicing operations. While, Corp/Other was essentially breakeven this quarter on a pretax basis, as I noted earlier, our revenues included roughly $450 million of net episodic gains this quarter and our expenses included about $100 million of related charges, resulting in a net benefit to EBIT of roughly $350 million. Slide nine shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate/Other. As you can see, total net interest revenue declined 3% year-over-year in constant dollars to $10.9 billion, as growth in core accrual revenues was more than offset by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue. Trading positions are managed on a total revenue basis, with the interest component varying based on a number of factors. So while our total trading revenues were up significantly this quarter, the contribution from net interest revenue was lower than a year ago. But this trade in, as we said in past, the trading component of our net interest revenue is by nature more difficult to forecast. Turning to our Core Accrual businesses, net interest revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% or $280 million from last year, driven by the addition of the Costco portfolio, other volume growth, and the impact of the December 2016 rate hike, partially offset by lower day count and increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long term debt. On a sequential basis, Core Accrual revenues decline as the benefit of higher interest rates was more than offset by the impact of lower day count, loan mix and rate positioning actions. Adjusting for day count, Core Accrual revenues were up slightly from last quarter. And our core net interest margin declined by 1 basis point, reflecting the impact of higher cash balances. Looking to the reminder of the year, Core Accrual revenues should continue to grow year-over-year. Assuming one additional rate hike mid-year, Core Accrual revenues should grow year-over-year by roughly $1.5 billion in total over the next three quarters, with just under two thirds of that amount coming from higher rates and the reminder mostly reflecting higher loan volumes and mix. On slide 10, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET1 capital ratios improved to 12.8%, driven mostly by earnings, partially offset by $2.2 billion of common share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.3% and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% year-over-year to $65.94, in part driven by 6% reduction in our shares outstanding. To conclude, I'd like to spend some time on our outlook for the second quarter. Starting in consumer, in North America, revenue growth this quarter should continue to be mostly inorganic, driven by a full quarter of revenue contribution from the Costco portfolio which we acquired in June of last year. Excluding mortgage, we expect continued growth in our North America Retail Banking franchise as well. However, this will likely be offset by lower mortgage revenues versus the prior year. And internationally, we continue to expect modest year-over-year revenue growth in constant dollars with positive operating leverage in both Asia and Mexico. On the institutional side, we expect Markets revenues to reflect the normal seasonal decline from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues should be broadly stable sequentially, assuming that market conditions remain favorable. And we should continue to grow year-over-year in TTS, Securities Service and the Private Bank. In Corporate/Other, revenues and expenses should continue to decline over time as we wind down legacy assets. But the underlying EBITDA contribution we saw this quarter of about negative $350 million is a good run rate for modeling this segment going forward. Cost and credit should be higher quarter-on-quarter, driven by the normalization of credit cost and ICG, partially offset by improvement in North America consumer. And on a full year basis, we continue to expect our efficiency ratio to be around 58%. With that, Mike and I would be happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : First, very quickie, I just wanted to get a clarifier. Did you just say the minus $350 million is a good run rate to use for holdings, going forward? I missed the last comment. John Gerspach : Corp/Other Glenn Schorr : Corp/Other, okay\u2026 John Gerspach : We don\u2019t have holdings anymore, Glenn. Holdings that folded into Corp/Other\u2026 Glenn Schorr : The strength in DCM was great in banking in general. But I wonder if you have any thoughts on how much of the up almost 40% versus last year's disruption in the quarter versus maybe pull forward as some people thought rates might go up versus maybe it's just good environment and it's a competitive product to lending. Just curious there. Mike Corbat : If you go back and look at the first quarter last year, which is a tough start and you look at the areas in particular. So ECM, I don\u2019t think we did as an industry we did an IPO until the middle of April. If you look at what went on, you had referenced maybe inadvertently DCM, but DCM had a tough start last year. I think had almost extraordinary March this year. And I think if you look at the pipeline of banking, banking deals. And I would say all the pieces that we expected with that momentum coming out of last year came to fruition. And I would say that the second quarter continues to feel like it has positive momentum. So I would say, coming off a very little base. But I would say the activity in client engagement was high and I think remains high going into the second quarter. John Gerspach : I actually think the activity this quarter it's more or less of what you would think about as being a more normal quarter as opposed to something that is a big bounce off of a down quarter; and so you have an outsized a wallet out there in this quarter. I think if you take a look at historical averages, it's kind of in line, so it doesn\u2019t appear to be outsized the activity. We\u2019ve nice bounce back obviously from first quarter of last year. But as Mike said, there was virtually zero equity activity last year in the first quarter. So we got a nice bounce back there. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that, maybe last question it's a good lead into zero equity activity. In equity, cash volumes were off a lot, especially in the U.S., but you had a very good quarter. In your prepared remarks, you mentioned that derivatives leading the way. Are you talking about corporate derivatives size, are you -- is that an activity in an environment collection? Or are you doing something specific to drive your derivatives business and equities? Because I would have thought you might have mentioned PB being a bigger driver; just curious for a little more color, because that's an area of work for you guys. Mike Corbat : Glenn, we've been putting investments in equities for a while. And we like to investment we said that we\u2019ve made in both the people and the platforms in equities; we've got balance sheet to put to work; we think that we've been gaining share with our targeted clients; and I think you\u2019re starting to see some of that activity coming through now, it's one quarter. So let's string it together for a couple of quarters. But we saw good client engagement on both the corporate and investor side this time, and so we\u2019ll see. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. Please go ahead. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about branded cards and that outlook for the second half. You still got revenue yield feeling some pressure, but you mentioned that should get better. Can you just remind us of that trajectory of second half profitability inflection that you are looking for in cards and what the drivers are of that as things mature? Mike Corbat : It's primarily two-fold. One is, as you'll recall, back in the middle of 2015 we began to make some significant investments in growing our proprietary product portfolio in cards. That's when we really tried to roll out the launch and everything from double cash to our various value cards, banking the reward cards, all of that. And as we said there, it takes basically 24 to 30 months for those new card acquisitions in a proprietary book to really begin to generate a positive net income. And so that 24 months coincides with the second half of this year. And in similar fashion, when we bought the Costco portfolio, last June, we said that just do the purchase accounting, Costco would not be accretive to earnings until a full year had elapsed. And that happens to coincide with the second half of this year, as well. So we\u2019ve got both of those tailwinds that we fully expect them to be visible in our second half results. You should be able to see it, both in revenue growth and also improved cost of credit, especially as we lap some of the very high cost of credit numbers that we had in the second half of last year as we were building up loan loss reserves for Costco, in connection with the purchase accounting, so those factors. And as I said we like the way Costco is performing; we like the momentum that we got in our proprietary cards products as well; and it's all progressing as we had expected. And so that gives us the confidence in talking about that year-over-year growth coming in the second half of the year. John McDonald : Then just separately, could you repeat for us the net interest income, the core net interest income guidance that I think you said if there's one more rate hike. And also just let us know like how much does one 25 basis point rate hike help you? Is there any way you could just mention that for us so we could, if we wanted to add our own assumption of more rate hikes, how should we think about that? Mike Corbat : Very rough math, John, 25 basis points rate hike should impact revenues positively by about $100 million for each full quarter that it's in effect. That's very rough math. That's all going to be dependent upon where you are with deposit is and everything else. So the initial rate hikes you might get a little bit more than a 100, subsequent rate hikes you might get a little bit less than a 100. But a 100 is a good rule of thumb to use. John McDonald : And if we take the net interest income that you saw this quarter. How should we think about that, and as it relates to your outlook, going forward, for net interest income? Mike Corbat : When you take a look, again, let\u2019s just focus on the Core Accrual revenues. What I said during the prepared remarks was that we expect the Core Accrual interest revenue to grow year-over-year by about $1.5 billion during the next three quarters, again assuming one more rate hike somewhere around midyear. We had roughly $300 million year-over-year benefits in the first quarter. I think you will see that if you look at slide nine of the presentation. So that was being -- we would expect full year growth to be about $1.8 billion from a combination of the higher rates and volumes for the full year. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Mike you were -- pretty strong statement around capital return. What's giving you the confidence; is it just the fact that you are feeling that much better about your capital ratios; is that regulatory conversations. Obviously, it's rolled again to speech, which you\u2019re talking about, maybe phasing out the qualitative side of things. Is that your sense that they are going to be a little bit more willing to give you credit for the excess capital you have. Just any color around that thought process on your part. Mike Corbat : I would start here first Jim on the qualitative side of things. And I think that the work that the team has done from a qualitative perspective in terms of models and scenarios and all of the important pieces that go into your build up and ultimately your assets. I think we\u2019ve made a lot of progress, and I think the regulators have recognized some of that progress that we\u2019ve made. And I think we feel good about the process we put in place. And obviously depending how it goes forward, we\u2019re committed to continue to improve on that. And then the other side of it is the qualitative side. And again as I said in my opening remarks, you\u2019ll look at what we\u2019ve done here in terms of capital return and yet our ratios continue to go up; and so this quarter generating $5.5 billion of regulatory capital. And what we\u2019ve said is we got to get to a position where we\u2019re returning that access capital. That\u2019s an important piece of the math around our pathway to making sure our returns get to where they need to get. And so we\u2019ve been engaged in those conversations. We\u2019ll see when the ASC is responded to, what it looks and feels like. But again, I think we feel good about the process. We feel very good about our numbers and our ability to make big ASC and we\u2019ll continue to work on it. Jim Mitchell : Just maybe a broader question on regulation or de-regulation, however, you want to think about it. Is there any -- have you felt like however that we\u2019re a couple of months into the new administration, has there been any kind of coalescing around some ideas that maybe go from idea to actually implementation that you feel good about? Or is it still too early to be making any kind of assumptions around some, easing around some of the regulations? Mike Corbat : In terms of being able to point to specifics, I think it's early. But not just myself, a number of us in the industry have been very engaged with the administration and very engaged with a number of different committee members, our regulators, et cetera. And as I think we talked about before just to toe-in from the top, is an important message and signal. And I think we\u2019ve seen very clearly with the president and the administration is very for growth for jobs. And I think around that I think the presidential order that he put out, which I think is one of the first real signs along the way here in terms of what's going to be focused on and where things go. We\u2019ve obviously been involved and commented in terms of things that could be focused on, should be focused on and we\u2019ll see -- we expect the termination and that comes backward. But at this point, I would call the conversations with the administration very constructive. Jim Mitchell : And if we -- I think concerning the noise around potentially a new glassed eagle maybe this year sort of somewhere to what they did in U.K. about ring fencing. Would that be something that would be overly onerous for somebody like you or how to think\u2026 Mike Corbat : Probably like all of you. And anytime I hear this term 21th century glassed eagle, I ask what it is and I have yet to have anybody really tell me what's there. And as you can imagine that not just myself but I'm sure others have been involved in those conversations. And I would say that the administration is focused around trying to harmonize regulations, focus around trying to take things away that are either duplicative or don\u2019t really add value. And I have yet to have anybody really explain to me what value there is in terms of either a reinstatement of glassed eagle, which in itself is strange or what 21th glassed eagle is. So we continue to ask about it but not necessarily be that focused on it. We think our business model is the right model. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: I want to come back to the outlook for net interest income. And I was hoping again with same basis is what you talked about in January, I think you said the net impact of growth at that time what was Corp and at that time what was holdings. The net of those two would be a modest positive. I think it was up $200 million year-over-year. So I was wondering if you could just update that with, including obviously the comments you gave earlier, but just bring on the same basis to that would be helpful. Mike Corbat : So in answering the earlier question from John, I mentioned that the add up of two pieces; the $300 million year-over-year growth that we saw in the first quarter; and the $1.5 billion growth that we anticipate for the balance of the year, you get $1.8 billion. Now the prior guidance that we had given of $1.2 billion had included trading related net revenue. So the two figures are not really comparable. The $1.8 billion that I'm talking about in response to John's question and the $1.5 billion of guidance, we really talked about Core Accrual revenue. Whereas the other $1.2 billion was just kind of all-in, and as I said, it included trading related revenue. So the figures just aren\u2019t comparable, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Right and that was my question, I was trying to get them comparable. Because the constant net interest income, obviously, excludes the one-off book. It holds day count, it holds currencies constant. So I understand there might be some moving pieces, going forward. But just having it on apples-to-apples basis, your best guess and outlook right now would be helpful. Mike Corbat : I am giving you the best thing that I can do, just to give you the $1.5 billion outlook, which is reflective of the construct that that we have in place today. When we don\u2019t beat the $1.2 billion outlook previously, as I mentioned that it included trading related revenues built into that $1.2 billion. There\u2019s some downward expectations related to trading net interest revenues and the previous guidance. So what I would say is that the change in guidance right now is primarily related to assuming two additional rate increases. We had the one rate increase in March and now we've built in another rate increase in June. And there was probably just some modest reduction in our expectation for loan growth that compared to the earlier guidance, certainly following the first quarter performance. Matt O'Connor: I want to take a stab on the trading part, which is fine we can estimate that. How about to see legacy asset piece here that I think was about $400 million contribution this quarter. And you obviously had some sales at the end of the quarter. How should we think about deducting out that component? Mike Corbat : Same as the guidance that we gave you back at the beginning of the year. We said our expectation would be that we called it holdings at that point in time because we had a holding segment. And we said that holdings, year-over-year, we would expect $1 billion reduction in net interest revenue. You saw that we\u2019ve had roughly a quarter of that $220 million in the first quarter in the legacy asset component of the bar chart on slide nine. And so it's still is looking about $1 billion year-over-year impact. Matt O'Connor: And then just squeezing in one other one, beside the $100 million exit cost for the sale of the mortgage servicing unit, were there other legal or repositioning costs? I don\u2019t see anything disclosed, but it's been a busy day\u2026 Mike Corbat : Bear in mind, Matt, what you probably noticed is that we just collapsed all our expense disclosure now into one line, just called operating expense. For a while, when we were going through periods of heavy repositioning cost and heavy legal expense, we thought that it was beneficial to break those things out of the separate line item, so that we could talk separately about them. But now, as far as legal and repositioning, pretty much it's just part of our BAU activity. So it's just in the operating expense number. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Mike Corbat : Matt, if we had anything unusual, we call it out. Matt O'Connor: It was very high a year ago. So as we think about the underlying expense growth of the Company, I think combined, it was in $700 million range a year ago. So just trying to figure out is there a meaningful number to adjust for or not as we think about the operating leverage and underlying trends. Mike Corbat : The first quarter performance, again, we talked about operating efficiency targets at any year. And as you know when we talk to you about operating efficiencies, everything all-in, we don\u2019t adjust revenues and we don\u2019t adjust expenses. So that 58% target is all-in. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Matt Burnell : Just one I guess maybe very detailed question. There was a drop in non-interest bearing deposits in North America of about 5% quarter-over-quarter, drop of 6% year-over-year. Could you provide some more color as to what's going on there? And does it tie-in with anything that\u2019s going on within the loan portfolio? John Gerspach : As you mentioned, that drop was basically in our TTS business. And what we saw there was just some additional influence going into some of the interest bearing accounts coming out of the as a non-interest bearing. Matt Burnell : Okay\u2026 John Gerspach : As companies after a while, they build-up excess cash and build up excess cash. And eventually they\u2019ll shift a little bit of it over into an interest bearing account. Matt Burnell : And then just on the international consumer business, particularly in Latin America, Mexico statistically. Obviously, the trends are pretty positive or more positive now on a year-over-year basis. They were little bit negative. I assume some of that\u2019s seasonal on a quarter-on-quarter basis. Has there been any, in your sense, any effect of the U.S. policy on activity levels within your Mexican business? John Gerspach : Well, I do think that the Mexico economy, at the beginning part of the year, I\u2019d say that there was somewhat of a decline in consumer confidence that did occur. I was in Mexico three weeks ago. My sense was that that had changed, it was beginning to come back. But there was definitely a drop in consumer confidence at the beginning of the year. Matt Burnell : And then just finally, the release of the $230 million in ICG, was that entirely due to energy exposures or was the combination of factors there? John Gerspach : Yes, there were couple of other small things, but the predominant driver was energy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : John, I wanted to kick things off with a question on capital. Basel proposed some changes to its calculation methodology for GSIB surcharges. And on balance, it feels like it's going to result in some upward pressure on your GSIB score. I know there're differences between Basel and the Fed calculations, and which one could be a binding constraint for you guys specifically. But it looks like, on balance, the changes that Basel has proposed are bit tougher for you guys. And didn't know if that's going to result in you potentially moving to a higher GSIB bucket, given some of the changes from Basel from what appears to be 3% today to 3.5%. John Gerspach : So, in trying to piece through your questions from a capital point of view, Steven, our binding constraint, from a capital point of view, is the Fed mandated Method II calculation of GSIB. And even if the Basel committee made changes to what in the U.S. we recall Method I, the Method II score would still be the binding constraint. So if you think about it under the current regime, Method I, we're at 2%, Method II we're at 3%. As we run the numbers based upon the proposal coming out of Basel, the Method I would move to 2.5%. And so we would still stay where we are from a capital point of view with Method II being the driving factor. But then we'd have to see whether or not the Fed made any changes in their score. The Basel will continue with their flawed methodology of converting everything into Euros, which means that as we get changes in the dollar without any change at all in our balance sheet, our capital, our score under Method I can change dramatically. So we would still expect the U.S. to do what it had done and put forward a much more balanced approach, eliminating currency fluctuation from your capital base. So we'll see how that goes. The one change, Steven, and this may be what you're driving at. Obviously, Method I is a determinant of your TLAC requirement. And so to the extent that there was a change in Method I. And then again it depends on whether or not the U.S. just adopts the flawed Method I methodology proposed by Basel, or it does again a sensible change and converts it to something that\u2019s stabilizes the impact of currency fluctuation. Steven Chubak : And maybe just switching to revenue side of the equation, certainly the results in Private Banking and TTS have been quite strong. You alluded to within Private Banking a lot of the strength really being driven by lending side. And didn\u2019t know if you could just give us some context as to how we should be thinking about the revenue outlook for that particular business. And is this a reasonable jumping off point where off of $750 million, we should expect to see pretty steady growth? John Gerspach : Well, I don\u2019t think that you should count on 9% year-over-year growth every quarter, Steven. But we do have a very solid Private Banking franchise. And if I give you the indication that the growth was primarily driven by loan, there\u2019s really a much more balanced growth coming out of both loans and deposits. And obviously, it's being impacted by changes in the deposit spread as well. Steven Chubak : And just one quick question, I may, just on the NII side. I know you\u2019ve given a lot of guidance. Last quarter, you noted that we should expect to see the NIM flat year-on-year. And I am wondering, does that still apply to the core book at least or does that guidance no longer hold? John Gerspach : No, I would say that for the core book, we would expect NIM to be maybe up slightly year-over-year. And I am hedging at that only because we have seen a lot of growth in the cash balances. You can see our cash is almost 10% of our balance sheet, at this point in time. And obviously, as that cash grows, it does impact the denominator of the NIM calculation and you get very little earnings off of cash, especially cash that we would have over in, say EMEA. So I'll hedge a little bit on NIM, going forward, but it should be up slightly. But I\u2019d ask you to focus a little bit more on net interest revenue growth. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Ken Usdin of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : It was nice to see the 10.2% ROTCE ex the DTA this quarter. We do know that it typically is the peak quarter for you guys in terms of the progression for the year. But I was just wondering if you can just talk about those guide post that you had given us and your confidence in those out-year ROE targets that you\u2019ve had. And just any changes that you\u2019re thinking underneath it? Mike Corbat : So as I said, Ken, in my opening remarks and then John reiterate, is we remained committed to numbers that we put out there; efficiency ratio, ROE and ROTCE ex-DTA. And again, I think our story is one where we\u2019ve talked about, you can map out what looks like a, at this point, a fairly typical sequential ICG year; again with good momentum, and as we see things right now; and then, obviously, talking about the back half story in terms of consumer. So we\u2019re hoping that the combination of revenue, control cost to credit, expense discipline carries through the cost of the year and that\u2019s where the franchise is focused on. And then as we go into the outer-years the third or fourth lever in there is obviously capital return. And so, we want to continue to pull out level and continue not just to focus on what the growth of the numerator looks like, but also focus on the denominator and we put those together because its confidence in terms of what we told you we're going to do. Ken Usdin : And Mike as a follow up to that, we know you have the July, Analyst Day coming up and just wondering. Is that more about just providing color on the current strategy or should we expect anything different in terms of the overall company strategy? It's been a long time since you've done one of those. So just what should we be anticipating in general as we think about that? Susan Kendall : I think it's another step in terms of what I described is the renormalization of the Company. One thing where I look at this quarter that in some ways, I feel quite good about this by what I told you four, five, six years ago, we're going to have an earnings deck that can responsibly describe this firm in 11 pages and probably would have taken pause at that. And so, I think our ability to go and I think really go granular with you in terms of the businesses and that things that we're doing, and I think a lot of the work that's being done from the client, from a digital prospective and some of things that either over lunch or a meetings around the calls we don\u2019t get to do. And then something depending on the reaction and how you see it that something we would like to get into, whatever it comes to be as normal rhythm of doing with you. So, I wouldn't expect because it's anything very shattering, but we plan on taking a deep into some of these strategies and hopefully showing you a few things along the way. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple of questions just on the non-interest-bearing deposits, so I heard you earlier talked about NIB and how it's not atypical to move from NIB to interest-bearing deposits overtime. But I was just wondering, if there is some seasonality as well in the first quarter that you're thinking happened to you this year? John Gerspach : No, I don\u2019t -- I wouldn't put it on seasonality. There still is a lot of cash out there and it's always looking to fund the homes. And so, we attempt this, especially on the corporate side, we attempt to accommodate our clients as we best we can and we were saying the cash continue to build up. Betsy Graseck : Is there anything on the deposit better aside that we should be thinking about? How you're going to your -- your deposit data at this stage in cycle still lowering here, but maybe you can give us a sense of how it's moved up over the last couple of quarters? John Gerspach : It's actually been fairly -- I mean, we saw a little bit of a change with the December at rate hike, but its minute at this point in time that's it. John Gerspach : Okay, so basically when we're looking at the cost of funds on the liability side, the uptake has more to do with just a net shift to non-interest-bearing deposit -- I'm sorry, non-deposit funding, is that fair statement? John Gerspach : It\u2019s a fair statement. It's mostly driven by changes in long-term debt in the most part. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi good afternoon, my questions have been asked and answered. Thank you. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Can you remind us, John, your capital ratio, your CET1 ratio obviously is 12.8%. In a new more normalized environment, as we move forward, what's your guys comfort level of where you want that to be? John Gerspach : When Mike gave his opening comments, he talked about 11.5% being kind of at the upper end of a range, as to what we would think we would need to have to run the institution prudently. And when you think about it, if you just look at our regulatory requirements right now, they are about 10%. You add up the different buckets. We will always want to have at least now we are thinking about having a 100 basis point buffer on top of that, which get you to a 11%. There is still talk about maybe moving into that SCB type of the stress capital buffer. So that can take you to an 11.2, and so somewhere between 11 and 11.5, I think is a good range to think about right now as to what we would need to prudently run the institution. Gerard Cassidy : Very good, if there's changes coming with the new appointments to the Fed and they decide to do away with the capital charge that you and a few your peers have for operating risk. How much capital is tied up in that area right now? John Gerspach : When it comes op risk meaning, we still have, on the order of $327 billion worth of risk weighted assets tied up in op capital. But that again, op capital is part of the advanced approach. Gerard Cassidy : Right. John Gerspach : So, the next question becomes, do they stay with advanced approach? Do they move to standardize? CCAR is based upon standardized. There is a whole derivation of the stress capital buffer, again was calculated in CCAR, which is based upon standardized RWA. So, I think that there is still some discussion to be had as far as what becomes the real focal point of the denominator. Is that the advanced approach or is that the standardized? Gerard Cassidy : Sure. I noticed in the ICG this quarter obviously the trading activity was very strong for you and those are for your peers. Your Treasury and Trade Solutions numbers was a nice 9% increased. Can you give us some color aside from an interest rates moving up, helping that business? What are some of the other factors that contribute to the growth of that business considering it's one of the largest in the total banking number? John Gerspach : Well, it's obviously client volumes I mean we will continue to gain wallet share with our clients. You can see some of the statistics they get published by the Swift and other things that we continue to gain share there, and we've got a very healthy commercial card business in Treasury and Trade Solutions as well. And that's been a real engine for growth during the last two years. It is every indication that should continue. The nice thing about the commercial cards business that gives us fee-based revenue, and so, it rises, it diversifies the business away from just being focused on rates on balances. And with the commercial card business, again, once we win that that mandate with the client, it helps us really work with them, working capital management side of business and so it becomes very, very sticky overtime. Gerard Cassidy : Great, and then just lastly obviously you guys are global. Can you give us some color given European elections that are coming up and the political tremors we're seeing right now. How are the international markets today for your banking pipelines, trade finance, what are your guys in the front line seeing? John Gerspach : Well, obviously, everybody's watching and we're watching French elections, we're watching the lead up to German elections. One of the things we're watching closely obviously is with Article 50 hasn't been declared, European engagement around what Brexit looks and feels like. So, I would say in the case of the UK, it's clearly been a dampener in terms of activity in the UK, not a lot of inbound FDI et cetera. But I would say that on the continent, business actually remains fairly robust, and client engagement you can look at from a calendar perspective what was done in Europe this quarter, equity debt and transactions in general. And we've got a little bit of volatility in terms of currencies and some things, and so, I'd say the pipeline right now remains pretty strong. But we'll see as we go through from round one to round two and where polling goes in terms of the French elections. I think people will be watching that transition or that [segway], pretty closely. But as of right now, things feel pretty reasonable. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Eric Wasserstrom with Guggenheim. Please go ahead. Eric Wasserstrom : Just two follow ups on -- inside the global consumer bank. The first is, you talked about, John, in the past the remediation that you had to do for all of the changes in Korea from the regulatory environment and that had largely concluded I think at the end of last year. Are you seeing the reacceleration of revenue growth that you were hoping for in that region? John Gerspach : Yes, I want to make sure, I didn't say it was over, I said that the regulatory headwinds were abating which they had and that's actually been what you've seen in the numbers now over the last couple of quarters, as we continue to have nice yield, modest year-over-year revenue growth, 3% this quarter. And again, that's a good way of thinking about that business right now, it's certainly given back to the go go years where we had much higher revenue, but you can see the momentum building in that business as we work our way through the year. Eric Wasserstrom : But in terms of the costs associated with complying with the changes in the regulatory environment there, has that diminished at all? John Gerspach : Well, when we talked about regulatory costs in the past, it wasn't necessarily focused on Asia, it was more focused globally, but a lot of it here in the U.S. And I'd say that cost is still running high, but it's plateaued, and that's given us now the opportunity to shift some of the investment, more away from just doing regulatory work and put investment dollars towards supporting the businesses which has been great. Eric Wasserstrom : Great. And then just one follow-up on Mexico, the investment that's going on there, what form is that actually taking? I know that there's been a lot of focus on physical branches and things, but where are those dollars being -- where would they be manifested in the actual operation? John Gerspach : Well, there's several components to the investment program in Mexico, Eric. Core technology upgrades, branch refurbishment as you mentioned, ATM rollouts, we need to modernize a lot of the ATMs. And so we are proceeding with those planned investments as we work away through the year. I'd say that the pace of new branch construction has been a bit slower than we originally planned, just due to the some start up issues. But we are still on track to incur more than 30% of the total program cash spend this year, 2017. But naturally, due to the fact that some portion of that cash spend is going actually be capitalized. The impact on expenses were lag somewhat and it's going to increase gradually over a full year -- the next couple of years until it's fully reflected in our 2020 results. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : So a couple of more detail oriented questions on the -- on branded card, I just want to make sure I understand some of the numbers and some of what you said. First on the yield, I think you mentioned that you kind of hit a floor at 9.6 and you expect that to increase to the promotional balance on Costco go away and when not. Can you give us a sense of what you expect in terms of the glide path of that number? How that can progress over the second half of the year? And ultimately, what kind of yield you can get in your branded card portfolio? And then on the credit quality, in the branded card, I think you mentioned Costco collections changes the collection process, seasoning what not, influencing the numbers this quarter. And you had about $633 million of net credit loss in branded cards, which the big increase versus 1Q and 3Q. I guess it's fair to say that that's sort of abnormally high and we should expect that run rate to normalize at a lower level in the coming quarters, is that fair? John Gerspach : Yes, let's take the second half first. When you get to credit, the guidance that we've given you that we expect for the full year branded cards and that's branded cards all in to have an NCL rate of about 280 basis points. So, first quarter was 311 basis points, full-year average 280 basis points. So, yes, we expected to decline as we go through the year. And average out of the 280 for the full-year, so first quarter was definitely abnormally high. And again some of that was just that \"Costco bubble.\" We did have some start-up issues with the Costco portfolio. That meant that there was some difficulty people getting set up on payment plans that lead to an increase in delinquencies, we saw the 90 plus day delinquencies grow during the first quarter and then again washed out in first quarter and that's what hit the NCL this quarter. So, absent that whole bubble, the NCL for the branded cards in the first quarter was closing to 290 basis points. So, we feel -- we do feel a little good about that guidance going forward as far as 280 basis points for credit. The question on yield, when it comes to the yield is flattening at 960, and now yes, the expectation certainly is that it does grow. I agree with you that our expectation is that, it does certainly grow, but I'm going to shy away from giving you an absolute number as to what is going to grow to only because there are so many factors that can go into that including the mix of promo balances. And if we end up with some more transactions, those yield figures should -- could possibly come down a bit, but yes, it should grow from here. Saul Martinez : And that starts to really take place in the second half in a more meaningful way? John Gerspach : Yes, again, my expectation is that you should see some increase in yield, first quarter into second quarter, and then you should see a larger increase in the yield second quarter to third quarter. Saul Martinez : And on your Costco portfolio, how is the spend progressing especially the spend outside of Costco? John Gerspach : Again, the spend is doing well, obviously, it\u2019s a little hard for us to compare history right now, because we never seen Costco spend in the first place. We only have portfolio since last June, but the out of store spend is still above that 70% figure. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : I have just two quick questions, I guess maybe in a different way to look at the core accrual NIM that was 340 this quarter. What would that be ex rewards and promotions? John Gerspach : I don\u2019t have that I am sorry. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then, I know you said legal repositioning is actually part of just the ongoing business as the usual now, but previously, you gave a guidance that was about 2.25% of assets as an on going run rate. I mean is that still what you'd consider guidance or is that you expect it to be lower in '17, '18? John Gerspach : No, we had said, I think it was going to be 2% of revenue for 2017, and again that was just a view is to where we thought it was going to be and, but even now we thought was the -- a high figure compared to norm. We said it should reduce then overtime. But I think in terms of it being somewhere in that 2% range in 2017, if you want to think about what\u2019s in that efficiency rate, and if that changes dramatically, we'll say something. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions in the queue at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks. Susan Kendall : Great, thank you all for joining us today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations. Now, again, thanks, we'll talk you soon. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factor section of our 2016 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you Susan, good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $3.9 billion for the second quarter or a $1.28 per share. During the quarter, we saw continued momentum in our businesses with loan and revenue growth across both sides of our house. In global consumer banking, our US retail bank showed significant growth outside of mortgage operations and we saw a 10% revenue growth in branded cards driven by the Costco portfolio. Internationally, we had continued revenue growth in both regions; Latin America where we've been investing in Citibanamex has now had revenue growth and positive operating leverage for five straight quarters. And in Asia we've seen growth in positive operating leverage for four straight quarters. The institutional clients group had a very strong quarter all around. While trading revenues were down 7% from the prior period, which had benefited from a surge of activity following the UK referendum, our banking results were excellent. Investment banking had its best quarter in seven years. Treasury and trade solutions have shown consistent year-over-year growth for over three years now and the private bank had its best quarter in its history. We also generated $4.7 billion of regulatory capital during the quarter and returned over 2 billion of it to our shareholders resulting in a payout ratio over the last 12 months of nearly 90%. During the past year, we've reduced our outstanding common shares by 6% helping to increase our tangible book value per share to $67.32, and that's up 6% from a year ago and 14% higher than two years ago. Even still, our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio has grown to 13%, 150 basis points above the 11.5% we believe we need to prudently operate the firm. That's why our recent CCAR results were so important. Our capital return of $18.9 billion were nearly 130% of consensus estimates of net income enables us to reduce the amount of capital we hold, which will help drive increased returns for our investors. The momentum we established last year has continued throughout the first half of \u201817 with our net income up 6% so far and we continue to show steady progress towards our near-term financial targets. For the first half, our operating efficiency was 58%, our return on assets was 87 basis points, and our return on tangible common equity ex-DTA was 9.7%. Compared with our successful CCAR results, we are on a course to increase both the return on and return of capital for the benefit of our shareholders. We\u2019ll go into a lot more detail on how we're going to pursue both of these objectives when we host our Investor Day in less than two weeks and we look forward to seeing you there. With that John will go through our presentation and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thanks Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, we show total Citi Group results. Net income of $3.9 billion in the second quarter declined 3% from last year, but EPS improved to $1.28 per share driven by a 6% decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $17.9 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting 5% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continue to wind down legacy assets. Expenses were up slightly as higher volume related expenses, performance based compensation, and ongoing investments were largely offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, and cost of credit increased, mostly driven by lower reserve releases versus the prior year as well as higher volumes and NCL rates in consumer. Looking at the first half of 2017, total revenues grew 3% year over year including 7% growth in our consumer and institutional businesses. Total expenses remained flat and net income growth 6% driving a 12% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks. Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year over year to $645 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other. On a sequential basis, we saw particular strength in loan growth this quarter with an increase of $16 billion in our core businesses that was broad-based across regions and products. And finally, deposits grew 2% year over year to $959 billion. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues grew 5% year over year in the second quarter. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 2% from last year driven by lower mortgage revenues. Mortgage revenues declined by roughly $90 million year over year reflecting lower origination activity and higher cost of funds as well as the impact of the previously announced sale of a portion of our mortgage servicing rights. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues were up 7%, driven by continued growth in average loans, deposits, and assets under management as well as a benefit from higher interest rates. We\u2019re continuing to see positive results from the launch of our enhanced Citigold wealth management offering last year, driving growth in both households and balances with higher penetration on investment products. Turning to branded cards, revenues of 2.1 billion grew 10% reflecting the impact of the Costco acquisition as well as modest organic growth in our core portfolios, partially offset by the continued runoff of non-core portfolios. We continue to see strong client engagement in branded cards, with end of period balances up 10% year over year and 4% sequentially. Average card loans were up 1% sequentially, driven by higher transactor balances. Average full rate balances were stable quarter over quarter and we continue to expect growth in these full rate revolving loans with the resulting improvement in yields in the second half of the year as our investments mature. Finally, retail services revenues of 1.6 billion were 4% reflecting loan growth and a favorable prior period comparison. Total expenses for North America Consumer were $2.6 billion, up 6% from last year reflecting the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth, and continued investments partially offset by efficiency savings. We grew our operating margin by 4% year over year, and credit costs of 1.3 billion increased roughly $275 million from the last year. Net credit losses increased to 1.2 billion, driven by the Costco portfolio, organic volume growth, and seasoning as well as the impact of collections activity in retail services. And we build roughly $100 million of loan loss reserves during the quarter. Looking at our current portfolios in more detail, in branded cards, the NCL rate of 2.9% was down from the prior quarter. We continued improvement in delinquencies, in line with our full-year outlook for NCL rate of around 280 basis points. And in retail services, the NCL rate increased to 4.8% reflecting the impact of portfolio seasoning as well as continuing softness in the collections rates we are experiencing once an account reaches mid stage delinquency. We're not seeing any deterioration in the rate of current accounts becoming delinquent. And we continue to expect NCL rates to be seasonally lower in the second half of the year, consistent with the trend we saw in the month of June. However, given the lower collections rate, our full-year NCL rate in retail services will likely be around 460 basis points versus our prior outlook of 435 basis points. On Slide 5, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues grew 5% and expenses were up 3% versus last year, driving an 8% increase in operating margin. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8% driven by a 12% increase in retail banking reflecting continued growth in average loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. Card revenues were down modestly year over year, but improved sequentially as we continue to see improvement in full rate revolving loans trends. Full rate card balances grew slightly year over year this quarter. And with continued momentum we should see revenues growth year over year as we exit the year. And expenses grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth, partially offset by efficiency savings. Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 3% year over year, driven by improvements in cards and wealth management, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Higher card revenues reflecting 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year as well a modest gain from the sale of our merchant acquiring businesses in certain countries. And while retail lending revenue declined versus last year, we saw sequential growth in both revenues and average loans this quarter driven by personal loans. Expenses in Asia grew 3% as volume growth and ongoing investment spending were partially offset by efficiency savings. Total international credit cost grew by $70 million year over year, mostly reflecting reserve builds in the current quarter to support volume growth in Latin America as compared to a net release in the prior year. Slide 6 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail across both cards and retail banking. NCL rates improved in every region this quarter, while delinquency rates remain broadly favorable as well. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 7. Revenues of $9.2 billion, grew 6% from last year, reflecting solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of $4.8 billion were up 13%. Treasury and trade solutions revenues of 2.1 billion grew 3% or 4% in constant dollars, driven by continued volume growth and improved deposit spreads. Investment banking revenues of 1.5 billion were 22% from last year, reflecting strength in equity underwriting and M&A as well as continued momentum in debt underwriting. Private bank revenues of 788 million, grew 17% year over year, mostly driven by loan and deposit growth, improved spreads and increased investment activity. And corporate lending revenues of 477 million or 25% reflecting lower hedging cost as well as the absence of a prior period adjustment for the residual value of a lease financing. While average loans were down modestly year over year, we saw good sequential growth, with volumes up 3% supporting core business activity among our global subsidiary clients. Total markets and security services revenues of 4.4 billion, decreased 5% from last year. Fixed income revenues of 3.2 billion, declined 6%, primarily reflecting lower G10 currencies revenues given lower volatility in the current quarter and a comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago. Our G10 rates business was broadly stable versus last year. And our local markets rates and currencies business was stable as well, as we remained engaged with our corporate clients across our global network. Equities revenues were 11% lower versus last year reflecting episodic activity in the prior period as well as low volatility. Investor client activity in equities remain strong however, with cash equities up year over year as well as continued growth in prime finance revenue and client balances. And finally, in security services, revenues were up 10%, driven by growth in client volumes across our global custody business. We view security services as similar to TTS in many ways, serving as the core operating infrastructure for our investor clients around the world and providing the foundation for broader franchise relationships. Total operating expenses of 5 billion were up 5% year over year as higher incentive compensation, investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of severance, our comp ratio remained at 26%. Looking at the first half of 2017, revenues grew 11% year over year, with broad-based momentum. We continue to grow our network driven businesses in TTS, security services, and rate and currencies as we helped our clients grow and transact around the world. We grew revenues and deepened relationships in our private bank. We continued to support our clients with loan and debt capital markets financing and our franchise strength was evident in more episodic products as we gained significant share in equity underwriting and M&A. We grew the business while maintaining our expense discipline driving nearly 800 basis points of operating leverage. And credit quality remained strong consistent with our target client strategy. Together this drove an improvement in net income of nearly 30% over last year. Slide 8 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $653 million declined significantly from last year, driven by legacy asset runoff and divestiture activity as well as the absence of gains on debt buybacks in the prior year. And expenses were down 24% to $990 million, reflecting the wind down of legacy assets. The pretax loss in corporate and other was roughly $200 million this quarter, better than our prior outlook for a loss of 350 million, mostly due to a benefit from cost of credit related to our legacy mortgage portfolio. Slide 9 shows our net interest revenue and margin insurance split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate/Other. This split between core accrual and trading related net interest revenue has been refined to attribute a slightly higher amount of funding costs to trading related activities under our prior disclosures. As you can see, total net interest revenue was roughly flat year over year in constant dollars at a $11.2 billion as growth in core accrual revenue was offset by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue. Core accrual net interest revenue of 10 billion was up 7% or over $600 million from last year driven by the addition of the Cosco portfolio, organic volume growth, and the impact of rate increases, partially offset by an increase in our FDIC assessment and higher long-term debt. On a sequential basis, core accrual revenue grew by over $200 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the March rate increase and loan growth. However, we still saw decline in the core accrual net interest margin to 344 basis points reflecting higher cash balances. For the first half of 2017, core accrual revenue was up by $1 billion year over year and we expect to see a little more than $1 billion of growth in the remainder of the year. So in total, core accrual net interest revenue should grow by a little more than $2 billion in 2017 over 2016. However as previously noted, we still expect this increase to be offset by a roughly $1 billion decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corporate/Other. And finally we believe it is most relevant to look at trading related net interest revenue in the context of overall trading results. While trading related net interest revenue was down by roughly a third in the first half of 2017, our total equity and fixed income markets revenues grew by 4% year over year. On Slide 10, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio improved to 13% driven mostly by earnings, partially offset by $2.2 billion of common share repurchases and dividends during the quarter. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.2%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 6% to $67.32, in part driven by 6% reduction in our shares outstanding. So to conclude we're seeing momentum across the firm that gives us confidence as we go into the second half of 2017 and beyond. Starting with consumer, in North America, our investments in retail banking are delivering results with revenues excluding mortgage growing by 6% year over year in the first half. Retail services revenues continue to outperform our original outlook for a run rate of $1.5 billion per quarter this year, driven by higher than anticipated loan growth. And finally, in branded cards, we continue to see strong client engagement and balanced growth. In Asia, we generated year over year revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fourth straight quarter, driven by strength in cards and wealth management. And in Mexico, we also generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the fifth straight quarter reflecting momentum in retail banking. On the institutional side as I described earlier, we saw strong performance across the franchise in the first half of 2017 driving double digit revenue growth and nearly 800 basis points of operating leverage. And we're encouraged by the progress we're seeing recurring accrual businesses like TTS, security services, corporate lending and the private bank as well as episodic products like equity underwriting and M&A. As we look to the third quarter in North America consumer, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in retail banking excluding mortgage as well as modest organic growth in cards as we grow full rate balances. Mortgage should continue to be a headwind as we had a particularly strong third quarter last year. And importantly, we expect earnings to grow modestly year over year in North America with continued momentum into the fourth quarter. In international consumer, we expect continued revenue growth and positive operating leverage. And turning to the institutional side, we expect continued year over year revenue growth in our accrual businesses, including PPS, security services, and the private bank. Market revenues will likely reflect a normal modest seasonal decline from the second quarter and investment banking revenues will likely return to a level closer to the first quarter perhaps a little lower assuming a seasonal slowdown in the third quarter underwriting activity. Expenses should decline sequentially. Cost of credit is expected to increase quarter over quarter, driven by the normalization of credit costs in Corp/Other as well as continued volume growth in consumer. And we expect our tax rate to be in the range of around 32% for the second half of the year. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hey John, just quick follow up on the net interest income outlook for the second half for you know more than a billion, slightly more than a billion of growth in net interest income in the second half. What does that assume in terms of the interest rate environment, Fed hikes and also just roughly loan growth assumptions in there? John Gerspach : Well, we've only got one more interest rate hike that we\u2019re assuming for this year and it's in December. So that really isn't going to have much of an impact on that outlook at all. But it is inclusive of loan growth. We continue to see loan growth of you know quite frankly it\u2019s nothing more than we had baked into the outlook that we gave you at the end of the first quarter. John McDonald : And then for you and Mike, I was just wondering do you guys still feel good about the ROTCE targets getting to 10% ex-DTA and 18% and 10% on a fully loaded basis in \u201819, and just maybe a little bit of talk about what you see as the drivers of those ROTCE goals. Do you need to pick up in trading activity or further rate hikes? What are some of the key drivers there? Mike Corbat : We do, we feel I think very good about it. I referenced the metrics in terms of operating efficiencies, returns et cetera in the first half of the year and the momentum that we carried out of the latter half of last year. And then John has set up our expectations for the second half and feel the combination of the levers we have, John, between some revenue growth, between continued expense discipline, and a reasonable environment around cost of credit and obviously meaningful capital return gives us the pathway to hitting those. John Gerspach : Yeah, I mean John, we\u2019ll go into a little bit more detail on that obviously at our Investor Day in 10 days or so. But as Mike said, the drivers, they remain the drivers that we've been talking about all along. It's improving that return of capital and you saw the first indication of that when we got to CCAR results at the end of June. So we anticipate continuing to be able to return the right amount of capital, and we expect consumer to be a driver into the future. When we take a look at the two businesses that we have and we lay it out for you in one of the pages in the back of this deck, consumer for the trailing 12 months in generating an ROTCE of 12.8% and we believe that it should be over time capable of generating returns in excess of 20%, just over 20%. So that's going to be one of the critical drivers, and we'll take you through those details on Investor Day. John McDonald : Okay. We'll look forward to that and then maybe one just quickie on the quarter here John, it looks like for the first half of the year, the DTA utilization has been about 900 million for the first half, a little bit more in the first quarter than the second. What are you thinking about for the rest of the year and I think annually you also talked about 2 to 3 billion as a target, how do you feel about that? John Gerspach : We always talk about $2 billion as our usage coming out of earnings. And so, for the first half of the year we're at $900 million, so we're roughly on pace to utilize that $2 billion for the year. John McDonald : Okay, and you\u2019ve just had some OCI ,swings I guess throughout the year affected it. John Gerspach : First quarter OCI, give it. Second quarter OCI, take it away. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Just maybe we could talk a little bit about the international, it seems like the outlook is improved economically overseas. Are you starting to see some impact from that in terms of growth and with sort of the back up in the yield curves overseas, do you see any help from the rate environment overseas yet or does it have to be more the short end of the curve to help you on that front? Mike Corbat : When you look at - and John and I each referenced the growth - sequential growth and positive operating story continuing in Asia and in Mexico, and I would say that those environments are reasonable environments. Are they growing where we\u2019d like them to grow from a macro perspective? No, we've had downgrades in terms of Mexico growth rates. but again, 8% growth - revenue growth coming out of Mexico in a country that's growing sub 2, again, I think illustrating what we've talked about that we believe over the intermediate longer term, we've got the ability to grow our international front franchises at or in many cases at multiples the pace of domestic growth rates, and the other piece if you look in there is that in Mexico, it's the combination of our retail business in Asia, it is wealth management. And if you look at wealth management AUM throughout year over year and different metrics continuing to attract AUM into the business. So we feel good about the trajectory of those businesses and the ability to continue to get this type of growth. And as we've said, we expect that trend to continue in the near term in the second half of the year. Again, with growth and positive operating leverage. John Gerspach : And Jim, you get a sense of some of the momentum that we're seeing if you look at it in short, we included on Slide 18 of the debt that we just went through in the appendix. And you can see that in so many countries now we're getting growth quarter over quarter, it's that sequential loan growth that is really driving it. And that's a combination of things, as Mike said, its good engagement with the clients, you\u2019re seeing the results of a lot of the repositioning actions that we've been taking and as we reposition portfolios, we started to focus on different types of lending. A lot of it is in Asia specifically. Better use of digital channels to engage with clients. And actually be able to engage with them at the point of making or when they're entering into a store, they're about to make a purchase and we can offer them alternatives. And so you're seeing it. Year-over-year in international, we had 1.3% loan growth. and we have 1.5% loan growth sequentially in the second quarter. So that's one of the reasons why we feel pretty good about the momentum that we're getting there. And it's not just in consume, in similar fashion, we saw good momentum in Asia in particular in ICG business and our corporate lending. And this wasn't lending that was episodic not linked to a deal. This is lending where people were you know taking down loans to address working capital or CapEx needs. So again we feel pretty good about the momentum that we're seeing. Jim Mitchell : And any impact from my other question on rate, from rates, yield curve steeping overseas, obviously that's still very low rates. We still we need to see short rates move up for that to really be an impact. John Gerspach : Well yeah, I mean again we're not counting on that type of environment. So again in the projections that I\u2019ve given you, we're not looking at interest rates suddenly wildly increasing across the board. So it's not rate - our outlook is not rate dependent. I mentioned in the - when I spoke - when I answered John McDonald's question that we\u2019ve got one more rate hike for the US built in and its December of this year. And quite frankly we're assuming one more rate hike in \u201918, one more rate hike in \u201919 and one more rate hike in \u201920. So again, we're not looking as though this is all going to be rate influenced growth. We like the franchise that we built. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: I was hoping you can provide a little more detail on the expense outlook for the back half of the year. I think you said, down versus sorry on the third quarter [indiscernible] down versus 2Q. And you've also talked about full-year efficiency ratio target in the past I think of 58%. So just hoping to elaborate a little bit more on the back half year expense outlook and then what you think of the efficiency side - efficiency ratio? Mike Corbat : We're still targeting, Matt, we're still targeting that full year efficiency rate of 58%. And so on a lot of cases, the expenses -- the expense performance in the tail half of the year is going to be driven by how revenues come up. That's why I'm always a little hesitant to give specific reference, guidance as to expenses more than a quarter out because if revenues go up, we\u2019ll have some increase in expenses, if revenues come down, we\u2019ll manage through that 58% efficiency ratio. Matt O'Connor: And besides expenses tied to revenue, are there some costs that you know are going to drop off, whether it's severance or legal repo embedded in the current run rate or efficiency savings that are lined up. Mike Corbat : Well, we still have is we\u2019ll have the legacy assets continue to wind down, so there would be revenues that run off associated with the wind down of the legacy assets, we\u2019ll have expenses that come up with legacy assets. But that is the kind of things that we baked in and we've been reporting on all along. Obviously, legacy assets now have been further reduced. Now we went into the year with legacy assets you know the assets formerly known as holdings at $54 billion and by the end of June, they were down to $44 billion. So we\u2019ve already had a significant run off in those legacy assets. They'll continue to come down [indiscernible] run off. Legal and repositioning, we would enter the year; I believe we gave you some guidance that we thought that for the year legal and repositioning costs would be running something close to 200 basis points on Citigroup revenues. And we're running a little bit below that right now and I would anticipate probably for the full year legal and repositioning costs are probably going to come in somewhere around maybe 25 basis points less than we had originally guided. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : John, thank you so much for the outlook on net interest income for the back half of the year. I'm wondering if you could give us a little bit more of your insight, two of your peers mentioned that they anticipate corporate or wholesale deposits to outflow as a result of Fed balance sheet reduction. And I'm wondering what Citigroup\u2019s outlook is for - how sensitive your deposit base could be from outflow on the back of Fed balance sheet reduction. John Gerspach : Obviously this whole topic of Fed balance sheet reduction is uncharted territory. It\u2019s a place we've never been before. So it's really hard to say that you've got a model. And it's really hard to say that it's going to have any sort of major impact over the course of the next six months. So we you know we are assuming that as rate increases occur and as the Fed does wind down its balance, we will see betas increase slightly in our corporate side business, but we do not have anything major put into the outlook for the second half of this year. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question and I expect that maybe some of this would be deferred to your Investor Day, but given how much capital that you generate, even if we assume that you can continue to increase your payout from here, you clearly are still well over where you think a normal level of capital would be that's appropriate for your business. And also with regular form, that could even free up even more capital. And I'm wondering Mike, as we look over the next three years, what businesses do you think would -- you would plow in some of this excess capital that you think would be great growth opportunities for Citigroup. Mike Corbat : Well, as you look, I think Erika, they would largely stay consistent with what we've talked about, where you're seeing the growth. So one is, you shouldn't expect any outsized investments. I think what we've talked about is investments as BAU, investments largely being or really exclusively being self funded. But again, we continue to expect to see good growth rates in no particular order in terms of our TTS businesses, what we're doing in the private bank across our retail franchises, around the globe again with an emphasis on things we're doing here in the US and we're going to talk about that quite a bit in terms of Investor Day, the cards investments we've made.  So we don't necessarily see a lot to do there, but we see a trajectory from that in the future. And then, again what we do is we just look at where our clients want to go and be and be there to support them. And so it's difficult to go too far out in terms of exactly what that environment is going to look like because we could have some changes to tax or trade and we'd be in a benefit to be able to or we'd be in a position to be able to help those clients realign their interests and to support them in that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : I had a couple of questions on the retail partner card business, maybe just to start. Wanted to get along as just how the general struggles of traditional offline retailers might be affecting or affect that business in the future, maybe I'll start there and then I have a couple more detailed follow-ups. John Gerspach : So far, we're not really seeing anything like that in the numbers certainly in our business. If you take a look, as I mentioned, our loans are growing nicely in that business right now and we're still seeing very good customer engagement with our retail partner cards. If you take a look in the supplement, you'll see that purchase sales, up 22% sequentially, up 2% year-over-year. So there's no indication yet that we got any sort of impact in our retail services business from that. Brian Foran : Thanks. Two maybe smaller follow-ups. I mean one detail question I get a lot is what happens if a retailer goes bankrupt, so I'm sure every relationship is different, but maybe just, I'm sure you get the question, I mean do chargeoffs spike, is there an offset from RSAs or lower marketing, has the book gone runoff, or can you move it over to a branded offer. So just any thought you can provide there. And then two on the comments around the charge-off guidance, anything that stand out to you why mid-stage collections would be deteriorating for the retail partner book, but not for the Citi printed book. John Gerspach : Yeah. Let\u2019s -- we can get -- we can go anywhere you want in any order. If you stay with what happens if there is a bankruptcy, one of the core competencies that we have in the business is actually helping our clients, when we look at that, our client in retail services is the retailer. And so we're definitely focused on partnering with them and really becoming their partner and advising their approach to selling. We provide them with advanced analytics digital.  Therefore, so, if there is a restructuring that one of our retailers has to go through, we actually think that we can -- we can help them by leveraging our broad set of proprietary loyalty platforms et cetera, et cetera in order to help them through. So I'm not going to say that we look for it as an opportunity, but we actually think that we could be of use there. Plus depending upon the retailer, we also have on average about a third of our book are general purpose cards. So they are cards that are able to be used outside the store as well, which would serve to mitigate then any sort of impact on us. Will I move to collections? Brian Foran : Yeah. Just why you would be showing up in retail partner, but it didn\u2019t seem to be showing up from your departments in branded? John Gerspach : Yeah. And that\u2019s because it really is something that is focused in retail services as opposed to branded and it could be because of the nature of the receivables. With branded, obviously, it's a slightly higher FICO base, but also with branded, you're dealing with -- the average receivable is higher. So retail services tend to have lower -- lower average balances and what we're seeing and one of the reasons for, I mentioned as being a collections issue, we're really not -- normally if you\u2019re facing a credit quality issue, you're going to see deterioration in your early bucket flows. In simple English, you're going to see current accounts moving to delinquency at a faster rate. But we're not seeing that. We've had fairly stable early bucket flows for the past 2.5 years in his business. And I think that's reflective of our continued strong overall borrowing profile in this business. So it doesn't appear to be that we're really seeing a deterioration in the credit quality of what we're booking, but what we are experiencing compared to what we had in prior years is that there's a higher rate of accounts advancing because the later delinquency buckets, once they get to being two or more payments behind and that's really why we're focused on the collections process and we're developing a number of new and enhanced ways to communicate with our customers, using their preferred channel. I was talking to Bill Johnson the other day, we doubled our text messaging rates over the last few months. So we\u2019ve begun to see some evidence of progress, but it's slower than what we had originally targeted and therefore that results in our change in guidance. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : A couple of questions, first of all, just more of a clarification on the guidance of North American consumers. You indicated that earnings should be up moderately I believe year-on-year. Is that from, I guess, there was 780 million and 811 million, 3Q, 4Q of last years. So we should expect some moderate increase versus that threshold. Is that the right way to think about it? John Gerspach : I think I said modest instead of moderate, but yes. Saul Martinez : Okay. Modest. Okay. Fair enough. And if -- okay. So if my math is right, that's still something around the neighborhood of, I don\u2019t know, 130 basis points ROA or so. So you\u2019ll give, I suppose you'll give a more expansive description of the ramp-up you expect in that segment at your Investor Day over the next couple of years. Now, I guess -- and on, secondarily on capital deployment, how -- is it premature to start thinking about M&A as a strategy to deploy excess capital.  It sounded like if from the answer to an earlier question, but you obviously have a ton of excess capital. Can you just share with us how you're thinking about potentially looking at non-organic types of opportunities in terms of whether it be from a product financial return segment strategy. You\u2019ve obviously done Costco in the past, but how do you think about that as part of the toolkit so to speak for capital strategies. John Gerspach : So one is, we\u2019re open to M&A opportunities. Again, you referenced Costco, Best Buy, other things we've done along the way. We clearly have the financial capacity in our capital, our leverage ratios, our balance sheets, but importantly, anything that we do Saul is going to have to be within the target of our footprint, our clients and the businesses we\u2019re in. What you shouldn't expect is that we're going to go out and we're going to go venture into some place or some products that we historically haven\u2019t been. So if some things in footprint, in strategy, the price makes sense, we're happy to go after it. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. Final one, just more of a ticky-tacky question, page I guess 9, the 280 million of NII from legacy assets, is that primarily Brazil and I guess we\u2019re still expecting that transaction to close, is that -- is that the right way to think about that? John Gerspach : Well, it\u2019s a collection of a whole bunch of assets. We still have a sizable mortgage portfolio, US mortgage portfolio in that as well. Saul Martinez : Okay. But some portion of the 280 I guess is -- should be going away in the second half? John Gerspach : I think you should continue to expect that to wind down over time, but it's not all going to go away in the second half, but yes something that we closed Brazil, which we should close during the second half of the year, then a portion of that will go away. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Steven Chubak : John, I had a question on some of the capital targets that were outlined on the call. One of the things that we've been hearing from a lot of folks is just given the strong improvement in your CCAR results, you have some of the benefits outlined in the treasury white paper that was published recently. It does feel to us like the 150 basis points of cushion that you are assuming within your 11.5% target is very conservative and I recognize that it's going to be a multi-year process for you to take your 13% today and bring that down to 11.5% over time, but has your thinking changed or evolved at all with regards to your capital targets? I'm just wondering if there's any flexibility to manage that even lower over time. John Gerspach : Well, over time, if regulatory rules change, sure, we\u2019ll have the ability to manage that overtime. But right now, I\u2019m still comfortable leaving it. We originally started to talk about a range of between 11 and 11.5 and we\u2019re still targeting within that range, but Mike and I being the personality that we are, if there is a range, we\u2019re going to go towards the more conservative end of that range. And so right now, our guidance would be that, we expect to be able to operate prudently at 11.5%. And if there are some clarifications in regulatory rules overtime, then we will definitely adjust that target. Steven Chubak : Understood. And then maybe just one follow-up on leverage exposure. You've spoken in the past about how leverage is not your binding constraint, you see compelling opportunities to deploy some of that excess and we saw a pretty decent uptick in leverage exposure in this quarter and even some last quarter as well. And I'm just wondering which product lines are you deploying that capacity and just given the prospects for some SLR relief, are you seeing any changes in terms of competitive dynamics in some of the more leverage intensive businesses? John Gerspach : Let me start at the back end, no, we're not seeing any change in competitive practices as a result of people thinking that there is going to be changes in the SLR, because again, there's been a paper put out that\u2019s made some proposals, but nothing has been implemented yet. And so we're not going to act on proposals. What's been driving the growth certainly for this quarter, that growth is really, don\u2019t forget, leveraged exposure is off your average balance sheet and our average balance sheet really as a result of a lot of the growth that we had in loans grew during the quarter.  So the single largest driver of that change is the growth in the average balance sheet sequentially. We had our average balance sheet grew by about $40 billion quarter-on-quarter. And if you take a look at the leverage exposure, it grew about $40 billion, $46 billion. So it\u2019s the average balance sheet. So when you think then about, so let\u2019s grow in your average balance sheet, the average balance sheet at 40 billion is about equally split between an FX impact, don't forget the dollar did weaken in the quarter. We had -- we grew cash and then we had growth in loans and some growth in trading assets. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just one more quick one from me, just on liquidity, which has been certainly a popular topic ahead of the fed balance sheet unwind. Looking at your LCR, it's at a very healthy 123% and despite significant cushion, you've talked about resolution planning as a binding constraint on liquidity deployment and I\u2019m just wondering whether you believe or what you think is at least an appropriate LCR target for the firm and how we should think about maybe some excess capacity for deployment as the Fed begins to unwind the balance sheet, maybe providing some opportunities to deploy some of that excess cash in higher yielding MBS? John Gerspach : Yeah. We\u2019re currently, as you say, we\u2019re currently running in that 123ish range and they\u2019d probably tick up a little bit this quarter, I think, closer to 125, when all is said and done. And resolution has been the driving factor in that. So if you look at our balance sheet, during the course of the last year, we\u2019ve had a significant growth in our cash balances. Our cash balance has grown by about $36 billion year-over-year. And since the beginning of this year, it's grown 26 billion and most of that growth is that as we begin to finalize the plans that we had to, in order to come to compliance with what we needed to do for resolution purposes. That is pretty much behind us now. We've filed our plan. We like where we are. We\u2019re -- we\u2019ll see whether or not the Fed and the FDIC hold our plan on the same highest theme that we do. But now that we have built the cash and we\u2019ve built the liquidity, now, we can go about what we normally do and begin to optimize it. So I don't see cash becoming something that we continue to build from here on out. Hopefully, we will be able to take some of that cash down and then put it to other use. Steven Chubak : Okay. But if I am understanding it correctly that your comments John suggest that you need to manage to around 120% liquidity in order to meet the standards for the resolution plan that you hold yourselves to and hopefully the Fed and the FDIC will approve? John Gerspach : I don't want to give a guidance yet, because we haven't come to the conclusion yet of the optimization process. So don't take what I said as guidance other than we would expect that 123 to ultimately be lower. But I\u2019m not ready to give you a number yet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a question or two on the loans and the loan yield. You guys showed your pretty good loan growth and -- but yet, you did mention that loan yields were down a little bit and you had some mix as far as the NIM is concerned, but I'm just wondering can you help us distill whether the [indiscernible] loan yields was related to the ongoing corporate other runoff and/or is there just a different mix in terms of, it looks like it's card that's growing the most. I'm just wondering what's happening underneath the surface, especially with a couple of rate hikes in between the last couple of quarters? Mike Corbat : So there are several underlying stories that go in there and you\u2019re touching on a couple of them. Certainly when you take a look at overall NIM or overall yield, then that definitely gets impacted by the run-off of legacy assets, because those are for the most part higher yielding assets. So that's one. We had -- the loan growth and don\u2019t forget, our NIM statistics are all quoting average balances and so therefore the $16 billion of loan growth that I talked about as being there for end of period loan to end of period loan, a lot of that came on during the quarter.  So we don't have the full quarter benefit of that. It's in the end of period numbers, but we roughly got $9 billion to $10 billion of growth in our average balance sheet. And it\u2019s the average loans that\u2019s actually then going to drive your NIM. In some of the cases, when you look at cards and we quoted that the increase of $1 billion in average loans was really driven by Transactor account, so we don't get any loan yield off of that. But we like the business that we've been putting on.  We certainly would rather have loan growth than not loan growth. Importantly, the loan growth that we\u2019re putting on, like I said, it is widespread. It is spread nicely across regions. It\u2019s spread nicely across products and it\u2019s all in support of client related activities. And therefore, look at the earnings, not only that we get on the loan itself, but the earnings that will provide us by further deepening the relationship that we have with each of our clients, whether that be a consumer client or a corporate client. Ken Usdin : Right. Okay. Understood. And then just one follow-up on the card business. It's kind of goes -- it's also a piecemeal one, but simply your net credit margin in both retail and in branded cards, as you've talked, has continued to go down and you're talking about that inflection. So are we close to the bottom in the net credit margin for both of those businesses and how do you expect that to traject? John Gerspach : Yeah. I mean obviously a little bit of that from retail services is going to depend on just how quickly then our collection efforts are able to stem the tide of the NCL. But I would anticipate certainly in branded cards that we are either at or very close to the bottom of that NCL decline. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Moving over to the institutional clients group, your investment banking numbers were very strong, the growth in ECM. Can you share with us, was it more market driven or have you hired some folks in the last 12 months or 18 months and now they're bringing revenues in? Mike Corbat : Gerard, I think it's a combination of those things. We've brought in some good people, very good people. Again, we know in ECM, in M&A, it\u2019s your sectors, it's the calendar, it's the backlog. And I would say that obviously a pretty slow start to the first half of last year, obviously a much better start to the first half of this year. And I think the activities in sectors that we've got good positioning and came through in the numbers and again not just in equity, but as well as in debt and as well as in M&A. John Gerspach : Yeah. I think this is exactly what we've been working on for the last several years is that that old story. We've worked the last three years to become an overnight success and that\u2019s, when you look at it, we've been talking to you about adding talent, enhancing our industry coverage. It actually goes back to one of the changes that Mike made when Mike came in as CEO, where with he and Jamie, they decided to reduce the number of corporate clients that we had in our coverage. So we've taken our client coverage down from 32,000 clients down to 14,000 clients.  So it\u2019s more focused coverage, which allows you to have better understanding of your clients and your clients see that you\u2019ve got better understanding, you're in a better position then to serve them. And I think you\u2019re seeing a combination of client segmentation, adding the appropriate talent and three years of hard work and again, it\u2019s things that we\u2019ve been building up to. I think even more impressive perhaps than the result that you see in the second quarter is when you combine it with the first quarter and take a look at the first half results, because now for the first half, year-over-year, our advisory revenues are up 20%, our ECM revenues are up 82% and our DCM revenues are up 21%.  So when we look at it, we think we've gained 100 basis points of market share in the last six months when you compare 2017 compared to where we were in 2016. Now, as I said in the media call earlier, I don't want you to count on the fact that we're going to gain 100 basis point of market share every six months, but we do like the momentum that we've got building in our investment banking capabilities and we've got great confidence in the team that we've got on the field and obviously so do our clients. Gerard Cassidy : And to follow-up on comments you made in your prepared remarks, John, we recognize seasonality affects third quarter results. Keeping that in mind, how is the pipeline, when you look at maybe versus third quarter last year, which would reflect an apples-to-apples comparison for seasonality. John Gerspach : Yeah. I would say that we are in a stronger position as far as our engagement with clients. You don't have to look much further than the fact that in announced M&A, I believe now that we\u2019re a number 2 in the league tables. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Coming back to the trading part, you mentioned that the FIC revenues were down due to G10 Rates or G10 Governments. Can you give us some color -- John Gerspach : [indiscernible]. If that\u2019s what I said, then I completely misspoke, because FIC revenues are down really because of G10 FX. It\u2019s really all FX related. Our G10 rates is basically stable year-over-year, which is a great performance in the market environment that we've had. So when we look at the decline in FIC revenues, again, year-over-year, in the second quarter, it's really, the lion's share of it is being driven by G10 FX is reflecting a low volatility that I think everyone has spoken about in the market. When you take a look at our G10 Rates business, fairly stable; our local markets rate business, fairly stable; our local markets currency business, fairly stable; spread products, fairly stable. Gerard Cassidy : Yes, it was my error, but that's the color I needed. I was hoping you're going to give us -- very good. John Gerspach : Well, you certainly got me there quickly. Gerard Cassidy : I wanted to make sure you're listening. On a bigger question, the treasury came out with obviously their report on some changes they think would make sense to the banking system from a regulatory standpoint. If you guys had [indiscernible] and had to pick one or two that would benefit you the most, what would it be in those recommendations that treasury had, whether it\u2019s SLR or any of the other types of issues they brought up? Mike Corbat : I think one that we talk pretty publicly about, we've talked to Treasury about it and it's included in there. One is, for us and I think for a number of the other banks, it's likely that CCAR is going to stay the binding constraint and around anything that's a binding constraint, you just need more transparency. So we'd like more granularity in terms of some of the numbers and have the ability to explore some of the approaches that the Fed has and because Secretary report came back, that's one of the recommendations that they have. I would say things in there ranging from how do we think about, how do we bring together LCR and SLR and get some of the inconsistencies out. We have no issue from a headline perspective with Volcker, but the fact that we do five -- that there's five agencies empowered and they all believe that they have the voice at the table around it obviously creates conflict disagreement and from our side, certainly creates a lot of work. The good news I think in most of the paper is that the things that are in there don't require changes of law to implement. So hopefully as we get people in the seats, some of the heads of the agencies start to come together. We can actually start to effect some of this change, which hopefully we can start to make some meaningful progress on hopefully in the fourth quarter of this year. John Gerspach : As Mike said, some of the more common sense type of proposals, you\u2019ve referenced the SLR. Eliminating the need to hold capital against cash and things like that, that would definitely be something that would I think be the right way to think about. Mike Corbat : Viewing the dividend is something you can\u2019t turn off. And again, all the good news is all these things are mentioned. John Gerspach : Not assuming that your balance sheet is going to grow in times of stress. These are all very commonsensical changes that will be beneficial and I don't think it would impact safety and soundness at all. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : So just two quick questions. On Korea, I noticed that the loans were down quarter-on-quarter, even though you mentioned the strength in Asia and also there\u2019s an agreement to close a lot of branches there. Could you just give us some updated thought on the market, because that\u2019s how we\u2019ve gotten past the point where there was regulatory headwinds and we were looking for growth again? Is that not the right way to think about that market? John Gerspach : So in Korea, as we\u2019ve said, we announced the fact that we\u2019re repositioning that business, we're taking the light physical footprint in a much more agile approach to things as we move forward consistent with the way we're approaching other markets. So that is having a little bit of disruption there, but we think it's the right thing to do going forward. We will be closing 90 something branches over the course of time and concentrating the branches in more of the wealth centers, so it's having an impact there, and we\u2019re also transitioning out of being heavily reliant on the mortgage product in Korea into much more of a personal installment loan product. So you're just seeing that in the results, but you'll notice that the portfolio itself is still holding up fairly well. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then you also mentioned that you were pleased with the success of Citigold in North America. I mean is this just using Citigold to get back into the wealth management business? John Gerspach : Citigold is really targeted at being a wealth management business. It\u2019s the way that we really run the retail operation in Asia and so what we have really done is imported a lot of the techniques that we've been using in Asia for the last five or six years and reintroduced them into the US. We didn't have the capability of really doing that before, much before last year as we were still trying to get all of our North America consumer systems on a common platform, so we can have one broad view of our client.  It's hard to manage somebody from a client relationship when you've got one system that has their retail deposits, another one that has their credit card and another one that has their mortgage, another one that has their investment assets. We've now been able to bring all that together, it's given us a much better view of the client. That's been able now to give us a much better ability to actually segment the clients. And so when you think about the fact that we really just launched Citigold in November or re-launched it in November of last year, the progress that we've made in the last seven months is pretty encouraging. Brian Kleinhanzl : I guess the question is, are you just rebuilding a business that you sold Smith Barney several years ago. John Gerspach : No. Not at all. Smith Barney was not a Citigold type of -- Smith Barney could have been a piece of a Citigold offering, but Smith Barney just didn't fit with us. What makes this thing work is that there's great cooperation between the investment management people and the bankers and you really need that in order to grow a Citigold type of business, because you want to encourage deposits and you want to encourage lending and you want to encourage assets under, growth in assets under management, you want to be able to pull all of those levers, whatever makes sense for the client. Mike Corbat : And I think the other piece Brian that's important is the operating account, where the stickiness and what it means to have the relationship steeped in an operating account, in the depository account where very, very, very often you would actually see -- in a Smith Barney relationship, you would actually see the operating account actually at another institution. We hear it kind of comes from the operating account and again, you can look at the numbers we publish in terms of the deposit balances, the average deposit balances in our Citigold account. And so there are opportunities there in that diversification away from the pure deposit relationship to investments into broader lending and investing type products. So I think there's some reasonable difference to it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Adam Hurwich with Ulysses. Adam Hurwich : A quick question, John. Doesn\u2019t make sense, I\u2019m following upon your comments on cards. So does it make sense to look at transaction volumes as a ratio of balances and if it does, how should we look at that going forward? Mike Corbat : Adam, this is why I always love talking to you. I hadn\u2019t thought of it that way before. So before I answer it, let me think about that and I\u2019ll get back to you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Al Alevizakos : I've got two questions for you. First question is on the treasury and trade solutions. I've realized that there's no real benefit so far from the interest rates improvement. Therefore, I would like to know whether there is any downward pressure from something else that we actually don't see since it's only a one-liner.  And secondly, since we're in Europe, we would like to know whether there's any comment regarding the trading performance regarding the separate region, so whether you've seen any kind of obvious trends, any different trends in the US versus Europe or versus Asia. Mike Corbat : Okay. Let me start with the second one. There is certainly strong trading results coming out of EMEA. Again, we look at the entirety of the region, so I can't be specific to Western Europe, but definitely stronger trading results in EMEA and again that is certainly stronger there than we would have seen, we had decent results in Latin America, decent results in Asia, but good strength coming out of EMEA. As far as the first question, when we look at TTS, we definitely did get a benefit. TTS remains, as I said, a foundational business for our institutional strategy. So that still is good.  The revenue growth did slow a little bit this quarter to 4% as opposed to where we were running before, but we had seen growth rates of 6% or more. So there was some pressure that we saw on deposit pricing, but nothing out of the ordinary. Again, as you get into the later stages of rate hikes, you're going to see increases in your betas and that's embedded in all of our models. So nothing there. Importantly, what we continue to see in TTS is we're continuing to gain share in SWIFT volumes and chip volumes and importantly in commercial card volumes. So we think that that business is one that should continue to grow for us, although it's probably going to be more in that 4% to 5% growth range. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to Ms. Susan Kendall. Susan Kendall : All right. Thanks to all of you for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to me and my team. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Jamie. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including without limitation, the Risk Factor section of our 2016 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you Susan and good morning everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.1 billion for the third quarter of 2017 or a $1.42 per share including the impact of the sale of our fixed income analytics business. We delivered a very strong quarter showing the balance of our franchise by both product and geography and highlighting our multiple engines of client-led growth. We have revenue increases in many of the product areas we have been investing in, tightly managed our expenses, and again saw loan and deposit growth in both our consumer and institutional businesses. We've made progress towards the targets we discussed on Investor Day in terms of ROTCE 9.8% ex-DTA year-to-date and efficiency ratio of 57% year-to-date and we also returned over 6 billion of capital to our shareholders this quarter. Turning to our businesses, in global consumer banking we generated revenue growth and positive operating leverage in all three regions Asia, Latin America, and North America. In the U.S. retail banking and retail services both had growth and while we didn't see the year-over-year revenue growth we\u2019d anticipated in branded cards, we did show good sequential growth at 5% driven by growth in full rate balances and strong client engagement. Our institutional clients group again delivered excellent results and continued to gain wallet share as a result of our efforts to deepen our relationships with our target clients. Treasury and trade solutions grew 8% and we saw double digit growth across investment banking, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services. While total trading revenues were down by 11%, trading activity was better than we had anticipated earlier in the quarter and equity was up 16%.  You can also see the impact of our $19 billion capital plan during the quarter. We generated $4.7 billion of regulatory capital during the quarter driven by earnings and DTA utilization. And we returned 6.4 billion of capital to our shareholders enabling us to begin to reduce the amount of capital we hold. Year-to-date payout is nearly 100%. Including the impact of repurchasing over 80 million shares during the quarter, we reduced our common shares outstanding by over 200 million or 7% over the past year. We've reduced our common equity tier one capital ratio to 13%, still 150 basis points above the 11.5% we believe we need to prudently operate the firm. Given the amount of stock repurchasing power in our capital plan, we remain committed to reaching that level over time. Overall we continue to make progress in increasing both the return on and return of capital for our investors. The macro environment remains a largely positive one, growth while not as high as we would like remains consistent and we don't see too many economies in distress. However, while geopolitical tensions don't seem to have weighed on growth at least as of yet, I don't know how long that can continue. And while tax reform remains a question mark we do like the direction the administration is going in terms of regulation which we see as just a course to accommodate higher growth rather than a full scale regulatory repeal agenda. With that John will go through our presentation and then we'll be happy to answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Hey, thanks Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide 3, we showed total Citigroup results. Net income of $4.1 billion in the third quarter grew 8% from last year including a $580 million pretax gain on the sale of yield book, a fixed income analytics business which benefited EPS by $0.13 per share. Excluding the gain, EPS of $1.29 grew by 4% driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.2 billion grew 2% from the prior year reflecting the gain on sale as well as 3% total growth in our consumer and institutional businesses. Offset by lower revenues in Corporate/Other as we continue to wind down legacy assets. Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as higher volume related expenses and investments were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased mostly reflecting volume growth, seasoning, hurricane and earthquake related loan loss reserve builds and additional reserve builds in North America cards which I'll cover in more detail shortly. In total we've built $100 million of hurricane and earthquake related loan loss reserves across North America and Latin America GCB as well as the legacy portfolio in Corporate/Other.  Year-to-date total revenues grew 3% year-over-year including 7% total growth in our consumer and institutional businesses. Total expenses remained flat and net income grew 7% driving a 13% increase in earnings per share including the impact of share buybacks. In constant dollars Citigroup end of period loans grew 2% year-over-year to 653 billion as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other. GCB and ICG loans grew by $26 billion in total with contribution from every region and consumer as well as TTS, the private bank, and traditional corporate lending.  Turning now to each business, slide 4 shows the results for North America consumer banking. Total revenues grew 1% year-over-year and 5% sequentially in the third quarter. Retail banking revenues of 1.4 billion grew 1% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues declined significantly, mostly reflecting lower origination activity. However we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 12% driven by continued growth in loans and assets under management as well as the benefit from higher interest rates. We're continuing to see positive results from the launch of our enhanced Citigold Wealth Management offering driving growth in both household and balances with improving penetration of investment products.  Turning to branded cards, revenues of $2.2 billion were down slightly from last year. Client engagement continues to be strong with average loans growing by 8% and purchase sales up 10% year-over-year. We generated year-over-year growth in full rate revolving balances in our core portfolios. However non-core balances continued to run off as expected. And we face continued headwinds from growth in transactor and promotional balances which we are funding at a higher cost versus last year given the higher interest rate environment. Full rate revolving balances which had been flat since the beginning of the year began to grow this quarter as new loan vintages matured and started to accrue interest. This drove 5% sequential growth in revenues this quarter. However, it was not sufficient to deliver year-over-year growth.  Relative to our expectations going into 2017, we're seeing solid revenue growth in several products including Costco and Double Cash. However in aggregate we are seeing slower than anticipated revenue growth in our proprietary business mostly driven by a higher mix of promotional balances in our portfolio. Finally retail services revenues of 1.7 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America in consumer were $2.5 billion down 5% from last year as higher volume related expenses and investments were more than offset by efficiency savings. Digital engagement remained strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users including 22% growth among mobile users versus last year. We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost digital channels. For example, increasing e-statement penetration and lowering call center volumes while improving customer satisfaction.  Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by over $300 million year-over-year reflecting the acquisition of the Costco portfolio which did not incur losses in the third quarter of last year, episodic charge offs in the commercial portfolio which were offset by related loan loss reserve releases this quarter, and overall portfolio growth and seasoning. We also built $460 million of loan loss reserves with a roughly $500 million reserve build in cards being partially offset by the reserve release in commercial banking. The reserve build in cards was comprised of roughly $150 million for volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios, $50 million related to the estimated impact of the hurricanes, and about $300 million to cover our forward-looking NCL expectations. About two thirds or $200 million of this amount related to retail services where we could see the NCL rate increase from 470 basis points in 2017 to roughly 500 basis points next year. And the remainder is attributable to branded cards where we expect the NCL rate of 285 basis points this year to rise by about 10 basis points in 2018. On slide 5 we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In total, revenues grew 5% and expenses were up 4% versus last year driving a 6% increase in operating margin. In Latin America total consumer revenues grew 4% year-over-year. This is somewhat slower than recent periods driven in part by lower industry wide deposit growth this quarter which we expect to recover as we go into year-end. Card revenues grew slightly year-over-year on continued improvement in full rate revolving loan trends. And expenses also grew 4% in Latin America reflecting ongoing investment spending and business growth partially offset by efficiency savings. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 5% year-over-year driven by improvement in wealth management and cards, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Higher card revenues reflected 6% growth in average loans and 7% growth in purchase sales versus last year. And while retail lending revenues declined versus last year we saw a sequential revenue growth again this quarter. Expenses in Asia grew 4% as volume growth and ongoing investment spending were partially offset by efficiency savings. Total international credit costs grew 4% year-over-year mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning in Latin America. Slide 6 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter. In North America the sequential increase in the NCL rate reflects the commercial charge offs I noted earlier while the NCL rate declined in both card portfolios. Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 7, revenues of $9.2 billion grew 9% from last year reflecting the previously mentioned gain on sale as well as continued solid progress across the franchise. Total banking revenues of 4.7 billion grew 11%, treasury and trade solutions revenues of 2.1 billion were up 8% reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads. Growth in TTS was balanced across net interest and fee income with fees up 9% on higher payment, clearing, and commercial card volumes as well as higher trade fees. Investment banking revenues of 1.2 billion were up 14% from last year with a wallet share gains across debt and equity underwriting and M&A. Private Bank revenues of 785 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investment activity and deposits, as well as improved spreads. And corporate lending revenues of 502 million were up 14% reflecting lower hedging costs and improved loan sale activity. We continued to see strong engagement with our global subsidiary clients this quarter as they borrowed to support core business activities. Total markets and security services revenues of 4.6 billion grew 3% including the gain on sale. Fixed income revenues of 2.9 billion declined 16% on lower G10 rates and currencies revenues given low volatility in the current quarter and the comparison to higher Brexit related activity a year ago as well as lower activity in spread products. Our local markets rates and currencies business grew modestly as we remained engaged with our corporate clients across our global network.  Equities revenues were up 16% reflecting client led growth across cash equities, derivatives, and prime finance. And finally in security services revenues were up 12% driven by growth in client volumes across our custody business along with higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of 4.9 billion increased 5% year-over-year as investments and volume related expenses were partially offset by efficiency savings. On a trailing 12 month basis, excluding the impact of severance and the gain on sale, our comp ratio remained at 26%.  On a year-to-date basis ICG revenues of $28 billion grew by 10%, even while trading revenues remained flat to last year. We generated half of our revenues in banking which grew 13% on continued momentum in TTS, investment banking, the private bank, and corporate lending. And we're seeing strong growth in security services as well which we view is similar to TTS in many ways as a foundation for developing broader relationships with our investor clients. Slide 8 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of 509 million declined significantly from last year driven by legacy asset runoff, divestitures, and the impact of hedging activities. Expenses were down 36% reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and lower legal expenses. And the pretax loss in Corporate/Other was roughly $260 million this quarter. We believe this level of $250 million to $300 million of pretax loss per quarter is a fair run rate to expect for Corporate/Other through 2018. Slide 9 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading related revenue, and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corporate/Other. As you can see total net interest revenue declined slightly from last year to 11.4 billion as growth in core accrual revenue was outpaced by the wind down of legacy assets as well as lower trading related net interest revenue. Core accrual net interest revenue of 10.4 billion was up 5% or $450 million from last year driven by the impact of higher rates and volume growth, partially offset by a higher level of long-term debt.  On a sequential basis core accrual revenue grew by nearly $350 million this quarter reflecting day count, the impact of the June rate increase, loan growth, and mix. Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by $1.5 billion year-over-year and we expect to see roughly $500 million of additional growth in the fourth quarter. However, on a full year basis we expect this increase to be offset by a roughly $900 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corporate/Other. On slide 10, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 13% as net income was more than offset by $6.4 billion of common share buybacks and dividends. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7.1% and our tangible book value per share grew by 6% year-over-year to $68.55 driven by a 7% reduction in our shares outstanding. As we look to the fourth quarter, in consumer we expect continued modest year-over-year revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both North America and international consumer. In total we have achieved sequential growth in pretax earnings in global consumer banking for the last two quarters and we expect this to continue in the fourth quarter.  On the institutional side we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in our accrual businesses including TTS, the private bank, corporate lending, and security services. Market revenues will likely reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third quarter. And investment banking revenues should be similar to this quarter assuming a continued favorable environment. We remain on track to achieve an efficiency ratio of 58% for the full year and cost of credit in the fourth quarter should be broadly in line with the third quarter driven by the normalization of credit cost in ICG offset by lower reserve builds in consumer. Finally we expect our tax rate to remain at around 31% in the fourth quarter and with that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hey, thanks very much. A couple of quickies if I could on cards, the first one on just the average yields being about in line year-on-year. You mentioned balance transfer is still part of the mix, is -- our balance transfers some are rolling off but are you rolling new ones on, I'm just curious on what you're doing there? John Gerspach : Yeah Glenn, we are definitely rolling on new promotional balances. Glenn Schorr : And is that branded and Costco or is it more on the branded side? John Gerspach : Well Costco is part of branded but I think maybe the best way to think about this is if you take a look at what's going on with branded cards revenues in general. I think there is three factors that you need to discuss in order to explain where we are with the cards revenue growth. And the first is that as we saw the competitive dynamics and the rewards offerings in the U.S. heat up late in 2016. At that time we made a conscious decision to shift our acquisition program away from rewards oriented products and more towards value products. Now value products as we've been discussing, those typically feature a promotional period and so this change in tactics combined with the fact that the initial response to our value acquisition offerings was even stronger than we anticipated has resulted in a higher amount of these non-yielding promotional balances in our portfolio. And based upon the performance of the earlier vintages we expect these promotional balances will generate growth and full rate balances but, in the near-term we're seeing a dampening effect on revenues caused by this shift in focus. So that's one factor.  Then secondly there's also a dampening effect on the revenues against where we anticipated just caused by the higher rates. If you remember when we went into the year, our planning was based upon one 125 basis point hike in rates in the U.S. during 2017 and in fact so far we've seen two. And while the higher rates are overall accretive to the U.S. consumer business we've also talked about the fact that higher funding rates increase the near-term revenue drag caused by promotional balances. So that's the second factor. Now as late as June we believe that despite the drag of the higher promo balances and the higher funding rates we'd still be in position to deliver at least some level of year-over-year revenue growth in the U.S. brand cards beginning in the third quarter. However this is where the third factor comes into play.  Beginning in July we saw a slight uptick in the overall payment rate across the proprietary portfolio but while small it was just enough to take us from a small increase in revenue year-over-year to a small decrease. So three factors; change in acquisition focus, slightly higher interest rates, and a slight increase in payment rates that have combined to result in the third quarter 2017 branded card revenues to be just below the level that we had in third quarter 2016. Glenn Schorr : Okay, I definitely appreciate all that detail John. Are you seeing actual organic growth outside, I guess it's tough to differentiate given your strategy but are you seeing actual organic growth in Costco? John Gerspach : Absolutely, Costco remains a real winner. We've continued to be able to grow account balances, we've seen continued growth in the purchases. So it's still looking like an absolute winner for us. Glenn Schorr : And just last one cleaning up, were there any sales of the liquid loans in the quarter that we should know about? John Gerspach : Just the normal level that we would do every quarter. There was always a small amount but there's nothing unusual this quarter. Glenn Schorr : Okay, thanks for all that John. John Gerspach : Not a problem Glenn. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning John. I wanted to ask about the retail services business on the private label card. You mentioned the loss rate there could go to 5% from 470 this year, just kind of wondering what you're seeing, are you still seeing kind of roll rates deteriorate a bit from initial delinquency, the charge off and is that what you're kind of building into that outlook for next year? John Gerspach : Yeah, that's it exactly, John. It's exactly what we've been talking about for the last nine months or the last three quarters. And while we've seen some improvement in those later stage delinquency bucket roll rates, it's still higher than what we thought it was going to be. So that's what is feeding into that. It has fed into the increased guidance that we've given you during the course of the year driving another 2017 expected NCL rate from 435 basis points coming in to the year to 470 basis points now. And so you know, reflecting about a 30 basis points, 30-35 basis point increase where we otherwise would have expected retail services to be in 2018. John McDonald : And is that what the reserving action this quarter brings you to see if you kind of reserved for that outlook of 5% now? John Gerspach : Yeah, maybe if you want I'll go through both branded cards and retail services because it's the same three factors that impact both of them. So when you think about the branded cards, LLR build up, you know, we built about $200 million of the LLR of that 500 in branded cards. And there's about on a normal basis given growth and seasoning in branded cards we probably have about $50 million to $100 million in the quarter. So figuring the midpoint to be about 75, we added $25 million of reserves to cover our estimated impact of the hurricanes. And then finally in branded cards we're looking at an NCL rate of about 10 basis point growth next year and that will go from about 285 this year to 295 next year. That's a little bit higher than what we had previously considered.  It's still in line with our long-term 300 to 325 basis points but we'll probably get to 295 next year. You take a 10 basis point increment in your NCL rate, multiply it by an $85 billion loan portfolio, adjust that for 14 to 15 months of coverage and that adds about $100 million accrual on to branded cards. So overall, 75 that I would consider to be normal, 25 for hurricanes, and 100 just to adjust to that forward look. So when you think about that forward look maybe perhaps we could have taken more of a wait and see approach over the next several quarters but our assessment was that it was appropriate to take that reserve build now. So all things being equal I'd expect that the fourth quarter reserve build would be back in that range of $50 million to $100 million in branded cards that we would consider to be more normal.  And then if you move over to retail services, it is similar to what we just went through with branded cards. We had that $300 million reserve build in retail services and again if you look at retail services, the normal reserve build there is again kind of in that $50 million to $100 million range. And with retail services we'd likely be in the upper end of that range right now, just given the volume build that we've seen. So call that 90, 85, 100 somewhere in that range. Then there's another $25 million for hurricanes that we've put away in retail services to cover the estimated losses that we think could occur.  And then again as we look forward and we think about the NCL rate next year being 30 to 35 basis points higher than what we had previously thought about, again you take 30 to 35 basis points, multiply it by a current $46 billion portfolio, adjust that for a 14 to 15 month coverage period and that gets you the extra $200 million reserve build there. So $75 million to $80 million to $100 million for normal; 25 for hurricanes, 200 for the forward look that gets you to that 300 to 320 that gets in the supplements. And again just like in branded cards perhaps we could have taken more of a wait and see approach but we thought it was appropriate to take the reserve build now.  And again all things again being equal with retail services I'd expect that we'd be back in that upper end of that $50 million to $100 million normal range in the fourth quarter. Let me just finish it because if we\u2019re adjusting that range up to 500 basically basis points of losses in retail services in 2018, we're also going to take the medium term view of retail services up from where we have talked about on Investor Day of being about 500 basis points to be more in the range of 510 to 525 basis points. So again, not a big change but we're going to make that change in the forward guidance. John McDonald : Okay, that's very helpful, appreciate the detail there. And just one quick strategic question on retail services, is this a portfolio and a business that you're looking to grow, do you see that growing or adding new partners or growth within the existing partners or is it something that probably feels pretty stable over the next few years? John Gerspach : I think it's an area John if opportunities present themselves as we've seen in Best Buy and other and if portfolios make sense we clearly got the capital balance sheet, liquidity capacity, and if the returns makes sense we\u2019d be happy to take them on. John McDonald : And without new -- without acquisitions or anything does that grow or does it stay pretty stable? John Gerspach : Well we think it's a growth business and again if you measure it in revenue John it's a little hard and I think we touched on this a little bit in Investor Day. It's a difficult business to measure just based upon revenue growth only because with so many of the partner relationships that we have we end up with performance sharing agreements and those performance sharing agreements, now the accounting for that all runs through revenue. So your revenue as your NCLs go up or down that impacts the performance of the business, that ends up in your revenue number. So that's why over time you might only look at that as being a 1% revenue growth business. But we like the growth aspects on pretax earnings. So we think it's a really good business and unfortunately with those performance sharing arrangements that tend to obscure the true revenue trends and even in the near-term economics we end up having to build the loan loss reserves for all the NCL's that we're going to incur in that business even though some of those NCLs ultimately as they\u2019re realized will go into the performance sharing arrangement and so it's actually our partners that will actually bear a significant percentage of those NCLs. John McDonald : Got it, got it, so the pretax is the best way to track that? John Gerspach : That -- I would say the best measure is probably pretax earnings less the LLR. John McDonald : Got it, okay thanks guys. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Michael Corbat : Hey Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hey John, just a clarification, did you say that you expect NII to see an additional growth of 500 million in the fourth quarter? John Gerspach : I did, year-over-year. Jim Mitchell : Oh, year-over-year. John Gerspach : We expect year-over-year growth to be $500 million in the quarter. If you remember Jim when we, as we've been talking about growth in net interest revenue year-over-year we've been focused on that core accrual line and we said that in the second half of the year we would expect that to grow about a billion dollars year-over-year and we saw a $450 million in the third quarter and we're looking at $500 million in the fourth quarter. So we\u2019re roughly in line with that billion dollars that we talked about back in July. Jim Mitchell : Right, okay, fair enough. Maybe sticking with sort of NII maybe a little bit of a longer-term outlook in cards, your net interest margin there which you have obviously gone on through in detail and what\u2019s been impacting is, I think you are down about 8.6% this quarter. A year ago it was closer to 9.4%. When do we start to see or if you have a sense of when that starts to flatten in, can you get back to that 9% plus number over time? John Gerspach : Well we opened a number that we settle on, is going to be really determined based upon the overall portfolio mix between the branded proprietary portfolio, the co-brand cards, and everything else. So I don't want to give you a long-term target on the average yield. We have given you the target that we believe that branded cards in the medium term should produce about 215 basis points of ROA and that includes yield assumption, that includes our forward look of NCL rate of 300 to 325 basis points. I don't want to start giving guidance Jim on every little line item that comprise the cards performance. Jim Mitchell : But we can ask anyway. And maybe just one question on the capital return. It looks like you did about a third of your total CCAR number in the quarter, it seemed obviously a little bit of a faster pace which you front loaded it a little bit. Does that imply that there's a little more flexibility with the Fed in terms of doing more up front, how do we think about your flexibility if you see an opportunity to buy stock, can do more than just a quarter's worth in a quarter? John Gerspach : When banks file their capital plans, the capital return is approved not just based upon the full year but it actually is quarter by quarter. So we have to lay out what our estimated capital returns will be for each quarter and then we need to live within that whole budget for each quarter. So we've got some flexibility but it has to be within the quarterly numbers that we have told the Fed that we're planning for. Jim Mitchell : Okay, got it. Thanks. John Gerspach : No problem, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Foran with Autonomous. Brian Foran : Hi, good morning. Michael Corbat : Hey, Brian. Brian Foran : Just maybe a last one on this consumer credit issue, I mean when we looked at the medium term global consumer banking net loss rate you gave at Investor Day of 2.20 to 2.40, is everything you're seeing right now not just in retail card but pulling up across all the businesses is still consistent with that ranges, some of this pushing the range, what would be your mark-to-market on that to 2.20 to 2.40 guidance? Michael Corbat : You know the only thing that we've seen so far that would cause us to change any guidance would be in retail services where again we're guiding up from roughly 5% and then we had it in there a little bit higher than 5% to 5.10% to 5.25%. So, we are -- I haven't seen, to be honest with you Brian, I have not taken a look at how that, whether that drives us more towards the upper end of that guidance, it keeps us within that guidance though. Brian Foran : Thanks and then maybe a question I get a lot, I know it's a little bit of a lost cause to forecast trading related NII -- I can't be forecasting rating so, but like why is it down across the whole industry not just you so much, is it just simply trading books are liability sensitive so, there's a little bit of give back there or why are we seeing these trade related NII numbers come under so much pressure? John Gerspach : It has to do with the instruments that you're using in any given quarter to help position your clients appropriately, how you hedge, what instruments you used to hedge the position. And so some of the instruments that you use are mark-to-market instruments and therefore any change up or down in those instruments end up going into principle transactions and then mark-to-market revenues. If you're doing that by actually holding a security then to the extent that you've got a mark on that security, the mark would go into principle but interest that you actually accrue on that security goes to net interest revenue. So, trying to predict as you said trading related net interest revenue, good luck. Brian Foran : If I could just one last one in equities and security services, I know both are areas where you\u2019ve invested for some time now, when you look at the recent momentum any sense of how much of that is market share and client gains versus how much of that is the backdrop? John Gerspach : I'm sorry but you were breaking coming in and out, so in security services how much of it is market gains compared to actual client growth? Brian Foran : No, in both equities and security services you had some nice momentum lately, any sense is that the payoff from the investment you\u2019ve versus I guess the tailwinds are really more in security services in terms of the market but just are these the payoffs we\u2019re seeing from your investments right now? John Gerspach : Yeah, certainly in both businesses we're seeing the growth that we've been hoping for. Security services we've had good underlying growth for six to eight -- six quarters now. But in the beginning part of this year and for most of last year then underlying growth has been masked by the impact of some businesses, some product portfolio that we had sold early in 2016. And so we lapped that impact in the first quarter of this year and that's why now the last two quarters, the real underlying growth rate that we\u2019re getting out of security services is coming through. And again we consider that to be similar to TTS, a foundational type of business in order to grow good in this case investor client relationships. So we think that's a terrific business and you're now able to see I think more clearly the momentum that we have there. And you know when it comes to equities, Mike? Michael Corbat : On the equity side we will get the most recent quarterly numbers but I think the last numbers I saw had year-to-date equity wallet down revenue, down about 5%. Again we're up year-to-date somewhere in the 4% and we think that continues to come from share gains. John Gerspach : And I think the nice thing also you need to take a look at are we making progress with equities, I really think -- we are talking about, we try to gauge the progress that we're making in building the client franchise. And so in order to really gauge I think the progress that we\u2019re making there, take a look at our secondary business combined with the primary equity business, the ECM business. And if you look at that -- the equities franchise revenues, the equity markets plus the ECM they totaled over a billion dollars this quarter and that's up 30% year-over-year. The ECM revenues are certainly up significantly versus the prior year, they virtually doubled and that's really because we will be able to generate about 170 basis points of wallet share gain this year. And that's all with corporate clients. So combining both elements of our equities franchise, we've got a growing and balanced business with good momentum going with both our corporate as well as our investor clients. Brian Foran : Thank you both. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Your next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, yesterday the IMF named Citigroup one of nine banks that should have subpar profitability through 2019 and my question is at what point would you relax your assumption that Citi\u2019s restructuring is over. On the one hand the ROE is up year-over-year, certainly a lot higher than a few years ago, on the other hand third quarter ROE is 7.3%, you still have I am guessing around $46 billion of DTAs, why not consider more restructuring or what point would you do so? Michael Corbat : So starting with the IMF report Mike, it's reported that the coverage is based on one chart that I think is on page 12 of the document. And there's no underlying analysis that we can find in terms of how they came to those numbers. So we don't understand how they reach their conclusions. We disagree with them, I think we very clearly laid out our return of targets during an Investor Day and I think as today's results show, year-to-date results show we're making progress against those targets and we remain confident in terms of reaching them. In terms of the restructuring we declared the restructuring over but again as you can see in the numbers today and the numbers year-to-date that what we said is while the restructuring is over our focus around expense discipline stays and you\u2019ve seen operating expenses in the quarter down 2% year-over-year flat. So, that's in spite of the investments that we've talked about being funded in there. So again that discipline is not something that we've let slip away and that's a discipline that I expect we'll continue to keep as we go into the future. So we feel that what the quarter talks about, what year-to-date talks about is the balance and breadth of revenue growth and you can see the positive operating leverage across really almost all our business lines. You can see the revenue growth that's there. You can see the expense discipline and again you can you see that not only on a quarterly basis but you see it on a year-to-date basis and John talked about our expectations into quarter four. Mike Mayo : And one follow up, I mean the first page of the press release in the third quarter and the prior two quarters now highlight ROTCE excluding DTA. Why not instead of excluding DTA try to use the DTA more quickly through sales of assets. Is there anything else that you can do or you think maybe you should do under certain circumstances to sell appreciated assets to the level of DTA's declines and your ROTCE without any adjustments would increase? Michael Corbat : No, as we've talked in the past, that's something that we look at, again we try and manage the DTA carefully because that is your capital, we want to give back to you and we're not going to make either uneconomic or short-term decisions. And again we think based on what we've got approved this year and what we'll be looking to get approved into the future we've got a lot of capital to return today and we've got a lot of capital to return into the future and we are very focused on that. Mike Mayo : Alright, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I think you guys have stopped disclosing the legal repositioning costs earlier this year, but I was wondering if you can give us a sense of how meaningful they were, and what I am getting at is, I am trying to figure out how much of the positive operating leverage as we are looking year-over-year is coming from some of those drives going away and obviously it's sustainable when they go away I think as you mentioned the restructuring being done, but trying to figure out how much of the operating leverage that you point to has come from those going away and how much is kind of benefits still to come from further reductions in those buckets? Michael Corbat : And you said Matt, we stopped doing those line item disclosures but I think right now from year-to-date legal and repositioning has been running about maybe a little bit under 150 basis points of revenue. And so I think going into the year we had said that our anticipation would be that it would be about 200 basis points. So we've gotten a little bit of a lift out of the reduction in the level of legal and repositioning that we've had. And I think it's probably about where we finish the year, it is somewhere at or just below 150 basis points of revenue for legal and repositioning. Matt O'Connor: And then in the three year outlook you provided at Investor Day I think it implied a modest drop in expenses over the next three years, I assumed that's going to be one of the drivers in addition to general efficiency efforts? Michael Corbat : Well, to the extent that we get to a more normal level of legal and repositioning, yeah. I don't think that it's a big driver, it's one factor that clearly is in there. But in any given year you're still going to have some level of repositioning cost in legal which I think every company has and that's why it's just part of their overall expense base. Matt O'Connor: Okay, I just think -- I do think it would be helpful to break it out because if we look year-to-date you have about 300 basis points of positive operating leverage if I adjust out some of the gains to about 200 basis points, I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is from kind of just one offs going away and that helps I think give confidence in getting to 400 basis points of operating leverage that you are looking forward to going forward? John Gerspach : Well, when we go back to the Investor Day charts we tried to give you a sense as to over the timeframe that we were talking about that clearly the wind down of legacy assets and think all of that is now in Corporate/Other. It is certainly going to be one of the factors that gets us to the expense profile that we put in there. It's one of the wind down of legacy assets depresses revenues, and it also serves to depress expenses. So we tried to give you a sense as to the revenue and expense growth that we're going to be getting out of the core businesses and then where we saw Corp/Other, those legacy assets also play a role. Matt O'Connor: Yeah, okay, thank you. John Gerspach : Alright. Operator : Your next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks, I wanted a very small minor item but when you look at your security gains you've had about $200 million per quarter, as rates are kind of generally moving higher just to know if you were trying to reposition or do some things in that particular portfolio by taking those gains. So it is about five quarters in a row that you've actually taken gain, so I just was wondering what your Alco stance was there? Michael Corbat : You know, we're always rebalancing the portfolio and so you are always going to get some level of security gains. It's not something that we do to try to generate the gain, it's just an outcome of balancing where we are in the books to where we -- how we want to position them for the future. Marty Mosby : And then when we look at the -- okay go ahead. Michael Corbat : So as I said, it's an outcome not a target. Marty Mosby : Got you, and then when we look at the overall operating earnings per share we\u2019re still in this 1.25, 1.30 range, $1.25 to $1.30 range but yet shares are down 7%. I look at the institutional business, its revenues are actually up so it\u2019s not really volatility related to discompression in that particular business. You saw a lot of momentum in other pieces of the business which means that there has to be some, legacy assets that are still running off, some divestitures or businesses. These things are still kind of creating a drag that's not allowing you to really push earnings up even though we are seeing the benefit from capital. So when do we get to that inflection point and start to see some of the positives accrue to -- for the growth? Michael Corbat : You know Marty as we laid out in Investor Day, that\u2019s certainly is something that we are still seeing in 2017. And as we get further into 2018, 2019 and 2020 those forces become less and we also expect to get a greater contribution from the global consumer business towards driving that earnings growth. And so it's a combination of completing the wind down legacy assets and as you know there is a lot less of those legacy assets than there were. We're down to when we stopped disclosing holdings we were down to about $54 billion of assets and its -- if I could find holding again it would be somewhere around $40 billion of assets now. But it's still something that is dragging. We're still supporting some of the businesses that we sold with transition service arrangements. So that is going to be something that colors our results for a little bit but, as we move forward and we continue to get the sequential growth in global consumer and now you have seen two consecutive quarters of growth in pretax earnings in global consumer and we fully expect that fourth quarter to be another quarter where we get sequential growth. And we also expect that the fourth quarter is when we get global consumer to year-over-year growth and that is certainty then going to be a contributor to growth in EPS in 2018 and beyond. Marty Mosby : Got it, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Ken Usdin with Jeffries. Ken Usdin : Thanks, good morning. Mike I want to ask you a question going back to your opener, we've seen the metrics on the global growth start to improve mid single-digits year-over-year consumer and in some of the institutional businesses and I just want to a lot of enthusiasm for the emerging markets rebound that we've seen broadly speaking, you mentioned that the potential for the global disruption, can you just talk us through just like business momentum in the non-U.S. markets and maybe just touch on a couple of the biggest ones as well just to give us an understanding of kind of where we are in terms of that just organic growth improvement and where you might be worried about a little bit of a pause? Michael Corbat : Sure. So I think as you look around the world today and if you look at the forecast being put out in terms of 2018 at the top level right now growth is predicted to improve both in the developed and developing markets. But the developing markets, emerging markets are supposed to improve so, growth rates right now in the emerging markets probably came in somewhere just under 4% in 2016. We see a number probably somewhere around 4.5% in 2017, and we see forecast of around 4.75% going into 2018. Developed markets we probably were somewhere around 1.5% last year. Forecast are just bit above 2% this year, and I think we start to bump up hopefully towards 2.5% next year and if we get tax reform here in the U.S. obviously that'll act as a catalyst to those numbers. So, and if you look around the globe you've got most economies doing better and so that's the backdrop by which you would look at and judge things. And so again the relationship of the emerging markets growing faster than the developing markets stay in place. Again if you get tax reform, you get a catalyst to that. And it seems that we look at and you just can't ignore obviously, I talked in my opening about some of these things that are out there, that the markets and we have seen businesses just work their way through and obviously the North Korea situation will be one of those. And so again you've got challenges out there that at some point could start to weigh on the mind set, the pace of investment, the pace of business activity. We haven't seen it to date but it's not to say that it couldn't manifest itself in some ways.  We've obviously also had the near-term challenges of a lot of natural disasters. And whether that's been hurricanes or earthquakes or flooding damages that it comes as a result of some of those things, those things will have a near-term impact in terms of what growth will look and feel like. But probably as we've seen historically in some ways those actually end up being a stimulus in the longer-term in terms of those monies that come back in the form of aid and investment and in rebuilding. And that's our expectation that we would probably see that occur again. Ken Usdin : Got it, alright, thank you for that. And if I could just ask one follow up, just a moving picture with regards to the Reg reform and the tax reform potential, I guess more so on the Reg reform where it seems like the conversation is potentially louder, what are your kind of updated thoughts and hopes in terms of what might be most beneficial to Citigroup? Michael Corbat : You go back and look at it again. Excellent piece of work that was done was the treasury report that was put out in June and we would describe that is largely consistent with what certainly our expectations and I think the broader markets or broader banking system expectations were. And what you've seen is consistent conversation with the broadly defined administration around going after that important pieces that are now starting to come into place or starting to get some key personnel. So we've obviously just seen Randy Quarles confirmed into the Fed Supervisory seat. That's important to get him in place. We've got a confirmation hopefully happening soon in terms of getting the permanent comptroller of the currency at the OCC. We will have the seat turning over at the FDIC. And then as you start to get these in place hopefully they can get together and start to affect some of the changes there. But again as we've talked about none of this or the vast majority of it doesn't require any legislative or legal changes to existing rules or law. And it's in many ways the tone from the top and the prioritization of the agencies which again is as we've said, we think it's constructive for the banking and business environment. Ken Usdin : Got it, alright. Well, we'll see how that evolves. Thanks a lot Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning guys. Couple of questions, one just a clarification on the efficiency ratio target, the 58% does that exclude or include the 600 million or the 580 million gain that you have booked this quarter. My understanding was that it excluded it but I just wanted to make sure that's still the case? Michael Corbat : Well, the target that we set at the beginning of the year it includes all the expenses and all the revenue that we have when you take a look at how that $580 million gain is going to impact us. We're talking basis points on that ratio so whether we come in at 57.9% or 58.1% that to me is 58%. Saul Martinez : Okay, I mean fair enough. Okay, fair enough, the second question on the overall health of the consumer, you talked about moving up your loss ratios from 470 million to 500 million and the longer-term changing, we are seeing increases in losses in an environment where you do have a very strong labor market, unemployment coming down. It does really feel like there is maybe a two speed consumer with established households doing well and younger demographics, millennials, middle income folks not doing so well. So I'm curious as to how you're feeling just more broadly about the health of the consumer overall especially if we do start to see at some point down the line in the coming years some change in the labor market environment and do you think there is some risk in the medium-term to the losses, the expectations that you have in some parts of your consumer business? John Gerspach : So I would say it is not just in the U.S. but as we look around the world we would rate the health of the consumer right now is pretty good. And again so you touched on a number of the most important things, so when you look at a consumer what are the things you look at, does the consumer have a job. If they have a job are they going to keep it, if they don't have a job how difficult is it to get one. And I think as you look across the world unemployment, slow employment is high. Probably the bigger challenge to the consumer or to the worker has been the lack of wage growth and again not just in the U.S. but in many places. And we're beginning to see some of that and again that's helping to the consumer.  The other pieces when we look at the consumer and again when we go back to the crisis and know what we know from there, very hard to have an engaged consumer. In the U.S. the consumer accounts for about two thirds of the U.S. economy, very difficult to engage a consumer when housing prices are going down. And again what we've seen not just here in the U.S. but in many places there's a fairly steady consistent rise or at a minimum good stability to housing prices and I think the combination of jobs, a little bit of wage growth, stable housing, and rising asset prices has left the consumer in a pretty good place. Obviously we are a long way or we're a long way from the last credit cycle and so we're always challenging ourselves in terms of where we are. But a lot of the signs we looked for in terms of the deterioration of the consumer I got to say right now, we just don't see and if you go and look at our NCL rates and look at our delinquency rates around the globe from the document we've given you, again the numbers don't point to it. Saul Martinez : Okay, fair enough, thanks for the response. Operator : Your next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Yes, thank you. Just one quick follow-up question, hi, just one quick follow-up. Thank you so much for your very robust answers on card. Totally acknowledged that you told Jim that the cards deals from here really will depend on the mix. I'm wondering just from a timing perspective, is there a way for us to measure you know when these promotional balances would be potentially rolling off and you know be fully on the full yield, is there's a bit of a timing that we could think about? John Gerspach : You know in general the promotional balances while the range of offers vary, they did you go up to 21 months. No, I don't want -- don\u2019t freak out, that does not mean that it\u2019s going to be 21 months before we see growth in anything. But it\u2019s just that going into this year we shifted our mix of acquisitions away from rewards towards promotional balances. It doesn't mean that we won\u2019t shift back again. Now the one thing that we know about cards is in trying to build this balanced portfolio with the balance business we're going to need to make adjustments as we go along every quarter. And so I just don't want to give specific guidance Erika as far as what month or how long, we do think again we are going to get sequential growth again this quarter. And we'll keep you apprised as to how we think we are doing overall with our targets on branded cards. Erika Najarian : Got it, thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Quick question on Equifax. I believe you're one of the users of Equifax and then you partner with them maybe a little bit more than some of the other credit bureaus and just wanted to get a sense from you as to any change that you're making with regard to that relationship post breach? And also understand is there anything different that you do on the retail partner card side, you know given that point of sale is one of the ways you acquire customers? John Gerspach : And so you're right, we do use the services of Equifax but we've got to say that while this one is of a significant magnitude, data breaches aren\u2019t new and us having to work with and work around out data breaches I think for us and others are said to become fairly embedded in our business. When you think about the risk that we bear we're really bearing two types of risks when incidents like this occur, one is the authentication risk. So is somebody presenting the credentials, are they actually that person or that entity. And I think we feel that we've got ways of working with different technologies to authenticate and obviously we flagged those accounts and we know and we go on heightened alert to watch this. The second form of risk is the acquisition risk and that is that if somebody comes in through the application process, are they actually who they say they are. And that in itself is challenging and probably causes or does cause us to go through more steps of making sure that that's them. So one is we would go back, we would flag the file, and we would go back and be required to do extra levels of work against that. And from that the natural question is what's the ramifications on near-term, longer-term formation of credit and I would say in the first instance I think we've got the ability to authenticate pretty quickly. I think in the second instance it does slow the process down. And again some people have been locking their accounts within Equifax, that makes it a bit more challenging. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily material in terms of the slowdown but it does slow the process down just a bit. Betsy Graseck : Okay, and then just a question on the expense ratio. I know you just had a discussion on that. It looks to me like you came in pretty firmly below your guidance on the expense ratio. Good thing this quarter maybe 70 basis points or so below what you had been expecting and I'm just wondering if there's anything as we look forward to 4Q that would suggest that that trajectory of coming in below expectation is changing, is there anything special about fourth quarter we should be considering, why not just keep that expense ratio improvement going? Michael Corbat : We targeted the full year at 58% and that's where we expect to come in, at that 58%. Betsy Graseck : Okay, alright, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning John. John Gerspach : Hey Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : I have a question, obviously and I don't mean to sell short the efforts you have made in capital markets because you've done a great job in investing in your businesses and you showed us today like you did Investor Day gaining the wallet shift. But can you give us some color about competition because some of our bigger European competitors seem to still be struggling, are you able to take advantage and grow your market share as others haven't fully recovered like the American capital market players have? John Gerspach : Again going back we focused a number of years ago around what we said growth is going to look and feel like for us is not a whole lot of new client acquisition. In fact we're doing more with less clients, more focused on our target clients, and growth is going to come in the form of taking market share both on the capital market side of things as well as on the banking side of things, and that's what we've done. And it's our expectation that we will continue to focus on taking share. And again I think the opportunities, we know having lived it when you go through restructuring and you go through changes to your business model how disruptive they can be. And I think actually with us taking the early actions and actually having of a lot of stability in our ICG franchise has served us well and we continue to want to be focused on that. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and could you guys give us some color, you had good growth this quarter in corporate lending both sequentially and year-over-year, was it here in the States or outside the States that you saw better growth in the corporate lending business within ICG? John Gerspach : You know, I would say Gerard that it is -- it varies by product. Private banking where loans have been strong, private banking lending in both the U.S. and in Asia, but primarily in the U.S. when it comes to trade loans we have seen some good growth pretty much in Asia again in trade loans as well as some things here in the States. And it's been a nice mix across the place. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and I apologize if you've already addressed this, how does the backlogs look for the upcoming quarter in terms of the capital markets activity and investment banking? John Gerspach : You know we normally don't give too much guidance on the backlog but I think that you've seen that in the forward guidance that we've given towards the fourth quarter where we sort of said the investment banking revenues in the fourth quarter we expect to be pretty much on where we were in the third quarter. Gerard Cassidy : Very good and then just lastly obviously you and your peers have all given us very good guidance this quarter on the weakness and trading particularly in the FIC marketplace. Can you share with us there has been a real surge in these non-bank liquidity providers, they obviously have incredible technology and algorithm type trading, companies like XTX Markets or Citadel Securities. Now granted they focus their efforts on the very liquid markets that are lower margin like the G10 rates or currencies, do you guys see these guys as bigger competitors now than a couple of years ago or any color in that specific area of capital markets? Michael Corbat : I don't have the statistics to that but a couple of names you mentioned there are pretty good competitors. But again as we look in there, we've been taking share. I can't speak to their shares in the market but again when you look at our numbers we've been consistently taking share and we've been taking share in many of the areas they operate. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you Mike, I appreciate it. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Jeffrey Harte with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Jeffrey Harte : Good morning guys. Most of the questions have been hit but I have a couple left. One, looking at North American credit cards, the profitability maybe a little more challenged than you initially thought it would be, like the branded card are away, kind of target coming down a little bit. This has been an area you\u2019d been really investing and looking to for growth over the last year, does that impact your focus on North American cards as an area of growth, the reduction in profitability versus what you are initially expecting? John Gerspach : No, I mean Jeff when we got to the Investor Day we talked about the fact that the ROA was going to come down from 2.25 down to like 2.15. Again it's not a -- it's a tweak more than anything else and it was more reflective of a rebalancing of just the fact that we had a lot of the co-brand just growing faster than what we had thought was going to happen, so some of that is just a product of our own success.  But we still think of cards as being a healthy part of our business but it's not the only engine for growth that we have. It's the first area that we talked about only because the investments that we made in branded cards were so visible, when you think about the early investment that we made in the proprietary portfolios we got into that whole rewards and rebates area and so you know that you're just taking a big drop down in your profitability. It's very, very visible, it's not quite the same as hiring a few more people in equities markets. These things were big and so we needed to really make sure that we talked about them and that you understood where we were going.  But I think the nice thing is that we've developed many engines of growth right now. If you take a look at what's going on in the rest of North America, the launch of the Citigold platform, we now have retail banking revenues excluding mortgages which again we change our strategy on that. But the retail banking revenues up 12% year-over-year, yes, that is getting a little bit a lift from interest rates but it still is good growth. We've had our Citigold Wealth Management clients increase by 28% year-to-date. You can see the assets under management growing by 10%. So we've got a nice a nice growth coming out of retail banking in the U.S.  We've got on the international five consecutive quarters now of positive revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both consumer Asia and consumer Mexico. You see the engines for growth that we built in the ICG and these are all client-led businesses. TTS, security services, private bank 15%, that's two -- that's a couple of quarters now we've had double digit growth in the private bank. So while branded cards was the first engine for growth that we talked about publicly we've built a whole series of engines for growth that we're really excited about and that we try to lay out for everybody on Investor Day. I mean we're still focused on growing that branded cards business but it's not the only engine for growth that we have either in consumer or for Citi. Jeffrey Harte : Okay, and maybe taking a second leg off of that. The international versus the North American businesses in general, I mean part of the argument for Citi I think has always been exposure to international especially emerging market kind of some of the consumer businesses that nobody else can really match. So we've really kind of seen North America growing better than some of the international recently, can you talk a bit to when or will the kind of international business start to outgrow the North American business some, especially in kind of in the wake of how much you downsized your geographic presence there? John Gerspach : Yes Jeff, I think you may be getting caught up just a bit in the inorganic growth that we had in North America from the Costco portfolio because we actually like the organic growth that we've been getting now in Asia and in Mexico. In both -- like in Mexico a little bit -- revenues grew a little bit lighter this year this quarter than we would have liked but that seems to be something that's cutting across the industry. We have deposits we\u2019re growing but now in Mexico what we've got now is we have actually finished the repositioning of the cards book, we worked our way out of that J curve type of thing. And now we've got cards revenues in Mexico that are actually have growth year-over-year. So we think that the growth prospects for Mexico are pretty good.  Investor Day we said our anticipation is compound annual growth rate in revenues of 10%, we had been running at about 7% to 8%, we will probably be back to that 7% to 8% in the fourth quarter and then we should continue to grow into 2018 and 2019. Asia again we've got the cards business there now generating nice growth. We're starting to get growth in some of the retail lending. We like the wealth management business that we've got in Asia and again in both of those businesses five consecutive quarters of revenue growth and positive operating leverage. We think that's the way that you build a nice sustainable growth pattern by being able to grow revenues as you're generating positive operating leverage.  And then in North America, again we will take a look, branded cards is coming along a little bit slower than we had thought but still coming along nicely. And I talked about the retail banks so I think we've got really three good engines for growth in the future there in the consumer business. Jeffrey Harte : Okay. Thank you. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen we have reached the allotted time for our question-and-answer session. Presenters are there any closing remarks?

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Jamie. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; and John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2016 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. As you know, our net income for the fourth quarter and the year reflect the impact of the onetime non-cash charge due to tax reform and I'll go into some more detail about that after I discuss our business performance. We had a strong close to an important year. We reported operating earnings of $3.7 billion for the fourth quarter of 2017 or $1.28 per share. During the quarter, we again showed growth in many of the products we've been investing in and increased loans in both sides of our house. Globally, Consumer Banking was up 4%, including 7% internationally. We again had revenue growth and positive operating leverage in both the US and our international franchise. Credit remained favorable and net income grew by 8%. The Institutional Clients Group saw continued momentum with double-digit growth in its banking products comprised of TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Corporate Lending. We did have a decline in Markets revenue due to a less robust environment this quarter than in the period following the US election last year, but engagement remains strong with our target clients. For the full year, on an operating basis, we earned $15.8 billion in net income for 2017, which was nearly $1 billion more than in 2016 and our earnings per share were $5.33, up 13% from 2016. We also made solid progress towards the targets we laid out during our Investor Day in July as a result of our focus on client-led growth. Revenue growth and strong expense management brought us to a full year efficiency ratio of 57.7%, an improvement of over 150 basis points from 2016. We increased our return on assets to 84 basis points. Our return on tangible common equity, including and excluding DTA, increased to 8.1% and 9.6%, respectively. In terms of capital, we returned over $17 billion to our shareholders during the year and reduced our common shares outstanding by over 200 million shares. Turning to tax reform. We believe it will greatly benefit Citi shareholders. The charge we're taking relates mostly to the reduction of the value of our deferred tax assets as a result of a lower corporate tax rate, the implementation of a territorial tax system and the tax on deemed repatriation. DTAs primarily represent tax credits generated from losses we took in the US during the financial crisis and tax benefits from our foreign operations. These tax credits will be re-measured at a lower enacted corporate tax rate since the rate is being cut from 35% to 21% and, of course, we'll benefit from a significant reduction in our effective tax rate going forward. While the GAAP charge is large, it's important to note that the impact on our regulatory capital is far smaller at about $6 billion. Even after this charge, we have a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 12.3% today, which is well above the 11.5% level we need to prudently operate the firm. Not only do we remain committed to returning at least $60 billion of capital during the current and next 2 CCAR cycles, obviously subject to regulatory approval, but we feel confident about our ability to generate capital going forward. If anything, that ability has been enhanced by tax reform. From a business perspective, it's a great opportunity to advise our clients on how they can optimize their models to fit the new tax regime. Everything from repatriation to supply chain is on the table and we're already engaged in these conversations with our clients. The macro environment is as positive as we've seen in many years. 2017 was the first year since the crisis in which growth actually exceeded expectations. Tax reform could change the sentiment among those making investment decisions from optimism to confidence and become the boost the US economy needs to drive growth higher. The U.S. consumer should also benefit as higher take-home pay could drive either increased discretionary spending or the acceleration of payment of existing debt, each a potential positive outcome from the reduction in tax rates. So on balance, tax form is a - tax reform is a clear net positive for Citi and its shareholders and will help us achieve our goals of improving our return on and increasing our return of capital. We'll benefit from the lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income going forward. We believe the combination of higher income and reduced tangible common equity will have a meaningful positive impact on our returns, improving return on tangible common equity by about 200 basis points going forward. We're revising the return targets we provided in July accordingly and don't plan on speaking to RoTCE, excluding DTA, when we discuss the returns going forward. In all, tax reform not only leads to higher net income and increased returns, but also serves to strengthen our capital generation capabilities going forward. With that, John will go through the presentation and we'd be happy to answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Okay. Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, before we go into our operating results, I do want to spend a few minutes on the impact of tax reform on our fourth quarter as well as the benefits we expect going forward. I would note that these figures are based on our current understanding of the details of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and we will continue to refine our estimates over the near term. As noted on the table, our fourth quarter results included a onetime non-cash charge of $22 billion or $8.43 per share comprised of roughly $19 billion due to the re-measurement of our deferred tax assets or DTA arising from the lower US corporate tax rate as well as the shift to a territorial regime and roughly $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of un-remitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. From a reporting perspective, the entire $22 billion charge was recorded in the tax line in our Corp/Other segment. The impact on our CET1 capital was significantly smaller at approximately $6 billion or a 40 basis point reduction in our CET1 capital ratio. Importantly, we remain on track to return at least $60 billion of capital in aggregate over the 2017, 2018 and 2019 CCAR cycles, subject of course, to regulatory approval. On an ongoing basis, we expect to benefit from a lower effective tax rate, going from the low 30% range down to an estimated 25% rate in 2018 with a line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years. And finally, the combination of a lower tax rate and, therefore, higher net income along with the $22 billion reduction in our tangible common equity is expected to drive a material improvement in returns, adding roughly 200 basis points to our RoTCE going forward. Turning to Slide 4. For the remainder of this presentation, we show fourth quarter and full year results excluding the impact of tax reform in order to better describe our underlying trends. On this basis, net income was $3.7 billion in the fourth quarter, up 4% from the prior year, and earnings per share of $1.28 grew 12%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share from discrete items that resulted in a lower than expected tax rate, as well as a onetime loss in discontinued operations. Excluding these items, our normalized EPS was $1.20 in the fourth quarter. Revenues of $17.3 billion grew 1% from the prior year, reflecting 2% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets. Expenses were flat year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased, mostly reflecting volume growth and seasoning, as well as an episodic charge-off in our Institutional business this quarter. On a full year basis, total revenues grew 2% in 2017, including 6% aggregate growth in our Consumer and Institutional businesses. Total expenses remained flat, driving over 150 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, and net income grew 6%, resulting in a 13% increase in earnings per share, including the impact of share buybacks. Our RoTCE, excluding the impact of disallowed DTA, improved to 9.6% in 2017, showing good progress towards our original Investor Day target of a 10% return on this basis in 2018. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $667 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other. GCB and ICG loans grew by $41 billion in total with contribution from every region in Consumer as well as TTS, the Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending. Our progress was broad-based in 2017 with revenue growth and positive operating leverage and operating margin expansion in our Institutional business as well as every region in Consumer. In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth and nearly 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio. In ICG, revenues grew 7% with 200 basis points of efficiency improvement. Of course, our ICG results benefited from a gain on sale in the third quarter, but even excluding the gain, we generated 6% revenue growth and over 100 basis points of efficiency improvement in 2017. And finally, revenues in Corp/Other declined significantly year-over-year by roughly $2 billion. We expect the wind down of legacy assets to continue to be a drag on top line results over the medium term. However, the dollar impact should moderate going forward. Turning now to each business. Slide 6 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 8% in the fourth quarter as growth in operating margin outpaced a higher cost of credit. Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 4% year-over-year with positive operating leverage in both North America and our international franchise. Operating margin grew by 7% and we delivered solid improvement in earnings, both year-over-year and sequentially. This represents the third consecutive quarter of sequential improvement in our Global Consumer earnings, which we expect to translate into year-over-year earnings growth in 2018. From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the fourth quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint. And global cards delivered 3% revenue growth driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region. Slide 7 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 2% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues declined significantly, mostly reflecting lower origination activity. However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 14% driven by continued growth in checking deposits and deposit margin, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity. Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year with half the decline coming from lower escrow balances given the lower mortgage activity. We generated 4% growth in checking deposits this quarter driven largely by our Citigold segment. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. This aligns with our Citigold Wealth Management strategy with assets under management up 14% year-over-year to $60 billion. We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances with improving penetration of investment products. Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion increased slightly from last year. Client engagement remains strong with average loans growing by 6% and purchase sales up 10% year-over-year. We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 4% year-over-year, excluding our Hilton portfolio, as recent vintages continued to mature as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances. However, we faced continued headwinds from growth in transactor and promotional rate balances, which we are funding at a higher cost versus last year given the higher interest rate environment. The growth in promotional rate balances reflects a strong response to our offers, generating growth in both spending and borrowing activity from new accounts during the promotional period. We continue to be confident in our acquisition strategy and believe the investments we're making today will generate revenue growth as these balances mature. As we look forward, we expect interest earning balances to continue to grow while promotional rate loans should stabilize and then begin to decline in 2018 as we continue to take actions to adjust our acquisition strategy in a rising rate environment. These actions include shortening or eliminating the promotional period on certain offers while continuing to optimize our mix of acquisitions by product. The combination of interest earning loan growth and the decline in promotional rate balances should deliver underlying revenue growth in 2018 in the range of around 2%. However, this growth should largely be offset by the impact of additional terms that go into effect this quarter in certain of our partnership contracts. And as previously noted, we expect to close the sale of the Hilton portfolio this quarter. However, this sale should be neutral to revenues in full year 2018 as the gain on sale is roughly the same as the annual revenues on this portfolio. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2% driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America Consumer were flat to last year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings. We continue to drive transaction volumes to lower cost channels and digital engagement remains strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 21% growth among mobile users versus last year. Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 7% year-over-year and we built roughly $150 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning in the portfolios. Our NCL rate in US branded cards was 289 basis points for full year 2017. We remain comfortable with an NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points for 2018 and up to 325 basis points over the medium term. And retail services - and in retail services, our full year NCL rate was 473 basis points. This is consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 500 basis points for 2018 and up to 525 basis points over the medium term. On Slide 8, we show our results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter driven by revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline. Fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew by 7% with contribution from every business and region. In Latin America, total Consumer revenues grew 6%. This growth rate accelerated from 4% in the third quarter on better momentum across both retail banking and cards. Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the fourth quarter with broad-based volume growth across deposits, commercial loans and personal loans, as well as improved deposit spreads. And card revenue growth improved to 4% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans. We're achieving revenue growth in cards somewhat earlier than we had planned and this should contribute to an acceleration in growth for overall Latin America Consumer revenues as we go in into 2018. Turning to Asia. Total Consumer revenues grew 8% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. Retail banking grew 5% driven by our Wealth Management business, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. And card revenues grew by 11%, reflecting continued growth in average loans and purchase sales as well as a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business. Excluding the gain, card revenues increased by 7% in the fourth quarter. On a full year basis, Asia Consumer revenues grew by 5% in 2017 and 4%, excluding NIMs [ph]. In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. Slide 9 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter. The NCL rate improved sequentially in both North America and Asia. And in Latin America, the sequential increase in the NCL rate reflected an episodic commercial charge-off while delinquencies continued to improve. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 10. Revenues of $8.1 billion declined 1% from last year as continued strong momentum in Banking and Securities Services were offset by a decline in Markets revenues. Total Banking revenues of $4.7 million grew 11%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.2 billion were up 9%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with balanced growth across net interest and fee income. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 10% from last year with wallet share gains for the year across debt and equity underwriting and M&A. Private Bank revenues of $771 million grew 15% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $509 million were up 14%, reflecting lower hedging costs as well as loan growth. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.4 billion declined 17% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $2.4 billion declined 18%, reflecting continued low volatility as well as the comparison to a more robust trading environment last year in the wake of the US elections. Equities revenues were down 23%, mostly driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of roughly $130 million related to a single client event. Excluding this item, Equities revenues declined by 4% from last year, reflecting lower activity in corporate equity derivatives, while investor client engagement remains strong. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 14% driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $4.7 billion increased 2% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation. And finally, credit costs were $267 million in the fourth quarter, predominantly driven by the same single client event, while overall portfolio quality remains strong. For the full year 2017, our net income grew 16% on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage and continued credit discipline. We generated over half of our revenues in Banking, which grew 12% on continued momentum in TTS, Investment Banking, the Private Bank and Corporate Lending. Securities Services grew 8% as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment. And we deepened our relationships in Markets as well. In Fixed Income, while the trading environment proved to be challenging this year with low volatility and fewer macro catalysts, we continued to see strong engagement with our corporate clients as they leveraged our global network, particularly in rates and currencies. And in Equities, we made solid progress with our target investor clients, improving wallet share and growing client balances in line with our investment plans. Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $746 million declined 13% from last year driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 24% also reflecting the wind down as well as lower legal expenses. And the pretax loss in Corp/Other was $66 million this quarter, better than our outlook, mostly due to higher than expected hedging-related revenues in Treasury. However, we continue to believe an outlook for pretax losses of $250 million to $300 million per quarter in Corp/Other is a fair run rate to expect through 2018. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue and the contribution from our legacy assets in Corp/Other. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion in the fourth quarter was essentially flat to last year. Core accrual revenues grew year-over-year by over $500 million in the fourth quarter, in line with our outlook, but this was offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind down of legacy assets. On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by $2 billion over 2016, again, in line with our outlook. This was offset by a roughly $800 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind down portfolio in Corp/Other. And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year with about 2/3 of this decline coming from higher wholesale funding costs. As we look to 2018, we expect core accrual net interest revenues to grow by another $2.5 billion year-over-year driven by loan growth, mix improvement and the benefit of higher rates assuming one additional Fed rate increase mid year. Legacy asset related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million during the year as we continue to wind down that portfolio. And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. In the fourth quarter, our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.3% driven by $6.3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, as well as the estimated $6 billion reduction in CET1 capital due to tax reform, which, as I noted earlier, had a roughly 40 basis point impact. Our supplementary leverage ratio declined to 6.7% and our tangible book value per share declined to $60.40, including the full impact of the $22 billion non-cash charge related to tax reform. In summary, we made good progress in 2017 with broad based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders. Importantly, we continued to deepen our client relationships and lay the foundation for sustainable client led growth and steady improvement in returns over time. We remain committed to our medium and longer term return targets and expect to show continued progress in 2018. For the full year 2018, we expect top line growth broadly in line with the medium term outlook we described in July at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets. We expect to achieve another 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio on a like-for-like basis, keeping in mind that we just adopted new rules on revenue recognition that will gross up both revenues and expenses by about $800 million annually with no impact on earnings. Credit costs should continue to grow, but more driven by the normalization of credit in ICG this year, having already absorbed material LLR builds in Consumer in 2017. And in total, operating margin expansion should drive improvement in earnings before tax across the firm. In addition, as I noted earlier, we expect our effective tax rate to be around 25% in 2018 with line of sight to a 24% rate over the next 2 years. This combination of higher earnings before tax, continued capital return and the impact of tax reform is expected to drive a significant improvement in RoTCE in 2018. As Mike noted earlier, given that our disallowed DTA is much smaller now post-tax reform, we'll no longer speak to our returns ex-DTA, but rather on the full amount of our TCE. Excluding the impact of tax reform, our return on total tangible common equity improved to roughly 8% in 2017 and we expect to make additional progress this year. So including the impact of tax reform, which benefits our returns by an estimated 200 basis points, we should be able to generate an RoTCE approaching 10.5% in 2018. Of course, this sets us on a path to exceed our original targets for 2019 and 2020 as well with the estimated benefit of tax reform moving those return targets up to roughly 12% and at least 13%, respectively. What we described at Investor Day was a balanced achievable plan that did not rely heavily on macro or regulatory tailwinds or on any single business and we believe we are as well positioned now as ever to deliver results through 2020 and beyond. In terms of earnings power, the macro backdrop has only gotten stronger with all major global markets having returned to growth and the US poised to benefit from a more competitive tax regime. Higher GDP growth or additional US interest rate hikes beyond the one we have embedded in this year's plan would provide a tailwind for us. We also had two more quarters of operating performance behind us, extending our track record in areas like TTS, Investment Banking, Private Bank and Securities Services and ICG. We're continuing to see progress in Equities and have extended our leadership in Fixed Income in a difficult market. In Global Consumer, we finished with a very strong second half in Asia and we returned to growth in Mexico cards earlier than we had planned, giving us confidence that we can accelerate our overall revenue growth in Mexico. In the US, while branded cards has gotten off to a slow start, likely delaying growth in that business until 2019, we showed good traction with our Citigold Wealth Management investment and retail services is growing at slightly above our medium-term outlook. We also demonstrated strong expense discipline and overall credit remains benign. Turning to the tax rate. As I noted earlier, we believe we have line of sight to reducing our effective tax rate to 24% over the next two years and, if you look at what was embedded in our Investor Day outlook, we had assumed our effective tax rate would tick up over time to around 33% by 2020. So by 2020, we now see the potential for a roughly 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate. This gives us even more confidence in our ability to generate and return capital. Despite the charge we took for tax reform, our capital position remains strong and we are on track to return at least $60 billion in capital over the 2017, '18 and '19 CCAR cycles, subject to regulatory approval. And while there are lots of moving pieces, we believe our ability to generate regulatory capital has only improved post tax reform as higher net income should more than offset any reduction in our annual DTA utilization. This brings me to my final takeaway, which is our confidence in steadily improving our RoTCE. As we said before, we believe we are in a unique position to improve our return on capital while also increasing our return of capital for a powerful impact on RoTCE, and we are committed to showing you progress each year as we move forward. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Good morning. John, I was wondering on the net interest income outlook, the core accrual NII for $2.5 billion that assumes one rate hike. So many folks are assuming more rate hikes for this year, 2 or 3, sometimes 4. How much would your outlook for net interest income increase if we saw 2 or 3 hikes rather than the one you've embedded in your outlook? John Gerspach : Yes. I think the rule of thumb, John, would be that for each additional quarter that we had an incremental 25 basis point rate - impact of - a Fed rate hike, we should see an increment of about $80 million of core interest revenue. So just if we got a rate hike in March of 25 basis points and then we still got that midyear rate hike, that would give you 3 quarters of additional rates - of additional 25 basis point rate hikes so that should would translate to $240 million, $250 million of additional core accrual NIM - NIR, sorry. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. That's helpful. And then, in terms of the card revenues, I guess, first, on the US branded card. You mentioned that the revenue growth of 2% in 2018 will be offset by certain partnership renewals. Can you just mention what's going on with the renewals there? And then also, should revenue growth be accelerating towards the end of '18 as the promo balances start to wear off, the core balances start to grow? And when could we see the kind of unencumbered revenue growth start to show itself? Is that a '19 story? What are your thoughts there? John Gerspach : Yes. When you think in terms of the dampening of some of the new terms, I think when we, for instance, just to point to one example, when we renewed the American contract a couple of years ago, we talked to the fact that there was some additional revenue sharing that came into play beginning in 2018. That certainly is a contributing factor to what I'm talking about here as far as this dampening effect. As far as the acceleration of revenue, yes, the expectation would be revenue growth should be - should accelerate in the tail half, the second half of 2018 and then be fully visible from a full year point of view in 2019. Again, all excluding the impact that you're going to see quarter to quarter as a result of the sale of the Hilton portfolio. John McDonald : Okay. And then, on the International Consumer, it looks like both Latin America and Asia Consumer revenues have accelerated and are showing good momentum. Can you just talk a little bit about what you're seeing there and that inflection in Mexico Consumer, as well as Asia on a core basis and maybe what kind of revenue growth expectations you might have on the International Consumer front? John Gerspach : Yes. I'd say that from a medium-term point of view, John, what we're seeing now gives us confidence in those projections that we put forward for Investor Day. So I don't want you to think that we are upping the guidance from Investor Day. But with this performance, as I mentioned, let's stay with Mexico cards. For about 6 quarters in a row, we saw declining revenue growth year-over-year in cards. We began earlier this year to see that year-over-year revenue shortfall decline. It was lessening, but we wouldn't think that we were going to return to year-over-year revenue growth until the fourth quarter of this year. As we talked last quarter, we actually saw the third quarter produce 2% year-over-year growth in our Mexico cards revenues and now that has accelerated to 4% here in the fourth quarter. So again, that just demonstrates to us that we're on that path then to deliver the overall revenue growth that we have built into those medium term outlooks for cards in Mexico, which was in that 9%, 10% range. So it's moving forward really well. John McDonald : Got you. Okay. And you mentioned overall, even with US card being a little light, your overall Consumer revenue trajectory feels good relative to the Investor Day targets? John Gerspach : Yes. If you think about it, what this means is we put up, I think, at Investor Day a compound annual growth rate for U.S. branded cards over the 3.5-year period was going to be 3%. That probably comes down to 2% just given the fact that 2018 is likely going to be a flat revenue year. At the same point in time, retail services, we had, I think a 1% compound annual growth rate built in and we feel pretty good now about that looking more like a 2% growth rate. And then, there's some additional strength coming in, in retail banking as a result of the Citi - the strong Citigold offering that we've got. So all in all, we feel good about it. It builds on what Mike said earlier. We weren't reliant on any one product or any one region. And so I don't think it's unusual that you're going to see some, you know, there'll be some gains in one product and a shortfall in others, but overall, still in line. John McDonald : Got it. Thanks. John Gerspach : Overall, still inline. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks, John. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Michael Corbat : Hi, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Just maybe on the efficiency ratio, I think you've got it to about 100 basis point improvement in '18, but I think the target for 2020 is the low 50s and 100 basis points will get you closer to, I guess, 57. So it seems to imply that there's some back-ended acceleration and efficiency improvement. Is that the right way to think about it and where is that coming from in '19 and in '20? John Gerspach : Yes. It - everything that we're talking about right now is clearly in line. We never gave - with what we put up in Investor Day. I don't think we ever talked about a very specific 2018 goal at that point, but getting another 100 basis point reduction fits in with the pace that we had built into that Investor Day presentation. So again, there's nothing here that is different. We're continuing to see gains coming out of the investments that we're making in digital and consumer. You've seen, I think, the result of that as far as on the impact on the operating efficiency improvement that we've seen in Consumer. And you can see the improvement that we're getting in ICG. I'd say that there's still some process reengineering work to go through with our global functions and there's some additional work that we'll get out of our core infrastructure when - from a technology point of view. Those are going to require some additional effort in 2018 before you begin to see the results of that coming into play in '19 and '20. Jim Mitchell : That's what I was trying to get at. There's still some - there's - potentially as you kind of -- the investments start to trail off and you get these process improvements, you might see more of a step down in '19 or '20? John Gerspach : Yes, which is why we put forward the guidance of low 50s by 2020. Jim Mitchell : And is that somewhat tied to the investment in Mexico as that finally kind of rolls off maybe in '19 and '20 as well, so that's how we should think about that? John Gerspach : Well, the investment in Mexico, again, that's sort of embedded in what I was talking about with the Consumer. And, again, that will ramp up over time just as you make the investment, you don't get the immediate payback, right. It's only if you put investment dollars to work in 2017, you'll get some benefit in '18. You'll get even more benefit coming out of that in '19 and '20. But there's also reengineering in some of our, I'm going to call core infrastructure. It's our global functions, whether that be compliance, finance, risk. There's still work that we can do there, and we should start to see, again, an increased benefit coming out of those types of activities in '19 and '20. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just one quickie on the DTA. It looks like you still have about $13 billion deducted from CET1. Should we expect the pace of utilization to be slower with the lower tax rate? How do we think about that $13 billion going away over time? John Gerspach : Yes. The - again, we're still going through a lot of this work, right? But where we are right now, while our DTA - the disallowed DTA was basically cut in half, actually more than half, $28 billion down to $13 billion, our current assessment would be that our DTA - our annual DTA utilization is basically reduced by about 1/3. So we had told you that we expect DTA utilization of about $2 billion a year that would be accretive to the capital base. And so now that's more in the $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion range, so, again, still contributing to the overall capital. So we picked up 900 basis points of benefit in our effective tax rate and only lost $600 million, $650 million worth of DTA utilization in any given year. All in all, a pretty good trade-off and that gives you some idea as that - why we're seeing - why we're talking about this strong improvement in our overall ability to generate and, therefore, return capital. Jim Mitchell : Absolutely. Okay, thanks a lot. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hello. John Gerspach : Hi. Glenn Schorr : One easy one, I think, at first. I appreciate the 200 basis point boost to the return on tangible targets. Is it simple math? Can I think about that EPS range that you talked about going up by a similar percentage? John Gerspach : Yes, you can, Glenn. I mean, again, it's -- and I realize that it's simple math. We're actually -- if you do -- if you continue to do the math, though, I talked about the fact that we're getting a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate in 2020. And if you actually do the math on that, you're going to scratch your head and say, well, wait a minute, this looks like a 900 basis point improvement in our effective tax rate should actually drive a much higher improvement to RoTCE than the 200 basis points that Mike and John are talking about. And the math would suggest that it's probably closer to a 300 basis point improvement in RoTCE in 2020. But again, we're still working through a lot of the details and trying to assess what we might want to do with regard to additional investments, deploying additional capital for some clients, business expansion, et cetera, et cetera. So there's actually some dry powder above that 200 basis points right now, and we'll get more specific with you as 2018 continues. Glenn Schorr : I definitely appreciate that. It touches on the ability to hit, I guess, a double-digit EPS number from this quarter's sub $5. It's pretty powerful growth. Okay. Can we talk about the revenue yields in both retail services and Citi branded cards has been falling? It's clearly - well, I don't want to put words in your mouth. How much of it relates towards the teaser and the promotional books and the transactor books? And does that run off with the same comments, at the same pace as you talked about, the revenue improvement? John Gerspach : Yes. Broadly, the - we would expect that NIR in branded cards to also improve - the NIR percentage to improve in the back end of this year, 2018, and then continue to show improvement on a full year basis in 2019. And it is that combination, Glenn, that you were talking about as far as even as we're seeing growth in the interest earning balances, we do have that drag from promotional balances. Glenn Schorr : Got you. Okay. Last one. Average loan growth in ICG was good, 8%, and I think no matter what form it comes in is typically pretty good. I'm just curious how much of it we should think of as like facilitation loans, things like Aramco, things like hedge fund leverage, which are good things, I don't want to make it like they're bad, versus a traditional corporate borrowing money and building something. Just curious on that type of mix? John Gerspach : Yes, I mean, there's certainly some element of episodic lending in that loan growth. But the bulk of it, and I just don't have a percentage in my mind, whether it's 2/3 or thereabouts or even 3/4, is really what you would consider to be, I guess, normal ongoing lending arrangements, just straight-on commercial loans, loans in the private bank, trade loans in TTS, et cetera, et cetera. So we feel -- we do feel good about that loan growth in ICG. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks very much, John. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. John Gerspach : Hi, Matt. Matt O'Connor: I want to follow up on the 3% revenue growth outlook for 2018. I'm just - including the net interest income guide. It seems like its implying flattish fee revenues if we kind of just take the math literally. I'm wondering why fees aren't expected to grow, if that is the right interpretation, and then just some of the puts and takes on the fee business. John Gerspach : I don't have my line item detail on 2018, but I don't think you're getting to the right conclusion. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes in the fee business, where you do think there'll be some growth and then where you do think there'll be some challenges? John Gerspach : Well, we continue to see strong fee growth in our TTS business, just to name one, both in cash fees as well as from the commercial cards business. So we've been getting strong fee growth in there. Sorry, Matt, I just can't go down line item detail by business in my head. Michael Corbat : Yes. But I think, John, if you look at it as an example, fee growth, where you think of where we've seen good growth, Matt, is when you look in the banking products, when you look at, as John talked about, market share gains in M&A, you look at what we've done in terms of the private bank, securities services, lending, those more accrual type revenues have been strong. And again, we don't see anything in the environment that takes away from the outlook of those remaining strong. I think John's talked about a backdrop where we'll see trading remains choppy. But again, we've got an interest rate outlook that, by some people's standards, remains conservative. So I think we feel good about, on the revenue outlook, where we are, where the global economy is and feel good about, hopefully, at least achieving that 3% number. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then just a clarification, the $800 million grossing up of both revenues and expenses, does that show up - I guess, one, is that part of the 3% revenue growth expectation? John Gerspach : No. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Good. And then that shows up in the fee revenues versus net interest income, right? John Gerspach : Yes. That will show up in non-interest revenue. Matt O'Connor: Yeah, perfect. Okay, thank you. John Gerspach : Its all right. Operator : Next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, John. John Gerspach : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Kind of question is if we could turn it around, obviously, the benefits to this country from the lower tax rates have been explained by you and others. You're in a unique position to give us a view of what it might do to some of the other - we have the non-US countries that obviously are not lowering their tax rates. Do you guys have any sense on what this impact might do to some of the countries you're in that could lose businesses that come to the US or something like that? Michael Corbat : Gerard, I think it will - it already has, at least in rhetoric, started to put pressure, in particular, on some of those higher-tax economies. The challenge is when you get into those economies from a fiscal perspective, they don't necessarily have the latitude, the leeway or the ability to significantly cut taxes. And so, again, as we talk about the opportunities out there for us, we start right here in terms of Citi. But in terms of the dialogues we're in, everybody's taking a look at everything, from what repatriation means, to supply chain, to legal vehicle structure, to tax domicile. And we expect there to be some action, reaction and some movement, which, from a business perspective, should benefit us. But to your point, it's going to put some more pressure on those economies to attempt to become more competitive. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And I may have missed it, but have you guys announced any type of wage increases for your folks? I know some of the other banks have announced the hourly earnings going up and stuff and onetime bonuses. Have you guys announced anything on that front? Michael Corbat : As of yet, we have not. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. And then lastly, John, on the promotional rates that you talked about in credit cards, what's the typical normal term in terms of if somebody takes down one of your cards with a promotional rate, is it 6 months, 12 months? And then second, when the term expires, what's the roll-off for customers actually to give the card back to you or take the balance down to zero? John Gerspach : Yes, if you take a look at the - I'm not quite sure that there's a norm because each product has got its own offering. We have - some of our products where we have offered at 21 months interest free for a balance conversion and then 21 months of interest free purchases, that would be the extreme, and then there's others where it will be 7 months of purchases interest free as we have on Costco. So it does vary. But all of these things are being reassessed, as I mentioned. And we've never commented publicly on what the actual conversion rate is. But I can tell you that as we've seen our earlier vintages actually mature, the conversion rate that we're getting is right in line or even better than our models. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. John Gerspach : All right. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. You mentioned a new RoTCE target for 2020 of 13%. What is your new ROA target for 2020? At Investor Day, you said it was 90 to 110 basis points. John Gerspach : Yes, Mike, if you - again, if you do the math on that 20 - on the 200 basis point improvement, it should drive you to an ROA that is somewhere well north of the midpoint of that range that we gave you, a little-- so think about it as being moving towards the upper end of that range of 90 to 110 basis points\u2026. Mike Mayo : Okay\u2026. John Gerspach : Specific later on. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then, John, as far as the efficiency target, you were at 58% in 2017, and now you're looking for 100 basis points better, so 57%. But that still isn't too close to low 50s. Can you talk about the balance between investing for future growth and letting the savings fall to the bottom line? I mean, what are your biggest areas of investment? How much are you investing? Any change in your CapEx budget or anything else along those lines? Michael Corbat : So Mike, we've been - when you go back and think about what we talked about at Investor Day and the pathway to a low 50s efficiency, as John described earlier, there's the concept of balance in there, but it's a bit of revenue and it's expense. So on the expense side, it's continued expense discipline, but at the same time, some investments we're making today, as an example, in the digital space where we can convert analog functions to digital functions, improve customer processes and satisfaction, at the same time, get cross-sell. As an example, when you look at the Mexico investment that we've made, which I think we clearly have to acknowledge as having been helpful in terms of the 6% revenue growth in Mexico today, you look at 3 things there. One was the branch work we did, the movement to start smart branches. We've got 75 smart branches up and operating. And you go into those branches and watch in terms of what's changed from the reduction in the teller lines and the interaction out in front in terms of some of the machines, 1,600 ATMs with more or increased functionality being put in place. And then when you look at digital, actually, when we look year-over-year, we've got an increase of 38% of digital engagement in Mexico, above our expectations. And that allows us to continue to drive out costs. So you look at Mexico, yes, we got 6% revenue growth, but we did that inclusive of investment with 4% expense growth. And so, again, as I think we put some of these things in, and I don't think you'd be surprised in terms of the continued areas of investment. I think there's nothing really outside of what we've described, but a big emphasis towards digital, towards technology, towards new and smart banking as we go forward and then, obviously, continued investments in place like our TTS businesses and all the things that we've talked about. So I don't think you should expect anything significant away from that. Maybe we could, based on client and customer uptake, increase the pace or the volume of some of those investments that we see the returns but nothing extraordinary. Mike Mayo : I'm just trying to figure out if you can get where you're going a little bit faster and if you're satisfied with the progress. I mean, when we look at Mexico, when we look at TTS, when we look at the key metrics, they're moving in the right direction. But then we go back to your old ROA target from 2015 and say, wow, you'll still be getting there in 2020, so that's 5 years later than before. When we look at your remaining DTAs at the pace that you outlined, they'll be used up in another 10 years. That will be 20 years after the financial crisis. So I'm just wondering if you might revisit your statement from last year where you said the restructuring is over. Maybe you could have piecemeal restructurings, or maybe you could still sell off some appreciated assets or do something a little bit faster -- again, even though things are moving in the right direction, maybe you can get there sooner? Michael Corbat : Yes. And as I said, we're always open and we're always looking at things. And certainly, tax reform causes us to take a look. But again, when you look at some of the things you called out, treasury and trade solutions growing 9% in the quarter, 7% in the year, Mexico growing at 6%, those are big upscale businesses that are growing as we would like to grow at a multiple of GDP. But what we don't want to do is fall into the trap of then saying, let's accelerate that faster, and then start taking outsized growth in the form of balance sheet or other types of risks where we end up stumbling along the way. So trying to find that right balance, we're going to push ourselves, but we're going to try and make sure we don't make stupid decisions along the way in terms of getting there. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. It's Betsy Graseck. Michael Corbat : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hey. I just wanted to drill into two things. One was on the branded card. You mentioned that you're expecting to see that growth really be where you're looking for it to be in 2019. Could you just give us a sense of the road map between now and then? What are some of the key assumptions that you're making that will drive to that higher level of growth in 2019? John Gerspach : Sure, Betsy. The - there are several, I think, that you should track us on. One is we've talked about one of the key elements, obviously, in driving the revenue growth in branded cards is the continued growth in interest-earning balances. And there, we now have seen that growth. We've got 4% growth we quoted, excluding, again, the Hilton portfolio. It's just going to give us some noise. But ex the Hilton portfolio, we've gotten now 4% growth in the fourth quarter year-over-year. And so we feel good about that. And so now we've got sequential growth in those balances for the second quarter in a row, so that puts us on a good pace. We've mentioned last quarter, we touched on it again this quarter, that one of the dampening effects, though, even as we're growing those interest-earning balances, we have a higher than - a higher level of promo balances that we had originally expected to have because of the change in acquisition strategy. And while we're comfortable with our acquisition strategy, the promo balances are giving us a drag right now. So we're looking to first stabilize those promo balances early in 2018 and then have them decline during the course of '18. Some of the things that you can see if you go to our website and our offerings, you'll see that we have already begun to alter some of the offerings that we've put out. We've changed the terms. We've shortened the amount of time on some of the promos. Some of the promos we pulled entirely. So we're managing those promo -- the promo balance line as you would expect us to, given, one, the strong take-up that we had on the other offers; and two, just given the environment that we're in. So growth in interest-earning, shrinking, declining in the promo balances, and then there's going to be the other aspects of cards that sort of balance along underneath that. This year, we're selling the Hilton portfolio. That's going to give us a big gain in the first quarter, but we then lose the revenues of Hilton in each subsequent quarter, right? So what we said is think in terms of the gain that we book in the first quarter will basically offset the revenue loss of Hilton for the balance of the year. But again, that's going to give us a year-over-year headwind this year, so that's why it's a little bit -- going into next year, which is why it's going to be a little bit difficult. So those are some of the things - so - but overall, we say - and again, if you - it should be flattish revenues for 2018, and then revenue should begin to grow in 2019, basically delaying our growth profile in cards by about a year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That was a great explanation. The question - the follow-up is just on retail partner cards. We haven't spoken so much on this call about that. Could you give a sense of the strategy there? And one of your partners is closing stores. Are you seeing an impact on that or not? Give us some sense of how you're managing that business. John Gerspach : We really haven't seen - I mean, the retail services business is moving along very nicely. I mentioned the fact that the revenue growth is actually higher than what we had originally expected. We've got excellent engagement with our clients there, and I've said that we're working well with each one of our retailers. That means - again, that's one of the core competencies, I think, that retail services provides is the stability of partnership and advisory approach to each of the retailers. And we offer advanced analytics, digital marketing capabilities. I think all of that is what's coming through in the strong revenue performance in retail services, even as some retailers are closing stores. Don't forget, in retail services, some of our cards are general purpose cards, and we're seeing real good out-of-store purchases off of those cards as well. So it's not just the in-store purchase activity that is driving that business. Also, for many of the cards where we've got general purpose cards out there, and so it's much more of a co-brand relationship, we're seeing good out-of-store purchase activity as well. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay. And then just one separate topic on tax. There's a lot of discussion about the BEAT. And I noticed that - I think you mentioned it didn't really have a much impact on you. Could you just give us some color as to why that's the case or how you're structured in a way that enables you to avoid that? John Gerspach : Yes, I'm trying to think about why would our structure force us to be in there. Based upon our structure, we're really not impacted by the base erosion anti-abuse tax. I - if you ask me, I guess it's probably - our foreign branch structure probably gives us a little bit of help with regard to BEAT maybe compared to others. Betsy Graseck : Okay. As opposed to subsidiary. John Gerspach : Correct. But the branches - again, branches are taxed as part of the - or considered part of the U.S. tax entity. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. Thank you. John Gerspach : All right. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning, good afternoon. Michael Corbat : Hi. Erika Najarian : Hi. Mike, maybe this one is for you. As we think about a new regulatory regime as we enter the future stress test balance with the write-down in tangible book value and, of course, what that implies for valuation, could you give us an update in terms of your preferences of capital return between buybacks and dividends? Michael Corbat : Sure. So I would say the tax reform has not changed the approach that we've talked about historically. One is that continuing to walk the dividend up so that from a current yield perspective, the dividend remains competitive amongst our peers and dedicating the vast majority of our capital return capacity or capabilities towards buyback. Erika Najarian : Got it. And, John, just a follow up question. You mentioned earlier that for every quarter that we have an additional 25 basis points on the short, and that's about $80 million a quarter. In your modeling, what does that assume for deposit costs? John Gerspach : That reflects our updated view of deposit beta. If you go back a year or so - I think I was asked that same question. The guidance then would have been - for 25 basis points, we would have expected roughly 100. So now, just given the fact that - the assumption is that deposit beta will continue to increase, that's why the new guidance would be closer to $80 million. Erika Najarian : Okay. Thank you. John Gerspach : All right. Operator : Our next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey, good morning. John Gerspach : Hi, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : So a quick question. You gave - you reiterated the guidance on the NCL rate both for branded cards and retail services. But I mean, shouldn't your borrowers or customers also benefit from tax reform? So I mean, is there some chance that you come in better than that guidance post tax reform? John Gerspach : Yes, there clearly is, Brian. I mean, right now, our assessment is that, that benefit certainly would give us even greater confidence in those forward projections that we put out there. But we really haven't had a chance to run every aspect of tax reform in every MSA around the country through our various models to see what that might give us as far as any improvement in our NCL projections going forward. But I agree with you that when you take a look at the positive impact of tax reform, and I think Mike mentioned this in his opening comments, the expectation is that with higher take-home pay, you would expect consumers to either increase spending or perhaps increase the payment rate on existing debt. Both of those things would be beneficial to the economy. Both of those things would be beneficial to consumers, and they both should be beneficial to us. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And just a follow-up also on the NCL. You mentioned last quarter that you were seeing stabilization in the collections rates. Are you seeing any improvement quarter-over-quarter on those collection rates? Thanks. John Gerspach : Yes, and we definitely have seen improvement in line with our expectations. And so, again, that's one of the reasons why we were reaffirming the view towards a 5% NCL rate in retail services -- approximate 5% NCL rate in retail services in 2018. And again, we're reaffirming the guidance of around a 300 basis point NCL rate in U.S.-branded cards for 2018. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi, good morning. John Gerspach : Hi, Saul. Saul Martinez : A couple of questions. It seems like you are making progress in Mexico. You have good business momentum there. But are you concerned at all about the macro backdrop? There has been a pretty pronounced slowdown in loan growth in the fourth quarter in Mexico, and that includes cards. There's tick-up in delinquencies. You have the election, obviously, where the frontrunner is sort of a left-leaning guy with some populist tendencies, obviously, NAFTA uncertainty. But do you worry at all that sort of the macro backdrop, the election, the credit cycle could trip you up in your progress there? Michael Corbat : Well, we obviously pay a lot of attention to it, Saul, and we are watching it closely. And if you look at NAFTA, clearly, we believe the benefits to the U.S. and Canada and Mexico are important. That alliance is important. As we look at the numbers, you've seen the Mexican economy underperforming. I think, right now, growth forecasts look like Mexico is probably going to come in somewhere around 2.1%. That's clearly under-growing where it should be. So part of the NAFTA overhang is already built in. But if we saw NAFTA completely fall apart, it would probably have some impact and probably have more of an impact on our corporate franchise than the consumer franchise. The election, obviously, we're watching and we'll see how that unfolds. But again, as we look at our position in Mexico, we think we've got the continued ability to outgrow our consumer franchise at a pace as we've described is a multiple of GDP that's there. I think the other thing that you've seen is in spite of the fact that the dollar has weakened some you've actually seen the peso weaken further. Really, if you go back to midsummer at its point, it was probably about at its strongest. We've probably seen about a 15% depreciation versus the dollar since then, and that's made, obviously, the peso more competitive. So you've got to measure the ins and outs. But net-net if we don't get NAFTA, net-net if we end up with the election with a more leftist candidate, it will likely hurt the economy from here. Saul Martinez : Okay. That's helpful. Can you comment on M&A? You've just done M&A as a strategy to deploy capital. There are opportunities there. How do you think about it in terms of your overall capital strategy? John Gerspach : So when we think of M&A, we don't think of being out there and buying another bank or a big bank. A couple of things, one is from a regulatory perspective, not just for us, but certainly for the bigger banks in the industry, that would probably be challenged from a regulatory approval perspective. And candidly, at this point in time, I don't think we're all that keen about taking on big branch infrastructure that - we've got infrastructure in our consumer business. We've got infrastructure in our consumer business that already has us at scale. And I think we'd rather take that same investment as we're doing and channel it towards digital and other things where we can get growth organically. And I think you're seeing that in the strategy today. And where opportunities present themselves around portfolios with different types of bolt-ons that are in strategy, we're wide open. We've got the capital. We've got the balance sheet. We've got the risk appetite for those things that fit us. And so we continue to look at those. But again, when we think about and talk about and create expectations for you, it's predominantly organically led. Saul Martinez : Okay. So you don't feel like you need any branch infrastructure outside of your core 6 markets in the U.S.? John Gerspach : No. Again, we - we're going the other way. Others are going the other way. And we hope and believe and are making the investment in digital and think we can continue to grow our franchise using digital rather than physical branch footprint. Saul Martinez : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. If I could follow up on the NII dollars. John, thanks for giving that core accrual and legacy. I wanted to ask about the trading part, and I know it's quite volatile. But you had that $1.66 billion delta this year and you ended at $510 million. Can you help us try to range what you could expect that to do - that part to do this year? John Gerspach : In 2018? Ken Usdin : Yes. John Gerspach : I think, Ken, maybe the best way to think about it is if you look at the fourth quarter, we were down in trading related NIR [ph] $430 million or so, and then as you mentioned, that's $1.7 million for the year. And there's an element of that, that is going to be just difficult to predict because it's related to changes in trading strategies and balance sheet structure, et cetera. But I think you can get a sense of the impact of higher funding costs, which is what we called out in my prepared commentary. You can get a sense of that. If you take a look at Slide 19 of the financial supplement, and if you look there, take a look at the trading-related assets and liabilities, along with the categories Fed funds sold and repurchased -- and purchased. And if you look at those lines, you're going to see that with the - when you take a look at the assets and liabilities that are really clearly associated with our trading business, just a little over - the trading liabilities fund, just a little bit over half of the level of assets that we employ in our trading business. Now that means that the balance -- you got to think about it as primarily being funded by debt, some form of debt with 3 months' LIBOR rate as a good proxy to the cost of that funding. So obviously, as we've seen 3-month LIBOR is steadily increasing, well, we've seen trading-related NIR decline. I mean, I'm being overly simplistic. I have said there are certainly other factors that impact trading related NIR, but in periods of steadily rising rates, that's the factor that's going to have the largest impact. Ken Usdin : Okay. That's a good way to think about it. I'll come back if I have questions about that. And then the other question is, in your core, are you contemplating both the Hilton sale, as well as the delta to your just FTE component, which I know is not a big number, but is that all contemplated in the other 2 components? John Gerspach : Yes. Everything is - everything that you just mentioned is - all those factors are in the guidance that we gave you. Ken Usdin : Okay. Last thing then, just on the loan yields overall, I know there's a lot of moving parts also quarter-to-quarter and all that. But just on the loan yields, the decline this quarter of 13 basis points, I know probably some of that is the teaser balances. But can you - how much is mix and how much is volume, can you help us understand what the moving parts are of loan yields? Thanks. John Gerspach : I don't have that broken out, but obviously mix is definitely playing a role in NIM. So if you take a look at our core NIM, which declined 2 basis points for the quarter and maybe it was roughly 5 basis points for the full year, in the quarter, the decline really was just due to the impact of currency rates. But underneath that, what we've seen is a change in mix. So our corporate loans, which have good but lower NIM than - our corporate loans are growing faster than our consumer loans. And therefore, we've got a change in mix that is certainly contributing to that flattish NIM on a sequential basis and also contributing to the somewhat flattish NIM on a year-over-year basis as well. So we're seeing the loan growth. It's generating good net interest revenue, that's why you're seeing the growth. And you have $2 billion of core accrual net interest revenue growth for the full year, $520 million of that in the fourth quarter. But just given the fact that a lot of that is coming off of the corporate loans, it's changing - it's depressing the overall level of NIM at this point in time. Ken Usdin : Yeah, okay. Understood. Thanks a lot. John Gerspach : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. John Gerspach : Morning, Marty. Marty Mosby : Yes. Can you hear me now? John Gerspach : Yes. How are you doing Marty? Marty Mosby : Thanks. When you look at the tax rate for this particular quarter and it being down lower, is that a reflection of when you kind of look at your expectations or reserves against taxes, you have that, and as the tax rate is going down in the future, you would adjust the reserves that you need on potential benefit? And the reason I'm getting at that is there's been about half the banks that had this particular impact in this particular quarter before we got into the actual rate going down. So I was thinking that would force out why you're thinking you're down at 24%, too, down the road? John Gerspach : No, Marty. I mean, it's a good thought, but really, what's driving our tax rate lower this quarter, that 25.1%, it's really just the - an impact of one episodic item, that one episodic discrete item that was in the fourth quarter. That's what we tried to call out earlier in the call when we pointed to the fact that a combination of a tax good guide is one discrete item that benefited the corporate tax rate and one tax \"bad guide\" that ended up in these gaps added about $0.08 per share to the earnings. So it's just a combination of two episodic discrete tax items. Marty Mosby : Okay. It had nothing to do with the future tax rate going down? John Gerspach : No, sir. Marty Mosby : The other thing I was going to ask you was we've talked a lot about the improvement in returns and earnings as you go forward but not a lot about reduction in the tangible book value as you change the DTA this quarter. It was about a - it looks like about $10 per share that it came down. And if you look at the increase in your returns, incrementally, it could add $1 to $1.50 per year to make that up. So it's going to take a while to get back up from where we're at. I just was curious how you all thought about that in the sense of the dilution that you took upfront with the write-off. John Gerspach : Yes. We've always had the deferred tax assets in our tangible book value and our total book value. And I think many have questions as far as the future value of those things. We always thought of those as being something that you would look at more on an annuity basis because we knew that you'd be getting the value of those assets over time. And while we did take that write-off, there still is a remaining annuity value to the DTA that is on the books. So we still think that there's good value there. The reduction in the tangible book value or the book value, which is about $8 a share. I think when you look at the fact that we're generating a 200 basis point improvement at a minimum of - to RoTCE out into the future, I still think it's a pretty good trade-off. So you've got more certainty in the book value because the uncertain element of the DTA - the value of the DTA has been removed and you've traded that uncertainty for a real improvement in your RoTCE. So again, I think that the trade-off is overall accretive to the value of the stock. Marty Mosby : Got it. Thanks. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Our next question is from Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Andrew Lim : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Just had a following question on the trading NII that you talked about earlier. I mean, as the 3 months LIBOR keeps on going up, I guess, theoretically, this might head down towards 0 and maybe even negative. Is that something theoretically that's possible? And if that is on the table as a possibility, is it something that you could consider to wind up your trading strategies? John Gerspach : As I've said, there's a lot of moving pieces. There are a lot of moving pieces in trading related NIR. And the best way to actually look at the business is not through this one line item. This is just a factor of balance sheet construction and interest rate movement. That is not the way that we or you should evaluate the health of our trading businesses. So we really encourage you to look at the overall revenue performance in these trading businesses. And when you take a look at our FICC trading business, it's either number one or number two. We definitely have been gaining market share. So no, we're not going to shut down our FICC business because of trading related net interest revenue. Andrew Lim : Right. So everything should be taken as a whole. I understand. Okay. And then just on the net charge-off guidance that you've given there, what kind of interest rates do you look at in terms of giving that guidance? And how should we look at that, too, from a macro perspective? Do you look at like the short end, 1 to 2 years or is it increasingly like the 5 years as corporates and so forth have termed out their borrowing? John Gerspach : When we try to put models into play, we take a look at the overall economic environment, including where we think the -- where we see interest rates going, which is a combination of short end and long end, which is going to have different behavioral impacts on either consumers or corporate clients. So the answer is all of that goes in. Andrew Lim : All right. Thank you very much. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Our final question is from Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Al Alevizakos : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions and for the presentation. My first question is regarding the outlook that you have for 2018 and going forward on your IB trading business. Overall, I just want to know if you think that the tax reform will be enough to kick the period in Q1 and Q2 effectively and offset the prolonged low volatility. And the second question, which is effectively a follow-up of this question, is whether you see any significant margin pressure at the moment in your IB trading product. And if you do, I'm just trying to find the - what you think is the primary reason. We've already mentioned the higher funding costs, but I'm wondering whether you think that you're now facing high competition from your bank peers or a new competition from fintech? Thank you very much. Michael Corbat : So maybe I'll start with the first one. But Al, I understand when you say IB, you actually mean sales and trading as part of... Al Alevizakos : Yes, just the trading, yes. Michael Corbat : Okay. So one, I think I described and John described a couple of things, both on a relative and an absolute basis. So on a relative basis, quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year comparisons coming out of 2016 with the elections, obviously, activity was down a bit. And I think what we've talked about and described on this call historically is we don't necessarily measure trading by the quarter. We don't necessarily measure by the month. It is oftentimes week to week, it's day to day, and it's very, very much event-driven. And so we've talked about an outlook in terms of rates going forward. So if we start to see more rate increases, you could see some more activity around that. John also talked about the mix of our business being a bit different. But for us, it's not just the investors. The corporate client plays an extremely important part. And that I could argue in terms of foreign exchange and some other things that might be related to repatriations, money movements, domicile, et cetera, that we could see some activity coming out of that business as people react to tax reform that's there. But it's - our intention in the business to - the growth is going to look like and feel like more coming from share gains than the consolidation of a leadership position. And I think you saw that in a down revenue, down wallet year in terms of trading, that we actually fared pretty well there. And that's my expectation is that there would be more of that as we go through '18. And the second part of your question, Al, was on margins in the business? Al Alevizakos : Yes, just wanted to understand whether you think about pricing is actually going a bit lower. So it's not only about volumes anymore but actually pricing becomes part of the issue going forward. John Gerspach : Yes. Al, it's John now. Pricing has certainly been an issue in that business for the last several years. We've seen continued pressure on pricing. And I think you have to assume that, that continues. That's one of the reasons why we talked about this really being a scale business. If you're not prepared to make the investments in technology, which we've done, and if you don't have that good client base in order to work with, you're going to be in trouble. One of the things that we always point to, especially in our rates and currencies business, is that a large percentage of our client revenues come from corporate clients. And corporate clients are different from investor clients because corporate clients are in the market every day because they really have to hedge their overall balance sheet. They got to think in terms of working capital management. It's different than investor clients. And this year, in rates and currencies, corporate clients formed 45% of our client revenues, and even in a year where overall client revenues declined in the industry, we actually had a 5% growth in our corporate client revenue. So that was enough to actually generate an overall increase for us in client revenues in our rates and currencies business. So yes, there's a lot of changing dynamics in the marketplace, but we really think it boils down to being able to focus on your customers, which is why we talk about client-led revenue, to make sure that you are investing in the necessary technology, and those are the things that we're doing. Al Alevizakos : Great. Thank you very much for the answers. John Gerspach : No problem. Michael Corbat : Thanks for your question. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. Are there any closing remarks? Susan Kendall : Thank you, Jamie. Thank you all for joining us this morning. If you have any questions, please reach out to Investor Relations. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time.  Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Natalia. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we'll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.6 billion for the first quarter of 2018 or $1.68 per share. Our quarter showed strong and balanced performance as we continued to capture client-led growth, and we remain on track to deliver on the targets we announced at Investor Day. Our earnings per share were 24% higher than 1 year ago as a result of strong business performance, a lower tax rate and a continued reduction in shares outstanding as we execute our capital return plans. Relative to a year ago, we grew revenues by 3%, improved our efficiency ratio to just under 58%, increased our return on assets to 98 basis points and improved our return on tangible common equity to 11.4%. We grew loans in our core businesses by 7% or $44 billion from last year, and we ended the quarter with over $1 trillion in deposits. Global Consumer Banking had a good all-around quarter with 6% revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region. In the U.S., we continued to make progress with our Citigold Wealth Management offering and also had growth in retail services. In branded cards, we saw the underlying revenue growth that we projected, driven by an increase in interest-earning balances and strong client engagement. And in Mexico and Asia, we saw momentum in both retail banking and cards. Our Institutional Clients Group had another solid quarter. While Fixed Income revenues were lower than a year ago, driven by less investor activity, our Equities business saw its best quarter in many years, giving us confidence that our investments are delivering results. We also saw ongoing momentum in TTS, our Private Bank, Corporate Lending and Securities Services as we continued to grow these stable accrual-type businesses. While Investment Banking revenue was down, we held on to the wallet share gains we've made in recent years, and client engagement remained strong.  In addition to improving our return on capital, we continued to make progress in improving the return of capital for our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $3 billion in capital to our shareholders, helping to reduce our common shares outstanding by over 200 million shares from 1 year ago or 7%. We will complete our current $19 billion capital return plan in the second quarter, and we recently submitted our plan for the 2018 CCAR cycle. We believe we remain on track to meet the commitment we outlined at Investor Day of returning at least $60 billion over the 2017, '18 and '19 cycles, subject, of course, to regulatory approval. The environment remains unique, to say the least. We have synchronized global growth in a macroeconomic environment which is as positive as we've seen since before the financial crisis. U.S. corporations are starting to see the benefits of tax reform. The labor market is tight, and wage growth continues to improve. At the same time, though, there are concurrently escalating and deescalating tensions depending on the day and geography. And while our markets business may appreciate the volatility, we'd be better served by steady and predictable growth and having our fundamentally robust economy do its thing. With that, John will go through our presentation, and then we'd be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Thanks, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. Net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter grew 13% from last year as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. EPS grew 24%, including the impact of a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.9 billion grew 3% from the prior year, reflecting 7% aggregate growth in our consumer and institutional businesses, offset by lower revenues in Corp/Other as we continued to wind down legacy assets. Expenses increased 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. Our efficiency ratio was 57.9% for the quarter, roughly 50 basis points better than last year, representing the sixth consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency improvement. And cost of credit increased, mostly driven by the institutional business as well as volume growth and seasoning in consumer. Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter, and RoTCE improved to 11.4%. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 6% year-over-year to $673 billion as 7% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corp/Other. GCB and ICG loans grew by $44 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer as well as TTS to Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 37% in the first quarter, driven by operating margin and EBIT growth in each region as well as a lower tax rate. Total revenues of $8.4 billion grew 6% year-over-year and were up 4%, excluding the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale, which resulted in a gain this quarter, partially offset by the loss of operating revenues for a net benefit of about $120 million in our U.S.-branded cards business. From a product perspective, global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the first quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs even as we continued to shrink our physical branch footprint. And global cards delivered 3% revenue growth, excluding Hilton, driven by continued growth in loans and purchase sales in every region. Slide 5 shows the results from North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 4% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continued to decline, mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs. However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 8%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity. Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, including the impact of lower mortgage escrow deposits. We generated 2% growth in checking deposits this quarter, driven largely by our Citigold segment. However, this was more than offset by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. And in keeping with this focus on Wealth Management, assets under management were up 10% year-over-year to $61 billion. We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold with continued growth in both households and balances with improving penetration of investment products, and we're continuing to drive our digital transformation as well. As part of our mobile-first strategy, we've been developing capabilities to enhance the experience of our clients. And we're now at a point where we can leverage these digital capabilities to acquire and service a broader range of retail banking customers. Our recently announced launch of national digital banking is key to this next step in our transformation, designed to meet all the clients' needs through mobile banking, including the ability to seamlessly open a new Citibank retail account within the mobile app. We believe these capabilities will allow us to expand beyond our core markets and build a national presence, but we recognize that this build-out will take time. New features will begin to roll out towards the end of the second quarter, followed by a promotional campaign beginning in the third quarter.  Turning to branded cards. Revenues were roughly flat from last year, excluding the previously mentioned impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio. Client engagement remained strong with average loans growing by 5% and purchase sales up 8% year-over-year. We continued to generate growth in total interest-earning balances this quarter, up about 6% year-over-year, excluding Hilton, as recent vintages continued to mature, as expected, partially offset by the runoff of non-core balances. Excluding the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January, we delivered roughly 2% underlying revenue growth in our U.S.-branded cards business this quarter, consistent with our full year 2018 outlook.  Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 2%, driven by higher average loans. Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 2% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were partially offset by efficiency savings. We continue to drive transaction volumes through lower-cost channels, and digital engagement remained strong with a 13% increase in total active digital users, including 25% growth among mobile users versus last year. Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, and we billed roughly $119 million of loan loss reserve this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning. Our NCL rate in U.S.-branded cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 518 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% for 2018. On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 8% with contribution from every business and region. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 8%. Retail banking revenues grew 7% in the first quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. And card revenues grew 13% on continued growth in purchase sales and full-rate revolving loans as well as a favorable prior period comparison. Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 7% year-over-year in the first quarter and were up 6%, excluding the benefit of a modest onetime gain. Excluding the gain, retail banking grew 6%, driven by our Wealth Management business, reflecting favorable market conditions. And card revenues grew 5% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales. In total, operating expenses grew 5% in the first quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was essentially flat. Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail by region. Credit continued to be broadly favorable again this quarter. In North America, the NCL rate increased sequentially, reflecting seasonality in cards, while delinquencies remained stable. And trends remained stable to improving in Mexico and Asia as well. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8. Revenues of $9.8 billion increased 6% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses [indiscernible] a very strong performance in Equities this quarter. Total banking revenues of $4.8 billion grew 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 8%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income. Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 10% from last year, generally in line with the overall market and reflecting the timing of episodic deal activity. Private Bank revenues of $904 million grew 21% year-over-year, driven by growth in clients, loans, investments and deposits as well as improved deposit spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $521 million were up 19%, reflecting loan growth as well as lower hedging costs. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues of $5 billion grew 3% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.4 billion declined 7% year-over-year. Corporate client activity remained strong, driving growth in G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies. However, this was more than offset by lower investor client activity and a less favorable environment in G10 Rates and spread products, in particular in March. Equities revenues were up 38% with growth across all products as volatility trended higher and we saw continued momentum with investor clients, in line with our investment strategy. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 7% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of FX translation as well as a higher level of investment spending. And finally, cost of credit was a benefit this quarter, driven by net ratings upgrades and continued stability in commodity prices. Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $591 million declined 51% from last year, driven by the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 35%, also reflecting the wind-down. And the pretax loss in Corp/Other was $143 million this quarter, slightly better than our outlook, mostly due to a greater benefit from legacy asset sales. Looking ahead, we believe an outlook for pretax losses in the range of around $200 million to $250 million per quarter in Corp/Other is a fair run rate for the remainder of 2018. This is an improvement from our prior outlook of quarterly losses in the range of $250 million to $300 million based on somewhat higher treasury revenues, given the higher rate environment as well as the lower expenses. Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, split by core accrual revenue, trading-related revenue and a contribution from our legacy assets in Corp/Other. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.2 billion this quarter grew slightly from last year. Core accrual net interest revenues grew by $750 million, but this was largely offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the anticipated wind-down of legacy assets. On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew slightly, reflecting the December rate hike as well as loan growth, partially offset by the impact of lower day count. And our core accrual net interest margin improved by 8 basis points to 354 basis points, driven by the rate increase, loan growth and lower average cash balances as we use liquidity to fund higher-yielding assets. On a full year basis, we now expect core accrual net interest revenue to grow by over $2.7 billion in 2018 as we've added the impact of the recent March rate hike to our original outlook, which had called for $2.5 billion of growth, assuming only one fed rate increase in June. Legacy asset-related net interest revenues should continue to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio. And trading-related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first quarter. On Slide 11, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 12.1% this quarter due to an increase in RWA, driven by loan growth and client activity as well as $3 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, partially offset by net income. And our tangible book value per share increased to $61. In summary, we made good progress towards our longer-term goals this quarter with solid revenue growth, positive operating leverage and a significant improvement in net income and returns. Looking to the second quarter for total Citigroup, we expect top line growth to continue broadly in line with the pace we set this quarter at around 3%, plus or minus, with stronger growth in our operating businesses being offset by the continued wind-down of legacy assets. Operating efficiency should again show progress against the prior year period with more significant improvement to come in the second half of the year. Cost of credit should increase quarter-over-quarter, assuming that credit normalizes in ICG. And the tax rate should be closer to 25%.  Turning to the businesses in more detail. In consumer, we expect continued revenue growth in U.S. retail banking, retail services, Mexico and Asia. In U.S.-branded cards, as described earlier, excluding Hilton, we expect continued underlying revenue growth as loan balances are maturing as expected. However, this should continue to be largely offset by the impact of additional partnership terms that went into effect in January. And of course, we will also see a year-over-year impact from the sale of the Hilton portfolio. On the institutional side, markets revenues should reflect the overall operating environment. However, we would typically expect a seasonal decline in trading revenues from the first quarter. Investment Banking revenues should improve quarter-over-quarter, assuming favorable market conditions. And we expect continued revenue growth in our accrual businesses, TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network.  In addition, we're looking forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter. At Investor Day last year, we stated our goal of returning at least $20 billion of capital to shareholders as part of the 2018 CCAR process. And subject to regulatory approval, we believe we remain on track to do so. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : John, I wanted to ask about the longer-term efficiency target. You're still targeting the low 50s on the efficiency ratio. Did the accounting changes change that goal? And could you remind us what the time line for getting to that efficiency goal is over the next few years? John Gerspach : Yes. Sure, John. Yes, the accounting changes impacted our overall efficiency by 50, 60 basis points, so I don't think that, that really changes our target of getting into the low 50s at all. And again, our target there is to get into those low 50s by 2020. So that's still our target, and we still figure that we're on progress to do that. John McDonald : Okay. From the outside, it looks like you're really going to need an acceleration in 2019 and 2020. The current pace seems like 100 basis points of improvement a year. And if you're kind of at 57%, 58%, what would drive that acceleration in '19, '20? Could you talk a little bit about maybe the spending arcs that you're doing on investing and maybe the savings that you expect? Are those going to ramp up and drive it? Or is it all revenue assumptions that drive this improvement in the out-years? John Gerspach : No, no, no. Fair question, John, fair question. But we targeted this year for another 100 basis point improvement as compared to the prior year. Now I'll give you the fact that when you take a look at the first quarter efficiency ratio of 57.9%, it certainly is above the 57% target that we got in place for the full year, but it's not inconsistent with our plan for the rest of the year. And so when you look at the rest of the year, I think you have to expect continued top line momentum. We talked about, more or less, 3% sustained revenue growth, but there's also several drivers in play as it relate to the expense base. First, as we mentioned in some of the commentary, expenses related to legacy assets should continue to decline as we complete the existing TSAs and continue to wind down the assets themselves. Second, incentive-related comp tends to be a little bit more heavily weighted to the front half of the year, and that's consistent with historic revenue trends in markets. And finally, as I noted, I believe when I spoke at the RBC conference, we're taking the opportunity today to invest in the franchise to both to continue top line momentum as well as to capture significant efficiency savings that we've outlined for you at Investor Day. Now we're seeing much of the year-over-year impact of growth in these investments in the first half of 2018. So think in terms of investment spending being a bit more front-end loaded in 2018 and the resulting efficiency benefits then begin to ramp up in the second half of the year. And so when you get growth in the core businesses, we will certainly have some volume-related expenses growing. But altogether, the second half expense profile should set us up well for achieving larger improvements in our efficiency ratio, both in the second half of this year and then into 2019 and into 2020. John McDonald : Okay. So you do -- right, you are saying that to get to that math to work, you do have to have more than 100 basis points improvement in '19 to get to 2020 low 50s John Gerspach : Yes. That fact has been noticed by me. John McDonald : Okay, okay. And is there also -- just one more on this. Do you have some kind of uptake in mobile adoption and maybe planned shrinkage of call centers or data centers related to this that will pick up in later years? Is that part of the plan as well? John Gerspach : That's exactly part of the plan, John. That's all in, again, some of the investments that we continue to make in digital and mobile. At Investor Day, we talked about achieving $1.5 billion of annual efficiency savings in consumer. And I think we've made significant progress in some of the investments, and we are certainly on track to achieve those savings. But again, you haven't seen the bulk of those savings yet. Those are savings that we expect to come on in the second half of this year and then even more so in '19 and '20. As you know, key to achieving these savings is the drive towards creating self-service, digital and mobile capabilities. And those capabilities, we think, are designed both to enhance the client experience but also, at the same time, driving operational efficiencies through reducing customer calls and paper statements. John McDonald : Okay. That's helpful, John. And the second thing for me is just on the new proposals, the SCB proposal that we saw come out this week. Is that in line what you're thinking of the 11.5% CET1 ratio target? I know you kind of incorporated SCB into that, but could that evolve over time in terms of how much management buffer you're putting on your regulatory minimums and your thoughts on that? John Gerspach : Yes, John. At Investor Day, when we laid out the 11.5% for you last year as being our target, we discussed various components embedded in that target. And one of those components included a stressed capital buffer, which we estimated at 3%. And the details of the NPR that got released earlier this week, as far as we can see, they're broadly consistent with what we expected in terms of the structure of the new framework and certainly the expected impact on the minimum capital requirements. So to have a direct answer to your question, if I had, had the documents that got released earlier this week, last July, we wouldn't have changed either the 3% estimate of an SCB or the target CET1 of 11.5%. And as we discussed then, one of the things that we recognized is that the proposed rule is going to create a certain amount of variability in a firm's requirements. We put in 100 basis point management buffer that I think we described at that point in time as being in place to actually address the variability or the volatility associated with the SCB as well as OCI movements. So as we get further into the discussion about the SCB, I do think that it's going to cause managements to need to address how they're using management buffers. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : John, follow-up to your comments when we talked about NII and the trading-related NII and ICT having headwinds in a rising rate environment. I just want to make sure, is that just natural funding costs of more wholesale-funded business? Can you hedge or reverse that if you felt like it and had a view on rates? Can you pass it through to customers that are using your balance sheet? Just curious to get your thoughts on that. John Gerspach : Well, the answer to all of those questions is, well, first, yes. It is just natural within that business. I think maybe on the last earnings call, I mentioned the fact that if you actually look at the trading-related assets and liabilities that are in the average balance sheet that we give you in the supplement, you'll see that the trading-related liabilities cover, more or less, 50% of the trading-related assets. And so the balance is subject -- is funded through wholesale means. Can we do hedging on it? I guess you could. But don't forget, when you get into the trading businesses, a lot of what drives NII also is how different trades are structured. So there's a structural element of the balance sheet, but I don't think that we want to get into putting on -- having an interest rate view of businesses that are trading interest rates. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I got it. I appreciate that. And one more follow-up. Prior to the recent fed letters, there's a fed letter last month, and one of the things that it did was more aggressively stress card losses in the test, which I thought were already really aggressively stressed, but whatever. Curious if you have a view on how much worse that is, why they did that now. And does it have any impact on how you actually manage the business in real life? Are there particular types of business that get treated worse that you have to think about how you price? John Gerspach : No. I'm trying to choose my words very carefully here, Glenn. But one of the issues, obviously, that I think there's been a lot of discussion about has been the lack of transparency in some of the fed models that drive CCAR, lack of transparency into how scenarios are developed. And so we don't have a great deal of understanding in how the fed comes up with some of their views, and so it's rather difficult then to say, \"Okay. I understand they have a particular view on a particular exposure. We need to rethink the entire business model around something,\" because those views from the fed change as well, so long answer. But the short answer is no, we're not going to change the way that we look at our cards book. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I thought it was a very clean and straightforward quarter so appreciate that and appreciate the quick opening comments on such a busy day. If we look within ICG, the trends in Asia were quite strong, both in revenue and net income. And just wondered if you could elaborate on the revenue strength there in terms of some of the products and what drove that. John Gerspach : No. As you note, Matt, we saw a lot of good activity coming out of Asia in this quarter. It's actually a build-on of things that we saw building from the second half of last year, and I think it speaks to a lot of the growing economies in Asia, a little bit more positive outlook. And fortunately, given the breadth of our franchise, we're in position to capture a lot of that. But it's fairly broad-based. It's in -- it's actually the Fixed Income business in Asia actually performed very well this quarter. Equities performed well this quarter. Investment Banking was down a little bit in Asia but a lot less than it was anywhere else, so just a lot of good overall volumes coming out of Asia. Matthew O'Connor: And then just conceptually, I mean, how much of the franchise, when we look at these Asian revenues, are kind of global corporates doing business versus maybe a notch below like more local companies? John Gerspach : Well, most of our book is focused on serving the needs of the large multinationals. So that's one of the reasons why if you look at overall in the ICG, in our corporate lending book and the corporate exposures that we've given you, roughly 80% of that book is investment grade, and that's because it really is concentrated in those large multinationals because we service their subs in Asia and everything else. Now there's a growing cost rate of large local corporates that are also multinational. But still, our overall business is dominated by the large multinationals and their subs that are based in the U.S. and in Europe. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. James Mitchell : One of the biggest questions I get on you guys surrounds the card -- U.S. card business and how to think about or size the TCA rate impact and how it can maybe rebound eventually in terms of conversion rates and with the size of the portfolio. I mean, we can maybe take an educated guess, but if there's any kind of help you can give us in trying to think through what -- how the portfolio is sized today and how much you think you'll end up with in terms of paying balances next year and beyond. John Gerspach : Yes. And we've never talked specifics about the exact dollar amount on promotional balances that we've built up, and so I'm not going to go into that level of detail. But we have told you that it is -- it built up significantly last year, and our expectation is that it was going to stabilize at the beginning of this year and it has. And now it should continue then to reduce throughout the balance of 2018 and then into 2019. So we're never going to drive it to 0 because it certainly is an important piece of the growth strategy for the business, but it will get a little -- we acknowledge that it was a little outsized last year because we pulled back from trying to grow in the rewards product area and focused instead on the promo balances in value and whatnot. But we're already seeing the balances stabilize, and I think they're down slightly from the end of December to the end of March. But the thesis and our plan is to drive that even lower during the course of this year. James Mitchell : And what's the sort of expected or what should have been your experience with sort of balances that convert to interest bearing, the rough kind of percentage? How should we think about that? John Gerspach : Again, we've never disclosed an actual percentage, but I think if you think in terms of something a little less than half, you'd be in a good range. James Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. All right. And maybe just a question on equities trading. You obviously have very significant growth year-over-year. It seems mostly in the market-making components. I assume that's derivative. How much of that is just outside volatility this quarter? Or do you really think there's some sustainability in that growth? John Gerspach : Well, I actually think it's a combination of both. The overall market conditions for Equities was very strong in the first quarter, and so we certainly benefited from that. But at the same time, we've been making the investments that we've been talking about, the investments, sustained investments in our platform, the talent, expanded capabilities in order to serve the needs of our clients and putting more balance sheet to work to deepen those relationships. And so I think our performance this quarter is a combination of both favorable market and the foundation that we built through all of that investment. So we feel really good about our performance. We think that it continues the trend of our ability to capture market share in this area. Whether you're dealing with unfavorable market conditions or favorable market conditions, we still feel like we're on that march up towards the #5 position in equity markets, which is something that we targeted getting to several years ago. Michael Corbat : And what was nice about it is the breadth in terms of the combination of cash derivative, Delta One, Prime Finance all showing nice, sequential and year-over-year gain. So in there, I don't think we can or would annualize that number. We'd love to, but I don't think we're there yet. But I think we feel good about the progress and some of the stickiness that comes with that. John Gerspach : Yes. Very good. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : If you could just give more information on the credit cards and the promotional balances, I guess I'll try again. You said a little less than half is what -- if you could just clarify what that referred to. And I thought the new data point, you said there's 6% growth in interest-earning balances, and I think that would compare to 4% growth in the fourth quarter. So you're seeing an acceleration in the growth of interest-earning credit card balances. Is that correct? And if so, is that because the promotions are sticking once they reprice from 0% to 14% to 24%? Or is that due to other reasons? John Gerspach : Okay, Mike. If I miss one of the questions, please remind me what it was. But you're absolutely correct. 6% growth in the interest-earning balances this quarter compared to 4% last quarter, so that is an acceleration. And that's what we've been talking about, the fact that we did expect that growth rate to accelerate, and it has. And the acceleration of that growth rate is a combination, both of overall growth in the existing interest rate balances as well as the added growth coming from vintages of the promotional vintages now maturing and then a good portion of those promotional balances sticking with us as interest-earning balances. The reference prior to the 50% -- it's something in the range of a little less than 50% was an answer to -- I think it was Jim's question. As far as -- if you get promotional balances, how much of that do you think sticks with you? And we've never given an actual percentage, but I said, \"If you think of something a little less than 50%, you'd be in the right ballpark.\" How did I do? Michael Mayo : No. I think that's helpful. I mean, I'm still -- look, I'm all on your website now, and I see I can basically get free money for 21 months by transferring a balance and then purchases up to 12 months. It sounds like a great deal for consumers. It's just hard for us in the outside to know how the deal is for you guys. And I guess one last follow-up then. So you're not giving us the total balance of the promotional balances on -- I'll take it if you could give it to us. But what else can you have us look to, to be reassured that this strategy is going to pay off for shareholders? John Gerspach : Well, I think that, again, you're going to see, once we get past '18, we talked about some of the revenue impacts in '18 holding the overall business revenues flat. You should start to see growth in '19. More specifically, when you take a look at -- if you go into the supplement and you look at the net interest revenue percentage, ex Hilton, you can see how that has been steadily declining. And that obviously impacts a combination of the drag on promotional balances, along with the rise in interest rates, to fund that portfolio. Our expectation is that you got 1 more quarter of that to go down, and it's largely due to seasonality. The second quarter is usually a slight reduction there. But then you should start to see, beginning in the third quarter, that percentage increase. And that should give you a fairly good view as to what the future profitability of the business is. If you look at that now, basically I think if you look year-over-year, even with that percentage declining, we're still getting growth in net interest revenue in U.S.-branded cards, ex Hilton, something north of 2%, 2.4%, 2.3%. And that, again, that's in line with what we talked about as far as being the underlying growth of that portfolio for this year being 2%. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : So you increased your expectation for core accrual NII to 2.7% from 2.5%, and I guess you're incorporating an additional rate hike. But can you just remind us if we do see 3% or 4% hikes, how much that -- how much you benefit from each incremental rate hike on a quarterly basis? Can you just remind us what the sensitivity is there? John Gerspach : Yes. And it's very simple to do, Saul, because what we did was the March rate hike actually happened. We did not have that in our previous outlook, and we talk about that. And so our guidance had been that for each quarter, we get an additional 25 basis point rate hike, it should add about $80 million worth of net interest revenue for the year. So March happened, 3 quarters, 3 times $80 million, $240 million. So the 2.5% goes up to 2.7% and changed. We just rounded it to 2.7%. But technically, it will be 2.74%. And the math is as simple as that. Now that's certainly in place for the March rate hike, and that's the way we calculated the impact of the June rate hike. I do think that as we go forward with future rate hikes -- as you get more and more rate hikes, we'll probably see a bit of compression in that $80 million just because the expectation would be that deposit betas are increasing. Saul Martinez : Right, right. Okay. No. That's fair enough. That's about as simple math as you can do. Great. John Gerspach : Thank you. I'm... Saul Martinez : There you go. It works. Simple is good. On the trading side, just obviously this -- the volatility early in the year has helped, especially in the Equities side. But generally, I think the perception is -- has been that it's a good thing. Obviously, March, maybe FICC was a little bit tougher. But how are you feeling? I know it's hard to predict on a quarterly basis. But how are you feeling about the business from here? You've had -- volatility has been good. But with the more recent market downturn, maybe institutional investors are heading for the sidelines a bit. But how are -- how should we be -- how are you thinking about FICC right now, the outlook there? And obviously in the Equities side, there's a build-out. But just generally, what are sort of the puts and takes around the businesses? John Gerspach : Well, as far as from an Equities point of view, we certainly feel really good about the business that we're building in Equities. And so -- and I think this quarter's performance at least provides a point of evidence for it, although we were building up market share all during last year as well. But I think this is just another proof point. When it comes to FICC, it really is the investor that is a little bit of a variable there. And one of the things that we've talked about is the fact that investors, depending upon market conditions, are either in the market transacting or else, as you just said so, they sometimes drift to the sidelines. That's one of the reasons why we like the fact that in our rates and currencies business, in particular, 45% of the client revenues that we generate in that business are from corporate clients. And that gives us a fairly strong foundation in our rates and currency business because corporations need to fund their balance sheet every day, which means every day, you've got the ability to have a conversation with either a global treasurer or a local treasurer about what he or she needs to do in order to make payments, fund their working capital needs. And all of that helps to drive a lot of the activity in our rates and currencies business. So good core foundation, but it's the market volatility that ultimately will determine the size of the revenue flows that any institution is going to see in the FICC business. Saul Martinez : Got it. And I guess just the final thing from there just building out. In IP, how are you thinking about the pipe -- what's the pipeline look like? What's -- how are you thinking -- how's the DCM, ECM, M&A? How are you thinking about the outlooks there? Michael Corbat : Saul, I would say that the first quarter, we saw volumes down, and our drop in Investment Banking is pretty much right in line with what aggregate volumes were. But I would describe where we are today is not having hit the stop button but the pause button. And I think part of it is that I think we've seen some things on the approval, the regulatory, the legal side that have caused some of the big transactions to take pause. And I'd say the other piece right now, which we're actively involved in, is, in particular, in the U.S. in the C-suite, the introduction of tax reform has people thinking and rethinking strategy and appropriately so, right. We've taken traditionally a high global tax rate, made it a lower tax rate and rather than global being territorial. And so people are and appropriately so, and we're very involved in those conversations rethinking that. And so I would say the pipeline, as we go forward, we think, looks good. And we expect activity to pick back up. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Nomura Instinet. Steven Chubak : John, so I wanted to dig into some of the NII guidance that you have given. It sounds from what I could glean that given the growth that you're contemplating or anticipating within core accrual NII as well as the declines or more subdued revenues on the trading NII side as well as the legacy runoff book, it feels like, for the full year, we should see NII relatively flat. And I was just hoping you can affirm whether that's the right way to think about it. Or are there other factors that we need to consider? John Gerspach : We told you that core accrual net interest revenue should grow $2.7 billion this quarter -- I mean, this year. I wish it was 1 quarter, this year. The legacy asset runoff is $500 million, so that's $2.2 billion. And trading will be, as we've said, a bit unpredictable. But it's hard to imagine that we're going to get $2 billion of runoff in trading near this year. It could happen, I guess, but that's not the way we're planning it. Steven Chubak : Okay, understood. And, John, just wanted to dig into some of the efficiency comments you made with regards to some of your digital efforts within consumer. As we think about the long-term expense trajectory from here, I was just hoping you could shed some light on what you think is an achievable efficiency target for retail banking specifically. It's something that we hear from investors quite often, just given that your margins are well above some of your U.S. retail bank peers, whether you expect to see meaningful conversions there. And how should we think about the timing? John Gerspach : Yes. I don't want to get into guidance for individual product lines within a business. At Investor Day last year, we gave you our targets for Citi overall, and I think we shared some targets for GCB as well as ICG. But as you can imagine there, there's a lot of tradeoffs to go on in between different subproducts in each of those businesses. And I really don't want to get into specific targets for specific products. Steven Chubak : Okay. Fair enough. And just one more for me on the stressed capital buffer. You mentioned that you'd estimated an SCB of roughly 3%. I just wanted to clarify if that estimate is based on your 2017 results or is that more of an average over the last couple of years. John Gerspach : No. That was based on 2017, Steve. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Question just on LIBOR and the three months, 1 month base differential that happened this quarter. How did that impact you guys in the NIM? John Gerspach : Very little. I mean, I wouldn't say none but it isn't a noticeable factor that we would point out for anything. It certainly -- we had very little impact on any of our funding schemes or on how the businesses had performed. So it's interesting to look at but it didn't really impact us at all. Betsy Graseck : And on trading, same thing? John Gerspach : Again, it's part of the conversation that you have with clients. It's a great thing. It's a great conversation starter, and so it can lead to a whole series of discussions as to how clients might be thinking about things or observations in the market. But for how it impacted our business in particular, no. Betsy Graseck : Right. And then front-end skew of your rate sensitivity, I mean, that is LIBOR based and prime based. I'm assuming both, but it's just the basis that changed in the quarter didn't impact you. Is that correct? John Gerspach : Yes. Look, everything balances out. I mean, we have a slight reduction, of course, in our forward-looking IRE as a result of some of these moves and putting more things to work in the business. But it didn't impact anything structurally, no. Betsy Graseck : So then when I look at the core accrual NIM, the one on Page 10, the 3.54% this quarter, we can build off of that for the rest of the year, given the forward curve looking for a couple of more rate hikes? John Gerspach : Yes. The expectation would be that we would continue to see some growth in that core NIM. Betsy Graseck : Okay, great. And then just lastly, I know we had a lot of questions already on the ESLR. Your SLR is relatively high, and that's been high for a little while. Is it -- should we read anything into that? Like are you saying by having a relatively high SLR already that you've maxed out your opportunities on the lower risk-weighted asset business lines or maybe you have a different answer? John Gerspach : Well, I guess, the answer would be SLR has never been a binding constraint for us. And so we've never really had to optimize the SLR. We've never had a problem in getting there. When you talk about lower risk-weighted assets as -- and now, we're moving much more to standardized approach, it's not a big -- there's not a larger gap between what you would think about as an advanced approach or really risk-based RWA and GAAP assets anymore. There's some but it's less so. So the SLR is interesting. We would applaud the increased flexibility that it can grant us but it never -- it really hasn't been something that has really impacted our overall business. What impacts us would be our focus on maintaining a 3% GSIB score and managing to that target of 11.5% CET1 ratio that we talked about. So I mean, SLR is somewhat of a fallout from those two efforts. Betsy Graseck : And does it matter at all if the rules were to change to take cash out of the denominator? I know the proposal does not have that expected but there's a question in there looking for feedback on that topic. Would it matter to you if that was the case or not? John Gerspach : Well, again, we're always going to applaud increased flexibility and applaud the application of logic to regulatory ratios. And why you would need to hold capital against cash, I still don't understand. So yes, I'd like to see that just because I think it's logical. Michael Corbat : I don't think, John, it would change the business strategy. John Gerspach : It wouldn't change our business strategy. Absolutely not. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Mike, in your opening comments, you made a good blend of thought across better, synchronized global growth and yet the volatility. And I just wanted to ask you, this comes up a lot with the investor community but tends to be more resilient in the business model. We've seen better results out of Asia and Latin America, especially in Consumer. How resilient is that improved growth and trajectory versus -- and what do you hear when you're talking to the regions about, perhaps, the jitters that get caused out of the volatility and how that might impact growth? Michael Corbat : Well, when you think about Latin America or Asia and you look at what's going on in those economies, economies are, across the board, strong. We talked about this global synchronized growth, and when you're on the ground, you absolutely feel it. You feel it from the consumer perspective. You feel it at the corporate level. And I think some of the volatility that we see with morning tweaks or kind of stances that vary from time-to-time, I won't say the world is numb or numbing to that but I think that the positive things that are happening in the advancements we see on growth on the ground are overwhelming that. And that, to us, is very positive. Kenneth Usdin : Okay, got it. As a follow-up to that, John, can you just talk to us broadly then also about your outlook for credit? I don't think you've changed anything with regard to your card outlook, like you mentioned in your prepared remarks but anything notable to see underneath the surface in terms of some of the -- a little moving parts on the consumer side, LatAm better and then the U.S. normalizing as we expected. But just your overall thoughts on cost of credit and forward expectation would be great. John Gerspach : Yes, actually, we continue to see credit performing very, very well, whether it be in the North America businesses or in Mexico or in Asia when it comes to consumer. When you take a look at that slide, I think it's 7, and it's been pretty stable across the board. And as we look into the delinquencies, which we give you at least insight into the 90-day delinquencies, we don't see anything bumping up. So we feel pretty good about the credit picture across the consumer business. And in like fashion, we feel really good about the credit performance of our ICG portfolio as well. As I mentioned, 80% of our portfolio is investment-grade, and that's clearly the way that the ICG loan book has been performing. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : My questions have been asked and answered. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : You guys had some strong numbers in the Treasury and Trade Solutions on a year-over-year basis. It looked like you had up -- high single-digit revenue growth, and Securities Services was mid-teens. How much can you say was due to market share gains versus just a better interest rate environment for you guys? John Gerspach : I don't want to split the revenue growth. Obviously, there's 3 aspects, I think, in that. And 1 is continued volume growth with existing clients. We're doing more with every client, so we're gaining wallet share with our existing clients. We're also gaining wallet share outside of the existing clients by bringing on new clients, and that certainly is a story in security services in particular but also in the commercial card aspect of TTS. And then the last would be the impact of rates but I just don't have a percentage in my head, Gerard. Is it 60-40? Is it 70-30? 50-50? I just can't give you that but it's -- all three components are working in those businesses. Gerard Cassidy : I see. And we talk a lot about digitalization on the consumer side of the business. And you guys touched on what you're doing on your Investor Day with digitalization in this area. How important is that to maybe win new business as some of your competitors may not just be as good as you on the digitalization side? Michael Corbat : Well, I think it's important on a couple of fronts, clearly, in terms of winning new customers. But as you think about the digital strategy here, we're really out trying to change three things, one, the way we acquire. If you actually look at our acquisitions over the last year or so, about 1/3 of those are now coming through to us digitally. So the experience is better. And as we can get that hopefully through the straight-through processing, we've got the ability to take costs out. Second is around the way that we transact and interact with existing clients. So as an example, our efforts to radically reduce the number of paper statements that we're sending out on a monthly or on a regular basis, and we've shown a lot of progress there. And I think the third piece is really around the service. And in 2017, we reduced volumes to call centers, we think, by about 12 million phone calls. We think we're on track to likely do that again this year. You can pretty quickly run the math between the cost of a analog phone call versus a digital engagement. When you go on, you look at our apps in terms of your ability to check your balances, to move moneys, to make payments and to do these things, those are 3 big drivers. And what John referenced before is what we laid out in the Investor Day around this $1.5 billion of efficiency we think we can get out of our consumer business. And going back to the earlier question, how -- what does this trajectory look and feel like and why should we believe that there's the potential of an acceleration into late '18, '19 and '20? And so we're all over this. We view it to be a competitive advantage. And as part of that, what John mentioned in terms of our push into national digital banking and using a lot of our existing technology to continue to lever our consumer platform. John Gerspach : And Gerard, it's the same story on the corporate side. These digital capabilities, this -- expanding all the platforms, again, our strategy really gets to focusing on those large multinationals. So now, we've given those global treasurers, the regional treasurers, the ability to have a view into their working capital, not just in the regional office or the global office but in every operating subsidiary that they have around the world. And they're able then to manage their working capital, move funds off of their tablet. So they can sit in whatever city you want to pick, whether it's New York, London and Zurich or Beijing, and they can actually see on their tablet the working capital requirements in their international subsidiary and move funds through our application. We think that that's a real competitive advantage, especially as we're starting to see more and more company expand into more and more countries. That's the power of our network. Gerard Cassidy : John, you didn't list Portland Maine as one of those cities. John Gerspach : I thought about that, Gerard, but I wasn't sure if that's where you were today. Gerard Cassidy : There you go. You guys are unique in your international business versus some of your peers. Is there any behavior differences between your international or non-U.S. consumer customers versus Americans on the digital usage or how they behave? Michael Corbat : Yes, in some cases, very much so. So you can go look at smart devices, you can look at digital engagement. As you can imagine, Asia is really at the forefront on a lot of things we're doing in terms of digital engagement, united transactions and things coming through and things we're putting in place. And while moving and moving at a reasonable pace, you can simply walk into one of our branches in Mexico and recognize that Mexico is still predominantly a physical or an analog experience for our customers but changing and evolving. And again, what we like is we got the technology elsewhere in the world that we can continue to roll out. We don't have to invent it from Mexico. It exists. And I would just say that the world is at varying stages of digital engagement but all headed in the same direction. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just lastly. Mike, you touched about the breadth of the equity trading revenues being in cash and prime brokerage, et cetera. Have you guys seen any impact yet from the MiFID rules that went into effect? I know it is early but any early read on that yet? Michael Corbat : So we've obviously been engaged and been working with our clients towards making sure everybody is MiFID-compliant. I would say, those -- from our perspective, we believe those conversations have been very constructive, and the conversations we've been involved in are largely holistic approaches to what we're going to provide. And I would say the engagement has been good. And then I would describe today that we haven't had any surprises to the negative in any material way to how we thought this would roll out. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Alevizos Alevizakos : You've done a very good analysis to explain to us how the business is working with -- effectively with transaction banking working with your FX and rates business and the importance of your corporate clients. However, I would like to know your view about how you're feeling regarding the macro environment, especially regarding trade finals. Given all the news flow that we see everywhere regarding tariffs and all these kind of things that are happening with China and Russia, would it be possible to somehow quantify any potential downside for us? Michael Corbat : Sure, sure. So one is, when you look at -- coming out of 2017 and some of the numbers that were published, and I think it was the IMF published a report in January that talks about the 175 countries that they track, somewhere in the magnitude of 150 or 155 of those countries actually grew exports year-over-year, the largest number that I could remember on history. And so trade is alive. Trade is well. So that's kind of piece one as we come into '18. Piece two is when you think about the distribution of trade, while 80% of global trade is denominated in dollars, about 20% of global trade affects the U.S. And so as we think about our business, our businesses is, I think, very representative of global trade in that about 20% of our trade business is U.S.-related. And therefore, 80% is rest of world. So from our perspective and the diversification that we have, for us, it's not necessarily a question of who's trading it but is it trading and is it moving. And I think as we've done our analysis, at least as it pertains to us, the impact of a U.S.-China trade war is probably a bigger macro event than it is a Citi-specific trade event, meaning that I'm just hard-pressed to believe that if you've got 2 of the book ends of the global economy that the world is counting on for growth, and you've got a trade war going that growth is likely to suffer, and that's likely to have a spillover to the rest of the economy, seems -- as of today and as of recent conversations that -- from what, I'm sure, we're all reading that things have deescalated a bit there and seem to be headed in a more positive direction. But I think it's in everyone's best interest to try and avoid a trade war, if we can. Alevizos Alevizakos : Sure. And if I may follow up on Gerard's question regarding MiFID II. You already mentioned that Asia Pacific equities were very strong. How was Europe, especially in cash and deliveries? Michael Corbat : It was good. It was also strong. And again, I think, from a -- again, I talked a little bit about the product, the underlying mix between cash, derivative, et cetera. But as we look at North America, we look at EMEA and we look at Asia, again, good, balanced participation in that growth. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : I just had one quick question. On the credit cost, you said you're expecting them to tick up from here. But I want to make sure there was no change in your credit card NCL guidance, you're still comfortable with 2018 and medium-term targets that you laid out previously? John Gerspach : Yes. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a separate question. There seem to be a lot of concerns about deposit costs and where they're going from here. I mean, your deposit costs were only up 8 basis points quarter-on-quarter but are you seeing something different in the market over the last month or two that makes you concerned as well that there's isn't a more meaningful inflection in deposit costs? Are you starting to see irrational pricing in the market, perhaps, or deposits moving faster, deposit gambles, I guess, going up or something else in the market that we're not seeing in the numbers that you reported? John Gerspach : No. The way I would characterize it, Brian, is, I think, at least from our view, our deposit betas are, by and large, operating exactly as we had modeled them to this point. I do think that -- and this may be what you're hearing, as we continue to get rate increases, as the rate increases -- increase also in frequency, you're going to start to see some pressure on those deposit betas. It's just inevitable, and it's going to happen. Hasn't happened yet but I think we're all seeing pretty much the same thing, that the betas will move up. Now the betas moving up is all part of our forward projections, and so it's not a surprise to us but it's just something that you have to expect to happen. Brian Kleinhanzl : Was the deposit beta this quarter below still what you were expecting? John Gerspach : Mixed. No, I'd say corporate betas have moved up certainly more than consumer betas. And that's been consistent, at least in the last year. So you do have a mixed component in beta. Not every beta is the same. And so our deposit performance is a mix of what's going on with our corporate deposits as well as our consumer deposits. Operator : There are no further questions. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you, Natalia, and thank you all for joining us on what I know is a very busy day. If you have any final questions, please reach out to us and IR. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's call.

If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.5 billion for the second quarter of 2018 or $1.63 per share. Our earnings per share were 27% higher than a year ago, as a result of improved business performance, a lower tax rate and a continued reduction in shares outstanding. Our EBIT was up 5%, as a result of revenue growth in both sides of the house, combined with continued expense and credit discipline. Loans and deposits increased 5% and 4%, respectively. Our efficiency ratio was 58%, 130 basis points better than a year ago. Our return on assets was 94 basis points, an 11 basis points higher than a year ago and our return on tangible common equity improved to 10.8%, 300 basis points higher than a year ago. Global Consumer Banking had 3% revenue growth, including 6% internationally and Latin America revenue increased 11%. While underlying growth in Asia was 4%, in line with our medium-term expectations. In the U.S., we continued to grow our retail banking business and we closed the acquisition of the L.L. Bean portfolio in retail services and in U.S. Branded Cards, we saw strong interest earning balance growth as our investments continue to mature. Our Institutional Clients Group also grew revenues by 3%. While Fixed Income was in line with what we forecasted, our equities business had another strong quarter, up 19% from the year before and our accrual businesses continued to show strong growth across the board, especially Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending, and the Private Bank. Investment banking revenue delivered another solid quarter with good growth in advisory and equity underwriting. Taking a step back for a moment, was almost a year ago since we brought you all together to lay out our 2020 targets, so I think this morning is a good opportunity to recap some of the progress we\u2019ve made since Investor Day. As you may recall, at the time, I spoke about three strategic priorities we would pursue to reach those financial targets. First, was to deliver sustainable client led growth, by deepening our relationships with existing clients and reaching new clients within our targeted segments. Next, was to leverage our scale and investments in technology to enhance the client experience and improve our operating efficiency. And third, was to optimize our capital base and return all the capital above the amount needed to prudently operate and invest in our franchise. In terms of the first, you can see in our results over the past 12 months that we\u2019ve continued to grow revenue and deepen client relationships across our franchise. We expected that in some cases we would outperform and in others we could underperform those growth expectations, but on balance, we\u2019re performing close to our medium-term goals. And importantly, much of that growth is being generated in stable accrual businesses in consumer and in areas like TTS, security services and the Private Bank. And we\u2019ve had good success in many areas where we\u2019ve been investing. Earlier I mentioned equities for last quarter we ranked sixth, just outside of our top-five target. In consumer, our Wealth Management capabilities have been enhanced both through branch-based and digital outreach, and we significantly increased the amount of Citigold households here in the U.S. Internationally, Mexico is starting to see the revenue levels we\u2019ve forecasted, as we execute our investment plan there and our Asia franchise continues to grow. Clearly, U.S. Branded Cards should face headwinds, but we\u2019re seeing underlying momentum that gives us confidence in growth going forward. On the second priority, we\u2019ve continued to drive our digital transformation and invest for growth, while self funding these investments through efficiency savings. We\u2019re focused on transforming the client experience across our franchise, driving digital solutions for both our consumer and institutional clients, while lowering our costs through automation or other service improvements. These efforts are leading to lower call volumes per account and higher digital engagement by our clients. And overall, we\u2019ve improved our operating efficiency year-over-year for seven straight quarters and we\u2019re on track to reach the low 50s by 2020. The third priority is capital return. Last July we committed to return at least $60 billion through dividends and buybacks over three CCAR cycles, of course subject to regulatory approval. For the first cycle, we returned $19 billion of capital and just last month we got approval for the second tranche, a return of $22 billion, including an increase in our dividend to $0.45 per quarter. So our capital planning has been effective, reducing our common shares outstanding by over 200 million over the past year to just over 2.5 billion shares, which helped drive our EPS up by 20%. So, one year in, I have to say that, I\u2019m pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made for the first half of 2018. Our return on tangible common equity was just over 11% and we expect to remain ahead of our 10.5% target for the full year. We are on track to bring our efficiency ratio down to roughly 57% with a return on assets above 90 basis points. With that, John, will go through the presentation and then we would be happy to take your questions. John? John Gerspach : Hey. Thanks a lot, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three. Net income of $4.5 billion in the second quarter was 16% from last year. As growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. EPS grew 27%, including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.5 billion grew 2% from the prior year, driven by higher net interest revenues and expenses were flat, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were fully offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. Our efficiency ratio was 58% for the quarter, over 100 basis points better than last year, representing the seventh consecutive quarter of year-over-year efficiency improvement. And cost of credit increased 6% driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer. In constant dollars, Citigroup end-of-period loans grew 5% year-over-year to $671 billion. GCB and ICG loans grew by $40 billion in total, with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS, the Private Bank and traditional Corporate Lending. Now looking at the first half of 2018, we generated modest revenue growth and positive operating leverage, with roughly 90 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio. EPS grew by 26%, including the benefit of share buybacks, as well as a lower effective tax rate. Our return on assets was 96 basis points and our RoTCE was just over 11%, positioning us well to exceed our target of 10.5% for full year 2018. Now, before we go into the second quarter in more detail, let me build on some of the comments Mike made earlier on our progress since Investor Day on slide four. We remained committed to improving RoTCE through a combination of client-led revenue growth, expense discipline and significant capital return. As we\u2019ve noted before, our plan is balanced across regions and businesses, with no outsized reliance on macro drivers, including interest rates, and we believe our results over the last 12 months represents solid progress. As you would expect, certain businesses have outpaced our medium-term growth expectations, while others have lacked, but on balance we generated roughly 4% growth in our core businesses. In consumer, revenues are up 4% in constant dollars, slightly below our 5% medium-term goal. In North America, our retail banking and retail services businesses are broadly on pace and while U.S. Branded Cards has grown 1%, we are seeing underlying improvements in 2018 that gives us confidence in a stronger trajectory going forward. In Asia, we outperformed our 4% medium-term growth target, driven by strength in Wealth Management revenues. And while Mexico was somewhat below its 10% target, we\u2019ve seen an improving growth trend over the past few quarters. In our Institutional business, we\u2019re broadly tracking to our 4% medium-term growth target. Fixed Income markets have been challenging, but we\u2019ve offset this pressure with solid double-digit revenue growth in our accrual businesses TTS, Corporate Lending, Private Bank and Securities Services and we\u2019re also seeing significant growth in equities. We\u2019ve ramped up investments across the franchise to support this client led growth, but over the past year, we\u2019ve been able to fully offset this additional spend and volume driven growth through efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in flat expenses in total. Credit costs have increased, but we remain well within our medium-term loss rate guidance and credit quality remains broadly stable across the franchise. Over the past year, we repurchased roughly 8% of our shares outstanding, contributing to EPS growth of 20% and our total capital return increased by over 50% to roughly $19 billion. As Mike noted earlier, we recently announced plans to return an additional $22 billion in dividends and buybacks over the next 12 months. Now we recognized there is significant work yet to do, but we believe we are solidly on track to achieve our targets and I\u2019ll speak more about our outlook in a moment. Turning now to the second quarter. Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 15% in the second quarter, driven by operating margin expansion and a lower tax rate, partially offset by a higher cost of credit. Total revenues of $8.3 billion grew 3% year-over-year, with contribution from every region and product. Global retail banking revenues grew 6% in the second quarter, reflecting growth in loans and AUMs, even as we continue to shrink our physical branch footprint. And global cards revenues were up 1%. Slide six, shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $5 billion were up 1% from last year. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 4% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continue to decline mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs. However, we more than offset this pressure with growth in the rest of our franchise. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 9%, driven by continued growth in deposit margins, growth in investments and increased commercial banking activity. Average deposits declined 3% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. In keeping with this focus on Wealth Management, assets under management were up 8% year-over-year to $61 billion. We continue to see positive momentum in Citigold, with households up over 20% year-over-year and we\u2019re continuing to drive toward the next stage of our transformation by starting to rollout national digital banking. We launched the first set of foundational features in May on our mobile app, including the ability for retail banking clients to view and analyze their full financial position across firms. The next step will be to rollout enhance deposit taking capabilities through both online and mobile channels over the coming months, along with the broader marketing campaign. This is just the start of a wider launch across the full spectrum of deposit taking, borrowing and advisory services with the goal of building a full-service relationships through these digital channels. Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were down 1% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio. Excluding Hilton, Branded Card revenues were up 1%, with underlying revenue growth of 2% being offset by the impact of previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year. In addition, during the second quarter we recorded a gain of roughly $45 million in Branded Cards related to the sale of Visa B shares. However, this gain was partially offset in the second quarter by the impact of repricing actions on a small portion of our card accounts related to the previously disclosed issues with APR rate re-evaluation under the CARD Act. For the full year, we expect the impact of these repricing actions to be roughly $50 million. So together, the Visa B game and the repricing actions are neutral to revenues in 2018. In total, we continue to expect branded card revenues excluding Hilton to be roughly flat this year on a reported basis, with around 2% underlying growth, driven by continued strong client engagement, loan growth and improved mix. This is similar to what we saw in the second quarter. Excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 10% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 5%, including 6% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continue to mature. Our net interest revenue percentage declined sequentially as expected, but we continue to expect the net interest revenue percentage to improve sequentially beginning this quarter. This improvement should continue into the fourth quarter and then translate into a year-over-year increase in the NIR percentage in 2019. As the mix of interest-earning balances continues to improve, we believe our underlying growth will accelerate in 2019, resulting in modest reported growth next year, even considering the Hilton and Visa B games we took in 2018. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1% driven by higher average loans. This growth rate is likely to accelerate over the next few quarters, reflecting the recent acquisition of the L.L. Bean card portfolio, which added $1.5 billion of high quality receivables at quarter end. Total expenses for North America consumer were up 3%, including a provision of approximately $50 million for an industry-wide legal matter. Excluding the impact of this provision, expenses were up 1% as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings. Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year and we billed roughly $117 million of loan loss reserves this quarter, each driven by volume growth and normal seasoning. Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards was 304 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 507 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% for 2018. On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Second quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 6% with contribution from both regions. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 11%. Retail banking revenues grew 12% in the second quarter, driven by growth in loans and deposits. And card revenues grew 9% on continued growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the second quarter and were up 4% excluding the benefit of a modest one-time gain in the prior year. Retail banking revenues grew 4%, reflecting continued strength in Wealth Management, despite a sequential slowdown in investment revenues and excluding the one-time gain last year, card revenues also grew 4% on continued growth in loans and purchase sales. In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the second quarter, as investment spending and volumes driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit grew 11%, reflecting loan growth, as well as a reserve release in Asia in the prior year period. Slide eight shows the global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit continued to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine. Revenues of $9.7 billion increased 3% from last year, driven by continued momentum in our accrual businesses, along with a strong performance in equity this quarter. Total Banking revenues of $5.2 billion grew 6%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 11%, reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit spreads with solid growth across both net interest and fee income. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were down 7% from last year, as growth in M&A and equity underwriting was more than offset by a very strong prior-year comparison in debt underwriting. Private Bank revenues of $848 million grew 7% year-over-year driven by growth in clients, loans and investments, as well as improved deposit spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $589 million were up 22% reflecting loan growth, as well as lower hedging costs. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were down 1% from last year. Fixed Income revenues of $3.1 billion declined 6% year-over-year, reflecting a more challenging market environment, as well as the comparison to a strong prior year period in G10 rates and securitized products. We continue to see strong corporate client activity this quarter in particular in G10 FX and local markets. Equities revenues were up 19%, with growth across all products, reflecting the benefit of continued higher market volatility, as well as continued momentum with investor clients in line with our investment strategy. And finally, in Security Services revenues were up 12%, driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $5.5 billion increased 4% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation costs and an increase in business volumes, along with higher levels of investments spending, partially offset by productivity savings. And finally, cost of credit remains benign this quarter. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $528 million declined 20% from last year, driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 40%, also reflecting the wind down, as well as lower legal and infrastructure costs. And pretax income was $47 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting recoveries and cost of credit related to the sale of legacy mortgage assets, as well as lower legal expenses. Looking ahead, we believe an outlook for pretax losses in the range of around $100 million per quarter to $150 million per quarter in Corp/Other is a fair run rate for the remainder of 2018. This is a further improvement from our prior outlook, based on higher treasury revenues given the higher rate environment, as well as continued lower infrastructure expenses. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.7 billion this quarter grew roughly 12% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue, as well as the wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other. Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1 billion year-over-year and our core accrual net interest margin improved by 13 basis points to 360 basis points driven by rate increases, loan growth and an improved loan mix versus last year. On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $550 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates, as well as loan growth, along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter and our core accrual net interest margin also improved by 6 basis points, primarily reflecting higher rates. Looking ahead for the remainder of the year, we are updating our prior outlook for growth in core accrual net interest revenue from roughly $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion for full year 2018, reflecting loan growth, improved mix and lower than expected retail deposits sensitivity in the first half of the year, as well as an additional rate hike in September that had not been included in our original outlook. In the first half of 2018, our core accrual net interest revenue grew by nearly $1.8 billion year-over-year. So this implies second half growth should come in just slightly lower than that. Although, the retail deposit betas have run lower than anticipated so far this year, we do expect higher sensitivity going forward, which is reflected in our outlook. Finally, we continue to expect legacy asset related net interest revenues to decline by about $500 million this year as we wind down that portfolio. And trading related net interest revenue will likely continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we saw in the first and second quarters. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio remain roughly flat sequentially at 12.1% this quarter, as net income was offset by $3.1 billion of common share buybacks and dividends, and our tangible book value per share increased slightly to $61.29. Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few moments on our outlook. For the third quarter in ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall market environment. However, we would typically expect seasonally slower activity versus the second quarter. We expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses, as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network. And keep in mind, on a year-over-year basis, we will be comparing to the third quarter last year that included a gain of roughly $580 million on the sale of yield book of Fixed Income analytics business. In Consumer, in North America we should see continued progress in retail banking and retail services, including a full quarter contribution from L.L. Bean. U.S. Branded Cards growth will continue to be impacted by the Hilton sale on a year-over-year basis. However, we do expect the net interest revenue percentage to improve sequentially beginning this quarter as our loan mix continues to improve. We expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in Asia and Mexico. And additionally, we expect to generate a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Asset Management business in Mexico this quarter. Total Citigroup expenses should continue to decline sequentially as you saw the second quarter. Cost of credit should increase, reflecting normalization in ICG and Corp/Other, and the tax rate should be just under 25%. Now taking a broader look at revenue and efficiency trends for the second half of 2018, we expect total revenue growth to come in slightly higher than the 2% year-over-year growth we saw in the first half of the year. Expenses should continue to decline sequentially in both the third and fourth quarters, and this should keep us on pace to again deliver roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement similar to what we achieved in the first half of the year. We think about our expense base in a few components as we described at Investor Day last year. First, there are volume related expenses that will grow over time as we extend our franchise. Second, are the incremental investments we\u2019re making to both deepen our client relationships and improve the efficiency of our operations. We estimated these incremental investments at roughly $1.5 billion by full year 2020. Third, are the efficiency savings we expect to realize in order to offset these volume-related costs and investments. These we estimated at roughly $2.5 billion by 2020. And then, finally, we have expenses related to legacy assets which are shrinking over time. If we look at what we\u2019ve achieved so far over the past year, we\u2019ve deployed nearly half of the $1.5 billion of incremental investments, with a somewhat heavier emphasis in consumer initially and now across both consumer and ICG, and at the same time, we\u2019ve only realized roughly a third of the estimated $2.5 billion of efficiency savings. If you do the math, you\u2019ll see that the incremental investments were funded through efficiency savings over the past year, while other volume driven expenses were essentially offset through the wind down of legacy assets. So we\u2019re not yet at a point where the efficiency savings are outpacing the incremental investment spend but that should change as we go forward. In fact as we\u2019ve gotten better line of sight into the $2.5 billion of efficiency savings, we believe there could be upside to that figure. This would give us the flexibility to invest more into the franchise or we could also let those benefits drop to the bottomline depending on the environment. If you look at the existing $2.5 billion of planned savings, the largest component is in Consumer with $1.5 billion of efficiency benefits. As you would expect many of those benefits are driven by our digital transformation. First is, how we\u2019re using digital to engage with our clients shifting consumer activity to more convenient and efficient channels. Second, is how we\u2019re using technology to streamline our own operations, things like straight through application processing, the use of big data and branch optimization. And third, a portion of the savings should come from more conventional initiatives. For example, using lower cost locations, improving procurement and process reengineering. The second and third buckets, which are largely in our control and do not rely on changes in consumer behavior comprise over three quarters of the planned efficiency savings. And on the portion that is tied to client engagement, we are seeing good progress. Digital and mobile usage is up across all regions, E-Statement and E-Payment penetration rates are rising. Agent handled call volume per account is continuing to decline and this is contributing to a continued decline in operations cost per account. So while there is a lot of work still to be done, we have a good line of sight into our efficiency drivers both in consumer and across the franchise. We remain confident in our ability to drive an improvement in Citigroup operating efficiency of roughly 100 basis points in 2018 and then a further 400 basis points improvement by 2020 in line with our goal of reaching the low 50% range. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks. Mike Corbat : Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello. So in ICG Corporate Lending, the rev is up 22% as you pointed out. I\u2019m curious the combination of, A, biggest drivers of that loan growth and if you think that actually proves as all the tax regime filters through? And B, the other part of your comment what helped that was lower hedging costs and I thought that was a little curious in a world where rates are rising, so one mathematical and one more related to growth? Mike Corbat : Yeah. The lower hedging costs, that\u2019s something we\u2019ve actually talked about, I think, for the last several quarters, that it\u2019s a combination of two things, Glenn. Some of it is we\u2019ve reduced the actual amount of hedges that we have put on. And if you think about some of the things that have happened in the past year, the energy sector for instance has stabilized and so that\u2019s an area where we have been able to lower some of our hedging exposure. And then, additionally, we\u2019ve also, I think, put in some more effective hedging strategies and so those two combine for the benefit that we\u2019ve gotten in the hedging costs. As far as the overall growth in the Corporate Lending, I think, it is pretty widespread. If you look in the back of the deck somewhere around slide 23, 24, how about 24, you see the growth in end of period loans it\u2019s pretty widespread across regions with the exception of Latin America. And Latin America has been hit a little bit by the slowdown in Brazil otherwise there is still good volume growth elsewhere. But you can see year-over-year 9% growth in North America, 16% growth in EMEA, 8% growth in Asia and on a linked quarter basis we\u2019ve got still some decent growth coming out of the North America and EMEA. And if you go into the supplement, we give you the breakdown of the loan growth by product for ICG. And you can see it\u2019s all those things that I talked about on those comments, it\u2019s TTS, it\u2019s Traditional Corporate Lending. So it\u2019s pretty widespread. Glenn Schorr : Awesome. One more growth question if I could, this one in North American cards. Mike Corbat : Yeah. Glenn Schorr : Curious if there are one or two products that you\u2019re most confident and that\u2019s going to drive that pick up in the second half and 2019? John Gerspach : Well, the pickup, Glenn, it\u2019s driving from two broad themes that we talked about I think last time. One is, we\u2019ve started to see -- we expect to continue to see with [one-off] [ph] in promotional balance. We\u2019ve adjusted some of those terms that we had on the cards last year and we\u2019ve reduced the overall volume of new promotional activity that we\u2019ve had. So, we\u2019ve got a very good line of sight to the reductions in the promotional balances. So, those are, obviously, accounts that cost us money, right. I mean we don\u2019t earn anything on a promo balance and I\u2019ve got to fund it. At the same point in time, we continue to see those promotional balances transition into full revolving balances at just about the rates that we\u2019ve been modeling. The flipping rate, I think, I get asked the question last quarter on what\u2019s the rate of conversion, and I said, it was just under 50%. And that rate has held, it\u2019s actually inched up just a wee bit. But I\u2019d still say it\u2019s just below 50%. So, we\u2019re getting the good conversion activity as promotional balances run-off and they flip into full rate revolving balances. That\u2019s one of the reasons why full rate revolving balances have grown 6% year-over-year. So, again, we feel very good about those underlying metrics in U.S. Branded Cards. We\u2019ll see that change now, that change in trajectory in net interest revenue percentage. It\u2019s been declining fairly steadily for a couple of years now and this should be the bottom quarter. Next quarter the expectation is that net interest revenue percentage increases and then it increases again in the fourth quarter. And what we should see is in 2019 on a full year basis, the net interest revenue percentage should be higher than the overall net interest revenue percentage that we had in 2018. Glenn Schorr : Awesome. Thanks, John. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, John. Thanks for the comments. John Gerspach : Hi, John. John McDonald : Yeah. Thanks for the comments about the trajectory of your investment spend versus the cost saves that was helpful to thinking about your path of efficiency improvement. I just want to reiterate based on the targets and the pickup and saves you\u2019re expecting, this year you\u2019re kind of running at a pace for about 100 basis point efficiency improvement, and it sounds like that\u2019s going to accelerate next year to kind of a 200 basis point improvement pace starting next year I guess. John Gerspach : I would put it this way, John. Absolutely 100 basis point improvement. That\u2019s what we\u2019re targeting from this year and with that confidence in our ability to hit that. The next 400 basis points, whether it comes in 200 basis points, 200 basis points, 180 basis points, 220 basis points, I don\u2019t want to get too specific about that. We\u2019ll have more to say on that as we get closer to the year and we\u2019ll take a look at the budgeting. But, yeah, it will be 400 basis points of improvement over the next two years and we will get to a low 50s operating efficiency in 2020. John McDonald : Got you. Okay. Fair enough. And then just on the global consumer. Asia consumer growth decelerated somewhat this quarter from a 7% pace to something like more like 4%. I\u2019m sorry, if I missed, if there\u2019s some special item there, but what drove that deceleration there? John Gerspach : Client activity was fine, there was a little bit of a slowdown in investment activity. I think, I mentioned that in the commentary. That\u2019s somewhat of a sequential thing you get from the first quarter to second quarter. And there was also there was a couple small non-recurring items that occurred in the first quarter. Nothing big enough to call out, but again just a little bit of noise as you go through the sequential comparison. John McDonald : Okay. And then just the opposite trend, Latin America accelerated to the 11% kind of in line with what you\u2019ve been targeting for Mexico for the Investor Day targets. Is that a pace that you can maintain going forward or are there some factors that we should keep in mind that were special this quarter? John Gerspach : Yeah. Whoa there, big guy, all right. I would never want to point to 11% is being a sustainable trend, but -- because every quarter we have got one or two little things in it. But what we do like is the fact that if you take a look over the last four quarters that rate of growth has been accelerated. I think we were at 4% rate of growth four quarters ago, then we went to 6%, then last quarter was either 8% or 9%, now we\u2019re up to 11%. And that really -- what we\u2019re thrilled with is the fact that the underlying drivers are there. Take a look at the cards business, all last year we were talking to you about the fact that the cards business was now just beginning to lap some of the restructuring efforts, the repositioning efforts that we had in place and now you\u2019re seeing that really hit it\u2019s pace. So, I don\u2019t want you to think that 11% is going to be every quarter, but again over the next two and half years [inaudible] at or close to that 10% CAGR that we put out at Investor Day. John McDonald : Got it. Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hi. Good morning. John Gerspach : Hi, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Maybe just a follow up on sort of the growth in outside the U.S. It\u2019s obviously been ticking up, but I think investors are pretty concerned about what we\u2019ve seen lately in terms of emerging market or at least equity markets and tariffs and NAFTA. How do we think about, I guess, the risk to the improving story, how do you guys -- how can you frame it for us to feel more comfortable that these businesses are pretty sustainable in some of these headwinds? John Gerspach : Well, Jim, first I would say that, when we look at the trade rhetoric, it certainly introduced volatility, but we haven\u2019t yet really started to see any significant changes in behavior. Second piece is, when you think about where and with whom we operate in emerging markets, we\u2019re operating there typically with the multinationals. And the multinationals take a pretty consistent long-term approach to their business. Our relationships are broad and in here if you kind of play this out to a certain end, supply chains or trade routes may realign, but they don\u2019t go away and with the network we have we\u2019re simply going to be leading and realigning with them to be partnering in terms of what they choose to do if it\u2019s different from what it is today. So, we haven\u2019t seen changes in behavior of any significance. And so, no, right now it\u2019s the rhetoric we\u2019re tracking. I think the markets have the fears of what that rhetoric leads to. But at this point we\u2019re not seeing it coming through in the numbers. James Mitchell : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then maybe you talked about expenses to come actually a little bit ahead of expectations on the consumer side might give you some flexibility to invest more or let some flow to bottomline. But how do we think about where those incremental investments could go, would it be more to accelerate efficiency saves, potentially, let\u2019s say, in the Institutional side or would it be more for revenue growth drive -- driven those investments or a combination of both? How do we think about where that incremental savings could go? John Gerspach : Jim, one of the things, we haven\u2019t decided what to do with those incremental dollars as yet. That\u2019s something that we\u2019ll get more into as we get into the fall and our traditional budget making. And we\u2019ll have more to say on all of that as we get into the fall maybe around the next earnings call. But I think we would look at a combination of both revenue growth investments and continued efficiency. And some of these things, it would be advancing investments that maybe would have been in our mind something that we would have done in \u201821 or even \u201822, and just bring those things forward. So, we haven\u2019t made any decisions yet. But I think the important thing from an investor point of view is the understanding that the $2.5 billion is going to be higher. Jim Mitchell : Right. John Gerspach : We\u2019re not struggling to get to the $2.5 billion. Jim Mitchell : Right. No. That\u2019s fair. Just wanted to see if you had any kind of at least some examples of what you think you could accelerate some of those 2021 type investments what some of those areas could be. John Gerspach : And my view that, if I start giving\u2026 Jim Mitchell : I want to share, yeah, that\u2019s fine. John Gerspach : No, no, it\u2019s worse than that, if I start giving you examples, any example I give is going to be linked to a business guy and the first thing he is going to do is make beeline to my office and say. So then I can increase my budget. Jim Mitchell : Yeah. John Gerspach : So, no, not yet, we\u2019re still going to be making those decisions. Jim Mitchell : All right. fair enough. Thanks. John Gerspach : All right. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Mike Corbat : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: I had a question on the efficiency. You talk about the full year improvement in 2018 of about 100 basis points I think you\u2019re running about 133 basis points so far. And I guess as I look to back half of the year I would have thought there might be opportunity to expand on that. I think the second half revenue comps are hopefully relatively easy and its sounds like you\u2019re pretty confident on the expense side. So just want to push a little bit on the second half efficiency guide? John Gerspach : Yeah. But don\u2019t forget we do have a little bit of a tough comp, I mentioned it in the outlook, anything that we compare to, we did have that $580 million gain last year on that Fixed Income analytics business yield book. So that goes away as far as from a year-over-year comp and also while we continue to benefit from the wind down and legacy assets that does tend to abate, right, I mean, the expenses as they run-off, there is less of them to run-off. So we\u2019re confident in that 100 basis point improvement. But I certainly would didn\u2019t want to commit to anything more than that just now obviously. We\u2019ll give you more update as we get it, but we\u2019re confident in that 100 basis points. Matt O\u2019Connor: Got it. And then just change in directions within U.S. card, I think you\u2019ve announced that you\u2019ve changed or eliminated the promotional pricing with the Costco portfolio, I think the Citi Branded effort on the promotional pricing balance transfers it is still out there and continues to be pretty aggressive, any thoughts on tweaking that to not be as generous? Mike Corbat : We have plans in place to tweak all of our offers, you can think about as we got a rollout schedule, a rollout schedule in mind. We don\u2019t want to completely take some of the juice for future revenue growth off the table. So we take a certain action, there\u2019s certain other actions that we got planned, all of that is embedded in that outlook that I\u2019ve given you. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. I mean, I guess, a bigger picture question is, you\u2019ve clearly made a lot of investments in card over the years. I think several years ago you improved kind of the customer service, some of the systems. Now you\u2019ve been ramping up on some of the offerings and it\u2019s gotten very competitive I think in terms of what you are providing to customers. But it feels like there should be some bigger payback at some point beyond just 1% or 2% revenue growth. So I don\u2019t know if you kind of look out beyond next year if you see a more material acceleration or if you can just talk to that kind of conceptually of all the efforts in card. When do you get more robust revenue growth out of this? Mike Corbat : I think you just can\u2019t look at the revenue side of things. You need to look at the expense side, because again a lot of the investments we\u2019re making are in this transformation from what has historically largely been an analog business to a digital platform. And obviously we\u2019re in the stages of making those investments and in many cases running new and parallel processes. So actually incurring the expense of both. And as John mentioned, and I mentioned in my preamble, we\u2019ve had very good success at reducing the calls per account and transforming those into digital interactions, which generate significant savings. That\u2019s the upticks we think have been strong and it\u2019s accelerating and we think that continues to accelerate and then over time we get to pullout the analog and largely run on the back of the digital platforms that we built and that should manifest itself largely in the expense line. John Gerspach : And Matt, if you go back to Investor Day, we had targeted Branded Cards for a CAGR of 3%. And so that\u2019s still, when we get comfortable with the fact that we can either beat that 3% then we can start talking about a little bit of upside. But, again, we do like what we\u2019re seeing right now in those underlying drivers. And it certainly has given us the confidence in the fact that this is a business that this year flat revenues with a 2% underlying growth. And next year we should be able to see a 2% -- it\u2019s something around maybe a 2% growth overall even with the grow-over that we got to do in -- with Hilton and the Visa B gain. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Well, this might be a record for the number of questions on efficiency, but I\u2019ll try again. Can you hear me? Mike Corbat : Yeah. Very much, Mike. Mike Mayo : I\u2019m just going to repeat what I think I heard you say. So you expect expenses to be down sequentially in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And you expect to have savings above the $2.5 billion. On the revenue side, you said revenue growth should accelerate on year-over-year comparison for the third quarter and fourth quarter and NIR should be higher from $2.7 billion to $3.4 billion, is that correct? Mike Corbat : Yeah. Obviously, the NIR is part of the accelerating revenue growth and the $2.5 billion of savings is not a 2018 -- it\u2019s the $2.5 billion of savings that we said that we would get from 2018 through 2020. So you got all the fact. I just want to make sure that you are linking them properly. Mike Mayo : Okay. So why not more than 100 basis points of efficiency savings this year? Why not more than, say, 200 basis points of savings next year. I guess that\u2019s for you. But, then, Mike, a bigger picture, where is Citigroup between investing and harvesting? Of course, you\u2019re always investing in your business, but you had a lot of frontloaded investments and a lot of times the consensus estimates wind up having efficiency going a lot lower than, you say, well, we have to invest more in Mexico or we have to invest more in Credit Card. We have to invest more in something else maybe its digital banking now. So are there any other major investments like that that could come our way where we, say, well, that efficiency progress might be delayed for what we said. So, the big picture about investing versus harvesting and then the specifics why can\u2019t you have more than 100 basis points of efficiency saves this year? Mike Corbat : Well, I start with the first part. So, one, I think we\u2019ve been very, very transparent in terms of the investments that we\u2019ve been making and where we\u2019ve been making and I think laid, as John talked about, in the consumer business the saves in the investments there. So I don\u2019t think there is anything we\u2019re going to surprise you with in terms of new investments. I would leave on the table where the opportunities present themselves to actually pull some investments forward where we think the paybacks are strong. So we\u2019re in there, so as John said, when we get into budget we\u2019re going to be looking at opportunities that we have in the firm of where we can make investments and get some strong near-term savings and paybacks, and that\u2019s why at this point, we really don\u2019t want to commit to exactly how the 400 breaks between \u201819 and \u201820, because we may have some things that we can pull forward that are actually cost us a little bit in \u201819, but have the ability to pay back in \u201820. So, but nothing is going to change us getting to the low 50s by 2020. Mike Mayo : Okay. And the digital banking effort does that involve a large incremental spend? Mike Corbat : There is two aspects to the spend Mike both of which are embedded in the investment dollars that we\u2019ve been talking about. One is, there is obviously some level of technology development, as you\u2019re developing new features and functions on the apps and you are introducing those things. And the second would be a marketing campaign to make sure then that customers are aware of the capabilities that you have and have those capabilities can help solve their needs. So, there -- I would say, there\u2019s two elements of that spend, both elements are in $2.5 billion, both elements are is the 100 basis points of improvement for this year, both elements are in the path towards getting to the low 50% efficiency ratio by 2020. Mike Mayo : Got it. Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Mike Corbat : Hi. Betsy Graseck : I had a little more recent question, but just on the NII uptick and strength in NIM this quarter, could you just give us a sense of to -- John Gerspach : You\u2019re sure that do you want to ask something about operating efficiency? It seems to be the topic this year. Betsy Graseck : No. You want one on that? John Gerspach : No, no. I\u2019ll take the -- I\u2019ll take net interest this morning, please. Betsy Graseck : I am just revs here. So, you had a nice pick up rate in NIM this quarter\u2026 John Gerspach : Yeah. Betsy Graseck : \u2026 first time in a while. So I just wanted to get a sense as to why we should expect that that\u2019s going to be sustainable and in particular could you speak a little bit to the NII lift that you had in the institutional segment as well, because it was, obviously, 2% year-on-year, but 12% Q-on-Q, so wanted to understand what\u2019s going on there? John Gerspach : Yeah. Betsy, maybe the best thing -- if you look at slide 11 that we have give you. Betsy Graseck : Yeah. John Gerspach : On the net interest, we puts everything in constant dollars so that you don\u2019t get FX changes sort of clouding the picture. And then when you take a look at every individual quarter there\u2019s only day count issues. So maybe look at the bottom of that page and take a look at the quarter core accrual net interest revenue per day. And I think that what you\u2019re going to see is, we actually started to see an acceleration in net interest revenue core accrual net interest revenue last quarter. You saw how that we went from 113.5 a day in the fourth quarter to 116.9 per day in the first quarter and now we have some additional growth up to the 121.6. So, we\u2019ve actually, this is actually two quarters in a row now of good acceleration in our core accrual net interest revenue. And in both of those quarters, the growth -- it\u2019s roughly the same, it\u2019s about 50% of the growth being contributed through the ICG, the corporate business and that\u2019s tied into the loan growth, the growth in deposits, we\u2019ve got some incremental spread on some of our trade loans this quarter. So, all of that is embedded in that. That\u2019s about half of it. And then the other half is somewhat split 50-50, 60-40, between the Consumer business and Corporate Treasury where we continue to benefit from the higher rate in Consumer from the growth in volumes, particularly some of the volumes we talked about in Asia, in Mexico and now with the growth of the full rate interest earning balances in Branded Cards. So, all of that is embedded, but I don\u2019t want you to think that it was just a phenomenon. It certainly happened in the second quarter. It\u2019s actually two quarters in a row now of what I would call fairly good sequential growth in our net interest income. Betsy Graseck : Okay. That\u2019s fair. I guess part of the question two is around the trading related NII, which with the flattening curve has been under pressure yet in 2Q improved. So, maybe give some color on that as well. John Gerspach : Yeah. Every second quarter there is dividend season in Europe. And so we get into some special trades in the second quarter. If you look at last year, the first quarter of \u201817, compared to the second quarter of \u201817, you\u2019ll also notice that the trading related net interest revenue increased from the first quarter to second quarter last year. It was $140 million last year. It\u2019s $180 million this year. It really is just that seasonal dividend season trade that ends up being transacted in Europe. For the most part we still expect the headwinds to be there for net interest revenue in trading. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And so your outlook for NII for the second half, that\u2019s based on the curve -- on the forward curve to think about that? John Gerspach : Yeah. It\u2019s based upon the forward curve, it\u2019s also based upon our expectation for volumes and betas. Betsy Graseck : Thank you. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning or good afternoon. One more balance sheet question, John. John Gerspach : Yeah. Ken Usdin : Just deposits are growing really well for you guys and the betas obviously picking up too especially sequentially. It\u2019s hard to seek some of the detail when we think about the averages. So, can you walk us through just how U.S. rate curves versus non-U.S. rate curves are affecting how you\u2019re looking at deposit growth and what you\u2019re paying in different markets and it\u2019s just a type of improvement that we should start seeing in terms of incremental betas from here? John Gerspach : No. I\u2019d break it down into two distinct categories, Ken. So, for me a corporate deposit point of view, we\u2019ve been talking for some time about the fact that we\u2019ve seen increased sensitivity. And that increase -- that sensitivity has continued to increase. And so that has already being baked in and will continue to be baked into our net interest revenues, as well as our forward outlook for net interest revenues in those corporate deposits. And from a corporate deposit point of view, sensitivity is -- I would say, they\u2019re little higher in North America than they are overseas, but again, all of that is baked in. Where we see a real difference so far is in U.S. retail sensitivity and those betas that we\u2019ve actually realized to-date have lagged our previous -- have lagged our estimates, and so some of that benefit is helping us in growing the net interest revenue at a somewhat faster pace that we had originally guided to. But again, in the forward guidance that I\u2019ve given, our expectation is that those U.S. retail betas will increase in the second half of the year. So, we think that that\u2019s all baked into the additional growth that we\u2019ve given you in those outlook comments. Ken Usdin : Okay. I understood. And what are your expectations for, I guess, generically these non-U.S. rate cycles, I mean, everyone is waiting for, it seems to be continue to be pushed out ECB and BoE, do you include any hikes from -- important to you non-U.S. yield curves as you think forward? John Gerspach : We employ all the forward curves in our forward guidance. So, we use the forward curve where there is one in every country in which we operate. Obviously, the most important ones would be Mexico, as well as the U.S. and then some of the curves in Asia. But all of that is baked in. Ken Usdin : Right. I guess I was just wondering if there\u2019s been any meaningful changes as you see it, there\u2019s a lot of curves for us to watch, you guys watch them all the time, but it seems like there is probably hasn\u2019t been that much changed lately? Ken Usdin : No, no, not really John Gerspach : Okay. Got it. Thanks a lot. John Gerspach : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, John. Hi, Mike. John Gerspach : Hi, Gerard. Mike Corbat : Hi. Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : John, can you share with us -- you\u2019re ruling up the national digital platform as you described. When is the official kick-off where you\u2019re going to be able to, say that was, okay, it\u2019s up and running, it\u2019s fully implemented? And then, second, how are you guys going to measure the success of that strategy? John Gerspach : Gerard, when we\u2019re ready for an actual date, we\u2019ll give it to you. We\u2019ve been rolling out features. We\u2019ve been testing a lot of functions. So, I would say, the best I could tell you right now is to expect a marketing campaign sometime in the early fourth quarter, maybe the late third quarter, but I can\u2019t give you a more definitive date than that at this point in time. And then, we\u2019ll measure success on that both from a -- how we\u2019re doing from an NPS point of view, I mean, we do believe that our introduction of National Digital Banking will enhance our NPS. We\u2019re seeing really nice growth in our mobile NPS right now. So we feel good about the mobile app that we have. We feel good about the digital capabilities that we now have for our existing clients, and therefore, this is a chance for us to expand nationwide. Gerard Cassidy : And as part of the roll out and the strategy, do you expect to have the feature or the ability for a new customer to open up the checking account. Obviously, the savings accounts are the ones that have been successful for everybody, but do you -- are you striving to be able to have straightforward way where a new customer could open up a checking account through the mobile or online? John Gerspach : Yeah. We do. We actually already have that. We already have that built. It\u2019s just a matter of -- you want to make sure that it\u2019s completely tested before we broadly announce it\u2019s there. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. I see. And then coming back to the Credit Cards. Obviously, you had a big win with L.L. Bean. Are there any other in the pipeline types of bidding that you\u2019re doing where we could hear further announcements, second half of this year or early next year on Branded or on wins like this? Mike Corbat : Yeah. We\u2019re in active conversations not just in the U.S., you heard us talk about Qantas. You heard us talk about Kohl\u2019s, so not just in the U.S. but we\u2019re in active conversations around the globe. And again, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see anything as chunky as a Costco, but these are terrific add-ons to the portfolio. In this case L.L. Bean high-quality, good spend, et cetera, and so we are -- we\u2019ve always got our eye out for them. Gerard Cassidy : And speaking in pipelines any color on the investment banking pipeline and -- as you go into the second half of this year? Mike Corbat : The environment remains strong, as we look at the pipeline, this quarter you saw advisory, you saw equity capital market strong. We had a tough comp to overcome in terms of DCM. But as you look at the deal pipeline and some of the things not just big, but intermediate sized things going on and we expect it to stay that way through the year. Gerard Cassidy : And the last question, credit quality is strong for you and your peers, and you had improvement in many areas. I just didn\u2019t notice in Asia there was -- looked like you had an uptick in corporate and non-performers, again it\u2019s not a major issue. But was it, any color on -- it was one credit or any color there? Mike Corbat : Yeah. One credit, you\u2019re going to get those things episodically, right. Gerard Cassidy : Right. Right. Appreciate it. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Not a problem, Gerard. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. I thought I\u2019d help you get to the record number of card questions as well. Just -- wanted to just ask one question, I want to make sure I heard what Mike was saying earlier. As we think about 2019, the ROA in North American Branded Cards should continue to -- should be improving from here regardless of any new partnerships that you may win? Mike Corbat : That\u2019s correct. John Gerspach : Correct. Erika Najarian : Great. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Mike Corbat : And Erika we\u2019re going to put that question in the card column and at the end of the day we\u2019ll give you a scoreboard tally to card\u2019s questions compared to efficiency questions. Thanks, Erika. Erika Najarian : It\u2019s okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good afternoon. While I change gears and won\u2019t ask you about cards or efficiency, I\u2019ll ask about capital. John Gerspach : All right. Saul Martinez : All right. So on that have you give -- have your thoughts evolved on your capital planning and specifically your target CET1 in light of not only the stressed capital buffer which we realize hasn\u2019t been finalized and could change. But also the Fed adopting a more counter cyclical approach to the testing, this year, obviously, your stressed capital losses were elevated and if you use this years as the basis it would suggest that your capital cushion that you and some of your peers have above your target is pretty minimal. So just if you can give us your thoughts on how the capital planning processes is evolving? John Gerspach : Yeah. Saul, that the short answer to your question is, no. Now, the longer answer is, when we put together the 11.5% ratio at Investor Day last year. We presented that, as representing the capital ratio, which we could prudently run Citi. And I think that we were very clear as to the various components that comprise that target and as you remember those components included a CET1 minimum requirement of 4.5% and then a GSIB surcharge of 3% and SCB that we then estimated at 3% and then a management buffer at 1%. Now three months ago, the Fed published an NPR for the SCB, which I think largely confirm the industry\u2019s concerns about the variability that the SCB introduces into each firm\u2019s capital requirements. And I think that the most recent CCAR results, kind of -- they service proof that those concerns were well-founded. And I think you\u2019re testing your counter cyclical buffer, if you look at what happens with the SCB in many ways that counter cyclical buffer is built into the SCB when you start to measure the peak to trough losses. So I think that you look at CCAR results and I don\u2019t think that the Fed ever intended for the SCB to introduce this level of variability into the capital requirements of any individual firm or for that matter the industry as a whole. So I really do expect the changes are going to be made to that NPR before the SCB is actually implemented. And further, I talked about the GSIB charge. I think the Fed is open to recalibrating the GSIB surcharge, especially if it moves forward with the SCB. So, I mean, don\u2019t forget the U.S. banks that are using the Fed\u2019s Method 2 approach, they\u2019re operating under a GSIB surcharge that significantly higher than what\u2019s called for under the Basel approved Method 1. So I think there is room for change in that component as well. And then, the last thing I\u2019ll talk about is, don\u2019t forget this management buffer that we have of 1%. We establish that to cover some of the variability that we saw in various elements of the capital requirements. So if the SCB has implemented, creates some variability, but we could probably also look than to have the management buffer be raised or lowered periodically rather than just be set at some fixed element of the capital requirement. So, given all of these potential moving pieces, I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve got any clear reason to change that 11.5% target at the present time. For Mike and I, it still represents to us the best estimate of the CET1 ratio at which we should be prudently running Citi. Saul Martinez : Okay. No. That\u2019s helpful. If I could change gears a little on that and ask a follow up on Mexico. It seems like you do have commercial momentum there but -- or improving commercial momentum there. But we did have a fairly sizable change politically at Mexico with the last not only winning but winning convincingly. Just any initial thoughts on what the implications of that are? What are your folks at Banamex saying about that? Mike Corbat : Well, I think, you are right, we did have a decisive victory President elect L\u00f3pez Obrador clearly elected majorities now really in both parts of the house there. I would say that the reaction locally has been reasonably positive, you seen that manifest itself in terms of currency. Other pieces, he started to put some people in positions forward. The market\u2019s responding well to. He\u2019s come out and reiterated the sanctity of the Central Bank. He\u2019s reiterated the commitments of fiscal discipline. So I would say all those things so far make a positive thing. And in this instance we shouldn\u2019t forget if you have someone elected by a popular majority. And consumers is not going to wake up and change their spending habits based on winning the outcome the pace that they want. I think what we\u2019re probably watching more short intermediate terms is the business reaction. So we actually don\u2019t expect really much of any near-term reaction from a consumer perspective affecting our view potentially towards some uplift actually in terms of activity. We are watching your businesses in terms of FDI activity, investment and so forth, and again, it\u2019s too early to tell, but we haven\u2019t seen any reactions of significant so far. Saul Martinez : Okay. Great. Thanks, guys. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Saul. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer and Company. Chris Kotowski : Yeah. Good afternoon. Mike Corbat : Hi, Chris. Chris Kotowski : Hi. You\u2019ve been discussing your international consumer strategy mainly in terms of online and mobile banking and so on. But at the same time, it just occurs to me that I can\u2019t walk into a drugstore these days without tripping over a Citi Branded cash machine. And I\u2019m going to imagine that\u2019s not a coincidence. And so I\u2019m kind of curious how you\u2019re planning on kind of integrating that physical presence with the online presence? And then, kind of follow-up to that, are your agreements with CBS, Walmart and RiteAid, is that -- are those national agreements, are they exclusive agreements and are they long-lived? Mike Corbat : Yeah. They are national agreements. They are long-lived and then absolutely is part of the broader strategy. So, ultimately, if you\u2019re somewhere and you want to find it, yeah, we are going to be able to go on and find out at both Citi and whether it\u2019s a Citi branch or whether it\u2019s one of the ATMs you described. So, again, we think as adding to and supporting the national digital banking effort that that\u2019s a key component that gives those clients access to the cash and transaction of things they need. John Gerspach : And of course, if you\u2019re Citigold client, we\u2019ll waive the ATM fees no matter where you go. Chris Kotowski : Okay. But, so, I -- but presumably I could like get an online account at a -- with my Citi account and then I walk into a CBS in Dallas and I could still get cash out without a fee? John Gerspach : Yeah. Chris Kotowski : Okay. All right. Cool. Thank you. That\u2019s it. John Gerspach : You bet Chris. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. John Gerspach : Hey, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hi. Good afternoon. Hi. Good afternoon. I just had two quick questions. One, on the Corp/Other you mentioned those are going to be 100 to 150 over the remainder of 2018, but is the expectation then that the kind of tracks lower from there as everything improves from there as the legacy assets roll-off into \u201819 and \u201820. John Gerspach : I\u2019m going to get to \u201819 and \u201820 when closer to the fall at the next thing. Let\u2019s see how we do with interest rates. There is -- as I said before, there is a limited amount of legacy that is still yet to run-off. So you\u2019ll see. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then a quick follow up on Mexico, you mentioned it was tracking below the revenue growth target, but you didn\u2019t seem to indicate what was tracking below target, I mean is it just loan growth isn\u2019t it coming through as expected? I mean, what can you do to get Mexico back up to achieve the target? John Gerspach : Yeah. It was basically revenue growth, Brian, is tracking slightly below target. Again, we have set up 10% CAGR for the period midway through \u201817 up through 2020. And while we had 11% this year, if you take a look at where we have been\u2026 Susan Kendall : This quarter. John Gerspach : This quarter, where we\u2019ve been on the trailing 12 months is slightly below that. But, again, with good momentum. Brian Kleinhanzl : Right. But on the revenue side what\u2019s tracking below? Is it just loan growth is weaker than expected, is it? John Gerspach : Deposits, I would say, it\u2019s a combination of some slightly lower loan growth and slightly lower deposit growth. Mike Corbat : Right. John Gerspach : But, again, the important thing for us is that trend is improving, 4%, 6%, 9%, 11%, we think we\u2019re on the right trend line moving forward. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Great. Thanks. John Gerspach : No problem. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you all for your time today. If you have any follow up questions, please feel free to follow up with us in Investor Relations. Thank you.",

Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Earlier today, we reported earnings of $4.6 billion for the third quarter of 2018 or $1.73 per share. We continue to see solid growth this quarter in many areas, including our accrual businesses and ICG, fixed income, and Mexico Consumer and despite a drag from net one-time gains that affected our top line comparisons, we still achieve positive operating leverage for the quarter, driving our efficiency ratio down to 56.1%. Loans and deposits, both grew year-over-year and our return on assets increased to 95 basis points. We're on track to achieve our 2018 financial target, on a year-to-date basis we've generated 4% underlying growth in aggregate across our consumer and institutional businesses. Our efficiency ratio is 57.3% and we achieved a return on tangible common equity of 11.2%, keeping us on track to exceed our original target of 10.5% for the full year. We returned $6.4 billion of capital to common shareholders through buybacks and dividends during the quarter and over the past 12 months, we've reduced our common shares outstanding by over $200 million or 8%. Combined with our operating performance, our earnings per share were 22% higher than one year ago. Turing to the businesses, in Global Consumer Banking, we saw solid growth in Mexico, even when you back out the gain on the sale of our asset management business. In Asia, we saw some headwinds in our more market sensitive investment products. But the remainder of the franchise showed consistent growth. And in the U.S., we're starting to see the impact of the L.L. Bean portfolio and retail services where revenue continued to grow. Branded Cards had sequential revenue growth and given strong growth in interest earning balances, we remain on course to achieve 2% underlying revenue growth for the year. Our Institutional Clients Group grew by 4%, excluding a one-time gain from last year. Fixed Income and equities were up 7% in total and as in the past our accrual businesses, TTS Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank all showed strong year-over-year growth.  Investment banking was down versus last year as continued growth in M&A was more than offset by slower underwriting activity across the industry. The client dialogues remained solid and we feel good about the pipeline and upcoming transactions. During the quarter, we also made some changes to make certain our structure is completely aligned with our strategic goals. In North America, we shifted to the same regional model we have in Asia and Latin America and have asked Anand Selva to run what is our largest consumer market. His experience in Asia where we operate a client centric franchise with strong digital adoption will help us bring North America to where it needs to be as we look to leverage both our brand and our scale in credit cards to drive deeper client relationships nationwide. In ICG, we\u2019re combining corporate and investment banking with capital markets origination, by integrating advisory services with capital raising, we believe we will ensure an even greater focus on our clients. And Paco Ybarra will become Jamie Forese\u2019s deputy, giving Paco a platform to focus on technology and capital optimization across our institutional businesses. And as you know, several senior leaders at our firm have decided to retire among them John Gerspach, but the good news is, is this isn\u2019t your last call with John since he won\u2019t be leaving until we file our 2018 financial statements. With that John, I\u2019ll turn it over to you to go through the presentation and then we\u2019re happy to take questions. John Gerspach : Thanks, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, net income of $4.6 billion in the third quarter grew 12% from last year. Largely driven by a lower effective tax rate and EPS grew 22%, including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.4 billion were roughly flat to the prior year, reflecting the net impact of one-time gain in the third quarters of both 2017 and 2018, as well as FX translation.  As a reminder, last year, we recorded a gain of approximately $580 million on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in ICG. And this year, our results include a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Mexico Asset Management business in consumer. In constant dollars, total revenues excluding these gains grew by 4% in the third quarter, driven by strong performance in our institutional franchise. Despite the revenue headwind from net one-time gains, we achieved positive operating leverage this quarter with our efficiency ratio improving year-over-year to 56.1%. Constant credit was down slightly versus last year as lower reserve builds in consumer were largely offset by volume growth and the normalization of credit costs in ICG. And excluding the gains in both periods, pre-tax earnings grew 8% year-over-year. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $675 billion. GCB and ICG loans grew by 6% or $37 billion in total with contribution from every region in consumer, as well as TTS the private bank and traditional corporate lending. Looking at year-to-date results on slide four, you can see aggregate revenues in our consumer and institutional businesses have grown 4% this year, excluding the previously mentioned gains. On an underlying basis, institutional revenues have grown 4% in line with our medium term expectations, driven by our accrual businesses in treasury and trade solutions, securities services, lending and the private bank and consumer revenues have grown 3% in constant dollars, somewhat below our medium term goal. Now this is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia Wealth Management revenues, the impact of partnership terms that came into effect earlier this year in U.S. branded cards, which we will lap as we go into 2019. And finally, in U.S. Retail, a drag from lower U.S. mortgage revenues, which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity. Despite these headwinds we've made good progress on expenses, bringing our year-to-date efficiency ratio down to 57.3%. Credit quality remains broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pre-tax earnings grew 5%. EPS grew by 24%, including the benefit of share buybacks as well as a lower effective tax rate. And our year-to-date RoTCE is 11.2%, well above our full year target of 10.5%. Turning now to the third quarter, slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Net income grew 36% in the third quarter, largely driven by lower cost of credit, a lower effective tax rate and the gain on the sale of Mexico Asset Management business.  Total revenues of $8.7 billion, grew 3% year-over-year, reflecting the strength in Latin America as well as the one-time gain, and expenses increased by 6% year-over-year, driven by the timing of investment initiatives versus the prior year. On a sequential basis, expenses were flat and year-to-date both revenues and expenses grew 4% versus last year. Slide six shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. In total, third quarter revenues of $5.1 billion were down 1% from last year. Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 3% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continue to decline mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% in the third quarter, a slower pace than we saw in the first half of the year largely reflecting lower episodic transaction activity in commercial banking, as well as increasing rate sensitivity. While deposit spreads continued to improve year-over-year, the pace of improvements slowed this quarter led by a deposit mix shift in our commercial portfolio. Average deposits declined 2% year-over-year, primarily driven by a reduction in money market balances as clients put more money to work in investments. Assets under management grew 9% to $64 billion. In aggregate, deposits and assets under management grew slightly year-over-year as strong growth in Citigold households and balances more than offset other outflows.  Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were down 3% from last year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio, as well as previously mentioned partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year. Now excluding Hilton, purchase sales grew 11% year-over-year in the quarter and average loans grew 4%, including 7% growth in interest-earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature. This growth in interest-earnings balances is driving a positive mid shift in our portfolio. As a result, on a sequential basis, our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans or net interest revenue percentage improved as expected by over 20 basis points and our net interest revenues grew by 5%. We expect the NIR percentage to continue to improve in the fourth quarter, resulting in year-over-year spread expansion that should continue into 2019. For the full year, we continue to expect reported revenues in Branded Cards to be roughly flat; however we remain on track to achieve 2% underlying growth. This underlying growth should accelerate and translate into reported growth in 2019, even considering the Hilton and Visa B gains we took earlier this year. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 2%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the full quarter benefit of the recent acquisition of the L.L. Bean card portfolio, partially offset by higher partner payments. Total expenses for North America consumer were up 7%, primarily reflecting the timing of investments versus the prior period. On a sequential basis, expenses were roughly flat and should remain stable into the fourth quarter.  Turning to credit, total credit costs were down 20% year-over-year, primarily due to a lower reserve build in both Branded Cards and retail services relative to last year. Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards was 291 basis points, in line with an NCL rate in the range of 3% for 2018. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 458 basis points, which is also consistent with our outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 5% for 2018.  On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Third quarter revenues of $3.5 billion grew 11%, driven by strength in Latin America, as well as the previously mentioned one-time gain. In Latin America, excluding the gain, total consumer revenues grew 8%, driven by continued volume growth across commercial, mortgage and card loans, as well as deposits.  Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the third quarter, as continued growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues, given a weaker market sentiment. Over the last 12 months, Asia Consumer revenues grew 4%, in line with our medium term expectations, driven by 5% growth in revenues excluding investment products. While investment product revenues are more market sensitive and can be variable quarter-to-quarter, we\u2019ve seen growth overtime consistent with our growth in clients and assets under management. And we are continuing to increase the proportion of more stable accrual type investment revenues, as our business in Asia today is more sensitive to upfront transaction fees than in other regions. In total, operating expenses were up 4% in the third quarter, as investment spending and volume driven growth were partially offset by efficiency savings. And constant credit grew 17%, reflecting loan growth as well as the impact of a reserve release in Asia in the prior year period. Slide eight, shows our Global Consumer Credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter across regions. The sequential increase in the NCL rate in Latin America reflected an episodic promotional charge-off that was fully offset by a related loan loss reserve release and therefore neutral to cost of credit. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, excluding the impact of a prior year gain, revenues of $9.2 billion increased 4% in the third quarter and were also up 4% on a year-to-date basis, with strength in both banking and markets. Total banking revenues of $4.9 billion grew 2%.  Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were up 4% as reported and 8% in constant dollars. Reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes, loans and deposits. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were down 8% from last year as growth in M&A was more than offset by a decline in underwriting fees, reflecting lower market activity. Private Bank revenues of $849 million grew 7% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads. And Corporate Lending revenues of $563 million were up 11%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging cost.  Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 8%, excluding the gain last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.2 billion increased 9% year-over-year with contribution from both rates and currencies as well as spread products. Equities revenues were up 1%, as strength in prime finance and derivatives was largely offset by lower revenues in cash equities, reflecting a more challenging trading environment and lower commissions. And finally, in Securities Services revenues were up 11% as reported and 15% in constant dollars, driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $5.2 billion increased 1% year-over-year, as higher compensation costs, investments and an increase in business volumes were partially offset by efficiency savings. And finally cost of credit was $71 million this quarter, reflecting loan growth. Slide 10 shows the results for Corp/Other. Revenues of $494 million declined 5% from last year, driven by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 44%, also reflecting the wind down, as well as lower infrastructure costs. And pre-tax income was $65 million this quarter, better than our outlook reflecting higher treasury revenues and lower infrastructure expenses relative to our prior expectations. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect a modest pre-tax loss in Corp/Other, mostly driven by seasonally higher franchise wide marketing and regulatory consulting cost, relative to the third quarter. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. As you can see total net interest revenue were $11.8 billion this quarter, grew roughly 5% from last year, as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corp/Other. Core accrual net interest revenue grew by roughly $970 million year-over-year and our core accrual net interest margin improved by 12 basis points to 360 basis points, driven by rate increases, loan growth and an improved loan mix versus last year. On a sequential basis, core accrual revenues grew approximately $270 million, reflecting the benefit of higher rates as well as loan growth along with the impact of one additional day in the quarter. However core accrual net interest margin remain flat on a sequential basis, as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter.  Year-to-date core accrual revenue grew by over $2.7 billion year-over-year and we expect to see additional growth in the fourth quarter that's roughly in line with the $970 million we saw this quarter. So the growth in our core accrual net interest revenue should approach $3.7 billion for full year 2018. However, as a reminder, on a full year basis, we expect this increase to be partially offset by a roughly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy asset wind down portfolio in corporate/other. And trading related net interest revenue will likely to continue to face headwinds in a rising rate environment as we've seen year-to-date. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter our CET-1 capital ratio declined sequentially to 11.8% as net income was more than offset by share buybacks and dividends and we saw an increase in risk weighted assets related to client activity. And our tangible book value per share increased slightly to $61.91. Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In ICG, equity and fixed income market revenues should reflect a normal seasonal decline from the third to the fourth quarter. However, we currently expect revenues to be higher on a year-over-year basis.  Turning to investment banking, revenue should reflect the overall environment, but given our current backlog, we expect revenues to be up both sequentially and year-over-year. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses, including Treasury and Trade Solutions, Securities Services, Lending and the Private Bank. In consumer, in North America we expect to see somewhat better growth in the retail banking, excluding mortgage as well as retail services. In U.S. Branded Cards, total revenues will continue to reflect the impact of the Hilton sale as well as partnership terms that went into effect earlier this year. However, the net interest revenue percentage should improve both sequentially and year-over-year. And we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in Asia and Mexico. Cost of credit should remain fairly stable quarter-over-quarter. And we remain on track to achieve roughly 100 basis points of efficiency improvement this year. This will put us at a 57.3% efficiency ratio for the full year. Even though the fourth quarter revenues will likely see some pressure sequentially given the normal seasonal decline in trading revenues, our expenses should also decline modestly on lower compensation costs and better efficiency savings. This should put our efficiency ratio in the fourth quarter roughly in line with our performance year-to-date. And finally, our tax rate should be in the range of 24% to 25%. And with that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Good morning. John I wanted to -- yes, as we look at to your 2020 financial targets. At a high level, you're projecting a widening of the operating leverage jazz next year and acceleration of the efficiency improvement that you're already having. So I guess as we look out in that plan, is it fair that you expect that widening of the operating leverage to be partly driven by stronger revenues and partly by slower expense growth as we look out? John Gerspach : Yes, I mean, John I think we're consistent with what we laid out at Investor Day last year. We've been talking about certainly during the first nine months of this year, which is that we continue to expect revenue growth largely in line with GDP and call that that 4% or so revenue growth in our core businesses, say 3% overall. So we are expecting some degree of revenue growth and basically holding expenses flat over that period. John McDonald : Got you. And then the efficiency improvement this quarter seem to be concentrated in the corp. and other segment. Are we getting to the point where the incremental savings will start being reflected in the core businesses as we look out? John Gerspach : You\u2019ll see, as we said, consumer expenses staying stable next quarter, but again, last quarter John, we talked about the fact that from an investment point of view, we were about 50% through our investment spend, and at that point in time about a third of the way through generating the expense efficiencies associated with those investments. Both of those have picked up, we are starting to see that gap begin to close, it certainly visible to us in the details I can't say that it's going to be visible to you in the fourth quarter in the each of the businesses, but you'll certainly see that in 2019. John McDonald : Got you. Okay. And one more quick follow-up in terms of the card revenues starting to look better next year seems like the core revenue growth rate feels like 2% this year and will accelerate next year on a core basis. Is that really driven by the decline in promotional balances and the impact on net interest yield? John Gerspach : John, it's two things. I mean, we continue of course to grow the -- I think it's more of the fact that as those promotional balances run down, we're continuing to convert a lot of those balances into full rate revolving balances. We talked last quarter about the fact that we saw that conversion rate at something just below 50% and that we continue to see that type of performance. So you've got that mix of the net interest earning balances growing and I referenced it is 7% growth in the net interest earning balances this quarter. And then you combine that with the decline in the promo balances. And that's really what's fueling that revenue growth that we see going into next year. So, as we look forward, we expect those interest earning balances to continue to grow and then a larger percentage of that growth gradually comes from the higher margin proprietary product balances. So, promotional rate loans decline, the other balances grow and that's what's driving it. This is all part of what we're trying to achieve by getting the right balance in our U.S. Branded Cards portfolio. We've talked about this in the past. And I think that what you're going to see is that by the end of 2019, we should have a well balanced portfolio with the appropriate mix of both interest bearing and non-interest bearing receivables. And then importantly within each of those categories, we have the right balance of -- on the interest earnings balances, the right balance between co-brand and proprietary products. And then in the non-interest bearing the right mix of promotional and transacted balances. So all of that is really what's going to fuel that revenue growth that you're going to see in 2019 and then beyond. John McDonald : Got you. Thank you. John Gerspach : It\u2019s all right. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Good morning, John. John Gerspach : Hi, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Maybe just following up on John's prior question on cards, as you noted, the net interest or the NIR percentage grew 23 bps to 851. Where do you see that selling long-term, obviously prior to all the [indiscernible] rating Costco these [ph] rate cards you were doing north of nine? Is that something where you could get back to? How do we think about that longer term potential revenue yields in the card business? John Gerspach : Yes, I don't think that we're right in the position now Jim to give you a long-term goal on net interest percentage. A lot of that's going to depend on, where the interest rate environment settle out. Jim Mitchell : Sure. John Gerspach : And then just how successful we are in driving that right balance. But we certainly see it growing higher in 2019. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And do you think the conversion of -- at about less than 50%. Does that slow loan growth, but also help on the credit side? How do we think about that trade off? John Gerspach : Well, it does slow loan growth a little bit. But I think it's -- if you're focused on growing loans and only growing loans, we could put out those promotional balances all day long and grow loans. And then you\u2019d be asking me about, where's the revenue. And so what -- again what you do is with those promotional balances you\u2019re hoping that those clients, once they finish with the promotional period will like the value preposition that they see based on the card that they have taken and then stick with you and convert to a full rate revolving loan and that\u2019s exactly what we are seeing. So we\u2019re happy to trade-off some reduction in the growth of non-interest bearing loans for faster growth in interest bearing loans. Jim Mitchell : Right. And I was just asking does that help on the credit side, as you get rid of those non-interest bearing loans that roll-off, that\u2019s all. Do you get a little help with that. John Gerspach : I mean, as far as for me from an NCL percentage point of view. Jim Mitchell : Yes. John Gerspach : Yes, it might but hopefully we\u2019re getting the right growth elsewhere as well. So, I wouldn\u2019t -- I certainly wouldn\u2019t describe any part of our NCL rate being they\u2019re holding at around that 3% or 3.25% as something to do with the fact that we\u2019re quickly running off promotional balances. Jim Mitchell : Okay, I mean that\u2019s fine. And just maybe just one other, maybe forgive me if I missed your comment on fix rating, but you guys obviously at least so far what we\u2019ve seen outperformed I think our expectations. Is that really largely the EM volatility that we have seen, how do we think about that with respect to fix? And also I guess longer term if you\u2019re worried about some of these movements in currencies. John Gerspach : Actually when we talk about the strong performance in rates and currencies this quarter, it was really centered more so in G10 rates and G10 FX. And I\u2019d say it\u2019s fueled by a combination of strong corporate client activity and also our ability to navigate a fairly interesting trading environment in the second half of the quarter. There was a good amount of market volatility in the second half of the quarter due to a combination of U.S. interest rate moves and pressure on the euro resulting from the situation in Turkey and I think our guys did a great job navigating that environment. Jim Mitchell : Okay, thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks. John Gerspach :  Hi, Glenn. Glenn Schorr : Hello there. Quickly on Mexico and Asia, the good on Mexico I am just curious on the removal of the NAFTA headwind if that increases your confidence in your 10 percentage growth expectations, which has been good. And maybe a flip side question on Asia, good explanation on market sensitive stuff laying down decent underlying growth, but in the 4% 2020 target that\u2019s a full package, right? In another words markets good and bad, but we\u2019re still expecting 4% growth through 2020 targets. Mike Corbat : Yes, so if you take each of those pieces. So one is we like the fact that there is a deal on the table, obviously it needs to be ratified by all three governments, hopefully we hear back fairly quickly from Mexico and from Canada. We have got political backdrop we\u2019ve got to work our way through the mid-term et cetera here. But I think the deal that\u2019s on the table and getting behind that us would be important. I would say we stay committed on the 10%, I would argue Glenn that kind of near to intermediate term NAFTA likely has a bigger impact on our institutional flows than our consumer flows. And so where you look, I think what we have seen is the result of some of the skirmish back and forth is I think you have seen FDI go down, you have seen more volatility in the currency, I think you have seen U.S. business inbound to Mexico probably more conservative and I think you have seen Mexican business was more conservative. So I actually view this as probably having a bigger benefit near to intermediate term for what happens in our institutional business and I would say from our core business we\u2019re watching longer term the impact of heading into the inauguration, heading into the budget in December and then kind of watching what comes out in terms of fiscal discipline, social programs, et cetera and then how that translates domestically into what happens in the economy, which will have the bigger impact in our opinion on the consumer business. I think in Asia, when you look across our Asia franchise that 4% growth across the footprint in consumer is again to use John\u2019s words, it\u2019s pretty balanced and as we look into those franchises we see good growth, you saw in this quarter actually pretty good underlying cards growth. We saw pretty good underlying growth everything other than the wealth management. And I think as historic and as expected when we get these periods of heighten volatility the wealth product tends to pull back, but again constructively when you look at what's going on in terms of AUM, we continue to build AUM and provided this isn't some prolonged period of extraordinarily heightened volatility. We'd expect those wealth management revenues to recover and therefore putting us on track for that 4%. John Gerspach : Glenn, we actually put a slide in the back of the earnings deck slide 20. Just to sort of make some of the points that Mike is just making, we recognize that right now the franchise is still it's a little overweight towards wealth management. And -- but the wealth management revenues it\u2019s going to give us some volatility. But if you take a look at it how it's performed over the past two years, the overall franchise has been growing at about 4% right in line with where we've targeted out to 2020. And wealth management has grown 6%. So it's been performing, but it does give us a little volatility. Now we are still as I said a bit overweight, and we've got several initiatives underway to increase the proportion of what I would called more stable accrual type revenues. And that includes a focus on lending. And if you look at how our loans have been growing, they've been growing in a nice cliff. Now there is a good portion of our loan book in Asian consumer that we're not looking to grow, mortgages very low margin loans. But if you strip out mortgages, the underlying loans cards, personal installment loans, they've been growing at a rate of about 7% year-to-date. And even when it comes to investment products, we're changing the fee structure on many of our investment products more towards a trailing fee structure that we have here in the states as oppose to what now is very heavily reliant on upfront fees. So that overtime is going to bring Asia more in line with our fee structure in the U.S. and it will also tend to make the revenues a bit more stable. So we will liked what's going on in Asia and we're still very comfortable with that 4% growth factor out to 2020. Glenn Schorr : Awesome. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. John Gerspach : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : My first question is for Mike, since we talked to you last, you installed a new Head of U.S. Banking. And I guess this person will oversee credit cards and other retail products and distribution. So what are you trying to achieve with that new management change? And why now and what kind of metrics will you monitor to make sure this change is successful -- will be a success? Mike Corbat : Sure. So as I described in my preamp, really what we're trying to do here and what we're trying to accomplish in many ways mimics the structure that we already have in Mexico and that we already have in Asia, where we\u2019ve got regional heads who have the ability to view the franchise were important to view the customer holistically. And if you go back and think in many ways of the history of Citi it was Citi Card and Citi Mortgage and Citi this and Citi that. We had a series of bilateral relationships through products with our clients often times not necessarily knowing or understanding the entirety of the relationship. I think the work that was done in terms of Rainbow and other technology implementations now gives us the ability to view the client holistically. Why now is because when you go back and look at the work we needed to do from products of getting a card suite built out, of getting contract renegotiations, et cetera, et cetera. We had a lot of work to get done and we've now gotten to the place where we feel like we've got the products, we've got the platform, we've seen this work, it's proven successful for us in the other two regions and the time felt right. And with Anand having very successfully driven our business in Asia, we thought given the things that we're trying to accomplish here and a good bench not just in Asia but Mexico and other places that it would be the right time to make this move. So, we\u2019re excited about it Anand is pulling the team together it\u2019s early days for him, but he brought a lot of energy to it and we\u2019re excited about what\u2019s ahead. Mike Mayo : And any metrics that you\u2019ll monitor to make sure this is successful in terms of profitability or growth? Mike Corbat : Well, I think it\u2019ll be the combination, so in there I said in my preamble not only brings strong traditional consumer banking, but has really been at the forefront in our firm in terms of the whole digital adoption and the push towards digital obviously that\u2019s extremely relevant and prevalent in Asia. So, one is we\u2019re going to continue to make the push, because around the combination of revenue growth, customer satisfaction as well as expense trajectory digital plays an important part of that. So there will be digital metrics some of which we\u2019re showing external today, obviously it\u2019s the continued growth and continued push around deposit and deposit capture not just within our traditional physical footprint, but as we talk about on a national wide basis and what we do there. And then part of the value preposition that we\u2019ve talked about in terms of how we do that and how we drive more growth, as an example is taking advantage of our broad footprint of credit card holders not just across the U.S., but around the world and using various forms of digital interaction and various types of incentives or rewards to get more out of those relationships and we\u2019ll have metrics against all those. Mike Mayo : Great. And last follow-up maybe for you or for John. So, you have consolidated the platform, you\u2019ve consolidated cards, you\u2019re in a position where you can do this now. So will you be getting additional disclosure as relates to North America consumer whether it\u2019s digital banking or a slice indicing a few different ways for us externally? John Gerspach : Mike when you say additional disclosure you mean other than the break outs that we give you right now as far as Branded Cards, retail services and retail bank and then adding them all up together to be the North America region. Mike Mayo : Or it could relate to more digital banking disclosure, how you\u2019re doing with products and customers or you had a lot more capability internally, given what you have done with project Rainbow and I thought that was a good reference like a decade or two to consolidate all the retail system and after all there is earlier acquisitions. So now that you have these capabilities to serve customers, maybe you can provide us with more information on any incremental success you\u2019re having. John Gerspach : Yes, I mean, we\u2019ve taken a first stab of that, if you take a look at the slide 24 in the appendix, maybe in the future we can do a little bit more of this on a regional basis, right now we\u2019re tracking everything globally. So, we\u2019ll see how we build this into something else. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. John Gerspach : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hello. John Gerspach : Hey, Matt. Matt O\u2019Connor: Actually just a follow-up on the last line of thinking here, as you talk about kind of deepening the retail bank relationship obviously part of that is could it be the national digital banking effort trying to get deposits. But beyond the Card and the deposit gathering like do you think you have the product set and the kind of scale in some other areas. Because, I guess, my perception is you are a lot smaller in mortgage than kind of some peers of your size, auto, I think you either pulled out or you\u2019re very small there. Like are there other areas that you feel like you need to enter or bulk up so that you really have the offering for the customer base. Mike Corbat : So, John why don\u2019t I start, I think when you look at mortgage or you look at auto today in each of those cases the predominance of those products, as an example more than half of mortgages originate in United States today are originated by non-banks. Over 80% of auto loans originated till today are originated by non-banks. And so I think we look to play in our sweet spot in terms of broadly defined payment of cards and where payments are headed. Wealth management and so the combination of then the Citigold type depository and product offering with the combine suite of investment options or opportunities on the back of that. And so, again, we think that that is a good suite. And as we look at consumer preferences, that's probably the tighter bundle that's actually there today. And I think when you look at people either Morgan shopping or auto loan shopping, you tend to see those as more of kind of one-off type transactions as to our approach is more of the relationship approach of trying to broaden some of the products we have. Matt O\u2019Connor: And on the investment and wealth side I mean you\u2019ve had some good momentum on the investment sales in terms of growth rates. Do you think you've got the scale that you need in that area as you think about going national and trying to really penetrate the card customer base? Mike Corbat : Again the platform exists and we can -- I won't say infinitely scale it, but we can certainly easily scale it and the platforms of connectivity, all of that's there. And so again, whether we do it out of a branch on Fifth Avenue or whether we do it online, we've got the same connectivity to the products. John Gerspach : And Matt what, again, we've never said that, we're never going to build another branch. If as we show success in penetrating those especially those card clients that are outside of our six named cities right now. If we start to see concentrations we\u2019ll be looking to build wealth centers around those population areas as well. So to Mike's point, we think that initially we can scale off of our mobile or digital platform and then if required, we're more than willing to scale up physically as well selectively. Matt O\u2019Connor: And do you think the preference would be to build organically or would you be more open to maybe buying a branch network than you've been in the past? John Gerspach : I would say more likely now to build organically. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And if I could just squeeze in a completely separate question, the charge-offs in Latin America ticked up a bit both linked quarter and year-over-year, but the delinquencies actually went down. John Gerspach : If you look, we actually try to make a comment on that focused on slide, I think it\u2019s eight where we give you those credit statistics. And you see that tick up to a 4.63% NCL rate in the third quarter, that's really being driven by one commercial credit that went to write-off that we had previously reserved. So it did show the NCL rate tick up and it had absolutely no impact on our cost of credit. And as you still correctly note, it doesn't impact our delinquency statistics at all. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Sorry, I missed that comment. Thank you. John Gerspach : That's okay. I say a lot. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. John Gerspach : Hey Ken. are you on mute. Operator : Ken Usdin, your line is open. Ken Usdin : Hi. Can you hear me? John Gerspach : Yes. Mike Corbat : We got you. Ken Usdin : Sorry about that. Okay. So thanks. Real quick, I wanted to ask you just about the deposit insurance fund assessment. And can you just kind of walk us through are you expecting it to be out in the fourth quarter? And since you guys account for through NII. Just what do we need to understand about how that will move through in terms of NIM going forward as well? John Gerspach : So you talked about the surcharge, right? Ken Usdin : Correct. John Gerspach : Yes, and you're right. But we have the surcharge. The surcharge costs us about $140 million a quarter and that the roll off of that surcharge is not embedded in the guidance that I gave earlier. As far as net interest revenues growing by somewhere in that same range as they grew in the third quarter, that $970 million. So if it did roll off in the fourth quarter that would be some upside. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then you obviously continue to account for that in NIM going forward. When we think about it on a segment basis is that spread out everywhere or is it in corporate other? How do we see that come through the segments? John Gerspach : No, we actually push it down. Ken Usdin : Okay. So when it comes out, it'll be a nice little helper to the both the segment NIMs and also the corporate level. John Gerspach : That is correct, sir. Ken Usdin : Okay, got it. Understood. One quick one, just on credit. Latin America losses were up a little bit. And I don't know if that was the seasonal versus just any change there. Can you just talk us through if there was any just notable change in underlying? John Gerspach : No, the tick up in net credit losses in Latin America really stem from one commercial credit that we took to write-off this quarter. But we had already fully reserved for it. So it really had no impact on our reported earnings out of Latin America. It just shows up as an increase in the NCL and then if you look at reserves, it's coming out of the reserve, because obviously we leased the reserve. But I think importantly you'll note that our Latin America delinquencies really had no appreciable change. As a matter of fact, they actually went down both sequentially and year-over-year. Ken Usdin : Yes, okay. All right, thanks very much, John. John Gerspach : No problem at all, Ken. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. John Gerspach : Hi, Betsy. Mike Corbat : Hey, Betsey. Betsy Graseck : Hey. Couple of questions, one is just on how the steepening of the yield curve is helping you out, and in particular the European yield curve. Because I think there is a little more exposure there than most banks. And I currently wanted to get an understanding from you as to how it's impacting your forward-look? John Gerspach : Betsy, we really are still much more exposed to movement on the short end of the curve. And I think you see that in the disclosures that we give you both in the Qs and the Ks. So we really don't have a great deal of exposure on the long end of the curve either in euro or in U.S. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So you go out like two years is that it or? John Gerspach : I'd say when I look at everything it's more short rate compared to let's say three years. Because three -- if you take a look at our investment portfolio, our investment portfolio probably has an average tenure just below three years 2.7 something like that. So it's really more looking at it on the short rate out to the three year. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then separately, could you just walk us through how you're thinking about planning for the potential risk of the Sears [ph] bankruptcy either filing Chapter 7, Chapter 11 not sure which way it\u2019s going to go right now, but seemingly likely to come on Monday. Can you just give us a update on how you're thinking about your position there? John Gerspach : Obviously we're not in a position to comment on the likelihood that Sears will commence bankruptcy proceedings. But Sears has been a 15 year card partner of Citi Retail Services. And the portfolio does continue to deliver strong returns for us. If you do look at the portfolio itself and just to put everything in perspective, the portfolio consists it's primarily MasterCard general purpose accounts. And as we\u2019ve said in the past over 70% of the customer spend of that portfolio is outside of Sears. That's consistent with what we would consider to be top of wallet customer behavior. And we\u2019ve seen already that the retailer has already taken actions to close stores and restructure its operations. And that has already been embedded in our financial planning, and is embedded in the outlooks that we've given you and the targets that we've set. So we don't expect a Chapter 11 filing to have an immediate impact on Citi at all. Now if the Sears bankruptcy resulted in accelerated store closures, would likely have the effect of slowing new acquisitions. We have to ramp up our engagement with existing cardholders to continue to support spending activity on the predominantly general purpose MasterCard portfolio, but that would be period expenses more so than any individual initial impact. Betsy Graseck : Right. Because -- and you're facing these customers obviously directly and if I recall correctly the renegotiation that you did earlier this year with Sears gives you a little more flexibility on how you can approach the clients and work with them, is that right? John Gerspach : Yes, it actually means that we own those portfolios we have the right to own those portfolios. And so we don\u2019t see any impact at all other than the slowing down. I would say that\u2019s in the Chapter 11, you also asked I think about Chapter 7. And obviously if for some reason they went down to a full liquidation that would have a larger impact now there would be certain accruals that we would need to take there\u2019d be a write down of the portfolio related intangibles that remains associated with the contract that we have. And so that total impact could be $300 million, that\u2019ll be $300 million charge that we might have to take if they went Chapter 7. But most of that charge would reflect the acceleration the write-off of the contract intangible that would otherwise have fully amortize during 2019. So again not a real significant impact to us over the next 15 months. Betsy Graseck : Got it, okay. And then just one follow-up on the -- I think there was a CCIL question earlier. But, the question I had is I know you put in your commentary went back when you did the Investor Day, potentially a 10% to 20% increase in the reserve at the point in time when CCIL was adopted in 1Q, 2020. The question I have is just the composition of that 10% to 20%, does that include some asset classes where there\u2019s a build in some asset classes where there is release. Just wondering thinking around that. John Gerspach : The way that the math works with some of the models, yes, there are some portfolios where upon the adoption of CCIL we\u2019d actually have too much. Loan loss reserve and then there are others that would require us to build some additional reserves. All of that is embedded in that 10% to 20% guidance that we have given you. And that we also said that as we look at it now it\u2019s likely to be that we\u2019re on the upper end of that guidance. But we\u2019re still within the guidance that we gave. Betsy Graseck : Okay, thank you. John Gerspach : No problem, Betsy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Afternoon. Couple of questions, one on the accrual businesses and ICG you have had lot of success there. But you did see a slowdown in TTS this quarter, I think it grow 4% was down sequentially, any color there what\u2019s going on and what drove that? John Gerspach : So I\u2019d ask you to focus on the constant dollar disclosure that we gave you with TTS, only because so many of our revenues in TTS come from outside the U.S. And on a constant dollar basis, what we told you is that the TTS revenues grew again by 8% this quarter year-over-year. So we think that\u2019s been consistent with that the growth that you have seen in the past. So, we don\u2019t see any real slowdown in our TTS business at all. Saul Martinez : Okay. So it\u2019s just currency then. John Gerspach : Correct, sir. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. And then just a follow-up on CCIL you highlighted the estimate. But, I think perhaps the bigger impact for you and for some of the money centers or GSIBs is the interplay with the CCAR process and interplay with the SCB. But just any comments there, any concerns about whether that CCIL\u2019s implementation into CCAR could serve as an impediment to your capital optimization plan. John Gerspach : Well, there\u2019s a lot that we don\u2019t know about the future of CCAR and CCIL, but the one thing we do know is that the Fed has said that CCIL will not be part of the 2019 CCAR cycle. So, therefore we\u2019re not anticipating that CCIL will have any impact on our ability to again our guidance is that we expect to be able to achieve that $60 billion worth of capital return over those three CCAR cycles we have done $41 billion through the first two cycles that we referenced. And we don\u2019t see CCIL as an impediment to us completing that. Mike Corbat : And the other thing we have done is we\u2019ve tried to emphasize with the Fed that they should be actually taking a aggregated view of the combinations of whatever is to come, whenever it comes in terms of SCB, countercyclical buffer and CCIL together to get an aggregate or cumulative view of what impact that may have not just on us but on the industry. John Gerspach : GSIB, recalibration. Mike Corbat : Exactly. Saul Martinez : Got it. I guess, yes, I meant more beyond 2019 to sort of your longer term capital plan, but okay. But that's helpful. Thanks so much. John Gerspach : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning or good afternoon guys. John Gerspach : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Mike, I think in your opening comments you mentioned that you felt pretty good about the investment banking pipeline and upcoming transactions. Can you compare to us the outlook for that pipeline today for the fourth quarter to what you saw at the end of the second quarter of going into the third quarter is it higher than that, the same, lower? Mike Corbat : One is there is obviously seasonality to the pipeline kind of depending. So when you look at the numbers today and John referenced it a bit that in there. So we actually had relatively speaking fairly strong performance in terms of M&A. And we actually had relatively weaker performance in terms of the two capital markets debt and equities. And when you look at aggregate these in the third quarter as an example you're in a deal or you're out of a deal that can move the numbers.  And so traditionally when we look at as we go into year-end, at least traditionally, the combination of M&A deals getting closed is fairly strong. And then people trying to get in particular prefunding or financings done as we close out the year. So our expectation of what I would say I'm not going to get into specific numbers. But I think John in and what he talked about in the 4Q in terms of investment banking, we expect both a sequential and year-over-year increase in there says that we think we\u2019ve got pretty good visibility to monetizing a fairly strong pipeline. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And John you talked about in the ICG Group with the equity markets some of the factors that affected the growth in revenues. And you mentioned that there was a challenging trading environment and lower commissions. Can you give us any color on the Midfit 2 [ph] how that might be affecting your cash business and can you make any conclusions yet on which way that's going? John Gerspach : Yes, really we don't really see much of an impact coming from Midfit 2 [ph] on our equity business at all. What we had here Gerard, if you take a look at our equities overall business, we had good growth in derivatives, in prime finance and delta one. Those products combined were up about 15%, 16% year-over-year. And so where we did see this decline was in cash equity. And we just had-- we just didn't do as good a job navigating the choppy trading environment in cash and equities as we did on the other side of the house in G10 rates and currencies. It's choppy trading environment, we did really well in one set of products and not so well in the other. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just finally, you mentioned in the ICG Group the corporate lending business revenues were up nicely double-digits year-over-year, year-to-date I think they are up almost 17%. Is that coming from what type of corporate loans because I noticed the corporate loans year-over-year when you break it out in slide 21 of the supplement the Private Bank part is up strong as well as the Markets and Securities Services. So where you getting that growth, is it from your large corporate clients or is it from other areas? John Gerspach : It's pretty widespread Gerard to be honest with you. And it's pretty widespread both on a geographic basis as well as on a product basis. I\u2019d say the one area where we didn't see significant loan growth this quarter would have been in trade. And that's just because we deliberately took down our trade loan book in Asia we just didn't like the spreads. And so we went a little bit more on a originate to distribute mode in Asia. And the nice thing is with the franchise that we\u2019ve built we've got that ability now to moving aside to participate in the market and hold the loan, because we think that it's a good spread. Or if the spreads are a little bit tighter than we like we can originate and then find other people that we can distribute to. So I like the overall strength of the franchise right now. It's broad based, it really is getting deeper in with the clients. And I think that's reflected in the loan growth that you've been seeing in both, in all the regions of ICG. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. John Gerspach : No problem. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. John Gerspach : Hey, Brian. Brian Kleinhanzl : Hey, thanks. Just two quick questions here, one just focusing on the non-interest revenues in North America for GCB, I mean, those were down again quarter-on-quarter and it's probably like the lowest it's been 10 years. I mean, you mentioned that there were some higher partner payments, some additional partner terms going through there, but we're kind of hitting a low water mark for that. And if we should inflict from here? John Gerspach : Yes, Brian, it's a noisy line, especially this year. I'll grant you that. Don't forget earlier in the year we had some gains that we told you about on the Visa B shares that is influencing that line. We also did mention the fact that we had some higher partnership terms that kicked in with some of our portfolios and that's going through that line. I think you're going to see improved growth on that line when we get into next year, and we get beyond some of these one-off transactions. If you look at Citi overall right now, and you look at our net interest revenue and fees, net interest revenues constitute just over 60% of our revenues, 62%, 63% something like that. Whereas fees are 37%, 38% and there's just a lot of noise going on in the fee line right now between the gain that we took last year with yield book, the gain now that we're taking with the asset management the partnership fees that are rolling in. But what we really think that as we move forward, you're going to see additional fee generation especially in GCB, the interchange, the annual fees as we get beyond those partner payments, they will come through. So I think on a go forward basis, you can think about growth and non-interest revenues for Citi as being at a slightly higher pace than interest revenue. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. And then just one separate question on the legacy assets, the North American consumer looks like the pace of run-off have kind of slowed modestly, but I mean, how should we think about that going forward, I know you gave some of the guidance that it's going to be an offset? John Gerspach : The run-off of legacy assets, that is absolutely slowing because we have less legacy assets to run-off. And, legacy assets now are roughly 1% of our overall GAAP balance sheet. So once we got past our Columbia consumer business, which we managed to sell earlier this year, there are really no more operating businesses in there. It's really comprised of some of the legacy mortgages and home equity loans. So they'll continue to run-off but at a slower pace. What you will continue to see for at least the next year is some impact on the expense line of the run-off, because don't forget, as we sell these businesses, in many cases we've entered into these transactions supportive release where we continue to support the business for a period of time could be 12 to 24 months as the buyer is integrating these operations into their own operation. So we still expect some benefit coming from the rundown of legacy assets on the expense line. But you're absolutely right, you're going to see less of an impact in assets. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay, great. Thanks. John Gerspach : Okay. No problem, Brian. Operator : There are no further questions. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you all for joining us here today. It you have any follow-up questions please call me and my team in Investor Relations. Operator : This concludes today's call. You may now disconnect.",

Today, we are joining by Citi\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; the Chief Financial Officer, John Gerspach; and Citi\u2019s incoming CFO, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks. At which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then John Gerspach, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2017 Form 10-K.  With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. Excluding the one-time impact of Tax Reform, we reported earnings of $4.2 billion for the fourth quarter of 2018 or $1.61 per share. Our net income for the year totaled $18 billion or $6.65 per share, a 25% increase from 2017.  During 2018, we made solid progress towards the 2020 targets as we\u2019d committed. Our return on tangible common equity reached 10.9%, exceeding the 10.5% we targeted for the year. And despite the market conditions we experienced throughout the fourth quarter, we still improved our operating efficiency to 57% for the year. In addition, we grew loans and deposits in constant dollars by 4% and 7% respectively, improved our return on assets to 93 basis points and managed our effective tax rate down to the 23% range, a little better than we had forecast. We had positive operating leverage and our EBIT was up 5% on an underlying basis.  While the revenue environment was more challenging than we had anticipated, we responded decisively by managing both our expenses and our balance sheet in light of the lower market sensitive revenues. Our expense base declined by 4% both year-over-year and sequentially this quarter, taking our annual expense base to below $42 billion, and we continued to prudently manage risk-weighted assets to optimize our capital needs.  While we won't sacrifice the investments which are key to competing in the future, we also have to ensure that we remain flexible and adapt to whatever market conditions and economic conditions that materialize.  Turning to the quarter, in the Institutional Clients Group, our market-sensitive products generally had a challenging quarter, especially in fixed income. We did gain share in M&A, but Investment Banking was impacted by a decline in equity and debt originations during the quarter. Our accrual businesses, which consist of Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, the Private Bank, and Corporate Lending continued their very strong performance, up 11% for the full year in constant dollars. And as a matter of fact, we've now had five straight years of consecutive growth in TTS and are confident that we can continue with that momentum.  In Global Consumer Banking, in the US, we saw 4% underlying growth in Branded Cards and 6% revenue growth in Retail Services this quarter, and Retail Banking grew 5% ex-mortgages. Internationally, we saw good growth in Mexico, especially in the cards products, while Asia was impacted by lower revenues from investment products. During the year, we returned $18.4 billion in capital to our shareholders, buybacks of common stock reduced the shares outstanding by over 200 million shares from a year ago or 8%, and our tangible book value per share increased by 6%. We finished the year with a Common Equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.9%, up from 11.7% in the third quarter as risk-weighted assets declined. We'll be making our CCAR submission in the spring and believe we've got the capacity to reach our three-year capital return target of $60 billion.  As 2019 begins, we find ourselves operating in a more uncertain macro environment. From what we see, economic growth is stronger and more resilient than recent market volatility would indicate. That said, we're prepared to make adjustments if we get the sense economic conditions are changing.  We remain committed to our 2020 financial targets. And this year, we've targeted increasing our return on tangible common equity to 12% and further improving our efficiency ratio.  We continue to utilize technology to improve the client experience and lower our cost to serve, whether it's by automating processes or enhancing our mobile channels, and we'll continue to rollout new digital capabilities throughout the year.  As I mentioned before, we have levers we can pull if revenues come in lower, but we're very cognizant of the need to invest for the long-term so that we can serve our clients with distinction. One thing before we go to Q&A, I want to take a minute on the occasion of his final earnings call, to thank John for his 28 years of service to the firm and to congratulate him on his retirement. I know those on the phone respect him for his candor and honesty, and we'll miss him. He leaves things in good hands with Mark Mason and I know everybody's going to enjoy working with Mark.  With that, John will go through our presentation and then we'd be happy to answer your questions. John? John Gerspach : Hey. Thank you very much, Mike. And good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3, first, let me note that all comparisons throughout this presentation exclude the one-time impact of Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017 as well as a subsequent adjustment in the fourth quarter of 2018.  As previously disclosed, we recorded a non-cash charge of $22.6 billion related to Tax Reform in the fourth quarter of 2017. At that time, we noted that the final impact of Tax Reform could differ from the provisional estimate based on the finalization of our own analysis as well as additional guidance to be received from the US Treasury Department. In the recent quarter, we finalized our analysis and adjusted the provisional charge resulting in a benefit to income taxes of nearly $100 million or $0.03 per share. Excluding this benefit, we earned a $1.61 per share in the fourth quarter of 2018.  Now, looking at our results on this basis, net income of $4.2 billion in the fourth quarter grew 14% from last year driven by a reduction in expenses, lower cost of credit, and a lower effective tax rate, and EPS grew 26% including the impact of an 8% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.  Revenues of $17.1 billion declined 2% from the prior year, primarily reflecting a lower Fixed Income Markets revenues as well as the wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.  Expenses declined by 4% or over $400 million year-over-year resulting in our 9th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, and cost of credit was down 7% versus last year. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter, reflecting an adjustment to our full year estimate of income taxes under the new tax regime as well as other resulting actions we have taken. This results in an effective tax rate of just over 23% for full year 2018, which we believe to be an appropriate tax rate as we look into 2019. In constant dollars, Citigroup end of period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $684 billion and deposits grew 7% to $1 trillion. Now, looking at full year results on Slide 4, we made steady progress in 2018, although revenue growth remained somewhat below our medium-term outlook. As a reminder, in 2017, we recorded a one-time gain of roughly $580 million on the sale of a fixed income analytics business in ICG. And in 2018, we had a gain of roughly $250 million on the sale of our Mexico asset management business in Consumer. Excluding these items, Consumer revenues grew 3% in constant dollars, slightly below our medium-term goal. This is primarily driven by the near-term impact of weaker market sentiment on our Asia wealth management revenues; the impact of partnership terms that came into effect in 2018 in US Branded Cards, which we have now lapped as we go into 2019; and finally, in US Retail, a drag from lower US Mortgage revenues which should abate going forward as well as rising deposit sensitivity. Institutional revenues also grew 3%, as strength in our accrual businesses in Treasury and Trade Solutions, Security Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank was partially offset by weakness in Fixed Income, as well as softness in equity and debt underwriting. These results largely reflect the macro uncertainty seen in the fourth quarter, which created a challenging trading environment as well as an industry-wide slowdown in underwriting activity. Despite these headwinds, we made continued progress on our efficiency goals, driving our full year efficiency ratio to 57%. Credit quality remained broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pre-tax earnings grew 5%. EPS grew by 25% including the benefit of share buybacks as well as a lower effective tax rate. And our full year RoTCE is just under 11%, well above our target for 2018, which positions us well relative to our 12% goal for 2019. Turning now to each business, Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. In total, revenues of $5.3 billion grew 1% in the fourth quarter. Retail Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 1% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues continued to decline, mostly reflecting lower origination activity and higher funding costs.  Excluding mortgage, Retail Banking revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, slightly better growth than we saw in the third quarter, and deposit spreads stabilized in our commercial portfolio, and we faced fewer headwinds from episodic transaction activity. Average deposits declined 1% year-over-year, primarily driven by the transfer of deposits into investments. Assets under management were flat year-over-year as 5% underlying growth was offset by the impact of market movements, given the equity market sell off at year-end. Excluding market movements, total deposits in assets under management grew 1% with improving momentum. If you look at 2018 versus 2017, we more than doubled our net new money inflows across consumer deposits and investments this year. And we retained a larger dollar amount of those deposits that transferred into investments. Turning to Branded Cards, revenues were roughly flat versus the prior year, including the impact of the sale of the Hilton portfolio as well as partnership terms that went into effect in 2018. Excluding Hilton, revenues grew 2% year-over-year, including 7% growth in net interest revenue reflecting loan growth and spread improvement versus the prior year. Average loans grew 3% versus last year, including 9% growth in interest earning balances as recent vintages continued to mature and we saw strong balance retention across our portfolio. This growth in [Technical Difficulty] improved by over 30 basis points to nearly 880 basis points, a little better than we had anticipated for the fourth quarter. We\u2019re now approaching a more optimal mix of interest earning and non-interest earning balances.  As such, we expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads going forward, although we will see quarterly fluctuations and actual performance will depend on a number of factors, including our acquisition mix, the rate environment and our balance between proprietary and co-brand portfolios over time. This should fuel strong underlying revenue growth in 2019 and beyond. As we\u2019ve now lapped the impact of partnership renewals on our fee income and we\u2019re growing loan volumes at more attractive spreads. We continue to expect reported growth in total revenues in 2019, even considering the Hilton and Visa B gains we took in 2018.  Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 6%, driven by organic loan growth, as well as the benefit of the acquisition of the L.L.Bean card portfolio. Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 3%, primarily reflecting investments. Turning to credit, total credit costs were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and portfolio seasoning in both Branded Cards and Retail Services. Our NCL rate in US Branded Cards was 297 basis points for full year 2018, exactly in line with our 3% outlook. And in Retail Services, our NCL rate was 488 basis points for the full year, which is again consistent with our 5% outlook in that segment. On Slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 1%, driven by Latin America. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 5% or 7% excluding the ongoing impact of the sale of our asset management business in the third quarter. Card revenues grew 8% on continued strength in purchase sales and loan growth, while retail banking revenues grew 6% excluding the impact of the asset management sale.  Retail loan growth was vivid in Mexico this quarter, driven by an episodic paydown in our commercial portfolio, while we continued to generate solid growth in deposits.  Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, excluding the impact of a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business in the prior year. Excluding the gain, card revenues grew 3% year-over-year on continued growth in loans and purchase sales. And Retail Banking revenues declined 1%, reflecting the lower investment revenues. While investment revenues remained under pressure, we continued to see positive inflows into assets under management as well as 8% growth in Citigold Client. And excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia Consumer growth remained broadly in line with our medium-term expectations driven by growth in loans and deposits.  Total average loan growth of 3% in Asia includes the impact of our continued repositioning away from lower return mortgage assets. Excluding mortgages, loans grew 5% year-over-year. In total, operating expenses were up 1% in the fourth quarter, as investment spending and volume driven growth was largely offset by efficiency savings. And cost of credit declined 1%, reflecting a modest reserve release in Latin America this quarter.  Slide 7 shows our Global Consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained broadly favorable again this quarter across regions. In North America, the sequential uptick in delinquencies is consistent its seasonal trends we\u2019ve seen in other years in the third quarter to the fourth quarter driven by cards. This typical translates then into higher NCL rates in the first half relative to the second half of the year.  Turning now the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $8.2 billion were down 1% in the fourth quarter as strength in our accrual businesses as well as revenue growth in M&A and Equity Markets were more than offset by weakness in Fixed Income. Total banking revenues of $5 billion grew 5%, Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 7% as reported and 11% in constant dollars, reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes and deposits as well as improved spreads.  Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 1% from last year, as strong M&A performance was more than offset by a decline in underwriting, reflecting lower market activity.  Private Bank revenues of $797 million grew 3% year-over-year, driven by growth in loans and investments as well as improved deposit spreads and Corporate Lending revenues of $559 million were up 9%, reflecting loan growth along with lower hedging costs. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.1 billion declined 11% in the fourth quarter. Fixed Income revenues of $1.9 billion declined 21% year-over-year due to a challenging trading environment during the quarter.  At the Goldman Conference in early December, I noted that while clients remained engaged, we did not see the level of transaction activity we had originally expected this quarter in G10 rates in particular, as clients had largely stayed on the sidelines in an uncertain macro environment. Thereafter, the environment continued to deteriorate characterized by volatile market conditions and widening credit spreads. This resulted in a risk-off sentiment where the market-making became even more challenging in December across both rates and currencies, and spread products. Equities revenues were up 18%, mainly reflecting the impact of an episodic loss in the prior year. On an underlying basis, revenues were down slightly, as strong client activity, particularly in derivatives, was offset by a challenging trading environment and lower client financing balances.  And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 7% as reported and 12% in constant dollars driven by continued growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $4.8 billion declined 2% year-over-year on lower compensation costs associated with lower revenues.  And finally, cost of credit was $129 million this quarter, reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio. Looking at the full year, excluding the previously mentioned gain of roughly $580 million in 2017, both revenues and expenses grew by 3% in 2018. We generated over half of our revenues in banking, which grew 5% on continued momentum in TTS, the Private Bank and Corporate Lending. Securities Services grew 11%, as we continued to deepen client relationships while also benefiting from the higher rate environment. And in equities, we made solid progress with revenues up 19% for the full year.  The combined strong performance in these businesses helped to offset weakness in Investment Banking and Fixed Income, down 7% and 6% respectively on a full year basis. But even within these businesses there were still some standouts. In Investment Banking, we showed continued progress in M&A with revenues up 16%. And in Fixed Income, if you look at our total G10 FX and local markets rates and currencies business, revenues were far more stable at roughly flat to last year as we benefited from steady corporate flow activity across our global network.  Cost of credit was higher than the prior year given lower reserve releases but credit quality remained solid with roughly 5 basis points of losses for the year. Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $470 million declined 37% from last year driven primarily by the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 45%, also reflecting the wind-down, as well as lower infrastructure costs. And pre-tax income was $44 million this quarter, better than our outlook, reflecting episodic gains in our investment portfolio as well as lower total expenses relative to our prior expectations.  Looking ahead, we would still expect a modest pre-tax quarterly loss in Corporate/Other in 2019.  Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margins trends. As you can see, total net interest revenue of $11.9 billion this quarter grew roughly 8% from last year in constant dollars as growth in core accrual net interest revenue was partially offset by lower trading-related net interest revenue as well as the continued wind-down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other.  Core accrual net interest revenue grew by $1.4 billion year-over-year, well above our prior expectations driven by the FDIC surcharge benefit, improved spreads in our US Branded Cards business and balance sheet optimization as we deployed more cash into better yielding assets.  On a sequential basis, our core accrual net interest margin improved by 12 basis points to 372 basis points, including 4 basis points from the FDIC surcharge benefit. The remaining 8 basis points reflect momentum we\u2019ve seen building over the second half of the year, given higher interest rates, continued loan growth and an improved loan mix.  As we noted last quarter, even though core accrual net interest revenues grew sequentially from the second to the third quarter of 2018, our net interest margin remained flat at 360 basis points as the benefits of higher rates and loan growth were offset by higher average cash balances during the quarter. As we deployed that liquidity into better yielding assets, you can now see that underlying revenue improvement pull-through in the net interest margin. On a full year basis, core accrual revenue grew by more than $4 billion over 2017, ahead of our outlook of $3.7 billion for the year with about $1 billion coming from the benefit of higher interest rates. As we had expected, this was partially offset by a nearly $500 million decline in the net interest revenue generated in the legacy wind-down portfolio in Corporate/Other. And trading related net interest revenue declined by nearly $1.7 billion year-over-year, similar to the year-over-year decline seen in 2017.  So, if you look at our total net interest revenue for full year 2018, we grew by about $2 billion year-over-year in constant dollars. As we look at net increase revenue for 2019, now, we're unlikely to get the same magnitude of benefit from rate hikes this year. However, a slowing rate trajectory should also translate into a smaller drag from trading-related net interest revenue from 2018 to 2019.  We should also see a smaller drag from the wind-down of legacy assets. And then, of course, we will benefit from the absence of the FDIC surcharge which is about a $400 million benefit year-over-year. So, on a net basis, we expect to generate as much or even more than the $2 billion of growth in net interest revenue that we saw in 2018, even if we see less incremental benefit from rate hikes. Of course, in 2018, this growth in net interest revenue was partially offset by a roughly $1 billion decline in non-interest revenues, driven by a drag from partnership renewal terms and lower mortgage revenues in Consumer, the wind-down of legacy assets, the impact of gains we took in 2017 on hedging activity in Corporate Treasury and the net impact of previously mentioned one-time gains on asset sales.  We do not expect non-interest revenues to decline again in 2019, as we've now lapped the operating revenue headwinds in Consumer and we expect less pressure from the wind-down of legacy assets. On Slide 11 we show our key capital metrics. In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 6% year-over-year to $63.79 driven by the lower share count and our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.9% driven by a reduction in risk-weighted assets, as we continued to prudently manage the balance sheet. Our total CET1 Capital declined modestly during the quarter, as net income and DTA utilization were more than offset by $5.8 billion of total share buybacks and dividends. For the full year, we returned over $18 billion of capital to common shareholders for a payout of 110% of net income to common. And based on our 2018 CCAR capital plan, we expect to return an additional $9.8 billion of capital in the first half of 2019. In summary, we made continued progress in 2018. And while the revenue environment proved more challenging than we had anticipated, especially in the fourth quarter, we delivered on several key objectives. We improved our RoTCE by nearly 300 basis points, achieving a full year RoTCE of 10.9% and exceeding our goal of 10.5% for the year. We delivered nearly a 100 basis points of improvement in our efficiency ratio, while continuing to invest in our future.  We maintained our credit discipline growing our loan portfolio, while maintaining loss rates that were well within our medium-term expectations across every business and region.  We achieved the benefit to our ongoing effective tax rate under the new tax regime that exceeded our initial estimates. And we delivered on our capital optimization goals returning over $18 billion of capital through share buybacks and dividends during the year.  We recognize that the bar gets even higher as we go into 2019. We also recognize that we\u2019re in an uncertain macro environment where the market is beginning to discount future growth and this may create a more volatile operating environment as we saw in the fourth quarter. But we\u2019re continuing to manage the franchise responsibly and we\u2019re committed to steady, sustainable improvement in both our efficiency and returns. If you look at our performance in 2018, several businesses performed well with good visibility into 2019. The largest of these is our Treasury and Trade Solutions franchise, which generated over $9 billion of revenues and posted its 5th consecutive year of growth in constant dollars.  Our other accrual businesses in ICG across Securities Services, Corporate Lending and the Private Bank generated another $8 billion of revenues with good line of sight into 2019. Our Mexico Consumer franchise with nearly $6 billion of revenues continued to grow with a favorable market backdrop, including record low unemployment and strong consumer confidence. And while are US Branded Cards franchise generated only 1% growth for the full year, we saw 3% underlying growth in that franchise in 2018 with momentum as we exited the fourth quarter. That\u2019s a business with nearly $9 billion of annual revenues, where we are now realizing the benefits of our investments over the past three years. We also made significant progress in bringing our US Consumer business together for a more powerful client-centric franchise as we go forward. And we took on new portfolios like the L.L.Bean card acquisition to augment our organic growth. Of course, it\u2019s more difficult to predict the operating environment in areas like trading and investment banking but we continued to show good progress in M&A and equities this year, and our global FX business proved to be resilient in a challenging market.  As we look to 2019, we\u2019re preparing for a range of operating environments with a focus on achieving our RoTCE target of 12% this year in a responsible sustainable way. From a revenue perspective, in addition to the good momentum we\u2019re seeing in many of our businesses, we also have other revenue tailwinds, including the absence of the FDIC surcharge, as well as a smaller expected drag from the wind-down of legacy assets in Corp/Other.  In 2018, we absorbed over $1 billion of total revenue drag from legacy assets, which compressed top-line growth by about 1% and it should drop to about half that amount in 2019. In addition, on the expense side, we\u2019re now beginning to see efficiency saving meaningfully outpace the incremental investments we\u2019ve continued to make in the franchise. In the second half of 2018, we realized a net benefit to expenses of roughly $200 million, as savings exceeded incremental investments. That should grow to around $500 million to $600 million of net incremental savings in 2019, plus an additional $500 million to $600 million of net incremental benefits in 2020. These net savings should offset volume-driven expenses as we continue to grow the business. And it should also result in positive operating leverage for Citi in total and for our consumer and institutional businesses in 2019.  Of course, the magnitude of operating leverage we can achieve this year is sensitive to the revenue environment. But even if the environment is challenging, we believe we can deliver more total efficiency improvement than we did in 2018. And achieving our 12% RoTCE goal for this year is not dependent on capturing the full efficiency benefits we laid out in the fall which showed roughly a 175 basis points of improvements to our efficiency ratio in 2019.  Credit continues to perform well. Our effective tax rate is coming in better than we had originally estimated under the new tax regime with the potential to move somewhat lower. And as you saw in the fourth quarter, the growth opportunities are limited. We will prudently manage the balance sheet to limit RWA growth, and therefore, our capital needs.  It's still our goal to get the efficiency ratio into the low 50% range as we believe that\u2019s the right level given the investments we're making in digital and automation, as well as our mix of businesses. But our primary goal is to responsively and sustainably improve the return we're delivering on our shareholders' equity from the roughly 11% we achieved in 2018 to about 12% this year and over 13.5% in 2020.  And with that, Mike, Mark and I are happy to take any and all questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And we have a question from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. And John congrats on retirement. John Gerspach : Hey. Thanks, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Maybe if I can follow-up on just -- still out of time there at the end on the expense flexibility. I think that's a big sort of concern in the marketplace given the revenue backdrop at least in the fourth quarter that can change quickly in capital markets and I appreciate the commitment to the RoTCE. But when we think about in a more dire scenario, how much kind of a flexibility do you have? You were down 4% year-over-year in a tougher environment, can you get expenses down year-over-year in 2019? How do we think about sort of that range of flexibility so we can kind of play around with our models? Mark Mason : Hi, Jim. This is Mark Mason. How are you? Jim Mitchell : Hi, Mark. How are you? Mark Mason : Good. I\u2019ll turn you to Page 17 inside of the deck that John just read through. And what 17 shows, if you look back all the way to 2016, and it shows the long-term -- the trailing month efficiency ratios. And what we\u2019ve shown here is that year-over-year for the past number of quarters we've been able to bring that operating efficiency down. But more importantly to your question around expense ranges we can manage to, you can look at the fourth quarter of 2018 and see we ran at about 41.8. And if you look back at any of those years in 2017 and 2016, that's about the range in which we've run over the past couple years. And so to answer your question, I think as we think about the prospects for 2019 and our ability to manage expenses tightly, this is probably the range you should think about. Mark Mason : Okay, that's helpful. And then maybe just one question on credit and cards. Are you still comfortable John or with the 3% in Branded Cards and 5% or is -- I know that was sort of your prior expectation, is that still the expectation in \u201819 for the card losses? John Gerspach : What we\u2019ve said, the medium-term expectations would be that Branded Cards would operate in that range of 3% to 3.25% and Retail Services in the 5% to 5.25%. And those are still valid assumptions as we move forward and specifically for 2019. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Bernstein. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Mark, I was wondering if you could just clarify the range that you were referring to in your answer to Jim's question. You mentioned the 41.8 this quarter is a low on that slide. Was there a range from that to something else or just kind of this ballpark of 41, 42. Just wondering kind of what you\u2019re referring to there? Mark Mason : Ballpark range, if you look at the Page 17, fourth quarter of \u201916, the LTM there was about 42.3, fourth quarter of \u201818 about 41.8. So that's a ballpark range roughly. John McDonald : Okay, got it. And then two questions for you guys on the Branded Card. John you mentioned feeling good about the momentum continuing on the NII front which was very solid this quarter and better fees as your lap the partnership headwind. So what's the reasonable revenue growth aspiration for 2019 in this kind of economy? Is it similar to how you exited here in that 2% to 3%? Is that kind of how you\u2019re thinking about Branded Card revenues for \u201819? Mark Mason : I mean if you -- the Branded Cards as John mentioned, fourth quarter roughly 3% underlying, and that's a -- we think of that as a pretty good run rate going into 2019. John McDonald : Okay. And then you mentioned the card loss guidance just a question ago. Just wondering on the card ROA, I think the previous target for Branded Card was 215 basis points Branded Card ROA, and for the year you're at 180, in this quarter you're at 211. Is that 215 kind of the aspiration on the Branded Card ROA? I think that was prior to Tax Reform. We're just wondering what your updated thoughts are there? Mark Mason : Yes, that's still the target we\u2019re moving towards for branded cards, and that\u2019s after Tax Reform. John McDonald : Okay. So kind of new tax rates maybe offsetting increased competition or stays about the same? Mark Mason : There\u2019s probably a little bit of upside to that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor : Are there any specific marks that you would want to call out either within Fixed Income trading or other areas related to hung deals, or obviously it\u2019s just kind of a tough December and spreads widened, and some of it's just kind of normal marks, but are there any specific marks you'd want to call out? And then have those reversed in January? There's been some articles out there talking about spreads tightening and banks able to offload some stuff they couldn't just last month. Mike Corbat : The short answer to that is, no. That is not what we saw in our particular trading results. And to the extent we had those kind of marks, they\u2019d more likely end up in our loan revenue that we were talking about, and you can see we had fairly robust loan revenue growth again, so that's not what\u2019s impacting us. Matt O'Connor : Okay. And then just a bigger picture question, I mean obviously if we look at where bank stocks in general especially your stock, there's concern about a macro slowdown. I don't think we're seeing it outside of the capital market revenues in your results. But anything real time that you're seeing in the GTS business? Obviously you see a lot of global corporates, a lot of government data, you have the shutdown in the US. Just kind of any real time updates in terms of the macro conditions that you're seeing? Mike Corbat : What I\u2019d say is we see is we actually see a -- certainly US and even more broad global economy where the underlying fundamentals in particular on a domestic economy basis if you go around the world comprise of strong tight labor markets, reasonable wage increases, good consumption, while investment coming down, still reasonable. And I think the -- what's clearly in the fourth quarter overshadowed that was really market fears over what the transition from QE to QT might look and feel like. And obviously, we saw a lot being paid attention to pretty much any word that came out of the Fed\u2019s mouth. And I think the third piece is that adds to that volatility is things such as trade under, the on/off again momentum of trade negotiations obviously affecting two of the biggest economies in the world. And I think when we put those three things together, we clearly see a disconnect between what we see in our business on an anecdotal basis and what the markets are saying.  So, we don't see it, and I think what we've said before, and I think others have said before, is that right now, we see the biggest risk in the global economy is one of talking ourselves into the next recession as opposed to the underlying fundamentals taking us there. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Okay. So I just wanted to hammer home one thing that you said, you said you want sacrifice key investments for competing in the future in response to the market conditions. I get it and you're doing that. But as you balance, you have a lot of targets out there and I think we\u2019re probably all over-obsessed over each basis point on them. But as you balance to hitting the targets versus the necessary investments, can we just rewind and go through what you think those couple of key investments -- I know there's more than that, but key investments to make you as you said competitive in 2019 and beyond, what's going to drive growth? Mike Corbat : Sure. So if you go back and you look at the last page or so that John talked about, when you look at underlying growth in the business, if you look at -- John talked about the $9 billion of TTS revenue growing at 11%, we talked about Securities Services, the Private Bank lending, Mexico, US Branded Cards, equities, M&A, if you just take those revenues and add them up, you're in excess of 50% of the revenue of the firm. And those are -- if you look at the momentum in those businesses, it\u2019s clearly strong. And what we don\u2019t want to do is stop that investment or do anything that has the potential to derail the growth that in every way we\u2019ve worked so hard, so hard to build.  And so again, when you think about things that are top of list, clearly, the more broad investment in terms of digital, we talked about some of those cost saves that have begun to come through roughly the $200 million this year, manifesting itself in $500 million to $600 million incremental in each of the next two years, a lot of that savings is dependent upon the continued investment in terms of the switch from analog to digital, and in particular in parts of our consumer business, coming from behind and kind of getting cards back on track, the empty calories of cutting marketing investment in terms of our platforms there, the investments that we\u2019ve started and have been executing against in terms of Mexico. I think all of these things you\u2019re seeing good -- and we have a lot of confidence in those paybacks. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in our list of investments, Glenn that would surprise you. And obviously, as the environment evolves, we\u2019re going to continue to watch those very carefully. And if we start to gain some of those lower priority, we\u2019re certainly willing to pull back on those. But what I don\u2019t want to do is get loaded to the start-stop, it\u2019s so disruptive. That right now I just described an economy where we don\u2019t see the underlying fundamentals having significantly changed. We saw that in 2011, we saw that again coming out of 2015 into 2016, in each of those timeframes, we went back to have better growth in recessionary periods all the way. I can\u2019t say that\u2019s the point this time, but what I don\u2019t want to do is I don\u2019t want to sacrifice that momentum that we\u2019ve got going right now as we go into 2019. But if and when appropriate, we\u2019re going to pull the levers we need to pull. Mark Mason : I\u2019m not sure, if you mentioned TTS in particular as well in addition to those businesses. We\u2019re putting more investment into that business, building out the client experience, building out the platform. That\u2019s always a business that\u2019s a large growing part of our franchise and we want to maintain the competitive position we have there. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate all that, if I could two quick what I\u2019d call annoying questions that come up plenty. One is, your exposure in lending into the CLO market as a lender and just maybe talk about your positioning there and then what collateral, what LTVs and what protections you have in that world? And then also just anything you\u2019d say about size of Sears and why, just because one retailer goes out doesn\u2019t mean people stop paying their bills? Mike Corbat : So I\u2019ll start off on the leverage lending fee. So first, from a direct exposure perspective, we talked about our corporate loan being largely investment grade. And as of the end of 2018, our exposure both funded and unfunded was roughly about 83% investment grade. So less than about 20% is not rated investment grade and of that about 55% is funded. And of course, all of these exposures are subject to our risk appetite framework, and we feel really comfortable with that. So although leverage lending is not a material component of our overall lending business, we do, of course, participate in the space to serve our target clients in the ICG. And when we look at that, we would also have some exposure to leverage loans related to CLOs and there are two places where that exposure resides. So one is in our markets business, and the other is in our investment portfolio. So in both cases there are limits that are imposed on you exposure and our exposures are the core -- again are a core subject to our overall risk framework.  In our markets business, we serve as a warehouse lender and an underwriter for our CLO manager clients and we made markets for our investor clients in the secondary market for CLOs. I\u2019d make a couple of comments on the warehouse lending that we do, which is subject to an aggregate $5 billion exposure limit. First, there are some structural protections that are in place that have been enhanced since the crisis. Second, unlike the pre-crisis, our CLO primary syndicate does not retain any residual exposure post the issuance. And as I said, we do make markets for our investor clients in the secondary market, but that exposure is subject to a market risk RWA limit of about $1.5 billion.  So as far as our investment portfolio is concerned, the holdings are well diversified and represent exposure to about 75 unique CLOs. And those investments are limited to most senior tranches of the CLOs that are rated triple-A. There are also some restrictions in terms of structure. For example we only invest in CLOs which include performance triggers. And so net-net, we feel pretty good about our exposure. We're not heavy into leverage lending. If you look at some of the underwriting charts we write pretty low on those underwriting charts. And so we feel pretty good about where we stand at this point. Glenn Schorr : In terms of Sears? Mike Corbat : Sure. So in terms of Sears, as you know, we don't comment on retail partner financial conditions. But I guess what I will say, if you'll recall that last quarter we indicated an upfront impact under a full liquidation scenario for Sears that could be in the range of about $300 million. And that included certain accruals. The write-down of a portion of our related intangibles and the time and cost of migrating the cardholders to other Citi products. Today, we'd expect that that total impact would be more like $200 million. So the impact has declined due in part to an additional quarter of intangible amortization as well as a refinement to our original estimate.  By the way I'd point out that we booked a small reserve in the fourth quarter that's associated with certain contingent liabilities. But if Sears pursued a liquidation in the near term, you can think about the vast majority of this impact coming in the first half of 2019. And again much of the impact would have otherwise been recognized as ongoing amortization expense by the end of '19 anyway. So the net incremental impact would likely be less than the $100 million for the full year. And beyond that upfront impact and acceleration of store closures would likely have an impact on the Retail Services revenues, perhaps resulting to a flat top-line result in total for '19 and '20 given the expected impact of new account acquisitions. John Gerspach : And Glenn, just specific to your question in there, again we've talked about it before, but you've got a program card here where 70% of the volume on that card is out of store which is consistent with top of wallet. So this is not just an in-store product but it's a utility product for these people where they're using in broadly. So I think the access to that and the access to the credit and the top of wallet nature we take comfort in, in terms of people's desire to keep that outstanding. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have a question on efficiency and slide 17, and slide 17 showed an improving efficiency for the last two years. We can go back further and see improving efficiency. So, when we look at your efficiency business line by business by, it looks worse than peer. So, my question is, what else can you do to improve intensity of expense control? And I'm not talking about cutting CapEx or long-term investments. Mike, I heard what you said. You don't want to have stop-start, stop-start. But, what are you doing for travel, entertainment, Black Cards, Ubers, size of coffee cups, paper cups, the sort of tone at the top that says hey, we've made a lot of progress, but we still a long way to go. We don't always get that sense or I don't personally always get that sense that this is a firm that needs to better optimize notwithstanding how far you\u2019ve come. Mike Corbat : Mike, I think you've got to go back and put it in a little bit of context of history. Having gone through the crisis and the things that we needed to do, we cut back, we curtailed, we stopped a lot of those things and tightly monitored those things that you mentioned. So, it wasn't we came out of the crisis and everybody's flying around the world first class and staying in five-star hotels. We put in place, we maintain and monitor strict travel policies in terms of off-sites, in terms of all the spends that we have. We put them in place, we monitor and we continue to take efficiencies from those. So, it's not like they were there and in better times, they went away and we're putting them back. We obviously continue to monitor and push those. So, probably why you don't hear about and this is because they\u2019ve got put in place and we just continue to push them as opposed to putting new things on. But, in the environment as we sit, we're going to do the appropriate things of making sure that we continue to push ourselves on the expense front, at the same time knowing that we've got to create our own capacity to invest. So, we take it seriously, we take it with a sense of urgency. And as a firm, I would say, we're all over it. Mike Mayo : I have a follow-up then, maybe one for John and one for Mark. John, you have made progress but maybe not -- maybe you didn't get everything done that you wanted to get done. So, as you look at Citi, as you are about to leave, where do you see some possibilities that you didn't get exactly what you wanted? And then, Mark, what's the difference in your approach versus John and how you're going to look at things and some maybe nuance changes? John Gerspach : Mike, when you look at -- actually the answer to both the question you asked to Mike and to me, when you look at the efficiency by business, most of the work still has to get done in the consumer business. And if you look at where we need to focus, it certainly isn't in the cards business. I think you understand and we understand cards is already a very efficient business. You need to improve the efficiency in our retail business. And that's what a lot of the investments are focused on and that's where we also need to be able to grow our revenue. So, I'd say that that's a business that is going to need improvement going forward. And it's one that we highlighted when we laid out at Investor Day. So, again, that's where we're geared going forward. But that's -- it's the overall efficiency in the consumer business where we still have some work to do. I\u2019ll turn it over to Mark? Mark Mason : Yes. I guess, I'd say, one, I'd like to just echo the point that we are intensely focused on this. We're focused on not only the efficiency, but on delivering the return target that we set. And so, you've seen the numbers, we've gone from an 8.1 return on tangible common equity last year to a target of 10.5 this year to delivering a 10.9 this year as an actual number. And I recognize that that is still sort of where we've targeted for ourselves going forward. And I recognize we've got a 12% return on tangible common equity for 2019. But as both Mike and John have said, we're preparing for varying operating environments, and doing so in a way that we can ensure that we still hit that 12%. And that involves all of the line items. That involves what we can do to continue to realize the benefits and the momentum we're seeing in the strong parts of the franchise, many of which both Mike and John have gone through. It involves us delivering on the savings from productivity, the $500 million to $600 million that largely should offset the volume and compensation growth that we see in revenue growth going into \u201819. It involves continuing to manage the cost of credit. And we think the fourth quarter run -- the fourth quarter number is probably a good run rate looking into 2019. It involves continuing to manage the tax line. That number\u2019s come in better than what we expected when we talked about 2018 performance. And it involves managing the balance sheet. And again, as we grow -- as we saw the fourth quarter come down in revenues, we were able to bring our risk-weighted assets down as well. And so, my commitment is probably a lot simpler and that probably is a lot similar to what John's commitment and Mike's commitment has been, is my commitment is the execution of the strategy that we've talked about, delivering against the targets that we\u2019ve set, and building in the flexibility that allows for us to manage in uncertain environments. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I was trying to unpack some of the revenue guidance for 2019. And given some of the favorable guidance you gave on NII, up $2 billion year-on-year. It implies that you should be able to hit that 3% revenue growth call even with the income staying flattish in \u201819. I'm just wondering, is that the right way to interpret the guidance? And is that why you specifically mentioned the flattish fee income growth, almost at a floor for \u201819 and certainly you conveyed a very positive tone on your ability to hit that 3% target? Mark Mason : Yes. So, I'd say two things. One, you're spot on in terms of the NII and we feel like our ability to deliver on the $2 billion or so or similar performance from what we saw in 2018. And then, in terms of the noninterest revenue, as we mentioned, that was a decline this year. We would -- we should certainly see growth in the noninterest revenue this year. But, we do have to keep in mind that our reported growth for noninterest revenue will look a little bit lower than the underlying because of a number of one-timers including the wind down of legacy assets and things like the Hilton gain and the Visa B share gains et cetera. So, I think the way you can think about it is that the bulk of the reported growth that we'd expect to see next year would come in the NII line, but we would not see the decline in noninterest revenue and perhaps even see some upside there. Steven Chubak : Got it. Okay. And switching gears for a moment just to capital targets. We\u2019ve heard some recent rhetoric come out of the fed on capital rules and the SCB. And something that they\u2019ve made pretty clear and the word choice that they\u2019ve used is that the industry currently holds adequate levels of capital. So, it certainly suggests, rules are unlikely to get tougher from here. At the same time, it\u2019s less clear whether we\u2019re going to see meaningful relief either. And I\u2019m just wondering, based on your discussions with regulators, expectations for the SCB, whether your thinking has evolved on your long-term capital target and 11% to 11.5%? Do you still view that goal as being appropriate, based on your current vantage point? Mike Corbat : I think with the SCB getting pushed out to 2020, what we would say is, we\u2019ve covered it publicly about the 11.5. And I would say, based on what we know today, that continues to feel to be the right neighborhood for us. Obviously, as we go forward, we\u2019ll continue to refine that. But, I think, we\u2019re quite comfortable with the 11.5 today. John Gerspach : I think, the only thing I\u2019d add to Mike\u2019s comments is that that 11.5 that we laid out there, that that was never intended to be a bright line limit. And there\u2019s a great deal of variability and many of the components, some of the things that you just talked about that go into calculating, the CET1 ratio. So, we would expect to operate on an ongoing basis with the CET1 ratio in the range of 11.5%. So, in other words, we may periodically dip slightly below that 11.5% and that would still be okay. Steven Chubak : One final question for me. Just on noninterest bearing deposits, you reported another 5% drop off in those balances in 4Q. This appears to be more an industry-wide phenomenon. But, I was hoping, you could speak to which segment specifically are seeing the steepest declines. And maybe what\u2019s your expectation in terms of where that could bottom as a percentage of total deposits? John Gerspach : I\u2019m not going to give any guidance as to where it could bottom. But, what we have seen is most of that decline obviously is in U.S. retail, which is where the bulk of our noninterest bearing deposits are. And there what we\u2019ve seen is two things. We\u2019ve seen flows out of the noninterest bearing directly into interest bearing, and we\u2019ve also seen flows going into investment products. I\u2019d say that in -- especially in the second half of this year, we\u2019ve seen flows -- overall flows in our consumer retail deposits -- excluding commercial deposits that pretty much have normalized now. We\u2019re basically -- if you look -- if you could look underneath the numbers, U.S. retail consumer deposits are virtually flat from an end-of-period basis, end of 2017 to 2018. And that\u2019s -- again, we are getting a new money, most of the new money is coming into interest-bearing account CDs, but some is coming into the checking. We\u2019re continuing to grow our wealth management clients. We increased Citigold household by another 18% this year. And what that means, though, is that those clients are operating where we would expect those clients to operate, which is they\u2019re starting to move money into investments. But, we\u2019re retaining -- in the second half of the year, our retention rate on those flows into investment accounts improved to 75%. So, we think right now we\u2019re in a fairly good balance. But, you\u2019re still going to see a bit of a shift going forward from non-interest bearing into interest bearing. Mark Mason : Just keep in mind, our U.S. retail deposits are about $150 billion out of the $1 trillion of total deposits we have. Steven Chubak : Got it. Very helpful color. Thank you both. And John, congrats on retirement. John Gerspach : Thanks. Operator : Next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks Management. Marty Mosby : I had a few questions about just what you're seeing in these particular businesses. If you look at fixed income, the pullback in yield from when it hit highs kind of late summer into the fall, kind of throws all your yield investors off, because they finally started to see rates starting to pick up. And then, all of a sudden it just comes right back and they just get kind of frozen like I wish I would have bought yesterday kind of thing. How do you see that kind of evolving? Have you seen any of this? It kind falls over time because they have to kind of get back to, okay, well this is just where we're at, we can get higher rates. So, let's go ahead and start doing that. Was some of that part of what we saw in the fourth quarter and we've seen any signs of that change through the first quarter? Mike Corbat : Marty, the fourth quarter was one of those quarters where there was so much volatility. It's not necessarily whether interest rates are moving up or down. You can certainly get good client engagement and a lot of activity in either of those cases. It's where the market appears somewhat directionless or people aren't quite sure exactly how far something is going. So, this is this concept that people have talked about as being bad volatility. And that's really what we saw in the fourth quarter where the volatility was just so much that people didn't know when to jump in. And therefore they -- everybody just stayed on the sidelines. That\u2019s what we saw. And I commented when I spoke at the Goldman Conference. My comments there were about the lack of client engagement that we had begun to see in the G10 Rates area of our business. And that was one of the things that led us then to talk about trading revenues overall being down slightly year-over-year because we didn't see that good engagement in G10 rates. With December, we saw basically that extreme volatility given the overall lack of a view of where rates would finally bottom out just impact every one of our businesses in fixed income. And that's what really led to the change from being slightly down to where you see today where the combination of equities and FICC ended up being down 14%. But, most of that really was in fixed income. It was in the second half of the quarter and predominantly in December. Now, we have seen some improvement in trading conditions with volatility moderating and both equity and yield showing signs of stabilization early in January. But, it certainly is very early at this point in time. And, I would still say that market conditions have yet to fully recover. John Gerspach : And I think, look, Marty, what you saw in particular in the later stages of the fourth quarter and you could see it manifest when you look at fund returns for the quarter, where people went from in some cases having pretty reasonable years to actually having down years, we really saw kind of a mindset that manifested itself in similar ways for those people that managed to get there and be up. They wanted to protect their ups and weren't willing to necessarily be that active. And those that were down said I'm down, I don't want to risk being down further. And so, we really saw precipitous drop off in terms of client activity, as a result of that. Marty Mosby : That makes sense. And if you look at the debt underwriting, came in a little bit better. There's a lot of discussion about liquidity in the market beginning to pull back, but I guess rates coming down. So, I just kind of want to balance what you saw with the liquidity market versus with equity underwriting kind of having its trouble with the valuations coming down, maybe more were pouring into debt underwriting. But, I thought I did a little bit better. I just thought maybe there was a balance between the liquidity and the rates coming down and getting some deals done in the particular fourth quarter. Mike Corbat : Overall, Marty, debt underwriting, it may have been a little bit better than people were fearing, but it still was not exactly what I would call a strong environment by any stretch of the imagination. And even -- and that pretty much persisted almost throughout the year. Market wallets and debt capital market were pretty much down 29% during the quarter. So, again, maybe not as bad as people thought about, but it was still a pretty dramatic reduction. Equity markets were down; wallet was down about 36% in the quarter year-over-year and debt about 29%. So, yes, equities were down a little bit more than debt, but you're still talking about some pretty significant drop-offs in market wallets, fourth quarter \u201818 compared to fourth quarter 2017. Marty Mosby : Then, lastly, a more global question. If you look about and think about this where we're seeing valuations right now and particularly your valuation being below tangible book value, if we take -- let\u2019s say, you take off the table recession or not, because I think that is the biggest part of the question and assume, as you all kind of foreshadowed as well as our models foreshadow that we're not heading into that recession unless we talk ourselves into it. Then, it really becomes returns versus your cost of equity as long as you're being able to improve returns like you have, and I think we've kind of crossed that threshold of cost of equity, but just wanted to make sure where do you kind of peg that cost of equity. And do you see in your mind that you are kind of building that excess return? And if you're not going in a recession and you're generating excess returns, then a discount to tangible value is definitely not reasonable at this point. John Gerspach : Yes. We think we've clearly crossed that. So, it\u2019s the 10.9 that has been referenced, again call it a circa 10% cost of equity. So, we think we're above that; and clearly as we execute against the trajectory this year to 12, obviously clearly above that, and above 12, 13 plus and beyond. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Can I just ask one question on lending? It looks like you guys, like the industry, saw really good growth, especially on the North America side and in EMEA, especially in corporate banking, and it looks like some was in the markets business. Can you just give us some color on was that in your view just core underlying economic improvement, akin to like you talked about earlier? Was some of it related to the market disconnect and perhaps might be fleeting and kind of was on-balance sheet off-balance sheet? How would you just help us understand this big surge in corporate lending that you guys saw this quarter? John Gerspach : When you look at the corporate lending -- and corporate lending, I think it grew about 2% sequentially; it's about up 6% -- I'm talking about the average balances that we give you in the back of the earnings deck. And that loan growth was pretty much spread across various components. I'd say that overall there was still good corporate demand for loans. We saw a good corporate demand. It did range a little bit different by geography. And how we chose to address it, we had a lot of strong client demand in Asia, for instance. And yet if you look, you'll see that our Asia loans were actually down sequentially and year-over-year. And that's just because that demand was at spreads and we didn't feel were appropriate. And so, we just chose not to participate. Some of the things that we did do in our say TTS business is where we saw that the spreads didn't quite meet our hurdle rate, we still originated the loans but we originated them for distribution. So, again, pretty good demand. There is -- in the markets area that you mentioned, a lot of that growth is driven by some year-end Community Reinvestment Act lending. That's where we do -- that's the segment of the business where we do our Community Reinvestment Act. But, there's also an element of some residential warehouse lending that is in there that we would expect then to clear out sometime in the first quarter as securitizations are executed. Ken Usdin : Got it. And, John, just to follow-up, you mentioned some pockets where spreads are tight. How would you just characterize the overall commercial side, that lending environment out there? Is there an opportunity to take back some market share away from the non-bank segments that have been tougher the whole industry? I know you guys seeing some of those opportunities. John Gerspach : I'd say yes. But don't forget, I think a lot of those opportunities are going to be in what I would consider to be the small to medium type of operations. And we're not a big player in what we will consider to be the CCB business, the commercial aspect of it. We certainly are growing in that business. But, it's not a large enough segment for us that would necessarily drive a significant amount of loan growth in 2019. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. John, I can't believe we can't ask you questions on the call next quarter. John Gerspach : You can, I just won\u2019t to answer. Betsy Graseck : Terrible. Good luck and enjoy. We're going to miss you. John Gerspach : Yes. And I know you\u2019re going to like Mark a lot more. He's a lot more user friendly than I am, so. Betsy Graseck : I don't know. All right. I've enjoyed your non-user friendliness actually. Maybe we could just -- my last question for you here is around the outlook for the long-term RoTCE, and I know on this probably we\u2019ve spent a lot of time talking about the outlook and the flex points that we have for \u201819. And I am just thinking, as I -- because we do model out next several years, you've mentioned in the past year the 16% that you put out there a couple quarters ago with 14 plus 2 for tax reform. But maybe you could give us a sense of, are there -- is there anything incremental to how you think about what the drivers are of that 16% beyond what we discussed as drivers for the 12% for next year? John Gerspach : Well, I think Mark laid out a whole -- and I laid out some drivers and I think Mark commented on them earlier as well. But, again, we laid out that 16% of tax rates are finding our way to a lower effective tax rate than we had originally thought that we\u2019d be able to achieve. And I think that there\u2019s still some additional work that we can do there. But, outside of that -- it is going to come down to those core elements of improving that efficiency ratio, seeing better growth in the consumer business and the accrual businesses. You\u2019re already seeing that in the ICG. I just think about the net interest rate, the net interest revenue outlook that we just talked about, and all of the growth now that is coming out of those businesses, you\u2019ve seen the core accrual revenue grow $4 billion year-over-year. We talked about the fact that masking that has been some underlying impacts in that fee-driven revenue, the non-interest revenue that we think now we\u2019ve lapped. So, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything new that needs to be done in order to get to that 16%. And I think there\u2019s a whole series of opportunities that Mark and the team are going to continue to unearth. Betsy Graseck : One question there is on the provision line. And I know you indicated the 3.25, 5.25 range for the card. Does the comment around provision -- should I take away from that that you feel that you are at normalized provision levels for your book at this stage? John Gerspach : At this stage, we\u2019re at normalized provisions in consumer. I\u2019d say that 2018 was a bit of a great -- a very good year for corporate credit. Fourth quarter I think is probably more indicative of where you will see the lost -- the overall cost of credit for ICG. But we\u2019re certainly not looking at any sort of significant ramp-up in cost of credit over the next couple days. Other than as loan portfolios continue to grow and season, you\u2019re going to get some natural increase. But those loss rates, we feel pretty good about those loss rates. Betsy Graseck : And as you think about the segments and the geographies for hitting these targets into 2020 or long term, I call that like 2020 I guess. But, as you hit what you\u2019re looking for in the U.S. retail card, do you migrate more capital towards emerging markets, you migrate more capital to Mexico and Asia, which have been growing faster, or do you feel like this current mix is -- you can hit the 16% with the correct mix? Mark Mason : Yes. I think, when we put together the targets, it reflected where we thought we\u2019d see the opportunity, so continued momentum out of Mexico, momentum out of Asia albeit, as John has described, we\u2019re seeing some pressure in the retail banking part of the business, particularly invest in investments. And so, as you would imagine, we\u2019re constantly looking at the client demand that\u2019s out there juxtaposed against returns and growth opportunities and recalibrating and reallocating resources accordingly. But at this point in time, I\u2019d say that mix that we\u2019ve talked about then in terms of needing to close the gap on the consumer side and 100 basis points or so of improvement on the ICG side is still where we think things are heading. I guess the final point I\u2019d make on that as is as you saw in the fourth quarter, where we see pressure in the business I saw pressure in fixed income in particular, you'll see us manage the balance sheet. We\u2019ve brought risk-weighted assets down; we ended with the risk-weighted assets of a $1.170 trillion versus the $1.196 trillion last quarter. And in this case, you saw our CT1 ratio go up to 11.90. Betsy Graseck : Yes. I know we've get the VAR numbers in the 10-Q, 10-K. So, I assume we'll see some reflection of that there as well. Anything in rates in fixed income? I know we\u2019ve talked through a lot of high yield spread credit widening and how that's not really impacting you much. But, I was just wondering on a rate side, the volatility that existed in rates? John Gerspach : When you take a look at the decline in FICC revenues, most of it was centered in G10 Rates. So, that was a big driver of the year-over-year decline in FICC. When we look at it -- and you can see in the supplement, I think. When you look spread products year-over-year, we're off by 3%. Now, remember, we had a miserable fourth quarter last year in spread products. So, on a relative basis, it was kind of an easy comp. But, the bulk of the year-over-year decline is in rates and currencies, and within that most of the decline is centered in G10 Rates. Betsy Graseck : And there was that one-off that was reported post the Goldman Conference, but that was in your Goldman Conference comments I would think, right? John Gerspach : That was embedded in the guidance that that I gave at Goldman, absolutely. But, even with -- even taking that loss out, fixed income would still be down mid-teens year-over-year, and again, the loss really in G10 Rates. Betsy Graseck : So, then, last is just -- I got a question this morning on the PG&E utility company that suggested that they might be reporting bankruptcy this year or filing for bankruptcy this week. You have some exposure to them. Could just talk us through how you deal with those kind of events? I know we\u2019ve talked through Sears earlier. John Gerspach : Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't comment specifically on any client. But, in general, we have a very strict risk appetite framework that we apply. You see that reflected in the overall statistics for our corporate book which is in excess of 80% investment grade. So, any exposure that we would have to any type of company that you're reading about is certainly going to be manageable. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Well, John, it's been great working with you; and Mark, looking forward to it. Thank you. John Gerspach : Thanks, Betsy. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : A quick question on the tax rate. When you gave the updated guidance at the end of \u201818, you had said that the 2020 was expected to be effectively lower than what it was in 2019, even though tax rates down, were at 24% and less than 24%. Does that same relationship hold even though you've dropped down the tax rate guidance? So now you're at 23% for \u201819. Are you still expecting \u201820 to be below 23%? John Gerspach : Well, let's leave it at least equal to that 23% for \u201819 until we're ready to come out with anything further. But, again, as we indicated in the guidance, we do think that there are opportunities that we have to go lower than the 23%. We're not prepared to give guidance on that yet. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. And then the other question was on your 2020 targets, you have that 3% revenue CAGR kind of embedded in there to get to those targets. But since you missed revenue growth this year, you\u2019re really kind of looking at now in the 4% [ph] in the next two years to still stay at a 3% for the full time period. So, is that kind of how you\u2019re thinking about it and how dependent is hitting those 2020 targets on revenue growth alone? Mike Corbat : So, when you look at that, as we've described that at Investor Day, Brian, we talked about a number of levers, right, that it was the combination of single-digit revenue growth, good expense discipline, reasonable cost to credit, and obviously significant capital return. And so, we've talked about the leverage here as we went through. One is obviously the revenue momentum that's going on in parts of our businesses, the more annuity like. We spoke to the expense saves, so, the 200 manifesting itself to 500 to 600 and then another 500 to 600. Earlier on in the year, John had talked about that we're actually outperforming on the expense front and we could get incremental couple of hundred million dollars of expense saves that would come through. Obviously, we talked about the legacy assets piece, we talked about FDIC surcharge, we talked about the tax rate. And again, we feel confident -- again, don't have scenarios or anything yet, but feel good about capital returns. And as we look to the future, 11.9 down to 11.5 and the combination of earnings, DTA utilization which we don't talk about much more but it's there and it's reasonably significant and obviously continuing to close that gap between 11.9 and 11.5 or wherever that number is. So, we think we've got a number of levers that we can pull as we go forward. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Just one last one. You said that you're expecting -- I guess that it is pure rate hikes in \u201819 versus \u201818. So, how do you think about deposit betas if there are less rate hikes? Thanks. John Gerspach : Well, the deposit betas are likely -- certainly on the retail side, they're likely to continue to increase into \u201819 even if there are no further rate hikes. In our plans, we're assuming that there's one rate hike in \u201819 but we still are assuming that there's going to be some increase in retail deposit betas. And if we look back at the last time rates increased, deposit betas -- retail deposit betas continued to increase for some time after the last rate increase. We have seen stabilization on the betas on the corporate deposits. And so, there may be some continued pressure upward there but much less so. To the extent there's going to be any I think large moves in beta, it'll be on the retail side. And that's again baked into all the guidance that we've given. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi. Good morning. Couple of quick ones hopefully. First, more of a geography question on the FDI surcharge benefit of about 140, 150 million. How is that distributed between the North American consumer and ICG? Is it there\u2019s a vast majority of it in North American consumer, is there a portion also migrating to ICG? John Gerspach : No. Actually that -- the 140 is not separately isolated within our -- the overall FDIC assessment that we get. So, apportion that out as we do with all the other aspects of the FDIC assessment. And it goes to -- it goes globally to all of our businesses around the world. So, if you want to think about it, it's actually two-thirds of the overall FDIC assessment ends up in ICG and only one-third in consumer. So, it would be less than a third of that benefit that shows up in U.S. consumer. Saul Martinez : Okay. So, it\u2019s allocated roughly in line with the overall distribution of deposits essentially? John Gerspach : No, it's actually allocated based upon a much more complicated formula than that, because it's not deposits that give rise to the assessment. There's a whole series of other risk indicators that actually drive your assessment. And so, we actually apportion that assessment among the businesses based upon their contribution to the risk factors that go into the assessment calculation itself. Saul Martinez : Okay, got it. That's helpful. And secondly, I guess a much broader question. Any updated thoughts on the political dynamics in Mexico? It does seem like there's been at least a bit more recent movement by the government to engage with the banking system in a more constructive way. I'm just curious if you guys sense that. And just your overall level of optimism that maybe things aren't necessarily getting better from a political standpoint, but at the very least, there's no signs of deterioration in terms of the policy landscape? Mike Corbat : Yes. So, we're early, right? We've -- President has been in office since December 1. I think he and his team continue to find their feet. And I think what you're referencing most recently was that they've kind of come out and they've been very clear in terms of wanting to become more inclusive in terms of banking. But in there, they've involved the finance ministry, they involved the local bank and banking associations in terms of I think working quite consciously and artfully to craft that message in a constructive way. So, it's early, but I would say that the interactions that we've seen have been positive. And I think the underlying piece of that is we've -- as was referencing some of the conversations before, we've got it, environment there right now, where we've got consumer sentiment really at or near all-time highs. And so, you've got an engaged consumer. And I think they're very mindful to try and want to keep that consumer engaged. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, everyone. Can you share with us, John? You touched on how the growth in TTS this quarter was due to wider spreads and also higher volumes and transactions? If you had to rank the three reasons why you had the better growth year-over-year, which one of those contributes to most of that growth? John Gerspach : They all contribute. And it's -- I'm trying to rank them. And I think it's actually -- it's the volumes that are driving things more than anything else. The deposit volumes and the transaction volumes would be the ones that are driving it. Rates is having an impact, but it's really the volumes that we're seeing in the deposit growth as well as the transaction volumes that are driving the revenues. And those transaction volumes are -- there's spread between things like commercial cars, just the traditional interaction that we've got on moving cash, but there's a whole series of working capital solutions that we're rolling out. So, that's one of the reasons why we feel really good about the long-term growth prospects of TTS, because again, it's not just being driven by one specific thing that if that stops, suddenly all the air goes out of the balloon. It\u2019s really a business that is multifaceted growth engines at this point in time. Gerard Cassidy : And, John, how is -- I mean, you\u2019ve got such a global footprint here in this area, new business or new client growth. Is that a contributor each year as well that actually moves the dial or is it just a steady at 1% to 3% or 4% new customer growth? John Gerspach : No. No, no, no. There\u2019s just definitely -- I don\u2019t have the number in my head, but we don\u2019t have a 100% penetration on our corporate client base with TTS. As strange as that may be, as good as we are, we don\u2019t have a 100%. So, we have the ability to introduce that TTS product set into new clients every year, and we are doing it. And then, once you\u2019re into new clients, what you\u2019re likely to get is, you get one of their regions or maybe several of their countries. And therefore, there\u2019s the ability then to grow into multiple countries, multiple regions, and it\u2019s been -- a lot of that is what has fueled the volume growth in TTS. I think, overall, Gerard, we\u2019ve got like something like a low-double-digit market share in TTS, maybe it\u2019s 10% or 11%. Whatever it is, it\u2019s relatively small. And there still is a sizable growth opportunity in TTS. Mark Mason : And, John, to your point, it\u2019s not just growing with new multi-national clients, but also with smaller clients that are looking to go global. And given the breadth of our franchise, we\u2019re positioned to take advantage of both of those opportunities and serve both types of those clients. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And shifting gears with you guys. Can you give us any color on investment banking pipelines? Obviously, we know what happened in the fourth quarter in December in particular. What are you guys expecting or seeing for the upcoming quarter in those pipelines? John Gerspach : Pipeline remains, I\u2019d say very, very strong, and client dialogue remains strong. And we\u2019ve got a very healthy backlog going into 2019. We just need the right environment to execute it. Gerard Cassidy : Right. Okay. And John, certainly back to your comments on the G10 Rates business, how it really fell off. When you look at it by customer segment that you trade with, was it more of the market traders, many hedge funds, or was it loan-onlys or sovereign wealth funds? Who really sort of fall off the most from your customer standpoint? John Gerspach : Early in the quarter, I\u2019d say, it was fairly concentrated and little more in the investor clients. But as the quarter proceeded, we saw both investor and corporate clients move to the sidelines. Gerard Cassidy : I see, very good. And echoing others, we\u2019re going to really miss your candor and frankness. And good luck in those retirement years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Sorry to prolong this but I actually had a question. Thank you so much for all the guidance that you\u2019ve already given us on the revenue outlook and expenses. And I heard you loud and clear, John that the efficiency improvement in \u201819 will be wider than the 90 basis points that we saw in \u201818. Assuming that low-50 sort of starts at 53% and it\u2019s top of the range for 2020. I\u2019m wondering, is the improvement in efficiency in \u201819 going to be about equal to \u201820 or is it going to be accelerating improvement into 2020 sort of like you\u2019re implying with what has happened in \u201818 and \u201819 if that question is clear? Mark Mason : It's going to be accelerating. This is Mark. It's going to be accelerating into 2020. Erika Najarian : Okay. And one more -- go ahead, John. Mark Mason : If you look there what we just talked about from the expense side of things, we talked about a recognition of 200 this year going to 500, 600 next year of going to an incremental 500 or 600 in \u201820. So, as the investment spend comes to maturity, our ability to accelerate on the expense side manifests itself. Erika Najarian : Got it. Most investors -- just a quick follow-up question are investing -- are expecting that the Fed will not raise rates anymore in 2019. Given the different tailwinds that you noted for net interest revenues, I'm wondering what the downside risk is to that $2 billion in growth if the Fed's last rate hike was December? John Gerspach : Go ahead, Mark. Mark Mason : Yes. This is Mark. So, I mean, look, in the past, in 2017, we talked about roughly $100 million benefit per quarter for 25 basis-point Fed rate hike. And if you think about for the most recent rate hike in 2018, we're only assuming a benefit of about $55 million a quarter. And so, my point in that and all of this is consistent with our U.S. dollar IRE disclosures in the K and Q. We're not heavily dependent on this midyear 2019 hike in order to deliver on our outlook for 2019. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Al Alevizakos with HSBC. Al Alevizakos : Thank you for taking my question. So you mentioned during the presentation that Asian wealth management was one of the weak areas in the quarter. That doesn't really strike me as a surprise. However, I would like to know what do you think is happening and what is your outlook for 2019? And was the weakness just because of AUM or was it something else as well? And then, secondly, just want to confirm on your comment on equities excluding the one-off loss that you had previously. Were the revenues down year-on-year? Because you mentioned, [indiscernible] was offset by weaker prime brokerage? Thank you very much. John Gerspach : Let's take the second one first on the equities. Yes, excluding that the one loss that we talked about last year would still be, as I said down slightly year-over-year. So, think it slightly as being something in the single digit, low-single digits mid-single digits type of range. And so, does that get you where you need to go on the equities? And that is yes. Al Alevizakos : Yes. John Gerspach : Okay. And then, when you think about Asia, when we look at Asia, it really is just that runoff investment revenues. And we generate -- I think I mentioned this on last quarter's call, one of the things that we're trying to rebalance in Asia is that a lot of our investment sales generate revenues on the front end as opposed to being continuing fees as the investment keeps ongoing. So, to the extent we get periods like this where there is investors are not moving money into new investments, it hurts us on the fee line. Now, we're converting more of those investment products in Asia into more backend loaded, more consistency fees. We can get away from this frontloaded concept front loaded concept, but we haven't done that as yet. So, that certainly is one of the things that is going on. And we have seen, consistent with some of the things I talked about with the trading; we have seen some pick up in investment sales in early January. But, again, it's early and certainly not back to where we want it to be. Al Alevizakos : Thank you for that. Could we say that the performance in the U.S. wealth management was particularly different in the fourth quarter compared to Asia? John Gerspach : Well, Asia, it\u2019s a much bigger wealth management business in Asia. That's a business that we've been developing for several years now. The U.S., we're really only into maybe the second, maybe it's 2.5 years of really focusing on wealth management. So, I think that you see similar results but it's just the U.S. business is relatively small at this point in time. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks. Sorry to holding up longer. A couple of questions. The decline in risk-weighted assets from -- was that all from trading? And if the markets do recover, should we expect that to go back up? John Gerspach : It's primarily concentrated in credit risk assets. The bulk of it would be in the markets businesses. But, it's fairly widespread across ICG. And it depends on when the markets and when the sentiment comes up and then what else -- where else we -- how else we deploy our capital. But, if you look, you'll see that there's some variability I'll call it in our risk-weighted assets. And that's pretty much just dependent on client needs and customer demands. Vivek Juneja : Right, okay. Because you are a regular market maker, so I would expect that if things do come back, you would be very much there in part of it. John Gerspach : Absolutely, absolutely. Vivek Juneja : Second one, little one which is what is the dollar amount of your wealth management revenues in Asia in 4Q \u201818 and what was it in 4Q \u201917? Because you gave us the last 12 months, but it's hard to get a real sense of what the revenues actual work did in year-on-year -- without the actual number for the quarter. John Gerspach : Vivek, I don't have that number in front of me. I\u2019ll have to -- Susan will have to get back to you with something, if it\u2019s there. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And lastly LatAm consumer, what do you need to do to get back to positive operating leverage year-on-year, which wasn't the case this quarter? John Gerspach : Taking a look at operating leverage quarter-to-quarter that's\u2026 Vivek Juneja : No. Year-on-year -- yes. John Gerspach : I think if you take a look at it on a full-year basis, that\u2019s a much better gauge of what you're doing in a business because you're going to have quarters like this where you have a slight decline in the retail revenues. So, I would look at the business on a full-year basis. And we've been pretty consistent with positive operating leverage coming out of Mexico in particular and we would expect to have positive operating leverage in Mexico in 2019 as well. So, it's a one quarter. Vivek Juneja : But if I look at, John, full-year \u201818 ex the gain on the sale of asset management business, is it essentially revenue growth and expense growth or -- given your rounded numbers in constant dollars are essentially the same, so that would say no positive offering leverage? John Gerspach : Well, based on the fact that we knew that that gain was coming and so we paced our investment spending to take advantage of the fact that we had the gain. And so, for the full-year, we were still managing to positive operating leverage. Just as I'm sure that you'd want us, if we knew that there was a large loss coming and your expectation would be that we would manage those expenses down somewhat in order to produce a better efficiency ratio and the operating leverage ratio, right? Vivek Juneja : Okay. All right. Thank you. And good luck, John. John Gerspach : Thanks a lot, Vivek. Operator : There are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks? Susan Kendall : Thank you all for spending the time with us this morning. As always, if there are follow-up questions, please reach out to me and my team in Investor Relations. Thank you.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Susan Kendall, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks. At which time, you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Kendall, you may begin. Susan Kendall : Thank you, Natalia. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we\u2019ll be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I would like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results in capital and other financial condition may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Susan, and good morning, everyone. This morning we reported earnings of $4.7 billion for the first quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $1.87 are up 11% from a year ago. We continued to make progress against our financial targets and strategic priorities; first, in regards to improving our return on capital, our return on tangible common equity rose to 11.9% up 50 basis points from a year ago. We had positive operating leverage and improved our efficiency for the tenth straight quarter and we had strong growth in both loans and deposits in our core businesses. In our global consumer bank, we had underlying revenue growth and positive operating leverage in every region, excluding the Hilton gain last year, total revenues grew 4% on flat expenses. We grow our operating margin by 8% and credit costs remain broadly in line with our expectations driving double digit EBIT growth. In North America, we saw strong underlying growth of 5% in our Branded Cards portfolio, and 3% growth in retail services. We saw deposit growth in retail banking and introduced new products to support our branch light digital heavy strategy in the U.S. In Mexico, we had 5% underlying growth, and while Asia grew at a slower rate due to a very strong prior year, investment revenues, loan and deposit growth remain solid. Our institutional clients group also performed well. In our steady accrual type businesses such as Treasury and Trade solutions and Security Services, overall revenues were up 7% in constant dollars. We also had a 20% increase in investment banking where we have steadily been gaining share among our target clients. Fixed income did rebound from the fourth quarter with modest year-over-year growth while equities was impacted by a weaker environment. We continued to execute against our second goal in regards to returning -- to improving the return of capital to our shareholders. During the quarter, we returned over $5 billion in the form of buybacks and dividends. We repurchased 66 million common shares in the quarter, and have reduced our shares outstanding by 9% from a year ago. We believe, we're on track to reach the commitment we made at investor day of returning at least 60 billion to our shareholders over the three CCAR cycles ending next year subject of course to regulatory approval. We recently completed our 2018, 2019 CCAR submission to the Federal Reserve, which is the third tranche of that commitment. When we entered the year, we talked about the need for us to be flexible to meet a range of operating environments, given the way 2018 ended. We have multiple leverage at our disposal, including expenses, balance sheet and continued credit discipline. I think we use them correctly, and now the environment seems to be normalizing. While GDP growth does appear to be slowing somewhat, we still see good consumer and corporate engagement. We'll continue to focus on serving our clients and finding opportunities to deepen our relationships across our consumer and institutional businesses and we remain committed to executing our strategy and to meeting our financial targets. As you know, we pride ourselves on having a deep bench, and last week we called on that depth when we selected new leadership who helped drive our firm forward in light of Jamie Forese's retirement. After, Ybarra, Carey Lathrop, Andy Morton, Mary McNiff, and Jessica Russ [ph] all have decades of experience at our firm. I also think the change at the top is healthy and creates opportunities to do things differently and shows that we take our talent and succession planning seriously. Now I'll turn it over to Mark, then we'd be happy to take your questions. Mark? Mark Mason : Thank you Mike, and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.7 billion in the first quarter grew 2% from last year, as a reduction in expenses, and a lower tax rate more than offset lower revenues as well as higher credit costs. EPS grew 11% including the impact of a 9% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. Revenues of $18.6 billion declined 2% from the prior year and were down 1% excluding $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio last year, primarily reflecting lower equity markets revenues, and mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio, along with the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate/Other. Expenses declined by 3% year-over-year as continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets, resulting in our 10th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage, and cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning while overall credit quality remained stable. Our return on assets was 98 basis points for the quarter and RoTCE improved to 11.9%. Our effective tax rate was 21% for the quarter, below our full year outlook reflecting a discrete item related to tax reform, as well as a small benefit associated with stock based incentive compensation. The lower tax rate resulted in a benefit of about $0.04 per share this quarter. We expect to be closer to our 23% tax rate outlook for the remainder of the year. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $682 billion as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by wind down -- by the wind down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 5% to over $1 trillion. Turning now to each business, Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer banking in constant dollars. Excluding the previously mentioned gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses remained flat; resulting in positive operating leverage and an 8% improvement in operating margin, and pre-tax earnings grew 11%. Slide 5 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year, excluding the Hilton gain. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion grew 1% year-over-year. Mortgage revenues stabilized sequentially, but declined again year-over-year mostly reflecting lower origination activity, and higher funding costs. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 2% driven by modest deposit growth and spread expansion. Average deposits increased 1% year-over-year reflecting growth in both brands based deposits as well as through digital channels. And looking at deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew balance of 3% from last year, excluding the impact of market movements. Turning to Branded Cards; revenues grew 5% excluding the Hilton gain. Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7% year-over-year excluding Hilton. And we continued to generate growth in interest earning balance this quarter, up about 9% year-over-year. This growth and interest earning balances drove an improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans for NIR percent to 912 basis points this quarter. Looking forward, the NIR percent should decline seasonally from the first quarter to the second quarter. And for the full year, we continue to expect spreads to remain at a level similar to, or perhaps slightly higher than the fourth quarter of last year. Average loan growth of 1% was somewhat muted this quarter, but I would note that the first quarter of 2018 represented the peak level of promotional balances last year. Since that time, we have optimized our mix of interest earning, to non-interest earning balances, while continuing to drive account growth, and we expect loan growth to revert to more recent levels starting in the second quarter. Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 3% driven by organic loan growth, as well as the impact of the L.L. Bean portfolio acquisition. Total expenses for North America Consumer were up 1% year-over-year as higher volume related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings. We continue to drive transaction volumes for lower cost channels, and digital engagement remains strong with 12% growth in mobile users year-over-year. Turning to credit, net credit losses grew by 10% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth, and seasoning in both CCAR's portfolios. Consistent with the pattern seen in prior years, we expect card NCL rates in the first half of the year to be higher than the second half of the year. Our NCL rate and U.S. Branded Cards was 326 basis points in the first quarter in line with our full year outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 300 basis points to 325 basis points. And in retail services, our NCL rate was 536 basis points, which is also consistent with our full year outlook for an NCL rate in the range of 500 basis points to 525 basis points. During the quarter, we continue to enhance our digital capabilities and launch new products to lay the foundation for a more integrated multi product relationship model. We simplified our deposit account opening process for both new customers, and existing cardholders, and at the same time successfully launched a new digital savings product, targeted to cut to customers outside our core retail markets. Looking across all deposit products, we have already been -- we have already seen digital deposit sales in the first quarter of 2019 that are roughly equal to all of last year. More than two thirds of the new accounts from digital channels are new to our retail banks and more than half or outside of our branch footprint. We also launched a new digital lending product, Flex loan that allows eligible cardholders to convert a portion of their credit line into a fixed rate personal loan, leveraging our experience in Asia. And we will continue to launch new products and relationship based offers in the second quarter, that leverage our proprietary ThankYou and Double Cash rewards, across both card and deposit products. This will also initially be targeted to eligible card customers outside our core retail markets. So while many of these initiatives are still new, we feel good about our progress today. On Slide 6, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. First quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 3%. In Latin America, total consumer revenues grew 6% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year. The impact was a net benefit in the first quarter as we recorded a small residual gain on the sale, partially offset by the absence of related revenues. Retail loan growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, driven by a slowdown in activity in our commercial banking franchise, where client sentiment has become more cautious under the new administration. While consumer confidence remains quite strong in Mexico this quarter, we have begun to see a slowdown in GDP growth and overall industry lending volumes. And while a slowdown in GDP is not unusual in a post-election year, we are watching the economy closely. Importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen this quarter in our strong EBIT growth. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 1% year-over-year in the first quarter as growth in deposit, lending and insurance revenues was largely offset by lower investment revenues. While investment revenues remained under pressure in the first quarter, we continued to see positive flow into assets under management, as well as 10% year-over-year growth in Citigold clients. And our revenue comparisons should become easier from here as investment revenues peak last year in the first quarter. Excluding investment revenues, our underlying Asia consumer growth remains broadly in line with our medium term expectations. In total, operating expenses were down 1% for the first quarter as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume driven growth. And cost of credit declined 4% reflecting a modest reserve release this quarter compared to a modest build in the prior year. Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remains broadly favorable again this quarter, with stable delinquency trends across regions. In North America, the NCL rate increased sequentially, mostly reflecting seasonality in parts. And in Mexico, the NCL rate reflects continued seasoning in the cards portfolio as well as the impact of lower overall volume growth. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion declined 2% in the first quarter, as strengthened TTS and investment banking was more than offset by weakness in equities, as well as the impact of $230 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened throughout the quarter. Total banking revenues of $5.2 billion grew 8%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported, and 10% in constant dollars reflecting higher volumes and improved deposit and trade spreads. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 20% from last year, outperforming the market wallet driven by strength in M&A and investment grade debt underwriting. Private Bank revenues of $880 million declined 3% versus a strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower managed investment revenues as well as higher funding cost, and corporate lending revenues of $569 million were up 9% reflecting growth in volumes and spreads. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion declined 6% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $3.5 billion grew 1% year-over-year as strengthened rates and spread products was partially offset by weakness in FX given the low currency volatility seen this quarter while corporate client activity remained stable. Equities revenues were down 24% versus a particularly strong quarter in the prior year reflecting lower market volumes and client financing balances. And finally, in securities services, revenues were flat on a reported basis but up 5% in constant dollars driven by growth in client volumes and higher interest revenue. Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion decline 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments and volume driven growth, and cost of credit was $21 million this quarter driven by portfolio growth, partially offset by loan specific reserve releases. Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 41 basis points. And the addition to non-accrual this quarter did not negatively impact our cost of credit as these loans were covered by previously established reserves. Slide 9 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $431 million declined 27% from last year, and expenses were down 26% mostly reflecting the wind down of legacy assets. And the pre-tax loss was $93 million this quarter, in line with our outlook. Looking ahead, we continue to expect a modest pre-tax quarterly loss in Corporate/Other for the remainder of 2019. Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.8 billion this quarter grew by roughly $860 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge. These results included a modest drag from the lower trading related, net interest revenue and the continued wind down of legacy assets. As we had anticipated, the drag from these items was far less material this quarter than it had been a year ago. And in total, these revenues now comprise less than 5% of our total net interest revenue. Therefore, we believe it is most relevant to look at our net interest revenue and net interest margin trends on a consolidated basis going forward. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $240 million reflecting two fewer days in the quarter. And our NIM expanded by 1 basis point reflecting higher rates and improved loan mix. On a full year basis, we continue to expect to generate at least $2 billion of growth and net interest revenue year-over-year. We are no longer assuming a midyear rate increase in 2019, but the expected benefit from the rate hike had been relatively small at less than $100 million of incremental revenue. In the first quarter, the year-over-year growth in net interest revenue was more than offset by a decline in non-interest revenue. However, this decline in non-interest revenue was mostly driven by the $150 million Hilton gain in the prior year, a $250 million year-over-year drag from the mark-to-market losses on loan hedges and the comparison to a very strong prior year in equities. We also saw a small residual drag on non-interest revenue from the wind down of legacy assets, but less than we've seen in prior years. On a full year basis, we continue to expect total non-interest revenue to come in at least flat to the prior year. On Slide 11, we show our key capital metrics. In the first quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 7% year-over-year to $65.55 driven by lower share count. And our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $5.1 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends. Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few moments on our outlook. We continue to prepare for a range of operating environments with a focus on achieving our full year RoTCE target of 12% for 2019. For the full year, we continue to expect modest revenue growth, flattish expenses, and higher but manageable cost of credit, combined with continued balance sheet and capital optimization to drive improved returns for our shareholders. Looking to the second quarter, we expect to return to year-over-year revenue growth. We face fewer headwinds in areas like Asia consumer, equities and the private bank, which presented difficult comparisons for us this quarter. And the underlying growth in North America consumer should be more evident as we move as we move beyond the impact of the Hilton portfolio sale. For the second quarter in ICG, in fixed income in equity markets, given the slower start to the year, we do not expect to see the same magnitude of seasonal decline in revenues we typically see from the first quarter to the second quarter. Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but given the strength of our performance in the prior year, we expect to be somewhat down year-over-year. And we expect continued year-over-year growth in our core businesses, across TTS, security services, corporate lending and the private bank as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network. On the consumer side, in North America we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth with U.S. Branded Cards now on a solid path. In Asia, year-over-year revenue growth should improve as we continue to grow our core businesses and we face less of a headwind from investment revenues. And in Mexico, year-over-year revenue growth will likely be muted given strong growth and performance in the second quarter of last year, although we expect continued growth in pre-tax earnings. For total Citigroup, we expect expenses in the second quarter to be roughly flattish to last year. And cost of credit should continue to reflect loan growth and normal portfolio seasoning. In addition, we look forward to receiving our CCAR results late in the second quarter. At Investor Day, we stated our goal of returning at least $60 billion of capital to shareholders as part of the 2017, 2018 and 2019 CCAR process. And subject to regulatory approval, we remain on track to deliver on this goal. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Good morning, thanks. Mark, I wanted to ask you about the efficiency improvement that you're looking for this quarter. Looks like the efficiency ratio improved 90 basis points year-over-year, but extra helped in look closer to 140 basis points. I guess is that 140 basis points more of what you're looking for this year in terms of efficiency better than you did last year, and what are the key drivers of that? Mark Mason : Yes. So thank you Don, and good to talk to you. I guess, I'd say we are certainly pleased with the expense levels we were able to deliver against this quarter. We came into the year on the heels of a fourth quarter that was obviously under a lot of revenue pressure. And so we wanted to be thoughtful about managing all the levers that we had in Q1 and in fact that is what we've -- what we've done. For the full year as I mentioned, we are looking for some top line revenue growth for total Citi and expenses that would be roughly flattish to what we'd seen in the prior year. That will obviously result in improved operating efficiency versus last year, but probably equally important, certainly equally important, we are managing those other levers whether it be the cost of credit or capital to ensure that we\u2019re getting to that RoTCE of 12%, and that would stay on our trajectory to get to 13.5 plus in the outer years. What's involved with that to the other part of your question is continued momentum, continued growth in the accrual businesses that we have that I mentioned earlier, TTS Security Services, Private Bank et cetera, continued strength in our consumer franchise which grew globally at 4% this year, but U.S. Branded Cards ex Hilton grew 5%. We expect that growth to continue, and continue strengthening NIR line percentage for the Branded Cards business. And a continue normalization or stable market more broadly that should hopefully bode well for our markets business. So, those are kind of the drivers on the top line. On the expense line, we will as mentioned last quarter, see the benefit of our productivity outweigh the investments that we\u2019re making and that should generate another $500 to $600 million over the course of 2019, that will be available to either fund expenses related to volume growth and certainly contribute to the overall performance metrics that we mentioned. And so, those items as well as the results coming out of CCAR and what that means for capital will be important levers that get us to the returns and get us to the results in operating efficiency. John McDonald : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. Just as a follow-up. It looks like the average deposits in North America, consumer showed a pickup in a better trend this quarter. What\u2019s driving that improvement in your view? And could you remind us more broadly of your strategy to grow U.S. retail deposits and why you feel comfortable doing so despite a smaller physical footprint? Mark Mason : Sure. So, we grew the deposits, U.S. retail deposits by about 1%. We got about $180 billion of deposits, about 30 or so are commercial deposits, the balance are consumer related deposits. We saw a very good growth through our digital channel. So digital generated deposits on the heels of really executing against the strategy that we talked about. And so, we have a relatively small footprint with 689 or so branches. That said, we\u2019ve got access to over 65,000 ATMs, and we\u2019ve got a very very large our U.S. cards portfolio. And our strategy as you know is a client led revenue growth strategy where we are looking to take advantage of the large customer base we have in cards and through enhance digital capabilities offer them value propositions that adhere to what the most responsive to. And so what we saw in the quarter and this growth with a comb -- and this deposit growth was a combination of getting good traction with our digital platform and with our customers both new to bank customers, but also existing branch customers and with some of our cards customers. We\u2019ll continue to roll out new products in the second quarter. We\u2019ve rolled out Flex loan this quarter. We rollout additional products in the second quarter around ThankYou and Double Cash rewards. I mean, again those will involve value propositions that we think will appeal to our clients in driving broader penetration of their wallets and a deeper customer relationship. John McDonald : Great. Thank you. Mike Corbat : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. So, I think both growth in the consumer side in Mexico and Asia are below where your goals were. It does sound like you felt good about Asia getting better. But I heard your comments on Mexico looking at slower GDP growth and worse loan trend. So, what do you look for there? And more importantly what can you do if the just general macro backdrop in Mexico is little slower. What\u2019s the goal there? Do you power through and grow the underlying franchise or you cut back to manage profitability? Mike Corbat : I think Glenn, what we\u2019ve talked about and I think what Mark pointed out in his remarks is we think we\u2019ve got the ability to manage the cost lines there and to manage both EBIT growth as well as returns. So, I think we\u2019ve talked about some of the investment we've made there. I think we\u2019re starting to see the ability to pull the levers on positive operating leverage and sustainability of that, at the same time through some of the other things, we\u2019ve done optimization et cetera not only drive EBITDA, drive net income, but also drive returns. So I think if we saw growth rates continue to slow a bit, I think we\u2019ve got the ability to manage through that and continue to still get the growth we want there at the bottom line in returns. Glenn Schorr : Okay. And if I could follow-up on John's and your answer on his card question; offering card customers tailored rewards to bring in banking business, happen to be a big fan of that, but I think it's getting a little active where you and a couple other big players are doing that. Can you drill down little bit more of what exactly you\u2019re offering? Is it in motion right now? And is it too early to talk about initial results? Mike Corbat : Well, I think it\u2019s too early to talk about results, because we\u2019re really kind of just at the stage of launch. But if you think, Glenn, about what we have that makes us a bit unique. I\u2019m going to leave some of our partner, a retail service relationships aside, but we effectively have 28 million people in the United States that carry Citi Plastic in somewhere between ThankYou, Double Cash, a value proposition that clearly people bought into. So as we go into these markets non-core. When we go outside of our six, we don't go in on a de novo basis. We go in already having established Citi customers in those areas. We know who they are. We know what they spend on. We know who their bank is, right. We\u2019ve seen their payments come in, if it's not us. And we think we've got the ability around our value proposition to target them offers which has the ability -- gives us the ability to compete on something other than rate. So, I think we feel excited about it. You'll see us out in the market in Q2 with that. And so I think it\u2019s early to tell. But the early test and things we've done we\u2019re excited about it. Glenn Schorr : All right. Thanks very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Maybe just, Mark, quick question on rate sensitivity. I think you guys have been much less sensitive to long as the curve both positively or negatively than your peers. Can you kind of I guess two question on that. I guess, could you discuss the risk of a rate cut given your short end sensitivity? And I guess secondly how you think about your positioning here. Is there any opportunities or risks in this \u2013 that the flatter curve is here for a while? Mark Mason : Sure. So, I guess I\u2019d make a couple of comments. One, just as it relates to what we forecasted for 2019 and I mentioned it in my remarks. In that we had originally forecasted one rate hike of about 25 basis points in the second half of the year. That one rate hike essentially equated to about $100 million of revenue. And so, not a material impact, we\u2019ve taken that out of our forecast now as I sit here and talk to you about the outlook. But not a material impact to the revenue forecast that we have for 2019. And similarly if there were -- we continued over time to kind of take down our ROE exposure and we certainly have done that and continue to do that through this quarter. If we were to look at a rate cut, we kind of looked at our exposure there and a rate cut would be somewhere around $50 million for the quarter, or $35 million to $50 million for the quarter. And so, not a material impact of a rate cut either. And so, we feel -- we obviously -- if rate remain flat or a declined for an extended period of time, we obviously will manage and look at the balance sheet very carefully and thoughtfully there. But we feel good about where we stand today as it relates to the rate environment. Jim Mitchell : Yes. That\u2019s very helpful. And then when we think about your 2 billion plus for the year, I guess what scenario drives the plus. Is it just loan growth or is there some other aspects of the market that can help? Mark Mason : Yes. I mean, it\u2019s largely one to be loan growth and not a volume we're able to capture there. But we continue to feel very good about the $2 billion NIR forecast that net interest revenue forecast that we talked about. And we think that the continued momentum that we see in Branded Cards and other parts of the portfolio will allow for us to deliver against that, so remain on target for that. We did $860 million in Q1, its roughly 8% more than the prior year and so we feel good about that momentum. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Mark Mason : The other component would be mix. So, loan growth and mix would be the other component that would be an important driver there. That is to say consumer versus corporate growth that type of mix. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Maybe just one follow-up on Asia consumer accounts both card and retail banking accounts have been -- were pretty flat. Is there an opportunity to grow that from here? What sort of the strategy needed to grow accounts? Or is it just more of a mature mark \u2013 more mature market? Mark Mason : Yes. I\u2019ll make two points on Asia consumer. One, we did see good growth with our Citigold, customers about 10% growth in Citigold accounts. And then two, we\u2019d see -- we saw a good growth as it relates to investment AUMs adjusted from market movements, so good momentum there as well. And so, we think we\u2019re showing good sign for when that market does return in terms of the broader market activity to capture some of that upside given the account growth and given the investment AUMs we\u2019ve been growing. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. I was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit on the management turnover. I think its three of the top five people that presented at Investor Day have retired. And I\u2019m not looking for a meaningful change in the strategy but are there kind of changes around the edge in terms of execution and just elaborate a bit on not just some of the senior people living in the company? Mike Corbat : Sure, Matt. I think if you look back and kind of go back through the years, really not just since I've been \u2013 became CEO in 2012, but actually if we go back to the senior leadership levels of the firm there is I think by any standards it\u2019s been pretty remarkable stability. And if you look at the retirements that we announced in the fall or Jamie's retirement, in most cases all 30-year plus veterans not only of the industry but almost in every case, most cases are firm. And so below that as you can imagine we\u2019ve over the years built equally strong and robust bench. And so while I hate to see people move on. At the same time in Jamie\u2019s case, Jamie is been a terrific partner, friend. If you look at the other success we've had in ICG, he's obviously been the leader of that and I think done a nice job of building that. But I think a lot of the credit also as he would give, goes to the team below in terms of what they've done. So I think in the sense since we\u2019re excited about the people I talked about in my opening remarks of having been at the firm for quite a while and having their shot at putting their fingerprint on the business. And I think if you look at the underlying growth, the market share gains, the customer feedback we get from many of the surveys that obviously goes as great as he is beyond one person in the organization. And so they're excited. We\u2019re excited. I\u2019m excited to have them at my table and the things that we can do to continue to grow the business going forward. Matt O'Connor: And if I recall correctly, I don't think you appointed a new President and I\u2019m wondering if you do intend to do that and if it would come from someone internally or potentially some of the externally? Thank you. Mike Corbat : I have no plans to do that as of now. Matt O'Connor: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Mike Corbat : Hi, Mike. Mike Mayo : So what are your RoTCE an efficiency target for 2019 and 2020? That really just kind of where you\u2019re guiding us. I think consensus is really backed off some of the targets you had last year. So let\u2019s start with RoTCE. You reiterated a 12% target for 2019. That\u2019s clear. And then at the September presentation from last year you said 13.5% for 2020 and Mark today you said the outer years, again consensus does not expect this, but are you still looking for 13.5% for 2020 and if not what do you\u2019re looking for? Mark Mason : Yes. So let me be clear and I apologize if I misstated something. So, for 2019 the RoTCE target is 12%. For 2020 the RoTCE target is 13.5 plus percent. Mike Mayo : Okay. Well, there seems like disconnect between consensus than what you're guiding, so I guess there\u2019s some skepticism. And maybe one reason for skepticism is on the efficiency. And I appreciate that efficiency is a means to an end, that is, your goal is to improve the returns, get it. But that September presentation last year, you highlighted efficiency improving from 57% in 2018 to 53% in 2020 with a 175 basis point improvement in 2019 and 225 basis point improvement in 2020, and you might pull back a little bit from that on the fourth quarter earnings, I\u2019m not sure, but what is your efficiency target now for the firm? And if you can give any color on GCB and ICT, that would be great too? Mike Corbat : So, I\u2019ll make a couple of statements. One is longer-term we're still remain committed to getting to the low 50s from an operating efficiency point of view. We believe the investments that we\u2019ve made, the productivity that we\u2019re expecting will allow for us to get that -- to get there over time. The target that you referenced for 2019 and 2020 are certainly target that we have and that we\u2019ve said and constructed the plans based on presented those. I will tell you as you witnessed at the heel -- on the heels of 2018, and frankly as we continue to go through the balance of 2019 that we\u2019re going to pull whatever levers we need to pull to get to the return targets that we set. While at the same time trying to protect investments that are critically important to the growth of the franchise, and that's an important -- that's an important trade-off that that we have to do, that we have to make and we've done it in the past, we did it in Q4 and we\u2019ll continue to do it. So, I'm not moving away from those targets. What I'm doing is I'm recognizing and hopefully others are recognizing that their multiple levers that can be pulled, that we\u2019ve got a long-term objective of delivering shareholder value and we don't want to make short-term decisions that compromise our ability to do that. Mike Mayo : So, with a chance to kind of clear the deck a little bit, so -- again consensus does not assume you're going to get that 53% efficiency ratio next year. You talked about not relying on one additional rate increase. You want to protect the critical investments. So, do you want to give us any guidance for efficiency improvement in 2019 and 2020? Mark Mason : Yes. I\u2019m not giving any additional guidance at this point in time beyond what\u2019s out there. Mike Mayo : And then my follow-up \u2013 that\u2019s fine. I understood. And then my follow-up, Mike, back in 2013 you gave a target to improve the ROA to 90 to 110 basis points. And I think if you adjust for taxes you still might not be in that range. So I think some of the frustration reflect in the valuation and the stock is some missed financial target. Can you give some sort of context to the missed financial target whether that one or some of the efficiency guidance that was given over the last few years. Why they weren\u2019t met and why you can maybe make your targets now at least for RoTCE? Thanks. That's my last question. Mark Mason : Sure. So Mike on the ROA, we\u2019ve talked about this on these calls in different forms before and that is if you look at what's happened from a capital perspective and a capital optimization perspective, our binding constraint today and probably has been for a bit and will likely to be into the future is around standardized stressed based capital. And what we\u2019ve talked about from a balance sheet or from an RWA optimization is making sure that we\u2019re using the balance sheet in a way that is accretive to our shareholders. And so, the example I gave which remains the case today and I think witness in our numbers for the quarter that we had outperformance in terms of our rates and in terms of our spread product. Those are accretive businesses to our shareholders. And rather than choose to optimize our balance sheet simply based on a blunt number of assets -- of the assets over earnings to actually look at the capital and the optimization of return and that's what we've done. And I think we\u2019ve talked about that. We tried to be transparent with that. I think in the numbers you see in terms of RWA usage and allocation we\u2019ve tried to stay mindful to that which we think is clearly the best outcome. Mike Mayo : Can I squeeze one last short question? Mark Mason : Sure. Mike Mayo : Without the efficiently target do you think you can comment to show better efficiency this year next in each region in GCB as you showed at this quarter and the ICG? Is that too much of an ask or is that something that's achievable? Mike Corbat : I think it's achievable. I'm not going to commit here because again I don't know what the environment brings, and simply rather say that we\u2019re committing to positive operating leverage in every region, every business, I would just go back to Mark's point that we understand how it plays in the math. We\u2019re committed to getting the company into the low 50s. I think as you\u2019ve seen our ability to drive leading performance in terms of operating efficiency, but if it comes down to the choice of not being able to make an investment in an area that we view as critical or accretive or something its offering real opportunity versus hitting the target I think our shareholders have been very clear certainly to me and to Mark that they would want us to make that investment. So, here Mike, I won't commit to that. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, guys. Good morning. I want to follow up on the RoTCE question. Obviously the Street is well below your guidance for this year and especially for 2020. And I'm sure you look at analyst estimates and your IR team looks at analyst estimates in terms of where they're at. I mean, where do you think there is the most go for outperformance? Where do you guys differ you think in terms of what your expectations are versus where you think Street is? Mark Mason : Yes. There\u2019s some difference as it relates to revenue. There\u2019s some revenue difference. There\u2019s some cost-to-credit difference when you kind of look at analyst expectations versus where we are. We -- our cost-to-credit estimates are lower than that of the Street. And then obviously we have read 11.9 of a CET1 ratio going down to the 11.5 at the end of the year. And so what we do with capital is another assumption that\u2019s in there. I think the tax rate certainly, we came in lower this quarter, but we talked about that being at about 23% for the full year. So most of the differential I think is going to be a little bit on the top line in the cost-to-credit as well. And then the rest of it I think is pretty much there. We talked about plans, expense which I think people have fixed upon. Saul Martinez : Yes. So there\u2019s a little bit on the revenue side and you\u2019re building in a lot less normalization in terms of credit cost than maybe one must have? Mark Mason : I kind of feel like we're looking at a normalized view of it. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. If I could change gears then on retail banking earnings, income from continuing operation this quarter I believe was 80 \u2013 in the 80 something million this quarter. You\u2019re far below what its been in the recent past. And I guess a couple questions. First, is there anything idiosyncratic in that number? And two, I get that you\u2019ve highlighted some of the new initiatives and that builds [ph] will take time to kind of play out in filtering the numbers. But any sense of when you start to -- when you think that'll start to actually filter into the results and you'll start to see better results in retail banking? Mike Corbat : So, retail banking for North America, we started to see I think some good growth this quarter particularly if you exclude mortgages. So, we think that that will continue to play out. As I mentioned we\u2019re seeing deposit growth there that's going to help on the revenue line and we expect that to continue as we execute against that strategy. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything in particular in the way of expenses except, what I would say is that the productivity that we\u2019ve talked about is going to start and will continue to play out through the balance of the year, and so that's going to help when you look at kind of the retail banking profitability in the outer quarters. On that we start to see the productivity, savings outweigh, the investments that we've been making across that franch or that piece of the franchise. So combination of continued revenue growth, continued expense improvement on the heels of productivity saves should help drive improved performance there. Saul Martinez : Was there anything unusual in the line item this quarter? The 83 million of operating earnings is been running about 130 to 160 in recent quarters? Or is that just \u2013 was it just the tough quarter? Mark Mason : Not that I can -- well, we made \u2013 we\u2019ve talk about the investments that we\u2019ve been making. So we \u2013 the digital investments that we\u2019ve been making in the platform, I mean, those are things that would be playing out through Q1, and again, somewhat back loaded in terms of the productivity save that start to play out in the balance of the year. Saul Martinez : Okay. Got it. Thank you. Mark Mason : I guess the other think I\u2019d mentioned is and I mentioned this at our conference I did in March which is that, as we came into the year and again on the heels of the fourth quarter what we saw material softness in revenue, we wanted to be very thoughtful about the 2019 plans and we did take an opportunity in Q1 to pull forward some of our restructuring decisions if you will, or reorganization decisions. And so, while we don't break the item out, there\u2019s probably some repositioning dollars inside Q1 for retail banking in particular that is driving that 83 that you see in the quarter. Again, you'll see the benefits of that start to play out in outer quarter, so the investments and some repo spending. Saul Martinez : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, just a follow-up there. You had a really good start year-over-year on the expense side. And then you mentioning flattish on the second quarter which should be up a touch from the first even though history which show first quarter often is the peak for the year just given the way you guys accrue in the institutional businesses. So, could you just talk through, is it perhaps just more of a better aspiration on the revenue side. Why don\u2019t you expect flat year-over-year given the point you just made about having perhaps a little restructuring under there and then the better start already that you had in the first quarter of the year? Mark Mason : Yes. So, to be clear we do expect to see revenue growth through the balance of the year, and so that obviously will drive some expense dollars with that. We still expect that the absolute dollar of expenses will be higher in the first half versus the second half of 2019, but on a year-over-year basis you could see some growth in the second half resulting in an aggregate 2018 to 2019 that\u2019s flattish on the expenses. Ken Usdin : Okay, Got it. And on credit you talked about being inside the bands for your expected card losses and also that first half will similarly also be higher than second there. Just want to ask you anything you're seeing in the consumer side outside of normal seasoning that would change your views one way or the other as far as credit card specifically and loss trajectories going forward? Thanks. Mike Corbat : Sure. No. there\u2019s nothing. We look at a whole host of metrics as you would imagine whether it stays delinquent or NIM pay and all of those important metrics and we\u2019re not seeing any signs of significant concern or a concern as it relates to the portfolio. You referenced exactly what I think the numbers reflect which is seasoning that and seasonality that\u2019s kind of playing out even when you look at the chart on slide seven that if you look at North America that bump on the 260 to the 297, one, there\u2019s a single name kind of commercial credit in there that\u2019s driving probably four basis points and the rest is really just tied to the seasonality that you can see in prior year quarters, even in Latin America, its less of a of an increase in NCL dollars and more a byproduct of lower volumes and the denominator there. And so, the answer is no, we\u2019re not seeing any particular signs around consumer or credit concerns and I extrapolate that to more broadly to suggest that is the case for institutional as well. Ken Usdin : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, Good morning. Mike Corbat : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I wanted to touch base on an announcement that you made at the end of March that had to deal with Citi building out digital consumer payments platform. And I know we talked earlier in the call about the issuer side, but I think this is more on the merchant side. And then I just want to understand what your expectations are for the TAM that you're looking at? What your market share improvement is? Do you think you can get with this over time? And do you feel that this would also bleed into opportunity on issuance as you deliver more services to your clients, maybe just spent a little time on that? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. So I think if you look at what's going on in the payment space, I think we\u2019ve seen a lot \u2013 we\u2019ve had a lot more engagement from our business customers of wanting to create a direct C2B channel. And so, I think some people look at this different ways to different merchant acquiring models. But I think the way they we\u2019re set up and we work closely with MasterCard and others is really kind of create that channel where our consumers have the ability directly through our pipes to create payments in there and I think in some ways that play to our strength that plays a little bit to our uniqueness of the things that we do. And so we\u2019re excited about that. I think if you look at the pace of payments that\u2019s kind of going in that direction, obviously picking up. And I think importantly both the business expectation and the consumer expectation is that that channel if it doesn't exist needs to exist. So, early stages, but again based on the on the pipes and the things we've had both in the consumer side as well as from the ICG side we think we\u2019ve got the connectivity. And I think unlike others we\u2019re actually leading this from the ICG or the TTS side in our firm. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Maybe we could broaden it out a little bit to talk about the B2B platform that you\u2019re working on as well the cross-border payments in general or we\u2019re hearing from some other institutions as well that there is a lot of interest in developing direct merchant-to-merchant or corporate-to-corporate B2B payment cross-border at T and I'm wondering where you are with your offering there and is it something that you focus on building out or not? Mark Mason : Well, I would start out, Betsy, I think that\u2019s a business were in, right, that\u2019s when you look at our TTS business historically the TTS portion of that has been predominantly has been B2B. We\u2019ve seen the growth rates that we\u2019ve had there. I think you\u2019ve seen this kind of not only operating with Fortune 5000 to Fortune 5000 but also working down and what John would historically kind of talk about what TTS is in terms of treasury management supply chain, cash, working capital, I think all of those. And so I think that's what you describe is the area where I think we've seen a lot of our penetration and growth coming from over the past couple years and it's obviously, an area that we\u2019re continue to stay focused on. Operator : Your next is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. I just had one follow-up question. Mark, in terms of the guidance for growth for NIR, is it based off of the 46 million in NIR that you presented in slide 10. I\u2019m just remembering from previous quarter that you talked about core accrual net interest revenue which would be I think based on the fourth quarter slides, a base of 44 billion? Mark Mason : Yes. The 2 billion was based on total NIR. Erika Najarian : Okay. Terrific. Thank you. Mark Mason : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. Mark Mason : Hi, Steven. Steven Chubak : So, I wanted to start off with the question on the capital targets. You noted the commitment to achieving the RoTCE goals for 2019 and 2020s, so that certainly quite encouraging. I was hoping if you can remind us just what the underlying CET1 or capital target that's contemplated as part of those goals. And maybe any update in terms of the sensitivity to those goals? Have capital targets have actually increased under the SCB? Mark Mason : Sure. So again our goal or our target I should say from CET1 ratio point of view is 11.5% and that 11.5% is comprised of CET1 minimum capital requirement of 4.5%. We have a GSIB surcharge of about 3% and we have an estimate for SCB of about 3% as well. And then as a management buffer that we\u2019ve added in there of 1% which is really designed to cover variability in various elements of the capital requirements. So that gets us to the 11.5%. We\u2019ve obviously been running at 11.9% in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter. The fourth quarter will inform what we\u2019re able to request and therefore hopefully get approved from a regulatory CCAR point of view. But that gives us another 40 basis points above our target to absorb a worse scenario if that were the case or to request more capital, should that be an opportunity that we that we deem or think make sense. I think as it relates to -- there really is a lot of new information as it relates to the SCB proposal. And so I think the last that's been out there from a news point of view has been in 2020. We get some guidance for 2020. We don't have any additional guidance or direction around that. What's going to drive our ability to return capital in the future will be the combination of how much net income we\u2019re able to generate to common. The utilization of our DTA, or disallowed DTA, today our disallowed DTA is about $11 billion. We've been using somewhere between 1 billion and 1.3 billion on an annual basis. I\u2019d expect that it still be the case. So the combination of those two things combined with what we're seeing in the way of growth in our business and/or opportunities that we think makes sense to invest will get us to kind of a core number in terms of what would be available for us to return to shareholders. And so we think we\u2019re well positioned with the 11.5% and we've made our submission and we\u2019re looking forward to regulatory approval sometime in the second quarter \u2013 at the end of the second quarter. Steven Chubak : Thanks Mark for all that. Helpful color there. And then just one follow-up from me on CECL, at 2017 Investor Day you guided to $1.5 billion to $2 billion pretax impact. You\u2019re quite brave being so early in giving that guidance. I\u2019m wondering now that we have better visibility into the accounting rule as whether you can give us updated targets on the CECL reserve impact. Whether you're still comfortable with that initial guidance of 1.5 to 2? Mark Mason : Sure. Thank you. So you\u2019re absolutely right. We have previously indicated that we expect the impact of CECL versus our current reserves to be on the upper end of the 10% to 20% range. We have been as you would imagine spending a lot of \u2013 we been spending a lot of time on finalizing our CECL models, working through assumptions, in many instances receiving clarification from regulators and other standard setters. And at this stage we believe the outcome could be a little bit higher than that range, so potentially 20% to 30% primarily driven by credit cards. But keep in mind even if or even at a 30% level the incremental impact to regulatory capital is manageable. So that be left in about 30 basis points of CET1 capital and then in addition we benefit from the regulatory capital phasing over four years. Steven Chubak : Got it. Thanks for taking my questions, Mark. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Mark and good morning Mike. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, can you share with us, you just gave us a good detail of the amount of money that may be available each year to give back to shareholders through net income as well as the DTA. How much of net income do you guys think you're going to need to support the organic growth of the organization on a go-forward basis? Mark Mason : How much -- how much net income? Gerard Cassidy : Yes. How much of the \u2013 if we assume that you could theoretically give back 100% of income every year, but obviously you want to support your growth and you're going to need to retain some of it. Do you have an idea of how much of it you would need to keep each year to support that organic growth? Mark Mason : Yes. So I mean, look obviously since we've been running at CET1 ratios going back as high as 12% or so, we've been able to return more capital and have a payout ratio that was north of the -- north of what the net income is that we've been able to generate. I would imagine as we get closer to the 11.5% and considering your point around investing in the business through either balance sheet, which would impact the RWA or the expense line itself. I would still imagine we'd have a payout ratio that was considerably high. It wouldn't be 100% but it'd likely be consistent with what we see with peers in the industry. So I'm not -- I'm not prepared to give you an actual percentage payout ratio post 2020, but I'd say it'd be pretty high, and certainly consistent with what peers are paying out. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then circling back up on CECL into your comments that you just made, do you guys think you'll give to us the investors by the end of the year some color on what the -- everyone has been very good at the day one reserve build, which you just gave us or built refined for us today. But any thoughts about what the day two, the loan loss provision number could look like on a quarterly basis going forward versus what you're going to report in 2019 under the old methodology? Mike Corbat : Yes. So I guess what I'd say to that is, we if you think about our plan if you will, our forecast and what's out there, from an adoption of CECL point of view, we've contemplated that in our 2020 plan and the return targets. And while we continue to refine the analysis around CECL and an impact, we don't we don't expect a material impact on our EBIT or our returns. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Your final question is from the line of our Al Alevizakos with HBC. Al Alevizakos : Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking my question. It's regarding the fixed income performance. I just was surprised by it because it was too strong. I think given the market backdrop. I just wanted to get a bit of clarity between the different regions what kind of performance did you see in the U.S. versus Asia or Europe? Thank you. Mike Corbat : Yes. So our fixed income revenues grew 1% versus the prior year. And you know what we really saw was a normalization of rate in credit markets at the turn of the year coming out of the fourth quarter and the dislocation that was there within fixed income results. Our G10 rate outperformed, driven really by strong client activity in North America. We did see a pickup in or an uptick I should say in corporate hedging deals on the back of strong DCM activity. And in EMEA, the results included increased revenue on structured note issuances as well as investors kind of sought out additional yield. This was offset by the weakness I mentioned earlier in FX given the declining currency volatility. But, as you mentioned, strong perform -- or solid performance I should say in fixed income also aided by solid results and spread products with strong performance in the flow credit products, and we also had a strong quarter in commodities particularly in EMEA driven by good client activity in oils and metals. Al Alevizakos : Great. Mike Corbat : A good mix of North America performance and EMEA performance. Al Alevizakos : Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions. Susan Kendall : Great. Thank you all for joining us this morning. And if you have any follow up questions, please feel free to reach out to investor relations. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today, we are joined by Citi's Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Interim Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first; then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results and capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported earnings of $4.8 billion for the second quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $1.95 were 20% higher than one year ago. We increased our return on assets year-over-year to 97 basis points and generated a return on tangible common equity of 11.9% over 100 basis points better than last year. We delivered positive operating leverage for the 11th straight quarter and improved our efficiency, while again growing loans and deposits. These results stem from strong execution of our strategy across our lines of business and show the benefits of our global franchise and product mix. Global Consumer Banking saw a 4% revenue growth overall in constant dollars with the contribution from every region. In North America, that was led by continued strong performance in branded cards, and again, we saw encouraging momentum in deposit growth, which accelerated from the first quarter; and internationally, net income was up 25%. In Mexico, performance was driven by good underlying revenue growth, expense management, and credit discipline. In Asia, higher deposit revenues and the recovery in investment revenues drove growth in the region. In our Institutional Clients Group, we delivered continued growth overall in our steadier transaction and accrual-type businesses showing the strength of our global client network, while we saw pressure in our market-sensitive businesses reflecting the broader industry even in products like Investment Banking, where we continued to gain share. During the quarter, we received a non-objection from the Federal Reserve for our 2019 CCAR submission. That means we will meet the goal set at Investor Day to return at least $60 billion in capital over three CCAR cycles. Our $21.5 billion capital return will increase the three-year total to $62.3 billion and includes raising our dividend to $0.51 and continuing to buy back shares of common stock at roughly the same level as last year's plans. These buybacks have reduced our common shares outstanding by over 10% in the last year alone and helped drive our tangible book value per share up 10% over that same time period. Given the current environment and market conditions, we'll stay flexible with a focus on making steady progress towards our financial targets through client led growth and research discipline, including balance sheet, credit, and expenses. As we look to the second half, we'll continue to take a close look at our capacity to make sure that we're rightsized for the operating environment. However, we won't change our commitment to safety and soundness and to making investments necessary to strengthen our infrastructure and control environment. Client engagement remained strong, and we continue to enhance our capabilities to serve our clients the way they want to be served across our network. That said, there remains uncertainty with respect to the economic market and rate environment, but as we think -- I think, we've shown that our franchise can manage through these by focusing on the things that we can control. I'll now turn it over to Mark and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Mark? Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide three, net income of $4.8 billion in the second quarter grew 7% from last year, including a roughly $350 million pre-tax gain on our investment in Tradeweb, which benefited EPS by $0.12 per share. Excluding the gain, EPS of $1.83 grew by 12%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding as well as a lower tax rate. Revenues of $18.8 billion grew 2% from the prior year, reflecting the Tradeweb gain, as well as solid results in consumer and overall growth in our accrual businesses in ICG. However, this growth was partially offset by lower market-sensitive revenues in ICG as well as mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our Corporate Lending portfolio. Expenses declined 2% year-over-year as volume growth along with continued investments in the franchise were more than offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets, resulting in our 11th consecutive quarter of positive operating leverage. And cost of credit increased, driven by volume growth and seasoning as well as a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio while overall credit quality remained stable. Our return on assets was 97 basis points for the quarter, and we generated an RoTCE of 11.9%. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 22%, slightly better than our outlook. We expect our tax rate to be between 22% and 23% for the back half of the year. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 3% year-over-year to $689 billion, as 4% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 5% with contribution from both our consumer and institutional franchises. Looking at results for the first half of 2019, we saw continued momentum in consumer, as well as the accrual businesses in ICG, which helped to offset the headwinds of lower market-sensitive revenues, along with the continued wind-down of legacy assets. And while we did benefit from the Tradeweb gain, this was largely offset by the impact of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges in our Corporate Lending portfolio. We delivered positive operating leverage with a 3% decline in expenses. EPS grew by 15% and our RoTCE was 11.9% for the first half. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. The consumer business showed continued momentum in the second quarter. Revenues grew 4% with contribution from all regions while expenses were up 1% driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings. For the first half of the year, excluding the Hilton gain last year, we generated 4% consumer revenue growth on flat expenses resulting in 8% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in net income. Slide 5 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 3% from last year. During the quarter, we continued to enhance our digital capabilities and launched new products to lay the foundation for a more integrated, multi-product relationship model. Our deposit momentum continued to improve as net deposit inflows in the first half of 2019 more than doubled compared with last year. We are growing deposits with both new and existing retail bank customers in and out of our branch footprint and through both digital and traditional channels. In digital, we further enhanced our account opening process and launched new products designed to deepen our client relationships, including relationship-based offers that leverage our proprietary banking and double cash rewards across both card and deposit products. We generated more than $1 billion in digital deposit sales in the second quarter, bringing our total for the first half to over $2 billion. Nearly two-thirds of these deposit sales were outside of our existing branch footprint and [Audio Gap] with card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us. Results from our new digital lending product Flex Loan also continue to be positive, following its launch in January, as loan originations more than tripled from the first to the second quarter, while maintaining a strong credit profile. And we will continue to roll out new features and products in the second half of the year. So again, while many of these initiatives are still new, we feel good about our progress. Turning now to the results of the individual businesses. Retail banking revenues of $1.4 billion were roughly flat year-over-year. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues grew 1% as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was partially offset by lower deposit spreads in commercial banking. Average deposit growth accelerated to 2% year-over-year. And looking at deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew customer balances by 4%. Mortgage revenues were largely stable again this quarter on a sequential basis, but declined year-over-year mostly reflecting higher funding cost. Turning to branded cards. Revenues of $2.2 billion grew 7% year-over-year. Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 8% and we continue to generate growth in interest-earning balances this quarter up about 10%. This growth in interest earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans or NIR percent to 896 points this quarter. Looking forward, we would expect to remain broadly around this level of spreads, as we look to maintain our current mix of interest earning to non-interest-earning balances. Average loan growth improved to 2% this quarter, as we saw a smaller drag from promotional balances in the prior year. And we expect loan growth to continue to improve as we go into the back half of the year. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.6 billion grew 1%, driven by loan growth partially offset by higher contractual partner payments. Total expenses for North America consumer were up 2% year-over-year as higher volume-related expenses and investments were largely offset by efficiency savings. Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 12% year-over-year reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. Card NCL rates were essentially flat quarter-over-quarter and consistent with the pattern seen in prior years, we expect card NCL rates in the second half of the year to be lower than the first half of the year. Our performance year-to-date is in line with our full NCL rate outlook for both branded cards and retail services at 300 to 325 basis points and 500 to 525 basis points respectively. On slide 6, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Second quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%. In Latin America total consumer revenues grew 3% or 5% on an underlying basis excluding the impact of the sale of our asset management business last year. Loan and deposit growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter reflecting the current environment where we are seeing a deceleration in GDP growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes. But importantly, we're managing expense carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 5% year-over-year in the second quarter or 3% excluding a onetime gain, mostly driven by higher deposit revenues as well as a recovery in investment revenues. We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 10% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year. In total, operating expenses were down 1% in the second quarter, as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume-driven growth and cost of credit was down 3% reflecting a smaller LLR build relative to the prior year. Slide 7 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit continued to be favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across the regions. Turning now to the institutional clients group on slide 8, revenues of $9.7 billion were roughly flat in the second quarter and down 3% excluding the Tradeweb gain, as continued momentum in the accrual businesses was more than offset by lower market-sensitive revenues and the negative impact from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads further tightened in the quarter. Total banking revenues of $5.1 billion were down 1%. Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 4% as reported and 7% in constant dollars with growth in deposits, transaction volumes and trade spreads reflecting continued strong client engagement. Investment Banking revenues of $1.3 billion declined 10% from last year, while outperforming the market wallet. The decline was primarily driven by a strong prior year performance in M&A, partially offset by continued strength in debt underwriting. Private Bank revenues of $866 million were up 2%, reflecting growth with both new and existing clients, which drove higher lending, deposits, and AUM volumes, partially offset by spread compression. And Corporate Lending revenues of $538 million were down 9%, reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging cost. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.7 billion were down 4% from last year, excluding the Tradeweb gain, as growth in Securities Services was more than offset by the decline in our markets businesses where the environment has been challenging and investor client activity has remained muted. Excluding Tradeweb, Fixed Income revenues declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting the challenging trading environment particularly in rates. Equities revenues were down 9% reflecting lower client activity in cash equities and prime brokerage, partially offset by strong corporate client activity in derivatives. And Security Services revenues were up 3% on a reported basis and 7% in constant dollars, reflecting higher rates as well as higher client activity. Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion declined 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investments in volume-driven growth. And cost of credit was $103 million this quarter, reflecting a normalization in credit trends in our corporate loan portfolio. Credit quality remained stable and total non-accrual loans declined both sequential -- sequentially and on a year-over-year basis. Looking at the first half of the year in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid contributions from our growing higher returning network businesses, most notably TTS and Securities Services, were largely offset by the decline in our market-sensitive business. We're focused on continuing to build upon the strength that we're seeing in our network businesses by making it easier for our large multi-national clients to do more business around the world. We are investing in technology to further digitize and improve our on-boarding processes, enhance our client-facing platforms, and roll out new capabilities across the franchise as we support the growth in cross-border flows that we are seeing with our multi-national clients, and we have a strong pipeline of initiatives going forward. Slide 9 shows results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $532 million increased 1% from last year, as higher treasury revenues and gains were largely offset by the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses were down 20%, mostly reflecting the wind-down and the pretax income was $73 million this quarter, somewhat better than our prior outlook. Looking ahead, we would still expect a modest pretax quarterly loss in Corporate/Other for the remainder of 2019. Slide 10 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of nearly $12 billion this quarter grew by roughly $450 million year-over-year, reflecting higher rates, loan growth and a favorable loan mix, as well as higher trading-related NIR, along with the absence of the FDIC surcharge. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue grew by roughly $230 million, largely reflecting higher trading-related NIR, along with one additional day in the quarter. However, net interest margin declined five basis points sequentially, as the benefit of our revenues was more than offset by higher cash balances, reflecting strong deposit growth in the quarter. In the first half of 2019, our net interest revenue grew by 6%, or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars. Looking ahead to the remainder of the year, as a reminder, when we set our NIR outlook for 2019 back in January, we were assuming one U.S. rate increase in mid-2019, but the expected benefit of the rate hike had been relatively small. As of last quarter, we had taken that rate hike out of our assumptions. And now we recognize that we may begin to see rate cuts as early as later this month, but keep in mind that the estimated impact of each rate cut remains relatively small. We continue to estimate that each 25 basis point cut in U.S. rates impacts revenues by roughly $50 million on a quarterly basis, but, of course, this will depend on the competitive environment for deposits and other factors. So, the rate environment continues to evolve, but we are managing our rate sensitivity carefully, and we continue to expect to generate net interest revenue growth this year of about 4% in constant dollars, which equates to roughly $2 billion of growth as we've discussed on previous earnings calls. Turning to non-interest revenue. On a full year basis, we continue to expect total non-interest revenue to come in roughly flat to the prior year. In the first half of 2019, non-interest revenue declined by close to $900 million, all of which you saw in the first quarter. This decline was mostly driven by the gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the prior year, as well as a very strong prior year comparison in equities in the first quarter, along with the drag from mark-to-market losses on loan hedges. In the second quarter, while we saw pressure in underlying markets revenues, it was entirely offset by the Tradeweb gain, so non-interest revenues were flat to last year. Looking ahead to the second half of 2019, as a reminder, in consumer, we will be comparing to the third quarter of 2018 when we had a $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico. However, we should be able to more than offset this headwind with organic growth across the rest of our accrual and consumer businesses, and we should see a favorable comparison in markets revenues in the fourth quarter, even if investor client activity remains muted, similar to what we've seen so far this year. On slide 11, we show our capital -- we show our key capital metrics. In the second quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 10% year-over-year to $67.64, driven by net income and a lower share count, and our CET1 capital ratio was stable sequentially at 11.9%, as net income was offset by $4.6 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends. To conclude, while the revenue environment has proved challenging for some of our businesses, we make continued progress in the first half of 2019. From a revenue perspective, we are seeing solid momentum across the consumer franchise and continued growth in our accrual businesses in ICG. And, while we've seen pressure in some of our market sensitive businesses, results have generally reflected the broader industry. We continue to believe, we can generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019, driven by continued growth in net interest revenue and more stable trends in non-interest revenue versus 2018. On the expense side, our productivity savings have exceeded our incremental investments by roughly $300 million so far this year, putting us on track to achieve the upper end of the $500 million to $600 million in incremental net savings, we had expected for full year 2019. Expenses were down year-over-year in the first half, and we believe that was prudent given the revenue headwinds we faced. Looking ahead, we will maintain this expense discipline relative to the revenue environment, while continuing to make essential investments in the franchise, including investments in infrastructure and controls, but we do expect expenses to be lower on a sequential basis from the first half to the second half of the year. And while the operating environment is uncertain, we will continue to look to all of our return levers with a continued focus on our full year RoTCE target of 12% for 2019. Before we go into Q&A, let me spend a few moments on our outlook for the third quarter specifically. In ICG, we expect continued year-over-year growth in our accrual businesses as we continue to serve our target clients across our global network and markets and investment banking revenues should reflect the overall market environment. On the consumer side, in North America, solid revenue growth should continue, driven by U.S. Branded Cards. In Asia, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth. And in Mexico, as I just mentioned, we'll be comparing to the third quarter last year, which included a gain on the sale of our asset management business. On an underlying basis, similar to the results seen so far this year, revenue growth will likely remain somewhat muted, although we expect continued strong growth in pre-tax earnings. For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially and cost of credit should continue to grow modestly year-over-year, reflecting volume growth and continued normalization in ICG. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi, good morning, Mark. Mark Mason : Good morning. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about the -- how are you doing? I wanted to ask about the RoTCE goal. So 12% goal for 2019, you are on the doorstep so far the first half of 11.9%. As we think about levers to kind of keep that up in the second half and push over the goal line to get above 12% for the year, second half often has not as strong capital markets, obviously, haven't been so good this quarter -- so far this year. So just -- what are the things to think about puts and takes for the second half that could get you over that 12% for the year? Mark Mason : Thank you. So, 12% remains the target for 2019. As you heard Mike mention, you heard me mention, we're obviously in an uncertain environment. The good news is that we have seen continued momentum in the consumer franchise, particularly in branded cards as we've talked about over the past couple of quarters with very strong performance this quarter as well on the heels of us converting those promotional balances to more average interest earning balances. And we'd expect that revenue growth to continue through the balance of the year. You heard me mention, the international franchises which are growing to have continued growth in the balance of the year and where there's muted growth to have -- to offset that with expense management and therefore have EBIT growth particularly in the case of Latin America. So those will be two positive drivers I would point to. I obviously point to our accrual businesses and transaction businesses on the ICG side, 7% growth in both Securities Services and GTS this quarter. We'd expect continued growth from those businesses. And on the expense side, we talked to -- or I talked to really being on the high end of those productivity savings outweighing investments. And I would expect to certainly come in with that $600 million side of the range that we've talked to there. The big area where the uncertainty in the environment you can pick the factor, whether it's the direct -- what's going on with rates and volatility around that or trade and tariff discussions, it plays out through the market sensitive business. It plays out through the trading that you see on the fixed income and equities. It plays out through investment banking. It impacts corporate sentiment, and those things as you would imagine are difficult to predict. We obviously feel good about the client dialogue that we've had, but that's -- those are the factors that are a bit harder to manage. And when we see that softness what you saw in the first half is that we pulled levers that we could pull responsibly. And you should expect that we would continue to do that in the back half without compromising two things. One, the investments required to continue to grow the strong parts of the franchise; and two, infrastructure and controls. And those two things we think are critical to the long-term sustainability of the franchise. Now, we'll continue to manage credit very carefully. You saw our tax rate come in a little bit lower this quarter. We'll continue to do work around what we can do to get the tax rate as low as we responsibly can get it, and you've seen us actually being more on the capital side. So that combination of things, we think is helpful in obviously trying to get to that target of the 12%. There are -- there is some unpredictability to that, particularly on the market side. And to the extent that that plays out more severely than forecasted, we would expect to be in and around the range of 12%. John McDonald : I guess also you did say \u2013 you\u2019d expect you\u2019re going to have lower card losses in the second half versus the first and that should help? Is there any frontloading of marketing or any other expense kind of frontloading and investment frontloading that you have ? Mark Mason : Yeah. I mean, when you look at the profitability just in general on the consumer business, it does tend to skew towards the back half of the year because of things like marketing spend. We also and I mentioned this in the last call, we also pulled forward some of the repositioning that we were looking to do as we reorganized around different parts of the franchise. And so, savings that we were expecting kind of later in 2020, we can -- we'll see some of that benefit play out through the back half of 2019. So, there are those things around levers and actions that we took in the first half that not only helped the first half, but have the potential to help us in the second half as well. John McDonald : Okay. And just last thing for me on that note. You're still looking ahead towards a goal of 13.5% for next year? Mark Mason : Yes, 13.5% remains the target for next year. Just to -- obviously, again, I'll point back to the environment that we're in; we'll see how the environment plays out. We'll see how the market reacts to rate reductions. Obviously, the activity we saw last week in the way of a market reaction was pretty favorable to have a more certainty around the direction of rates. But we'll see how those -- some of those things play out and it does remain the target, and if we have to identify additional levers to try and pull to get there, we will. But as we stand here today, that 13.5% remains our target for 2020. John McDonald : Great. Thanks. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thank you very much. Mark Mason : Hi, Glen. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Question on the net interest income trends. So, if you look at the 12% decline in non-interest bearing deposits and the 9% increase in interest-bearing deposits and then also the seven basis point rise in deposit costs sequentially and then the drop in loan yields, those trends combined, while not surprising, you would think from the outside would be a more negative tone on NII, but I think your guide was actually pretty good. Are there offsets that we don't see end or are some of those trends like the tail end of things that have been in motion and they actually get better over the next couple of quarters? Mark Mason : Yes. So, in terms of the net interest revenue, we're obviously at about $1.3 billion of net interest revenue with a strong Q1 about $450 million in Q2. And as we look at that, we've obviously factored in at this point not only the shift that you mentioned from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing, but also the likelihood of a rate reduction based on the talk that is out there. And so as we look at -- and look at kind of the continued momentum on the card side, and we look at the end of the deposit growth that we're seeing particularly in the TTS franchise with higher volumes a growth of 10% or so, we feel pretty good about our ability to get to that 4% growth in NIR. Notwithstanding that there are other factors that come into play, not the least of which is how many additional cards play out through the balance of the year. But as we sit here today, we feel pretty good about that. The bigger driver -- the biggest driver I think would be as I mentioned continued growth on the branded card side, continued growth in the accrual businesses. Those are going to be the larger factors that play through the back half of the year. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Appreciate that. Maybe a little more color on the loan -- on the loan yield side coming down, I'm assuming that is LIBOR-based loans. And the follow-up I have on that is, who makes the call on those loans, meaning LIBOR-based versus prime-based? Is it you, or is it client-led? I'm just curious on how to think about that as we go-forward. It looks like LIBOR adjusted but prime didn\u2019t, obviously. Mike Corbat : Yeah. So, we've had -- we certainly saw some revenue pressure on the corporate lending book. That was a combination of, kind of, the spread compression in addition to some hedging cost and that certainly played through here. In terms of the pricing of the loan, that is -- both a by-product of what we're seeing in the market, on the way of competition from a pricing point of view and obviously -- and the funding cost that we have. I think, we -- what we've tried to be diligent about is where there're opportunities to both serve the client and not necessarily tie-up the balance sheet, we've taken advantage of those opportunities, particularly in our trading -- our trade lending activity, so that we're not bringing on economic position that -- or positions that are uneconomical. We continue to see pressure from a pricing point of view in Asia. And so, you've seen our Asia loans come down just because the combination of the economics not making sense again, as well as just really slowing demand, given what's going on with trade. And so, there is pressure from a spread point of view. We do have a view towards pricing that not only considers our own internal funding, but also the client demand and the competitive landscape and that combination of factors is what plays out through the year. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Really appreciated. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with The Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Mike Corbat : Hi, Jim. Mark Mason : Hi, Jim. Jim Mitchell : Hi. Maybe just following up on Glenn's question, just to zero in on deposits a little bit. Interest-bearing deposit rates paid was up 7 basis points without any kind of a hike. Is that just a mix shift? You mentioned, I think, it looked like Asia deposits were up. I would imagine they're higher rates. Just trying to figure out, is there domestic pressure on rates paid, or is that just mix? Mark Mason : Yeah. So, there is some mix shift. I mean, there is some shift from non-interest-bearing to interest-bearing. Jim Mitchell : That would affect the rates paid on interest-bearing? Mark Mason : Yeah. That's right. And then -- so the other dynamic is, in fact, what we're seeing -- there are two things. One, what we see on the market from a competitive point of view; two, there tends to be a lag effect from the betas that played through on the retail side. And then three, as we've been growing some of the U.S. deposits that I mentioned earlier, some of that has been growth out of our markets, but with high \u2013 so tied with high yield savings account type product. Jim Mitchell : So, would you expect that to continue to creep higher a little bit, or start to stabilize? Mark Mason : It kind of depends on kind of what happens in the broader rate environment. We obviously are talking about rate cuts now and that ultimately over time would have an impact. I think, the strategic way that I tend to look at it is, these deposits -- the deposit activity that we have with clients is really geared towards the broader relationship that we have with them as you know. And so, we had a lot of good deposit growth on the TPS side. That's around the broader solutions that we talked to and worked with those clients around. The deposit growth we're seeing on the consumer side is really about the demonstrating the digital capability that we have and really broadening the relationship we have with them. So, yes, there is some pricing pressure. The rate movement in the future will certainly have an impact on how much more or less of that plays through, but we do think we're making progress again for the broader strategic objectives. Jim Mitchell : Okay. And a clarification for the $2 billion in NII growth this year. Are you assuming now a rate cut in that number? Or I'm not sure if I heard you say that? Mark Mason : We're assuming one rate cut in that number. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's very helpful. And then\u2026 Mark Mason : Towards the back half of the year. Jim Mitchell : Right. And just one question on TTS and trade finance, you mentioned spreads being wider in trades, so trade war helping you a little bit? Or have you seen a slowdown? Certainly trade flow seemed to have slowed. How do we think about that you seem pretty confident in the growth in that business? Or how you\u2019re thinking about the dynamics there? Mike Corbat : I think from a trade perspective, I would say -- I don't want to say BAU, the business activity remains fairly strong. I think we've seen some trade routes shifting. The example we gave as oppose to soy from the U.S. soy from Brazil et cetera, so trade route shifting, I think our clients are kind of very engaged around kind of steady and trying to stay ahead of that. So, I don't think, we'd speak to any kind of slowdown as of yet, but clearly people paying a lot of attention to it. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Matt O\u2019Connor: So you guys are executing on the capital deployment strategy you laid out a couple of years ago and to be fair, I think there was some debate or concern whether you could execute on that and you are. But now you're sitting here, you performed very well in DFAST. Some of your peers surprised the market and delivered more than expected. And it seems like your position to do even more than what you had promised couple of years ago and just wondering your thoughts on whether you can do it and the timing and how you approach it? Mark Mason : Yeah. So as you mentioned, we -- back at Investor Day, we talked about $60 billion plus over the three-year cycle. We were going to exceed that. We just have $21.5 billion over the four quarters covered by this 2019 cycle. As you know we have an objective of trying to, obviously, generate the highest return and return is -- as much capital as we can to our shareholders. We currently manage to a CET1 target of 11.5% net that obviously has buffers in it for some of the uncertainty that's still out there, whether the proposals like SCB and -- or other things that impact of the variability of capital. As we get greater clarity on those things, we will obviously continue to kind of look at that, but that remains the target going forward. We've got -- we're still running at 11.9% CET1 ratio. So subject to growth needs, we will always be looking at how we ensure that we run that more tightly to that target of 11.5%. And the way we think about the return of capital distribution of capital going forward is, largely as we get close to that 11.5%, which we expect to get close to towards the end of the year will be around how much capital we generate just opposed against how much we need to continue to grow. And so, we certainly have the objective of continuing to return as much as it makes good sense given the growth opportunities for the franchise. If you look back over the three-year cycle, we've returned on average about 121% of our net income available to common. So we feel pretty good about that percentage albeit, we started at a higher CET1 ratio years ago. Matt O'Connor: And can you just remind us as we think about the 11.5% target, what are some of the areas of clarity that you're looking for in terms of reevaluating that? You obviously got some comments from the Fed in recent weeks. But it seems like the stress test might be little bit easier than feared as they bring in the stress capital buffer and -- what are some other things specifically that you're looking for to potentially bring that down? Mark Mason : Yes. So, look they are -- you just mentioned one with the SCB that's one of the proposals that's still out there. We just got as you mentioned some clarity about what to see how that factors in. There are number of other proposals that are still outstanding. And the dialogue that we've heard from regulators is largely around ensuring that those things that there is understanding, how those things will work in aggregate in terms of how they impact the amount of capital that institutional out the whole, whether that's additional clarity on how to think about G-SIB. We obviously have C-CIL that will come into play in early 2020, but all of those factors are important. We've heard commentary around greater clarity or transparency as part of the CCAR process. We obviously support rate of transparency. We think it'll help through and move some of the variability in capital planning. So as that starts to kind of come -- continue to come into the fold that will be important to how we think about this. So those are just a couple of examples. Mike Corbat : And I think this really, Mark. When we think about the 4.5, plus to 3, plus the 3, what's in some ways on the table is the management buffer, the 100 basis points. And as you described, as we look at G-SIB and C-CIL and kind of all these things coming together, whether or not there's an opportunity to reexamine that or not. Matt O'Connor: And then just lastly to bring it all together like as you think about some of these moving pieces, do you think you\u2019ll have clarity before the next CCAR cycle that might motivate you to resubmit? Or is it more helping that clarity with the next cycle on these factors? Mark Mason : Yeah. Its -- these things kind of take time to play out, I think as we've seen over the past couple of years. And so we just really have to see how much additional clarity we get over the coming months and we'll figure that out as time progresses. Matt O'Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey, guys. Good morning. A couple of questions; first, Mark, I just wanted to clarify the NII guide. So I think you mentioned, you're still on track for $2 billion increase this year versus last year of that -- and 4%. That does imply by my calculations that second half \u2013 the quarterly run rate does continue to ratchet up versus the first half, something like 12.1, 12.2. Is that -- I just want to clarify that's right and if that's including a rate cut being baked into that outlook? Mark Mason : Yes. So what we are still targeting and on-track for $2 billion for the full year as I've stated. We do have one rate hike that we're assuming. Mike Corbat : Rate cut. Mark Mason : Sorry. Rate cut that we're assuming, excuse me. Rate cut that we're assuming on the -- in the back half of the year. Obviously, if that happens sooner, happens in July that would have an impact on the NIR forecast that we have and candidly, if there is more than one rate cut that would have additional impact and so those are the factors. There obviously are other factors that come into play, but that is -- and that is assuming obviously a change in the U.S. rates. So, -- but we are still targeting the $2 billion recognizing there's some risk there. Saul Martinez : Got it. But given just the $50 million impact for 20 -- for the quarter from 20 to 25 basis points of cut, presumably even if we do get one cut or two cuts, it seems like you're confident that you can get NII growth in the back end of the year versus the first half? Mark Mason : Yes. I think the broader issue is the uncertainty that Mike and I have referenced that's just out there. And so if we just isolated this to two interest rate cuts in the scheme of a $47 billion NIR line, I mean, you're absolutely -- you're right. But the reality is that, it's the broader uncertainty that's out there that's impacting the industry. And while that goes through the market-sensitive revenues and just kind of cooperate sentiment more broadly. Saul Martinez : Was there -- in the past you've broken out this slide on Page 10, where you break out the accrual versus legacy versus trading. Is there a reason why you're not doing that this time around? Mark Mason : Yes. Just -- I mean, as we kind of exited the holdings and started to kind of wind down those legacy businesses that became less of a significant variable as you look at these total revenues, it was probably 5% of the aggregate revenues in the first quarter, and so it just wasn't as -- it wasn't on a constant-dollar basis. It's just wasn't as meaningful, and so we moved towards simplifying it with both the legacy breakout as well as the trading NIR breakout. Saul Martinez : Okay. And one final one from me, a large portion of the expected profitability expansion in North America consumer comes from right-sizing the profitability in retail banking and you gave some positive commentary obviously and you feel pleased about the momentum in terms of deposits, the inflows, the digital strategies, tapping your cards network or your cards clients. But you also have a lower rate environment and deposit spreads is likely going to come in and I think you didn't have any growth in revenues in retail banking. In a tougher rate environment, can you right-size profitability? Or how much more difficult is it to right-size the profitability of your retail banking business, if the Fed continues to cut? Mark Mason : Yes. I'd make two points. One is as I think about the back half of 2019 and even 2020 for that matter, I think that the work that we've done in branded cards is going to be a meaningful contributor, or continue to be a meaningful contributor to the revenue performance that we see in consumer North America. The North America retail bank, as you mentioned, we had one's at a high efficiency rate at this point. We are seeing good traction as it relates to deposits increasing, but what -- again, what that's really about for us is, how we deepen the relationships and kind of broaden the penetration of those products and services into our card customer base. And so, over time, I think it's going to be more challenging to look at just the retail banking portion of that we breakout in income, because of that broader client strategy. And so, I think -- so, I think that's kind of how we thought about it. That said, I mentioned, kind of, repositioning that we have taken in the first quarter that we've taken a bit of that in the second quarter. That's largely around the reorganization to support that strategy and moving from our product siloed-type of business model to one that is more geared towards the client and we think that that will help. That, obviously, will help the margins as we continue to execute against the strategy. Saul Martinez : Got it. That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. I have one very short-term question and one very long-term question. The very short-term question relates to -- what was the dollar amount of the mark-to-market hedge losses? You said that, roughly offset Tradeweb, or was a much bigger number than what was in the press release? So what was that number? Mark Mason : So the -- in the quarter, the mark-to-market loss -- loan losses were -- losses on loan hedges were $75 million. For the half is what I was talking about. For the half, the number was about $306 million. So about $231 million in the first quarter. And so that's the number. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then the longer term question is, how much runway do you have left with technology to improve Citigroup's efficiency? Mark, when you mentioned the levers that helped meet your targets, the RoTCE target of 12%. You didn't mention technology, yet you mentioned the $300 million spread between the savings from the investments over the new investment level. So, what's the runway left kind of short, medium and long-term? Thanks. Mark Mason : In that $500 million to $600 million for the year, the $300 million that we've done year-to-date, as it relates to productivity, are the benefits of the technology investments that we've been making. So some portion of those savings is a by-product of technology investments. We continue -- we see those technology benefits in the digital capabilities that we built-out and how that plays out in a lower cost to not only acquire, but lower cost to service the clients. You see things like the use of eStatements going up. We see things like volumes into call centers going down. All of those things are benefits that are generated as a by-product of technology investments that we've made. We expect a similar level of productivity sales in 2020. We do continue to invest in technology. In fact, what you heard me mention earlier in terms of one of the protected areas being infrastructure and control, they are coupled with the different ways to look at that protected area as we invest in technology around our infrastructure and improve the data quality that we have and things of that sort, not only does it help us run a safer and more sound organization, but it also arms us with information sooner to enable us to react and serve our clients more quickly. And so, yes, the answer is yes. We do see benefits from technology playing out in these -- in the expense line and in the productivity savings that are referenced both in 2019 and 2020 and likely beyond and those things will help in getting us to the lower levels of operating efficiency that we've talked about achieving over time. Mike Corbat : Mike, I think if you go to Page 21 in the deck, you can see, we put in there some different drivers and metrics, and I think from -- the way I think about it is, today we really run the combination of an analog and a digital bank. And the faster we can continue to drive digital adoption mobile usage, we know that\u2019s cheaper. It's significantly cheaper when we\u2019re solving issues on your phone, where we're solving issues away from physical interaction or voice and again, you can see, we've got roughly 30 million active digital users. We've got 20 million active mobile users between North America and international. And you can look at the year-over-year growth rates, I think probably amongst the highest in the industry. And so, we're on this journey. And, obviously, the investments that we can make to switch those over, we think yields a -- yield quite high returns. Mike Mayo : And then last follow-up. Mark, you reaffirmed the guidance for RoTCE for this year and the next. And Mike, do you also reaffirm that guidance, I certainly do? Mike Corbat : Absolutely. Mike Mayo : So, Citi -- just predates you missed a lot of targets this decade as we approach the end of the decade and consensus does not expect you to reach those targets and look, we have buy on the stock. We haven\u2019t always had a buy on the stock. And we don\u2019t even have you reaching those targets. So, where do you think the disconnect is? You think that Citi is going to get 13.5% RoTCE next year and you are hard-pressed upon too many other people who agree with you. Assuming we don't have a recession or anything like that, where do you think the market is wrong? Mark Mason : Now, let me try to answer that in a couple of ways. First, let me go back to 2019 for a second, because both Mike and I have said that the 12% remains the target for 2019. It absolutely does. You can also look at the first half of the year or the fourth quarter of last year and witness strength in the franchise, on the consumer side, on your core side of the business, but you can also witness the impact of the environment that we're in and the uncertainty around that. Despite that uncertainty, we've gotten to 11.9% in the first half through pulling a number of levers and we would expect to continue to pull those levers into the back half of this year to the extent that that uncertainty increases, or there is more significant reaction from the market to the uncertainty, we'll of course look and work to find additional levers, but at some point that becomes challenged, in terms of getting to that 12% just given things we want to protect in this franchise. And I believe that even if it were to become challenged that we'd end up in a range around that 12% and that is what we are working towards that target that 12% target. In terms of 2020 and the 13.5% target that we have for 2020 and the disconnect, I mean, we've talked about the disconnect in the past and it moves around as you would know very well. But it's ranged from being a little bit of difference of views on the topline which I think we've started to narrow some of that gap, given the performance we've been able to demonstrate through the first half of the year, again in those strong areas. There's also been less of a disconnect on the expense line as I've given I think a little bit more specificity around the guidance there. There's been a cost of credit difference of use in the past and again we feel pretty good about our cost of credit outlook, but we obviously recognize that where we are in this cycle. There's been obviously tax work that we continue to do and we'll continue to do and I gave some additional view on that. We've done well on capital than we originally talked about. And still it's those drivers and levers that we will continue to pull through the balance of this year. We'll see how this year plays out, given all of the uncertainty referenced and we'll go into 2020 with the 13.5% remaining our target and with clarity on where we think we'll end up against it. Mike Corbat : And Mike, the way I think about it simplistically is, we're going to do everything within our power to get to those numbers with the exception of two things. One is, we are going to continue to make the investments that are necessary to keep our business competitive. You can see a lot of things going on around this and I think around our franchises in consumer or our institutional business. As an example, in TTS or security services, we think we just got to make those investments to stay competitive. And the second thing is around us is our commitment to our shareholders and our regulators to make sure that we're making the investments in terms of safety and soundness. And so, we won't put those at risk but everything else is on the table. Mike Mayo : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hey, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start-off with the question on the FICC business. You cited some of the pressures within FICC and rates in particular. Your business is already been somewhat unique just given the higher contributions from TTS and particularly with non-financial corporate. I think that's more than 30% of your total revenue there. I'm wondering whether you're seeing greater resiliency on that side of the business which would suggest maybe even more pronounced pressure within institutional. Mark Mason : So I guess what I'd say is obviously our fixed income revenues for the quarter were down about 4% if you exclude the gain from Tradeweb. I think when you look at what transpired in the quarter, there was a fair amount of volatility around rates and rate movement and what we saw was that play out particularly around the investor client base that we have. So, to the point we made before, we continue to see stable cooperate client activity, particularly in rates and currencies, where there's a strong linkage to our broader franchise and in particular TTS. But we did see decreased activity with our investor clients given all of the macro uncertainty that I've mentioned now a couple of times. Many of the investor clients remain on the sidelines. And frankly, it was the speed and the magnitude of the rate movements that created a challenging marketing -- market environment and made it difficult to monetize client flows. On the equity side, well, you didn't ask about equity. But on the equity side, I mean, the trade war had similar or trade discussions and war had a similar impact that kind of flows through particularly again with investor clients, I mentioned earlier, impacting both cash equities and prime brokerage, but we did see again, corporal client activity even in equities kind of hold up nicely playing out to equity derivatives. Mike Corbat : And the way I would say Mark is I think is -- engagement is high, engagement is very good. Mark Mason : Yes. Mike Corbat : But I think right now the challenges -- and maybe it's the opportunity -- in that we're clearly pivoting from an environment where we had predicted or thought, or had been built-in rising rates to at this point rates going lower. And I think from our perspective, we don't believe that the market has made that full adjustment, and there's probably some terms that's got to come as portfolio set-up for that potential lower rate environment. The question is when will that come and to what degree will that come, will there -- will we get conviction in terms of the trajectory of this lower rate environment and portfolios have to reposition, because I think today, they're not positioned where they need to be fully. Mark Mason : And again, to that point, just last week when there appeared to be some signs of greater clarity on the move in rate, the reduction in rates and the timing of that. The equity markets responded very, very favorably to that. And so to your point Mike, I think clarity in direction should yield greater confidence and perhaps a more of a risk on mentality as it relates to the markets. Steven Chubak : Very helpful color. I appreciate that. And just one follow-up for me on ICG credit, you guided to -- or indicate some normalization of credit trends, but the charge-off rate there is quite low at eight basis points. I'm just wondering is it fair for us to extrapolate that eight basis point loss rate as indicative of what you guys view as normalized. And can you maybe just speak to some of the unique aspects of the business like trading -- trade finance that should drive some lower loss levels through the cycle since that was actually pretty encouraging commentary from our point of view? Mark Mason : Yes. I mean, again, when you think about our Corporate Lending book and the quality of our exposure, the multi-national clients that we cover, the 83% of it being investment grade type exposure. Historically, we've had loss rates that have been low in the way of number of basis points five to six basis points historically, and yes, we are starting to see some normalization of that. I think the quarter cost of credit, the $103 million is reflective of that coming out -- coming out of last year and representative I think of what we've talked to in the way of what to -- to look to see in the way of normalization. And so, I think, it's a by-product of the quality of the book that we have and the nature of the activity that we do in lending. Steven Chubak : Okay, great. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin from Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks a lot. Just a follow-up on the credit side. Mark, you pointed out that the -- on the consumer side of credit that things have also kind of just gone according to plan. You've maintained that guide. At what point do you see the end of the light in terms of the seasoning? Meaning, how long do you think you can kind of stay in this very benign zone for the card side, presuming that the economy stays in relatively good form? Any reason to see any change to that, I guess, is the question? Mark Mason : Yes. I mean, not at this stage. I mean, it\u2019s -- we gave kind of medium term guidance, if you will, and we've talked about those ranges of 300 to 325, 500 to 525. Again, certainly through the balance of this year, we expect to end up inside of that range. We look at probably all the things that would be obvious to folks and then some. So, if you look at just on the macro front, we're obviously looking and watching closely the inverted yield curve and what that has meant historically. But when we look at that juxtaposed against the internal metrics that we use, whether that would be card usage patterns or utilization or payment rates or the percentage of customers making minimum payments. I mean, thus far those indicators have all remained broadly stable. And so, I don't see any cause at this point for material concern. Ken Usdin : Okay. And then, the tax rate you mentioned 22%, 23% in the back half and you've also talked about there potentially being some levers there. Can you help us understand, like, does that mean that over time you have the chance to still take the tax rate lower as you look into 2020 and as part of your \u2013 that plan for the RoTCE improvement? Mark Mason : We're constantly looking at it and trying to identify opportunities, looking at obviously where we book business and client demands around that and where there are opportunities to do that. But at this point, I'm not taking down the guidance. I'm just pointing out, perhaps, the obvious, which is that, it's one of the levers that we continue to push on and explore. Ken Usdin : Understood. Last one, just on the deposit cost side, with the potential rates turning and some non-U.S. central banks already cutting, what's the lag effect here in terms of this quarter? The deposit costs were up 7 basis points. What's the rate of change that you need to see before you can see a leveling out of the basis point increases that we see on deposit cost side? Thanks Mark. Mark Mason : Yes. So it's -- I guess, it's a -- what we've seen during the rate rise or increases where that the -- abate is on the corporate side and the commercial side have kind of tick-up a lot faster and there tends to be a lag on the retail consumer side. And as things turn, I would expect, to some extent, similar type of direction, notwithstanding that the retail deposit side still has that lag to it and there are other factors such as the competitive landscape that's out there for deposit. And so, it's a little bit hard, kind of, pinpoint exactly when that stabilizes, just given all of those factors, but we're obviously managing it closing and managing it in the context of the broader strategy that I referenced a couple of times now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. Just on the deposit business, a follow-up there. Could you give us a sense, I think you mentioned at the beginning, I recall that you had a $2 billion increase in deposits that was from the digital efforts you've got, two-thirds outside your footprint and half of the $2 billion coming from folks that have your card, but didn't have a banking relationship with you. Could you just give us a sense of how that was relative to expectations and what you think the major drivers were for generating that growth speaking to rate versus marketing versus any other factors that you want to add? Mark Mason : Yeah. So, one I would say that is in line with what we were expecting in the way of deposit performance through the digital sales channel. We have seen, kind of, broadly just good activity with our consumer retail clients not just with the net deposits, but also retaining deposits as they shift into AUMs. And so -- and as clients start to make investments and so the flow levels have been very good if you include both AUMs and the deposits. I would say, we would expect continued growth in the deposits in the back half of the year. It is a combination of -- and if you think about our strategy again to target card customers, a good portion of the deposit growth that we achieved were outside of our six markets and with our card customers who did not have a retail banking relationship. It's a byproduct I would say of not only rates, so there was some portion that is tied to the high yield savings account. Although that -- even that does demonstrate the power of the model, because we know these customers and they're not -- it's not a cannibalization of what we gather inside of our market. But it's also a byproduct of the work we've been doing around creating a value proposition and understanding, which of our clients are likely to respond to what rewards. And so you heard me mention banking points and double cash rewards. Those were part of the offerings to clients to join us in terms of the retail banking products that we offer in exchange for -- are there more ThankYou Points or more benefits that accrue from the double cash reward. So, it is a combination of marketing, targeted marketing in terms of knowing the customers, we want to go after and what they're likely to respond to. Some of it is rate, yes, but it's a combination of all of those things and we expect continued growth. Betsy Graseck : And then, I know you mentioned that the NIM came under a little bit of pressure as you had significant increase in deposit growth and the tie-in question here is, is there anything you need to see from these customers? Is there like -- do they need to keep their deposits with you for certain amount of time before you're able to take some duration with these deposits on the asset side? Or should we anticipate that as you're growing your new deposits here and out of footprint does that gets reinvested in the front end of the curve? Mark Mason : Yeah. So, I mean obviously there is LCR treatment for different types of deposits. These are largely time deposits that we've been bringing in. I think that we would expect that to -- like I said, expect that to continue down the path. There's no reason for us to feel us though the -- these are kind of short term in nature or anything of that sort. Betsy Graseck : Okay. But they be match funded or match invested I should say? Mark Mason : Yes. Betsy Graseck : Okay. And then just two other questions; one on the TTS business, could you give us a sense as how you expect the business operates or performs in a declining interest rate environment? If we look at the forward curve, how should we expect TSS to behave? And then you mentioned some strong pipeline with initiatives for the client\u2019s maybe you could speak to that? And I'm kind of interested in understanding what you're planning on vis-\u00e0-vis the Libra announcement that came out of Facebook. Now I know Libra seems like it's more a personal related, but there is a C2B and B2B element with that. So I wanted to understand, what your plans are? My basic question is why do we need Libra? It seems like you might have what companies need, so maybe you could speak to that a little bit? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes. I guess, I'll start and then Mike may want to chime in. So, just in terms of the TTS business, we obviously have seen very strong growth in the TTS business over the past number of years and quarters and even this quarter with 7% growth, which is probably a little bit lower than what we've seen in prior years and just as the rate increases have started to become fewer and now we move into a rate -- a likely rate reduction. The impact to TTS is factored into at least the estimate that I gave you in terms of the impact of a 25 basis point reduction. It obviously would have an impact on the growth rate. But I would say that the majority of the growth rate that we've experienced in our TTS business is not tied towards -- not tied to the interest rate. But instead tied towards growth that we've had in both with multinational clients that are large and that we've been with for a long time, but also new emerging clients as they've entered into new markets, new countries and we've been there to assist them with how they kind of grow their businesses and operations in those new environments where whether it be working capital or supply chain needs that they've had. And so I would expect to see continued growth in TTS albeit at a slower pace in light of the rate environment. But again, our relationship with our clients are broader than just us taking their cash and holding their cash and we're offering them solutions that are a lot broader than just the rate that we pay them for cash. The other piece that I'd mentioned is that, we have been and will continue to invest in technology around our TTS franchise. It is obviously a very competitive space, but it's one where we had a strong position for a long time. It's been nicely growing. It's very efficient. It's high-returning. We're nicely entrenched with many of our customers and we've got to continue to invest in the high end experience and enabling faster cross-border activity for those client. And so good growth, I expect to see continued growth, requires investment, we're in front of that investment to stay competitive, and we will continue to do so. And I'll let Mike kind of comment on some of the other pieces you mentioned. Mike Corbat : Thanks. Mark, I would just to -- going back to TTS for one second, that's the operating in a declining rate environment, it\u2019s nothing new, it certainly not new in the U.S. And if you look at our TTS business operating around the world many, many jurisdictions we operate, we've been in declining rate environments for a period of time, and I think the work that team is done, moving from interest rate sensitive to more fee-driven types of relationships has been helpful in that. On your question pertaining to what's going on from a technology perspective and in this case Libra in particular. One is, I am not -- we are not dismissive at all of this. We look at them. We study them. As we've said, we were not -- are not part of the inaugural group. I read the white paper several times at this point in time. And again, I look and there's I think some redeeming or there's some qualitative aspects that are appealing, and I think there's others that might raise some questions. And I think the way we think about it is that the market is moving and likely moving quickly towards 24/7, real-time frictionless, ubiquitous global money movements and payments, and that's just the reality and that's going to happen, and I think we're pretty well-positioned around that. As I think of things like Libra not a question of if, it's when the digital currency comes, it's a question is that currency one that kind of operates as a consortium, or is it a Federal Reserve, or is it a central bank-backed type currency? And I think we're preparing for a world with both of those were consumers, businesses are going to have flexibility in terms of their choices, of what they choose to use, and our goal objective and mandate really is to be there with the system that's got the capacity to operate across all of those. Betsy Graseck : So, a lot of times big-tackled highlight friction in the system and opportunities they have to cut friction out, meaning take out fee rates of legacy businesses. Could you speak to how you're thinking about that? Because I think some people might view you as a legacy business with a margin that can be taken out. How do you answer that kind of question? Mike Corbat : Yes. Betsy, I'd probably break our businesses into two components, I'd break it into consumer business and institutional payments business. I think in the consumer business, it's clear that interchange is an example is a friction that has existed for a period of time, and as we've seen elsewhere in the world, we're likely to continue to come down. And so -- and I think that's one reason, why you'd seen the disruptors or the innovators so focused on consumer versus institutional payments, because on the institutional side, there's really not much money in the pure movement of money. It's in the operation of the operating account, where yes, you do get some flow. But by the way, Libra has flow and in their consumer as I've read, they're actually not paying. That's where the partners are receiving their income. There are frictions in foreign exchange. There are frictions in terms of rates and other things that we combine with that, but you got to have the back-end that can provide those services in today's age, not only provide them, but provide them in a real-time upscale way. So, again, not dismissive, but on the institutional side of things that from a payments perspective, you got to have the full package. It's not just the movement of money is not the answer in there. And so again, not dismissive, but -- and that's why the investments in areas like TTS are so important that we're continuing to build-out the front-end. We're continuing to take pain points out and whether those frictions are in the forms of fees or money, or probably to our customers benefit, even more so in the form of on-boarding all the frictions that come in terms of account opening and making sure that we're investing in BSA and AML and those other pieces, such that we can continue to distinguish ourselves with our clients as the place to go. Betsy Graseck : Looks great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. And Erika, your line is open. Erika Najarian : Yes. Hi. Can hear me now? Mike Corbat : Yes. Good morning Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Thank you so much for answering the questions on your RoTCE targets. Maybe asking it a different way. The market seems to be now expecting three rate cuts between now and the end of 2020. I think previously you've set an efficiency goal of 53% for 2020, with 175 basis points of improvement in 2019 and 225 in 2020. And I'm wondering if we do get three rate cuts and corporate activity remains at current levels, is there enough productivity savings that you can identify to reiterate the efficiency targets as well? Mark Mason : Yeah. Look, I mean, we -- obviously, the volatility around rate movement has been pretty significant over the past couple of quarters from us -- from an increase to now a reduction and possibly three reductions. And so, if we had significant moves in rates, we can kind of do the math as to what the implications would be. I think we'd also have to make some assumptions around those other factors that are in the environment and what happens with those, whether it's trade and the tariffs, et cetera, and whether we'd really have a fulsome answer in terms of what implications would be on achieving the 13.5%, and then being able to ascertain what levers we'd be able to pull. So, it's a difficult question to answer, as I sit here today as to whether -- which levers and how much of those levers we'd be able to pull while protecting the things that Mike and I have referenced and still hitting a 13.5%. I think to some extent, I want to see how dispersed rate cut plays out and what the implications are for additional rate cuts. Again, we could very well see, as Mike suggested, the market having to react to a rate reduction and certainty around the direction in a way that is favorable to trading businesses, but we've got to, kind of, wait and see how some of that plays out. Erika Najarian : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl of KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yeah. Morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Brian Kleinhanzl : So a quick question on branded cards. You said, you expect to maintain the current mix between the full rate and promotional? But, I guess, breaking that down, are you still expecting migration to be occurring from the promotional to full rate and you're just going to be relying on promotional for loan balances going forward? Or more heavily relying on promotional balances going forward? Mike Corbat : So, in order to maintain the mix that we have, we will need to continue to invest in promotional and bringing on promotional balances, and so we will continue to do that. They will continue now -- we have, obviously, a track record of understanding how to do that and understanding the timing for, which it takes for them to convert and flip into average interest earning balances, but we now are reaching a mix that we think is a healthy mix for us. And in order to maintain that, we will need to continue to invest. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And then secondly, you mentioned that you're seeing macro conditions are slowing in Latin America specifically in Mexico, but there was additional levers you could pull on the expense side. I mean, what are examples of those additional levers that you have that are already in budget? Thanks. Mark Mason : In Latin America and in Mexico, what we saw last year, we saw expenses were up, I would say about 8% last year. And what I referenced this year or this quarter and last quarter, with the growth that we were seeing in EBIT. And the growth that we're seeing in EBIT is a byproduct in some ways of the investments spend that we made last year, now starting to pay dividends so to speak through 2019. And so investments or the digital capabilities that we invested in from technology point of view, the organizational business model structure that we put in place in terms of our retail activity there and all of those things are starting to play out as expected. We're about, I don\u2019t know halfway through the investment plan that we announced a couple of years ago and we have the opportunity, obviously, to temper the remaining spend that was planned for to ensure that it's done consistent with the market opportunity that we see. And so, that obviously is a factor that would help on the expense line. And then, we're tempering growth in terms of the loan activity, loan volume in light of what's going on in the economy and that obviously helps at least -- as we think about expected cost of credit and what else, so those are number of factors that play out there. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vinings Sparks. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking the question this morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Marty Mosby : To hit on the RoTCE targets again, would success be reaching those goals in the fourth quarter of each of these years? Or would success be -- ultimate success actually for the whole year? So, as you\u2019re kind of envisioning that, I kind my targets, have you kind of reaching those by the end of each year, but are you really saying that it\u2019s going to be 13.5% average for the whole year of 2020? Mark Mason : So, the target that we've set was for 12% was the full year return on tangible common equity target and as was the case for the 13.5% for 2020. Marty Mosby : And then when you think about capital markets or institutional business, it's been compressed or depressed for a while. We keep thinking this is uncertainty in the marketplace or it's related to something that's causing just a short-term hit. But is this somewhat more secular and when you start thinking about your goals for next year especially in 2020, are we assuming some of this pressure that we're in begins to release? And can you give us any, kind of, feel for the estimate of what you kind of assuming the uncertainty and that has had an impact on the short-term capital markets types of businesses? Mike Corbat : Sure. Marty, what I would say is that I think that there's part of it that is sec. But today, I would argue the majority of it is cyclical and what drives me to that statement is the intervention of central banks around the world and the amount of quantitative easing. And if you tell me that QE is just there forever, then I would probably move towards the majority of it being secular. But at some point, the central banks have to start to back out of the market in terms of asset purchases, in terms of liquidity. And I actually think that there's going to be an opportunity for those that are there to step in and provide the liquidity and leadership on that front. And again, what you see is -- and you see -- you follow it closely, you listen to what everybody says, we're not measuring trading by the year. We're not measuring it by the quarter. Trading in today's age is kind of day-to-day, week-to-week, month-to-month, a change of sentiment out of the Fed causes markets to react quickly. And I think it's what's -- what makes the forecasting as either Mark or I speak at these conferences so difficult. You tend to kind of speak mid-quarter and these things can change in either direction pretty quickly. And so it's not a lack of engagement from the client perspective, it's a lack of conviction. And again I think we've got the combination of that with a bit of overhang from an environmental perspective. And clearly, I think the central banks continuing to be actively involved and in some ways taking part of the role that ultimately the banks will need to play in the future. Mark Mason : And I think -- I'd add to that. As we see the pressures that we talked about impacting the trading businesses, in many ways we're not just standing still as these happens. And so you've seen us announce kind of the reorganization if you will of our spread products or in our spread products area. We've recently announced under the new leadership in end markets combining kind of our rates and currencies business both in an effort to ensure that we're better covering our clients and better positioned to cover our clients. And you'll continue to see as markets evolve and as the industry evolves for us to constantly be looking at our business model for ways to improve it and to improve the effectiveness of it, to improve the profitability and returns associated with it. And so we're mindful of kind of how things are changing to Mike's points, they do appear to be cyclical in nature, but we're constantly evaluating our businesses and trying to position ourselves effectively. Marty Mosby : Thanks. That was very helpful. And then lastly I wanted to ask you, as we think the Fed could begin to pull short-term interest rates down are we preparing to be able to begin to lower deposit rates instead of actually increasing them? So this has been a quick inflection point. But do you think that you'll be able to offset some of the impact as you're able to pull those deposit rates back down? Mark Mason : Yes. I mean look we've seen -- we've talked a little bit about earlier about the betas and how they varied from the corporate clients and commercial clients to the consumer client base. I think there are other important factors as rates start to move in a downward direction. We have seen some of the players in the industry start to take rate down. The other factors include the competitive landscape that's out there and how players decide to adjust the pricing, but it also includes, how you think about the relationship with the customer. And if it is in fact more than just that deposit relationship that's going to factor into how you think about pricing strategy, but I would imagine over and over time with a clarity on the direction that you will see betas respond over time. Marty Mosby : And historically, we're seeing the backdrop of higher deposit betas and rates initially drop meaning you drop a little bit more and then eventually that has a slow down, kind of reverse what we had on the way up. So, thanks for your answers today. Mark Mason : Yes. Operator : The final question comes from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike. Mark Mason : Good morning, Gerard. Mike Corbat : Good morning, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : You guys did very well in the CCAR this year in terms of the amount of capital that was reduced during the stress test. I think you dropped about 500 basis points, which was the lowest in maybe four or five years. What was the primary driver? Was it obviously de-risking the balance sheet, but it was primarily coming from Citi Holdings falling off? And then second, is it continues to go this way, would you consider lowering your CET1 capital ratio -- your target that is? Mark Mason : Yes. So, as Mike kind of alluded to earlier, there are a couple of factors that are involved in the CET1 ratio just taking that part of the question first. And obviously, we've had our management buffer that is included there of about 100 basis points. We have kind of a 3% placeholder in terms of the SCB and we're getting more clarity on that. It seems like in some of the recent commentary and as we get more clarity on the SCB proposal and other proposals and it takes out the risk of variability to how we think about capital planning, we will certainly take a look at the 11.5% and see that that still makes sense. In terms of the ask that we made of the $21.5 billion and what was approved, we obviously ran our scenario with an eye towards the targets that were set 11.5 in this base case, but also ensuring, we can achieve at least the minimums during the stress test scenario. And the mix of assets that we have on balance sheet, we\u2019ve been thoughtful first about the client needs to the course of 2018 with an eye towards what the implication would be from a stress point of view, as we go into a CCAR cycle and the longer term planning of the business and ensure that we ended the year in a place, again, that allowed for us to serve those needs, but was mindful of the return necessary in light of stress losses that maybe a byproduct of those types of assets. And so that's what kind of played out through the scenario and through the ask that we ultimately made. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Mark can you remind us are they still implementing the operating risk capital charge for companies like yours that have exited businesses, but you're still being assessed, the capital charge for those businesses, even though you're not in them? Mark Mason : Yes. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then\u2026 Mark Mason : Up risk RWA. Gerard Cassidy : And how much is that for you folks, that has cushioned you in terms of capital? Mark Mason : I don't think we break that out. Mike Corbat : We haven't broken that out. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. Is there any color do you think coming from the new regulatory regime to maybe give you and your peers some relief in this area? Mike Corbat : I don't think so. Mark Mason : I don't think so. Mike Corbat : I think you know as you look across -- we look across the industry peers, it's pretty consistent and that hasn't been contemplated. Just -- and, yes, just to be clear I think you noticed, but we're looking at -- or we utilized kind of LIBOR pretty standardized as it relates to our risk-weighted? That is the metric that is involved there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then shifting over to the Institutional Clients Group. Mike, I think you touched on in the markets area that there are some cyclical factors affecting them. And you talked about the quantitative easing. In terms of secular in the cash equities area, did you guys see much of the MiFID II changes affecting your cash equity business this quarter? Mike Corbat : This quarter? No. No. Again, I think, that over the kind of glide path of implementation, we really haven't. And we have been seen really many surprises. And we actually went into this and continue to believe that we've got the ability as clients kind of rationalize the counterparties to people that they deal with that Citi's in a position to be a winner in that, and I think we continue, I think as you've seen us continue the kind of climb up the tables, continue to take share there. Gerard Cassidy : Great. And then just -- can you guys give us a flavor for the Investment Banking pipeline, how does it look at the end of the second quarter relative to the end of the first quarter? Mark Mason : Yes. Again, on Investment Banking, kind of, as you saw in the numbers, we ended -- down 10%, but better than what I talked about at Morgan Stanley. The strength we saw in the end -- at the end of the quarter, was really a pull forward with both some ECM activity as well as in M&A. That said, the dialogue that we have with clients in Investment Banking remains strong and fully engaged and quite constructive, and we've seen particular strength in the U.S. M&A activity continuing. So we kind of go into the balance of the year feeling good again about that dialogue, but also recognizing that all these factors that we talked about influences the corporate sentiment and willingness to take action. Mike Corbat : And Gerard, when I think of it, in some ways it\u2019s -- the pipelines are fine. The pipelines are in pretty good shape, but what's the market willing to accept? What can get priced on what terms? And so I think the pipelines are there, I think the question is, in what ways are the market is open to get those deals done. Gerard Cassidy : Great. Thank you for the color, gentlemen. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Operator : And presenters, do you have any closing remarks? Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, everyone. Have a good day. Operator : Okay. This does conclude Citi's second quarter 2019 earnings review call. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin your conference. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital, and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn you over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. This morning, we reported earnings of $4.9 billion for the third quarter of 2019. Our earnings per share of $2.07 were 20% higher than a year ago. Our return on tangible common equity was 12.2%, bringing our year-to-date return to 12%, which remains our target for the year. We also had loan and deposit growth for the 15th consecutive quarter. We, again, saw a balanced underlying growth in Global Consumer Banking with a 4% increase in revenues, and EBIT growth of 17%. In North America, growth in our branded cards business accelerated to 11% from last year. Deposit momentum continued with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels as we leveraged our brand and scale in credit cards to drive deeper, multiproduct relationships with our clients. Internationally, EBIT was up 26%, excluding the gain on sale last year. In Mexico, we continue to manage through a slower growth environment through expense and credit discipline. In Asia, investor sentiment continued to improve, resulting in higher Wealth Management revenues. Our institutional clients group also had balanced performance with solid results in both the market-sensitive and accrual-type businesses. Our share gains continued at Investment Banking, while our Markets performance showed resilience due to strong client engagement. The backbone of our global network, Treasury & Trade Solutions, had strong revenue growth of 7% in constant dollars, while the Private Bank grew as well. In addition to achieving stronger business performance, we remain focused on improving the returns we deliver to our shareholders through our capital planning. Consistent with the commitment we made in 2017, we remain on pace to return over $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over a three-year period, which ends next year. The plan includes significant buybacks, which have lowered our common shares outstanding by 259 million shares or 11% in the last year alone. Combined with 6% growth in net income, they've helped drive our tangible book value per share up 12%. For now, we're focused on closing out the year and planning for 2020. The environment is highly unpredictable given how much of it is at the mercy of political machinations, whether it's trade negotiations or even the elusive resolution on Brexit. We'll keep our -- we'll help keep our clients -- we will help our clients navigate these choppy waters while also being flexible and adaptable when it comes to our own resource allocation. Despite it all, we remain committed to investing in the products in which we see the best growth opportunities as well as in our own infrastructure for the purpose of safety and soundness. We have the leading global network and we're going to maximize our competitive advantages. I'll now turn it over to Mark and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on Slide 3, net income of $4.9 billion in the third quarter grew 6% from last year and EPS grew 20%, mostly driven by a decline in our average diluted shares outstanding, as we've continued to buy back shares throughout the year, consistent with our capital plan. Revenues of $18.6 billion grew 1% from the prior year and were up 2% excluding the roughly $250 million gain on the sale of our asset management business in Mexico last year, reflecting solid results across both our consumer and institutional businesses. Expenses increased 1% year-over-year as volume growth, along with continued investments in the franchise were partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind-down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer, while overall credit quality remained stable. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 18%, better than our outlook reflecting discrete tax items. The discrete tax items equate to a benefit of $0.10 per share this quarter. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been roughly 22%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 4% year-over-year to $692 billion, as 5% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets and deposits grew 9% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises. Looking at year-to-date results on slide 4. Revenues were up 3% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX as well as the roughly $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio in the first quarter of 2018 and the previously mentioned gain on the asset management business in Mexico. Overall, consumer revenues have grown 4%, roughly in line with our medium-term expectations. On the institutional side, revenues are up 2% year-to-date with continued growth in our accrual businesses. Expenses declined 1% year-to-date even as we continued to make critical investments in our franchise and underlying pretax earnings grew by 4%. EPS grew 17%, and we generated an RoTCE of 12%, in line with our expectations for the full year. Turning now to the businesses. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. The consumer business showed continued momentum in the third quarter. Excluding the gain last year, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings. And looking at year-to-date results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 12% growth in pretax earnings. Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail. Third quarter revenues of $5.4 billion were up 4% from last year. During the quarter, we continued to make progress towards a more integrated client-centric relationship model. Our deposit momentum continued to improve. Year-to-date total net deposit inflows more than tripled compared with last year with strength across both traditional and digital channels. We've seen accelerating growth in deposits raised through digital channels. We generated nearly $2 billion in digital deposit sales in the third quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to over $4 billion. Consistent with our strategy to drive towards national scale in retail, nearly two-thirds of these deposit sales were outside of our existing branch footprint. And of this amount, roughly half were with card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us. Our experience to date gives us confidence in our digital capabilities and engagement model, and provides a solid foundation for deepening of these relationships over time. And while most of the products we've introduced so far have leveraged our proprietary products and reward programs, you'll see us expand into more partner programs as we move forward. Turning now to the results of the individual businesses. Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion were down 2% year-over-year, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposit growth accelerated to 3% year-over-year. And looking at average deposits and assets under management in aggregate, we grew customer balances by 5%. Turning to Branded Cards. Revenues of $2.3 billion grew 11% year-over-year. Client engagement remained strong, with purchase sales up 7% and average loan growth improved to 3%. We continued to generate higher growth in interest earning balances this quarter, up 9%. This growth in interest-earning balances drove a year-over-year improvement in our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans to 914 basis points this quarter. Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion grew 1% driven by organic loan growth. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 2% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses. Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 9% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. Our NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services were 312 basis points and 477 basis points, respectively, this quarter, consistently with our full year guidance. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Third quarter revenues of $3.3 billion grew 4%, excluding the previously mentioned gain on sale last year. On this basis, Latin America Consumer revenues grew 3%. Loan and deposit growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter, reflecting the current environment where we are seeing a deceleration in GDP growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes. But importantly, we are managing expenses carefully and maintaining credit discipline in order to preserve profitability and returns, as seen again this quarter in our strong EBIT growth year-over-year. Turning to Asia. Consumer revenues grew 5% in the third quarter. We continue to see strong growth in our underlying wealth management drivers in Asia with 9% growth in Citigold clients and 7% growth in net new money versus last year. In total, operating expenses were largely unchanged in the third quarter as efficiency savings offset investment spending and volume-driven growth. And cost of credit was down 12%, reflecting a modest LLR release relative to a build in the prior year. Slide 8 shows our global consumer credit trends in more detail. Credit remained favorable again this quarter with NCL and delinquency rates broadly stable across regions. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $9.5 billion were up 3% in the third quarter, reflecting continued momentum in TTS and the Private Bank, combined with strong performance in Investment Banking and stability in fixed income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets and corporate lending. Total banking revenues of $5 billion were up 3%. Treasury & Trade Solutions revenues of $2.4 billion were up 6% as reported and 7% in constant dollars, as we continued to see strong client engagement and solid growth in transaction volumes, partially offset by spread compression. We would expect the underlying business drivers to continue to perform well in TTS, given our unique global footprint and ability to deliver integrated solutions to our multinational clients despite continued uncertainty around the macro environment. Investment Banking revenues of $1.2 billion were up 4% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting continued strength in debt underwriting and strong performance in M&A, particularly in EMEA. Private Bank revenues of $867 million were up 2% driven by higher lending and deposit volumes as well as increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression. And Corporate Lending revenues of $527 million were down 6% reflecting lower spreads and higher hedging costs. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion were up 1% from last year. Fixed Income revenues were roughly flat, although we did see better activity with both corporate and investor clients, as well as a solid quarter in rates and currencies particularly in G10 rates. Equity's revenues were down 4%, primarily reflecting lower client activity and lower balances in prime brokerage, partially offset by strong client activity in derivatives. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars, reflecting higher volumes from new and existing clients. Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 4% year-over-year, as investments, volume-driven growth and higher compensation costs were partially offset by efficiency savings. And credit quality remains strong, consistent with our target client strategy. Looking at year-to-date results in ICG, our operating margin improved by 1% as solid results in TTS and strength in Investment Banking were offset by the decline in Equity Markets' revenues. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $402 million declined 18% from last year, reflecting the wind-down of legacy assets. Expenses increased 6%, reflecting higher infrastructure costs, partially offset by the wind-down of legacy assets. And the pretax loss was $68 million this quarter in line with our outlook. Looking ahead, we would expect a pretax loss in the range of $100 million to $150 million in Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter as we continued to invest in infrastructure and controls. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue. Split between our Markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding Markets on the top of the slide. As you can see, year-to-date net interest revenue grew by 4% or roughly $1.3 billion year-over-year in constant dollars, driven by 5% growth ex-Markets, reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS as well as the absence of the FDIC surcharge. Looking at results for the quarter, net interest revenue was roughly flat year-over-year and declined by roughly $250 million sequentially, reflecting the impact of lower Markets' net interest revenue. And net interest margin declined 11 basis points sequentially, also driven by the lower Markets' net interest revenue. However, it is important to note that the decline in Markets' net interest revenue is almost fully offset by higher noninterest revenue in Markets this quarter shown at the bottom of this slide. And turning to total noninterest revenue for total Citigroup, this quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth in noninterest revenue of roughly $350 million, driven by growth across the franchise, including higher Markets' noninterest revenue even as we faced the headwind of the $250 million gain last year, all of which gives us confidence in our ability to deliver better growth next quarter in noninterest revenue. So, while we did see pressure in net interest revenues, driven by the dynamic seen this quarter in Markets, which could continue into the fourth quarter, in total for Citigroup, we remain comfortable in our ability to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, driven by net interest revenue growth of 2% to 3% in constant dollars for the full year below our original forecast, given the dynamic I just mentioned in Markets, but offset by higher noninterest revenue, which should be better than our original forecast of at least flat to 2018 on a full year basis. So again, in aggregate, for total Citigroup, we still expect to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2019 on a reported basis, but the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. In the third quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 12% year-over-year to $69.03, driven by net income and the lower share count. And our CET1 ratio declined sequentially to 11.6% as net income was offset by $6.3 billion of total common share buybacks and dividends along with an increase in risk weighted assets. Before we go to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. In ICG, Markets and Investment Banking revenues should reflect the overall environment, but we are not anticipating a repeat of the challenging trading environment seen in the fourth quarter of last year. And in our accrual businesses, revenues should benefit from continued strong client engagement and higher volumes. However, we would expect this to be somewhat offset by spread compression given the lower interest rate environment. In consumer, we expect continued year-over-year revenue growth in all regions, driven by continued loan and deposit growth, partially offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads. For total Citigroup, expenses should decline sequentially, cost of credit should continue to grow modestly, and importantly we expect solid pre-tax earnings growth year-over-year. Finally, we expect a tax rate of approximately 22%, absent any discrete tax items. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. Mark Mason : Good morning. Glenn Schorr : I wonder if I could just get a follow-up on Branded Cards, the 11% growth in the quarter. Can you talk about -- or give us a breakdown of where that's being derived, what you're doing to incent that growth? I think I heard your comment about where part of the relationship is coming in, and how you're growing in the bank on non-bank customers through the card portfolio, but just focus specifically around the 11% growth in Branded Cards, talk about balance transfer and how the box you're writing to? Thank you. Sorry about that jumbled question. Mark Mason : That's okay. Thank you. So I guess what I would point you on Branded Cards is a couple of things. One, we're seeing, as we've mentioned on a number of quarters now, the conversion from promotional-type offerings that we've made and balances to average interest earning balances. And so this is a continuation of customers that we have that we brought on a couple of years ago through promotional offerings who weren't paying any interest to now converting to interest earning balances. And that's fueling part of the growth. You'll see purchase sales are up 7% in the quarter. You'll see the loan volumes are up as well. And so we're getting continued use of the card, top of wallet use, as evidenced by those purchase sales and the benefit of them now being interest earning balances for us. And that should -- that's been the case for the past number of quarters. We'd expect that to continue to play out in the fourth quarter and continue to get some spread benefits. But likely going forward well into 2020, the benefits will continue to play out from a volume point of view. So volume growth will continue to be an important factor as well. Glenn Schorr : And what you're doing on the promotional balances offers? I've just noted some long 21-month type offers out there. I just don't know if that's a growing percentage of the book or just tweaking at the margin? Mark Mason : We've now -- we've kind of reached the mix, our desired mix of promotional balances that we're looking to have in the portfolio. Now what you would imagine is once you strike that balance between promotional and the interest earnings, you've got to maintain that balance, which means we'll continue to do promotional offerings going forward at the pace we've been running at in order to maintain that mix. And as those promotional balances mature, they ultimately convert into interest earning. And so they fuel kind of a go-forward growth and they're important parts of -- or I'd say important part of our investment strategy as we execute on the Branded Cards strategy. Glenn Schorr : Got it. And then maybe a last follow-up on that, the flip side of that is, I know, that desire to deepen existing card relationships and convert card customers that don't have other banking relationships with you. What exactly are you doing to penetrate that? It sounds like it's starting to work. Mark Mason : Yes. So, it is starting to work. I think I referenced earlier the growth in digital deposit sales and referenced that. In fact, a good portion of that is coming from card customers who previously did not have a retail banking relationship with us. We are, yeah, as we think about investments we've made in technology and our ability to mine the data that we have of our customers, we're able to create value propositions that they're likely to respond to and open-up a retail banking account with us. So for example, we know which of our card customers enjoy and prefer our ThankYou rewards programs and which of our card customers respond to many of the other programs that we offer from a rewards point of view. And so we're able to create packages for them that reward them with benefits they respond to like ThankYou points, if they're willing to open a retail banking account with us digitally, and clients are responding. And so our ability to mine that data, to create value propositions around things that our clients are motivated to has \u2013 or motivated with has resulted in the growth that we're speaking to now. Mike Corbat : And I think the other piece of that, Glenn, is so far we have done that exclusively with our own proprietary products. But in the not-too-distant future, we'll be rolling that out to some of our co-brand as well as some of our retail partners. So I think we've got the ability to continue to expand on that. Mark Mason : Yes. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks so much. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald from Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning, guys. I wanted to ask about the RoTCE targets. Mark, just want to confirm, for 2019, still feeling good about 12% or a darn close to 12% for this year given your fourth quarter outlook. And then for next year, obviously for both of you, the environments gotten tougher we all know that and 13.5%, your prior target for RoTCE, feels ambitious in this environment. Mark, you acknowledged that at the Barclays conference. But how are you guys going to think about it as you go through your planning? And what's the target for kind of 2020 as your balance wanting to show improvement on RoTCE versus what might be a more difficult environment? Mark Mason : Sure. So, first thing, your first point, John, the 12% remains our target. As you pointed out, we are \u2013 we did 12.2% RoTCE this quarter, and we're at 12% year-to-date. And so that remains the target, and we feel as though we'll get to that number or darn close, as I've said now and you've said as well. In terms of the 13.5% for 2020, I've said it at the Barclays, and I'll say it again and Mike alluded to it. It's a very different environment than I think we expected kind of coming into the year. There's a fair amount of uncertainty that remains. 13.5% remains the target, but we are now in the midst of our budgeting process. And we need to factor in the uncertainty that's in the environment, what that's likely to look like, or how that's likely to play out, what the impact \u2013 the full year impact in 2020 of the rate reductions might be, what we think client demand is going to look like. And there are puts and takes there in parts of the business. There'll be pressure from some of these uncertainty and parts of the business like Markets, there could be some positives as we see volatility persist. And so we really need to get through the budgeting process to both understand what we think that top line is likely to look like, understand what levers we have available to us to pull in order to continue to demonstrate progress, and see what we might be able to do to narrow that gap and deliver on our targets. Mike Corbat : And I think as Mark alluded to, John, the other thing that I very much want to do is get the benefit of continuing to talk to our clients in terms of how they're thinking about things. Not just \u2013 I think as you probably heard more broadly this morning in terms of the U.S., but when you globally look at the consumer, consumer's in fine shape. We saw the IMF come out this morning and revise growth downward. I would describe that probably more as a catch-up to where many of us have been than necessarily any new information, i.e. 3% global growth. So not as high as we'd like it to be, but 3% global growth is still growth. And so I think a lot of it really depends of how our clients see themselves positioning in terms of CapEx, in terms of investment spend, in terms of hiring. And I don't think we want to be premature in any way in either direction of reading too much into that. And so we want to get our businesses in a room. We want to continue to gain information from our clients, not just here in the U.S., but around the world in terms of how they're thinking about things. And I think as the past several years have shown, last year is a great example. The closer we can get to the year as opposed to kind of prejudging this early before we declare anything, I think, the better and more informed we'll be able to come back. John McDonald : And I guess just to push you guys a little bit. The absolute level of RoTCE is quite a bit below peers. And I think, what most people would think, your franchise should be able to do on paper. With that in mind, even in this environment, Mike, do you hope to push to do better than you do in 2019? Like is that as a -- as a goal that you think is definitely reachable to do better next year than this year? Mike Corbat : Absolutely. I think we've got to continue to show progress and we've got to continue to narrow that gap. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : Good morning guys. Just maybe first on ICG a little bit. I was a little surprised; expenses were up quarter-over-quarter, despite revenues being down. It was -- I know you had taken some severance in the first quarter, and I thought the messaging was that you'd start to see those expenses come out in the back half of the year. Was it just volume; was it investment or any other severance in there? How do we think about the trajectory in ICG expenses? Mark Mason : Sure. So yes, the expenses were up 4%. There are investments that we're making in the ICG, particularly in our TTS business and how we improve the client experience and deepen some of those client relationships and those investments obviously are critically important. There are some volume-driven growth tied to it, largely around transactional expenses. And then there are some compensation costs as well. So there's the higher performance from a base compensation point of view. There's some strategic hires that we've made in parts of the franchise. And then lastly and you alluded to it, but it certainly played out in this quarter as well, as we've seen pressure on some of the wallets, and as we've thought about kind of the long-term -- or longer-term business model and benefits from technology that will play out, we've made some capacity adjustments. And those capacity adjustments obviously come with a cost. And so that is part of the -- what you see in the quarter as well in that 4% increase. Jim Mitchell : So you feel that even in a lower growth, that negative growth, lower growth environment, you can still get the operating leverage over the intermediate term? Mark Mason : So we think we -- look, I mean obviously in adjusting the capacity here, we're going to see some benefits of that play out in 2020. What will matter obviously is the topline and how wallets continue to evolve and how much share we're able to continue to capture. But we think we will continue to be able to run the business efficiently and perform accordingly. Jim Mitchell : Right, fair enough. And then maybe just on deposits. Really strong growth on a period end basis particularly on ICG. Is that sort of end of quarter balance sheet positioning by some of your clients and that's rolling off? Or do you think that's sort of some sustainable growth? And if so, what's driving that? Mark Mason : We actually -- you're right. We did see strong growth in deposits across the board in TTS specifically as well. It's across all regions in TTS. Frankly, it's with both new and existing clients. The majority of the deposit growth consisted of operating deposits, which is good. And frankly, about a 1/4 of the growth in operating deposits were from new or renewed clients. And so we're actively engaged with our clients. We're seeing opportunities to roll out our broad solution with them and we think that is likely to continue. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Great. That's helpful. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. Mike Corbat : Hey, Mike. Mike Mayo : First, look, you're running revenues faster than expenses. This was the 12th quarter in a row that you didn't call it out that what I think, I estimate you made it year-over-year by one-fifth of 1% of revenues, revenues grew faster than expenses. So you made it. But -- so the question is, growing revenue's faster than expenses, when you look back a bit ago, you were kind of doing it by like a touchdown or 2. And then it went down to a couple of field goals. Now it seems like you're exceeding it by an extra point to push the analogy. So the question is, how confident are you to continue that strength of revenues growing faster than expenses year-over-year? And what is the role of technology in helping you do so? Mark Mason : I'll take the first one? Mike Corbat : Yeah, okay. Mark Mason : So look, you're right, we have reflected positive operating margin. We expect that to continue for the full year of 2019. And as we've talked about when we described both 2019 and 2020, we've talked about plus or minus GDP growth on the top line, roughly flat expenses. And we expect to deliver that for 2019. So yes, positive operating leverage and operating margin is what we're expecting to deliver. Mike, you want to take the technology? Mike Corbat : Sure. Well, I think there's a couple of pieces I'd add to it. So one here, Mike, I think is if you go and you look at the numbers, I would say, relatively, quietly, as Mark alluded to over the past year, our head count was down by about 7,000, so somewhere between 3% and 4%. That has been almost exclusively focused on capacity at the front end. It hasn't really been focused or aimed at infrastructure. And so when we came into the year, what we told you was we would be going at every lever and looking at all the things that we could do. And I think this year, we've done that. I think clearly, technology, when you go back to slide 23 and look at our consumer business and some of the drivers around contact rates, digital mobile engagement, e-statement penetration, all of those moving, I think, very nicely in the right direction. And those continue to give us that only cost benefits, but as or more importantly, service benefits in terms of the reactions to those. So, I'm guessing, Mike, that given what's out there, that 2020 will continue to be a year where everything's on the table. We're going to kind of look at the multitude of those levers and we're going to kind of pull at those as we see fit, but at the same time not sacrificing the investments that we need to make to either maintain or continue to attempt to build competitive advantages in the U.S. and around the world. Mark Mason : The only thing I'd add to that is -- so if you think about technology and its benefits and how they manifest themselves, one, as it relates to the offerings that we're able to create for our clients, so our ability to create solutions around our clients' problems. You think about TTS as a good example. And as we deal with clients, and for example, they tried to match invoices with payments, we've been able to use technology in partnership with companies like HighRadius to create capabilities surround that. So technology helps with our offerings. Technology helps with the client experience, as Mike suggested in terms of the lower costs to serve, but also improving the way and the experience that our clients have with us. And then finally, technology helps with the efficiency of how we run our operations. So expanding our cloud infrastructure, removing legacy data centers and physical service, using automation, for example. So a number of different buckets are impacted by the technology spend that we make, and we'll continue to make that spend in light of those benefits. Mike Mayo : And then just one follow-up, as it relates to -- and I know John asked the question about your RoTCE target. I mean, I guess I'll ask -- I'll make it easier and harder for you. I guess, the easier thing is look, under you, Mike Corbat, the RoTCE really has gone up quite a bit, 7%, 8%, up to 12% over a few years. So that's tremendous progress, but you still lag peers. And I don't think consensus expects you to get your 13.5% target. I think you're kind of -- what I'm hearing you say today is everything's on the table, but let's look at it in light of the new environment. So assume it might not be 13.5%. So I guess we'll have to wait till the fourth quarter unless you just want to confirm that now. But look, as long as it's getting better, you're moving the right direction, that's good. I guess what irks me though is, this year's target of 12%, when you say we'll get darn close. And I know you're competitive, both of you are, your whole firm's competitive. But to be darn close, I mean, let's just get the target. Everything that you can possibly do, everyone at the firm should know that 12% RoTCE is what you're striving for. It's just that sense of intensity, even if you have it internally, it's just -- I'm not feeling it on this side of the perspective. So if you could just give us a sense of the degree of that intensity? And I guess, lastly, I mean two years ago, you said our restructuring is over. So if you have a worst-in-class RoTCE versus your U.S. peers, either the issue is management or model. So it's either management intensity needs to pick up or maybe you need to retract the statement that a restructuring is over and take out a new fresh look? So that's my last question. Mike Corbat : Okay. So what I would say, Mike, is that you're right, Mark and I are competitive. We are intense people. The firm is completely focused on this. But just like last year's fourth quarter, when I know you were disappointed, what I don't want to commit to is in some environment, having to do things that don't make sense for the long-term. As an example, could we have cut and slashed and gotten our way last year to our efficiency target? Yes, we could have. In light of the rebound we saw this year, would those have been the right decisions? I don't believe that at all to be the case. And so we are committed to the 12% within the realm of what makes sense for our firm, and in particular, for our shareholders over the intermediate to longer term. And I think you've seen again in this quarter, we're pulling every lever we need to get there, but we're trying to do it smart. And you have my commitment, Mark's commitment, we're going to continue to do that to -- everything we can to deliver that 12%. Mark Mason : I completely agree with that. I guess though, the one thing I\u2019d add just to highlight the point is that we're, obviously, trying to run this firm for its long-term sustainability and for the shareholder value that we can create. And that means making the smart decisions through the quarter around how we spend money and around how we evolve that model. So, what I mean by that is if you think about what we talked about in the way of capacity adjustments that we've had to make and the repositioning around that, those are increased expenses that we're having to take in the quarter and through the year. A short-minded view of that would be that that is against the 12% target that we're trying to deliver. When you're trying to run a firm for the long-term sustainability, you take those decisions because they're the right decisions to do and you realize that over time, they will pay dividends and benefits to the franchise. And so, yes, without a doubt, 12% is our target. People know that up and down in this firm. But we're going to run the firm responsibly. So hopefully that makes sense, Mike. Mike Mayo : Yes, all right. Thank you. Operator : Saul, your line is open. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi. This is Saul Martinez. So I wanted to also ask about 2020. I realize there's a high level of uncertainty in the macro outlook. You're going through your budgeting process currently. But given what you know about your current rate sensitivity, what the forward curve is telling you right now where long rates are at, what you're seeing in the economy, how confident are you that some revenue is still the base case for 2020 -- some revenue growth target is still the base case for next year? Mark Mason : Yes, Saul. Thank you. We're -- like you said, we're pulling that together as part of the budget process. We do know, as you suggested that there will be a full year impact to the rate reductions that we've have seen thus far through the year and any additional rate reductions that we see in the balance of the year, and so that's going to be a headwind that we got to face off. That said, there is certainty around that direction that we've seen play out. There's been FX volatility through the year that has caused a markets reaction in terms of that volatility, generating client activity. And I bring that up because there are puts and takes that play out across our businesses as the market evolves. And there's still uncertainty around trade and how much progress we continue to make through the year on that topic. There's still uncertainty around Brexit and what happens there. And so, as those things get hopefully finalized or additional decisions get made, those will be factors that we've got to consider as we look at 2020 and pull that plan together and before we're able to speak to what that target is from an RoTCE point of view or what levers we can pull to get to that target. And so, it is still in progress, I guess is how I'd have to respond to that Saul. Saul Martinez : Okay. No I get that and I wasn't too much asking specifically about RoTCE, but just the topline and whether the degree of confidence that there could actually be some growth because that would -- that obviously -- in this environment the fact that you are less rate sensitive than a lot of your peers does differentiate you. But okay... Mark Mason : And I do -- I mean I do -- we do expect to see continued growth in our cards business. We do expect to see continued growth in our global consumer franchise. So, as we reference kind of those core components to the franchise if you will into our network businesses, we do expect continued momentum there, but we do have to factor in some of these headwinds and unknowns. Saul Martinez : Got it. Let me change gears a little bit and ask you about CECL and not the day one impact. I know you guys for some time have given the estimated day one impact of CECL and a range there. But how should we think about the day two impact on loan loss provisioning going forward? Credit losses are credit losses over the life of the loan. They will be the same regardless of the accounting framework, but there are a lot of puts and takes. Your starting point, ALLL ratio will be higher, but given level of charge-offs will mean more provisioning and mix plays an important role. And it seems like, you are growing in higher loss content lending in the U.S. But have you thought about how CECL in an environment where maybe things don't really deteriorate much where we don't have a big change of the macro backdrop towards the team, how CECL impacts your ongoing level of provisioning going forward and so just kind of maybe thinking through some of the puts and takes of that? Mark Mason : Yes. So we haven't given any guidance on day two as you said. Obviously, the composition of the balance of the portfolio in any given quarter is going to be an important factor in estimating what that impact will be. We obviously have a mix of both consumer loans and corporate loans and so, all of those factors will come into play. I guess, what I would say is, as we thought about our forecast and we factored in what the longer-term impact would be of CECL, but we haven't given any particular guidance and I can't really speak to it any more specifically than that. Saul Martinez : Okay. All right. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks so much guys. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator, who is next? Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven, your line is open. Steven Chubak : Thanks very much. So, wanted to start off with a question on NII. Mark, I was hoping you could speak to some of the factors that pressured the markets related to NII specifically. As I think back over the last two to three years as rates were rising, higher funding costs were consistently highlighted as a drag on your liability-sensitive trading book. Now with rates declining, we're really not seeing that benefit from lower funding costs on the way down and I was hoping you could help us unpack what's happening on the trading side. Why the book isn't acting a little bit more liability sensitive? And should we see any funding benefit over time as the Fed continues easing? Mark Mason : Yes. So, I think -- look I think it's -- if you turn the page that page 11 kind of highlighted the mix that -- the dynamic that you're referencing and that I spoke to which is that, we're obviously seeing lower NIR on our -- from our Markets business that's completely -- that's being completely offset in markets non-NIR. And while you're right, that we have talked about funding costs and its impact and there is a funding cost benefit that plays through as rates come down, the dynamic around the markets revenues is overshadowing that, if you will. So, this mix impact is more significant than the funding cost/benefit that we're seeing. So, an example of this, the first thing I'd say is that as you would imagine, we manage our Markets business not for NIR and non-NIR but for total revenues and so that composition and that mix can and has varied. The NIR component is a function of the client demand and how traders manage the risk and fund positions, and so that is essentially what we're seeing play out here. So, one example of that is we could be long in asset that generates interest revenue, long for example because we have an -- we have inventory in place to facilitate that client activity. We could hedge that position with a derivative, and that impact of that hedge was hidden on NIR in principal transactions. And so it's that type of positioning that is impacting the mix and this mix is overshadowing the funding cost/benefit. Steven Chubak : Got it. But I guess thinking -- even taking a more holistic view, looking at principal transactions plus NII as the key trading proxy, it sounds like you should still see some benefit on the funding side over time as rates do come down. But the geography, I'd assume, may be different. Mark Mason : The geography may be different. Again, we are seeing a funding benefit. It's just being overshadowed. Steven Chubak : Got it. Okay. And just one more follow-up from me. On the retail bank strategy, you highlight some of the progress growing deposits through the legacy card channel and digital sales. You also alluded to the possibility of maybe forging new partnerships to build further scale and I was hoping if you could speak to maybe what some of those partnerships might look like. And then just bigger picture, as you think about the need to add scale to the U.S. retail franchise, whether it might make more sense to grow inorganically, and is that even a viable option given your current size or the current share of industry liabilities that you currently retain? Mike Corbat : Sure. I'm not, on this call, going to speak to specific names, but in the not-too-distant future, you will see us coming out. And you know our portfolio of world-class partners in our co-brands and in our Retail Services businesses and we've been working with a number of them on new value propositions around those offerings. Again, very similar to the ways that we've rolled out our own propriety products and so in the not-too-distant future, you'll hear more coming on that. Steven Chubak : And then bigger picture, just the retail bank strategy and appetites maybe growing organically. Mike Corbat : It depends on your definition of inorganic and so again, if we continue to find, as an example, portfolios of loans or cards or those types of things that we can acquire and fit from a client demography perspective, fit from a business line perspective and obviously are accretive to our returns, wide open to it. In terms of being out there buying a national consumer bank, I don't see that today but -- in particular, given where some valuations are and I think given what's at stake on the digital side of things but -- again, never dismiss it. But we're very focused on the things that we can do organically, our investment in digital. And again, I think you've seen what we've done there in terms of on the consumer side, the institutional side, using the digital strategy to not just reinforce but continue to grow our franchise. Steven Chubak : Great. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika, please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Just a few follow-up questions. On Chubak's questions with regard to net interest revenue, could you remind us on -- clearly, there's been a lot of volatility in terms of yield curve expectations? And could you remind us in terms of how your balance sheet is positioned today, what the sensitivity is to 25 basis points of rate cuts? Mark Mason : Sure. So, we've talked about this in the past in terms of if you look at the IRE that we have in the -- in our 10-Qs. For the third quarter, you'll see that, that won't have materially changed. So, the simple math is that a 25-basis-point cut would result in a reduction of $50 million. Now, that is the simple math. And the impact is, in fact, greater than what that math would imply. And it's greater because the IRE analysis is based on a parallel shift and we've certainly seen flattening of the curve as well as the pace of the cuts is faster. And the impact on deposit pricing sensitivity obviously is an important factor. So, we got a curve that's flatter and lower than expected. And the impact of the future cuts will kind of depend on the pace and the shape of the curve and the competitive environment. So those are all factors that influence that simple math, but the simple math has not changed. Erika Najarian : Okay. Got it. And just a follow-up to Glenn's question earlier, year-over-year growth in Branded Card revenues of 11%, you noted, Mark, that you're sort of at the right shift in terms of the mix in that portfolio. And as we think about 2020, should growth in Branded Cards revenue more reflect the sort of mid-single-digit loan growth that you've been showing? Mark Mason : Yes, we would expect that volume at that pace would be the major driver. There still be \u2013 there may still be a little bit of spread, but it will be mostly volume at the pace you've seen taking off at this stage or picking up at this stage. Erika Najarian : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt, please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Matt O'Connor: You're obviously one of the most global banks, and given all the trade uncertainty, there is naturally a perception that you're impacted by all this more than others. And was wondering, one, if you could just talk about that in terms of what areas you think it is maybe dragging down some of the business. And then, two, I think in the past, you talked about there are some puts and takes. So if you do less trade with one country, there are some offsets with some others. So just try to elaborate on some of those circumspect? Mike Corbat : Sure. I think that without a doubt, and this was reinforced, Matt, a few weeks ago when I was in China, that in certain economies around the world, tariffs, trade tensions have certainly impacted trade. It's impacted in two ways. One, from a volume perspective, I think we see less trade in movement today. And I think the second way, which you alluded to, is that we've also seen the rerouting of trade. And the example, we gave is today, China is not necessarily consuming less soy. It's just getting its soy from different places in the world. And so I think our ability as a global bank to move with our clients on both sides in terms of the importer and exporter and to be helping them rethink what those trade routes and what that supply chain looks like, I think we've been very effective at. And I think the other piece that, I don't think any of us can escape is that at least for right now with some of these uncertainties it has caused a slowdown in terms of trade. I think our businesses have shown a good resiliency. And again, our trade is included as part of our TTS numbers. But to Mark's earlier point, if we can start to get some clarity on some of these things where I think businesses can have a little bit more surety of \u2013 in terms of the future, I think our trade business would definitely benefit from that. Matt O'Connor: And do you think \u2013 obviously, this could to be a directional negative, I think, on the revenue in the near-term here. But do you think it kind of increased the relationship you have with all your global corporates, right? Because you're one of the few banks out there that can kind of shift to some of the trade mix and just let's you kind of flex maybe more of your muscles than if trade wasn't so complicated? Mike Corbat : I think that's right. Our ability to be in the room not just trade, but more broadly define supply chain management, really what that means in terms of a lot of companies today that operate in kind of this just-in-time inventory is critical. And as an example, what we've seen out of the China mix is trade routes with Vietnam and India being a couple of the beneficiaries of that. And I think our ability to move with our clients in terms of what that means has us pretty well positioned out there and it something we're obviously wanting to make sure we're in the room and is part of. Mark Mason : And I think we're uniquely positioned to be part of that dialogue, just given the globality in our presence in over 98 countries, et cetera so. Matt O'Connor: Great. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy, please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions, one just wanted to understand how you're thinking about GSIB surcharge size. Because I think you're a little bit above where you were in December. Does that matter to you? Not sure if it does. Mark Mason : Sure. So we are obviously -- in December, we were at a 3%. We are targeting being at a 3% again for 2019. Where we're at in that bucket does matter as capital implications if you think about how it fits into our TCE requirement. So it absolutely matters and we're targeting being at a 3% by the end of the year. Betsy Graseck : And is there anything in particular that you have to do to get there? Or is it just normal course? Mark Mason : Well, I mean we obviously we\u2019ll look at client demand that we have. We'll look at returns for the use of the balance sheet that we have. And our primary objective obviously would be to meet client demand where we can grow and do so with returns that make sense for the franchise, and so that's kind of a primary objective. We think we can do that through the balance of this year and deliver as a 3% GSIB bank. If we start to see in the future growth that takes us beyond that, we want to be thoughtful and responsible about, how we capture that and ensure that we're getting the commensurate returns that make sense. But we're actively managing how we're using the balance sheet, how we're engaged with our clients. And where it makes sense to put on higher returning assets, we're doing so. And where it makes sense to reduce those that are lower returning, we're doing so. And it's that dynamic that we'll manage to get to where we need to be for the end of the year. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Okay, thanks Mark. So Mike, question just on the consumer business, a little bit broader. You're a nationwide business in card, and you are a little bit more targeted -- well, you used to be nationwide in mortgage. Now you're more targeted around your customer set. I know you're looking to move into different geographies. You have the deposit and you've got some wealth. And I'm just trying to understand how you think about that footprint and that collection of businesses. And is -- maybe give us -- help us understand the strategic angle and where you're taking the U.S. business, where you want to take the U.S. business over in the next, say, three years or so. Does deposit lead first into new geographies and then you fill them with other products? Or is -- maybe you can loop in some of the inorganic discussion that you have before? Mike Corbat : Well I would say, today, it is primarily organic than it is fundamentally technology-driven. So using some of the things you cited that you saw, one, today from a physical presence, we've got 6 large presences across the United States. But as you referenced, we've got truly a national cards franchise. And depending whether you cut the line at our proprietary network or you go to some of our co-brand and retail partners, we're touching as many as 70 million consumers across the United States, virtually in every state. And I think as Mark referenced in the numbers and some of the experiments that we've doing on the deposit site, our ability to grow outside of footprint of the deposits brought in not just in the quarter, but really year-to-date, 2/3 of those brought in outside of those six markets. Of those deposits that were brought in; over 50% of those deposits were brought in by people who do not have the relationship -- the depository relationship with the bank. And so, I think our ability to continue to build on that will be smart around the advantage we have, and that is that we know these people. When you think about proprietary perspective or you think about the length of some of our co-brand relationships and what we know, we know where you live, we know what you spend, we know how much you earn. And by the way, we know who your bank is and we can be targeting people around that. So we think there's a real opportunity in many ways. We think it's very much a unique opportunity because there's really no bank out there that has the same national presence that we have from our cards portfolio. So again, not just from a proprietary perspective, but how do we engage with our partners and how do we create the right value propositions in each direction. And I think we've got a good plan against that, and you're going to be seeing more of that in the not-too-distant future. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Because it does feel like great brand value, maybe a little bit underlevered in the revenue line here; and so, I'm just wondering, do you build on that with incremental products like mortgage across these different geographies, kind of going back to where you were pre-crisis where you were much more nationwide and a much broader set of products? Mike Corbat : And again, I wouldn't rule out \u2013 and we've been asked, Betsy, I wouldn't rule out branch openings and changing that number from six to something higher. But first, it's going to come through digital engagement. And from that digital engagement, you'll likely see us start or build on that relationship off of the card through a deposit relationship. And then like most people that are in the digital space, you continue to add on to that. And so for us, let's make sure the value proposition works. I think we're seeing that. Let's build on that. And then as we have success, open to building more branches and areas where that makes sense and certainly open to adding more products. Betsy Graseck : Okay. Thanks Mike. Operator : And your next question is from the line of Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Marty, please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks. I have two questions. One is we looked at the \u2013 going back to the financial markets, kind of in an odd number. Isn't it also that as the inversion of the yield curve when long rates come down, the assets that are in the inventory are tied to the longer part of the curve, and the funding is tied to the shorter end of the curve. So, the inversion really does have a pretty meaningful impact on your mix revenue in that particular segment. And that also makes a difference because as the Fed catches up with the long end of the curve, that part of your NII can actually see a benefit going forward, which will be different than what you'll see in a normal kind of retail bank. Mark Mason : There are some impact there, but I think less so relative to the mix dynamic that I was describing. So \u2013 but you're right, there is some impact that flows through because of that dynamic. Marty Mosby : Okay. And then kind of looking at the bigger picture not \u2013 in other words, I've been on your side and haven't hit a target, and you have to put a target. And yet when you say the word target, it is a target, right, it is the direction you're going in, which I think is much more important than if I'm 11.9 or 12.1. It's the direction of improvement that you're kind of continuing to be able to go through that path. And if you look at this, and I look at this particular story and investment, creating a tangible book value as a big piece of what I think we hadn't talked about is that tangible book value is up 12% over the last year. So if your tangible book value is growing double digits, you got a 3% dividend that I'd love to know your opinion on whether or not that's defensible through the downturn in the cycle, but I think we set up CCAR to make it defensible So if you have a sustainable dividend, you're growing your tangible book value and you're progression in returns is on the upward trend, then I think trading at tangible book value is a pretty good bargain. So, just wanted to kind of think about those three avenues or those metrics. Mike Corbat : Sure. Mark, why don't we tag team? So one, Marty, I would say that from a dividend perspective, when you look at that, roughly 3% dividend yield, $2.04 a share, a little over two billion shares outstanding, so somewhere slightly north of $4 billion on a net income base in the high-teens. So I think clear sustainability of dividend, and in any reasonable environment, I think ample headroom to continue to take that up. The other piece obviously is the flexibility we have in terms of buyback and the amount that we have there. And we've talked about the components of the combination of earnings, of goodwill, intangible DTA-type usage in there that gives us a bit more capacity, and so again, I think ample flexibility. And as you've said in here, it's not just hitting any particular target, but in and around. And obviously, our primary focus here, which I think we try to use other things as proxies for, is to \u2013 some of the earlier conversations is continuing to on both end, absolute and relative basis, continue to grow our return on tangible common equity, so continue to take that up in any reasonable environment and also continue to close the gap to peers as part of that. Mark Mason : I think that's spot on, Mike. The only thing I'd add to your point around continued progress is if you look back to 2018 and we had a target of a 10.5% RoTCE, we were able to deliver on the 10.9%. We talked about a 12% for this year. We're on track year-to-date to do that. We've talked about returning capital over the three CCAR cycles at $60 billion-plus. We're at $60 billion-plus. And so we are continually trying to demonstrate progress on those very important metrics, not the least of which is this RoTCE, and we plan to continue to do so. Marty Mosby : Yes, and I think the progress and sustainability are the two key words that you talked about there. Continued progress and sustainability of what you've already achieved through any reasonable outcomes is the things that I would \u2013 I just wanted to confirm. So thanks for that. Mark Mason : Agreed. Agreed. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken, please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks a lot. Just a couple of quick ones. It was good to see the overall deposit cost start to turn down this quarter. Can you just talk about deposit strategies from here? And how do you expect the betas to act, especially you're still \u2013 you are putting out that national rate? How are you trying to match off against the lower rate side on the asset side with the deposit cost? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes. Our consumer deposits, while we did get growth in volume there, we did see pressure from a spread point of view. Keep in mind, our U.S. consumer deposit is about $150 billion, and the betas are generally low as it relates to those consumer deposits. And so as \u2013 we're not \u2013 as we saw the rate environment increasing a year or so ago, we didn't see the benefits of that. And so similarly, and we didn't see the impact of that. And so similarly, as we see rate cuts play out, we're not going to see that play through either. And so we kind of low betas on the consumer side likely to continue there. As it relates to pricing, for the high yield savings accounts, for example, which has been part of our growth strategy, just part, we have adjusted pricing for those and for money market accounts. And we've been doing that over the past quarter or so as we've seen interest rates come down, and you should expect that we'll continue to do that to be aligned with the market. Ken Usdin : Okay. And follow-up on the capital side. So you're at 11.6% on CET1. You talked about 11.5% year-end. Rates have obviously been a helper, and the capital return continues underneath. Can you talk about just like what happens post 2019 in terms of your willingness to let the CET1 ratio continue to come down in the context of still seeing a big capital return number and given what the outlook is for earnings underneath? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. So you're right, we did see kind of CET1 come down from second quarter to third quarter. We also saw that last year as well second to third quarter as we start to execute on the capital return that's approved as part of the CCAR cycle. There's somewhat of a natural dip there, but there's also the planning that we've talked to around getting down to what we thought \u2013 what we think is a prudent level of a capital hole, which is about 11.5%. So we are in line, I would say, with our expectations to be roughly at 11.5% by the end of the year. You'll recall that, that 11.5% has a management buffer in it. That buffer is meant to account for some of the uncertainty and volatility and some of the proposals that are still outstanding that could have an impact on capital requirements. But at this stage, without complete clarity on how some of those things change, we feel like 11.5% is still the prudent level at which to run the firm. That means then going into 2020, we will first have to think about client demand and growth juxtaposed against what we're able to generate in the way of net income that will be available to common shareholders and the DTA that we're able to reduce. And based on that reduction of a disallowed DTA, we will be able to determine how much capital we can in fact return to shareholders. And so that's how we'll think about capital return going forward. But the CET1 target at this stage remains at the 11.6% level. Ken Usdin : Thanks Mark. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes, thanks. Yes, I just have two quick questions on expenses here. It sounds like on Mexico, you were kind of managing the efficiency ratio and trying to get that lower. I mean does that mean you've officially decided not to do that last piece of investment? I think you outlined it was $500 million opportunity to pull back on? Mark Mason : Yes. So we \u2013 you're right. We have been managing Mexico very thoughtfully and trying to ensure that we continue to demonstrate EBIT growth there in light of the environment that's there and softer revenues that we've been seeing. The expense management that we're seeing there is in part a byproduct of the investments that we made in the prior year. And so some of those investments were in building out the efficiencies around our operations and so we're starting to see some of those cost saves play out in 2019 and so that is a good thing. We obviously will look at the balance of the investments that are to be made as part of our Mexico strategy and determine how we want to prioritize those and how we want to pace those in light of the environment that we're in. But the cost savings that we're seeing at this stage are really a byproduct of the return on the early investments we made to improve productivity and thoughtful pacing around what's left. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then just a separate one on -- you mentioned there's a continuing investment in Controls and Risk, in Corporate and Other. Are you close to a point where you've reached the peak on that? Would you expect that to trend down over time or is it still feeling that's increasing? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. We do we actually do expect I think I've mentioned the outlook for Corporate/Other being slightly higher going into the fourth quarter as a result of continued infrastructure costs. We think that's important to make as a franchise. That includes things like enhancing our data capabilities. It includes things like cybersecurity capabilities, improving our compliance and risk and finance infrastructure. So, all of those things that we think are critical to not only running a safe and sound organization, but in many ways, to helping to drive better business operations as well. And so yes, we expect to continue to make investments in that area. Mike Corbat : And I would say, Mark, within all of that, we -- it's not just the investment and the safety and soundness, but there's paybacks in and around on that in terms of being able to replace manual processes and other things. Mark Mason : Absolutely. Between the automation opportunities that are there, the straight-through processing opportunities that are there, that's what I was alluding to when I said the opportunity to improve business operations. So, it's safety and soundness and those efficiencies that we'll get as an organization. So, they are investments in fact in many instances and do have paybacks associated with them. Operator : Okay. Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard, please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning Mark, good morning Mike. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us -- you identified that you had some strong performance in M&A this quarter, particularly in EMEA. Was it due to hiring people that you're having the success in M&A or is it taking market share from some of the competitors, particularly over in Europe, some of them are struggling? Mike Corbat : I think it's both. I think when you go back and look, this isn't just a third quarter of 2019 phenomenon, but I think something we've spoken to. And I think you've seen over the last three or four years, some pretty consistent market share gains for us there. And it hasn't just been EMEA, but EMEA, I think, has been one of the top performers for us. And so I think it's really been both, client engagement, but also, as you know, in the business of making sure you have the right people in the right seats. And again, as you've seen publicly, we've been making those investments. Mark Mason : Yes, we've seen increases in -- when you think about share, in technology, in healthcare, in consumer. And so we've seen it across a number of sectors. As Mike said, it's a byproduct of having made those investments and being positioned to serve our clients well. Gerard Cassidy : And then in the Markets business, obviously, we've all seen on the retail side that the trading commissions have been dropped to 0 and many of the discount brokers like the Charles Schwab or Fidelity. In cash equities in the institutional business, we all know that the cents per trade has steadily declined. Electronic trading has reduced revenues. Is there a day that we're actually going to see zero commissions possibly in cash equities following the retail side? Mike Corbat : We could. We could. I don't think we're right there. But again, I think a lot of it, in my mind, will have to do with information and our ability to use that information and how GDPR rolls out in the U.S. and more broadly and what we're actually permitted to do with that information. I think that's a topic for another day. But I think that you could theoretically see certain people willing to pay for that information. I think point two is that when you actually look at with the indexation, the other thing that's going on is that the economics in terms of derivatives, the economics in terms of front brokerage, the economics in terms of custody and clearing, all areas that we've been heavily investing in. So to the extent that the cash equity trade underlies several of those activities supported by free trade around research and other pieces, I think there's more to play out in that as well. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then just lastly, you talked about the success of gathering deposits digitally, and I may have missed this, and you pointed to your high-yield savings account. To win those deposit customers are you doing it with the high-yield savings account? Or is there a cash bonus if they open up the account online, they get an extra $100 or something like that? Mark Mason : So we are -- so first of all, we're growing deposits more broadly than just the high-yield savings account and frankly, more broadly than just the digital. We're growing through traditional channels as well. We do have -- broke in the high-yield savings account specifically too, and that is through an offer of higher rate. But that said, what you also heard us reference was creating value propositions as well as incentives for clients to open deposit accounts with us, i.e., offering ThankYou points, offering Double Cashback, those types of incentives that are aligned with the card as incentive for those customers to open a retail banking account with us; in this case, online or digitally. Gerard Cassidy : Okay. So you're not sending them toasters though, right? Mark Mason : We're not. We're not. We're out of the toaster sending business at this stage. Gerard Cassidy : All right, thank you. Mark Mason : You bet. Operator : And your final question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. We are not getting response from Vivek Juneja. Mike Corbat : He may be asking his question elsewhere, operator. So with that, Liz, back to you. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call today. If you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out to us in Investor Relations, and have a good day. Mark Mason : Thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Thank you again for joining today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today, we\u2019re joined by Citi\u2019s Chief Executive Officer, Mike Corbat; the Chief Financial Officer -- and Mark Mason, CFO. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today, our CEO, Mike Corbat, will speak first. Then, Mark Mason, our CFO, will take you through the earnings presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital, and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2018 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Liz. This morning, we announced that we had a strong close to 2019. We reported earnings of $5 billion for the fourth quarter, bringing our net income to $19.4 billion for the year, the highest since 2006. Our earnings per share of $2.15 were over 30% higher than a year ago, and the $8.04 for the full year was over 20% above 2018. We finished the year with a return on tangible common equity of 12.1%, just ahead of our 12% target for the year, and this is 120 basis points higher than our 2018 return on tangible common equity of 10.9%. In constant dollars, our 2019 underlying revenues increased by 4% in both Global Consumer Banking and our Institutional Clients Group. Good revenue growth paired with disciplined expense management allowed us to deliver positive operating leverage, even as we continue to make significant investments in the franchise. Pretax earnings were up 5%. We also had loan and deposit growth for the year, and for the 16th consecutive quarter. Our return on assets rose to 98 basis points for the year. Our strong finish to 2019 was a result of balanced performance of both -- across both products and geographies. Both North America and international consumer banking had 4% year-over-year revenue growth. In the U.S., Branded Cards revenues continued to grow at a healthy clip, with a 10% increase for the quarter, bringing the full-year increase to 8%. We continued to attract digital deposits from both existing and new customers, bringing the total to $6 billion for the year. Better sentiment helped increase our wealth management revenues in Asia, and our cards business contributed to growth in Mexico. Investor sentiment also positively impacted our institutional business for the fourth quarter. Fixed Income was up nearly 50%, from a tough final quarter of 2018. Equities didn\u2019t perform as well, mainly due to weakness in derivatives. We continued to gain share in Investment Banking and the Private Bank posted good revenue growth of 6%. Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to grow, despite a lower rate environment as we work to ensure our global network remains indispensable to our multinational clients. We ended the year in a strong capital position with a common equity Tier 1 ratio of 11.7%, and we\u2019re on track to deliver our Investor Day commitment of returning more than $60 billion of capital to our shareholders over three CCAR cycles, having returned over $22 billion in 2019 alone. Our dividend creates a very respectable yield for our common shareholders, and we reduced our shares outstanding by 11% during the year. Our tangible book value per share increased to over $70, a 10% increase for the year. I\u2019m very proud of our firm\u2019s performance. As we did in 2018, we hit our return target for the year despite an uncertain environment, which saw trade disputes, rising geopolitical tensions, and still no finality regarding Brexit. As we told you entering the year, we prepared for multiple scenarios and used multiple levers to manage the firm through the uncertainty and deliver a solid year for our shareholders. We entered 2020 in a strong competitive position from capital and liquidity to talent and technology. We continue to invest in areas where we see opportunities for client-led growth and in our infrastructure in light of the enduring need to be an indisputably strong and stable institution. We\u2019re looking forward to sharing with you how we\u2019ll take our firm forward over the next several years. With that in mind, we will hold our next Investor Day on May 13. The environment has changed meaningfully since our 2017 Investor Day, and we\u2019ll lay out what we aspire to this year and beyond. Now, let me turn it over to Mark and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. Mark? Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike. Good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide three, net income of $5 billion in the fourth quarter grew 18% from last year, as growth in operating margin was partially offset by higher credit costs and we benefited from a significantly lower tax rate. EPS grew 34%, including the impact of a 10% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding as we\u2019ve continued to buy back shares throughout the year, consistent with our capital plan. Revenues of $18.4 billion grew 7% from the prior year, driven by higher noninterest revenue and reflecting continued solid results across consumer as well as our accrual businesses in ICG, along with a rebound in markets. Expenses increased 6% year-over-year, reflecting higher compensation and volume-related expenses, along with continued investments in the franchise, partially offset by efficiency savings and the wind down of legacy assets. And cost of credit increased driven by volume growth and seasoning in consumer as well as volume growth and a few episodic downgrades in ICG, while overall credit quality remained stable. Our effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, better than our outlook, reflecting discrete tax items. The discrete tax items equate to a benefit of $0.25 per share this quarter. Excluding this benefit, our tax rate would have been roughly 22%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans grew 2% year-over-year to $699 billion as 3% growth in our core businesses was partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets, and deposits grew 6% with contributions from both our consumer and institutional franchises. On slide four, we show our full year results. Looking at 2019, our progress was broad-based with revenue growth, positive operating leverage, and operating margin expansion across both our consumer and institutional businesses. Revenues were up 4% on an underlying basis, excluding the impact of FX as well as the $150 million gain on the sale of the Hilton portfolio and the $250 million gain on the asset management business in Mexico in 2018. In Global Consumer Banking, we generated 4% revenue growth across all three regions. In ICG, revenues also grew 4% with continued momentum in our accrual businesses as well as growth in our market-sensitive businesses. And even as we\u2019ve continued to make critical investments in our franchise, we maintained expense discipline delivering roughly flat expenses for the year, in line with our outlook. Credit quality remained broadly stable across the franchise and underlying pretax earnings grew by 5%. EPS grew by 21% and we generated an RoTCE of 12.1%, ahead of our target for the full year. Turning now to the businesses. Slide five shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. The consumer business showed continued momentum in the fourth quarter. For the quarter, revenues grew 4% with contributions from all regions, while expenses were down 1%, driving continued growth in operating margin and earnings. And looking at full year results in consumer, excluding both gains in 2018, we also generated 4% revenue growth while expenses were roughly flat, resulting in 9% growth in operating margin and 13% growth in pretax earnings. Slide six shows the results for North America Consumer Banking in more detail. Fourth quarter revenues of $5.3 billion were up 4% from last year. We have continued to make meaningful progress against our strategy to create a more integrated, client-centric relationship model, launching new value propositions across cards and Retail Banking and continuing to enhance our digital capabilities. In 2019, we introduced the rewards plus cards, digital lending products Flex Loan and Flex Pay, new digital checking and savings accounts and relationship offers for both cards and deposits. And in digital, we enhanced our account opening and servicing capabilities, for example, streamlining the digital account opening process, which has roughly doubled our application submission rate. These actions are resonating with our clients, driving deeper relationships and better growth in deposits, AUMs and loans. And while most of the new offerings we\u2019ve introduced in 2019 have leveraged our proprietary products and reward programs, this year, we will be expanding our reach and the breadth of our customer base with both existing and new partners. For example, we are expanding our partnership with American Airlines to include deposit products. And we recently announced a new partnership with Google to attract clients digitally. Importantly, we are building these capabilities in a scalable manner with the ability to expand to other partners efficiently. Turning now to the results of the individual businesses. Branded Cards revenues of $2.4 billion grew 10% year-over-year. Client engagement remained strong with purchase sales up 7%. And average loan growth improved to 4% while our net interest revenue as a percentage of loans expanded to 921 basis points this quarter. In Retail Banking, our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits up 7% with a strong contribution from both traditional and digital channels. And our AUMs were up 20% or 8%, excluding market movements, reflecting strong engagement from our Citigold clients. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales, bringing our full year total to roughly $6 billion versus the $1 billion we raised in 2018. And our experience to date gives us confidence in our ability to drive towards national scale and retail, as we deepen relationships over time. However, Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 4% year-over-year, as the benefit of stronger deposit volumes was more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Finally, Retail Services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 1% year-over-year, with continued growth in loans and purchase sales across the majority of the portfolio. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 4% year-over-year as efficiency savings, more than offset investment spending and higher volume related expenses. Turning to credit. Net credit losses grew by 10% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolios. Our full year NCL rate in U.S. Branded Cards and Retail Services were 319 basis points and 513 basis points, respectively. Looking ahead, we expect NCL rates in 2020 to be at or slightly above the high end of our outlook range of 300 to 325 basis points for Branded Cards and 500 to 525 basis points for Retail Services. And I\u2019d also note that we typically see higher NCL rates in the first half relative to the second half of the year, reflecting normal seasonality. On slide seven, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Fourth quarter revenues of $3.2 billion grew 4%. In Latin America, consumer revenues grew 6%, including a few small episodic gains. Loan and deposit growth was muted in Mexico again this quarter as we are seeing lower levels of client demand in the current environment of decelerating GDP growth and a slowdown in overall industry volumes. But importantly, we delivered strong year-over-year EBIT growth again this quarter. Turning to Asia, consumer revenues grew 4% in the fourth quarter. We continued to see strong growth in our wealth management drivers in Asia, with 10% growth in Citigold clients and 9% growth in net new money versus last year. In total, operating expenses for International Consumer Banking increased 3% in the fourth quarter as investment spending and volume-driven growth was partially offset by efficiency savings, and cost of credit was down 6%, driven primarily by Mexico. Slide eight shows global consumer credit trends in more detail. As a reminder, this quarter, we realigned our Commercial Banking business with all commercial banking activities, including those previously reported as part of GCB, now reported in ICG. The consumer credit trends on slide eight, reflect this change. In North America and Asia, this shift resulted in only a slight increase in the reported NCL rates. However, it did have a larger impact on reported NCL rates in Latin America, given the relative size of the commercial business there, which is structurally lower NCL rates and represented roughly one-third of the GCB loan book. Overall, credit trends remained favorable again this quarter. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine. Revenues of $9.4 billion were up 10% in the fourth quarter, reflecting continued momentum in the accrual businesses as well as strong performance in both Investment Banking and Fixed Income markets, partially offset by softness in equity markets. Total banking revenues of $5.5 billion were up 3%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.6 billion were up 2% as reported, and 3% in constant dollars, as we drove strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits and transaction volumes, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. We continued to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, reflecting growth with new clients, as well as the deepening of relationships with our existing clients, including 10% growth in average deposits, as well as double-digit growth in our cross-border payment flows this quarter. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 6% from last year, outperforming the market wallet, reflecting strong performance in equity and debt underwriting, particularly investment-grade underwriting as we leveraged our global capabilities to help clients optimize their funding needs. Private Bank revenues of $847 million were up 6%, driven by higher lending and increased investment activity with both new and existing clients, partially offset by spread compression, and corporate lending revenues of $732 million were roughly flat as growth in the commercial book was offset by lower volumes in the rest of the portfolio. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues of $3.9 billion were up 28% from last year. Fixed Income revenues were up 49%, largely reflecting a recovery from the fourth quarter 2018, coupled with strong performance, particularly in rates and spread products. Equities revenues were down 23%, primarily reflecting a more challenging environment in equity derivatives. And finally, in security services, revenues were down 1% on a reported basis, but largely unchanged in constant dollars, as higher volumes from new and existing clients were offset by lower spreads. Total operating expenses of $5.4 billion increased 8% year-over-year, driven by higher compensation-related expenses and legal costs. And credit costs increased to $246 million, reflecting overall volume growth as well as a few episodic downgrades while overall portfolio quality remains strong. And on a full year basis credit costs of $563 million were consistent with what we would expect annually, given the size as well as the quality of our portfolio. For full year 2019, our net income grew 3%, on the combination of revenue growth, positive operating leverage, continued credit discipline, and a lower tax rate. On a constant dollar basis, full year revenue growth was 4%. From a client perspective, our revenue growth was largely driven by continued strong engagement with our corporate clients across TTS and Investment Banking, as well as both Fixed Income and equity markets. And looking at our results from a product perspective, we generated over half our revenues in banking, which grew 3% as reported and 5% in constant dollars on continued momentum in TTS, Investment Banking and the Private Bank. Security Services revenues were largely unchanged on a reported basis, but grew 4% in constant dollars as we continue to acquire new clients, as well as deepen existing client relationships. And in Fixed Income, revenues grew 10% with strong contribution from both rates and currencies, as well as spread products. The combined solid performance in these businesses helped to more than offset weakness in equities and deliver positive operating leverage for the year. And finally, while our cost of credit was higher, it was in line with our outlook for 2019, reflecting a normalization in credit trends, and credit quality remains strong with roughly 10 basis points of losses for the year. Slide 10 shows results for Corporate/Other. Revenues of $542 million increased 8% from last year, reflecting gains on investments partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets. Expenses increased 34%, reflecting higher infrastructure costs partially offset by the wind down of legacy assets. And the pre-tax loss was $80 million this quarter, roughly in line with our prior outlook. Looking ahead for 2020, we would expect a quarterly pre-tax loss of roughly $250 million in Corporate/Other as we continue to invest in infrastructure and controls and see some impact from lower rates, as well as a reduced level of gains. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue, split between our markets business and the contribution from the rest of the franchise excluding markets on the top of slide. As you can see, we delivered 3% growth in net interest revenue or roughly $1.4 billion year-over-year in constant dollars in 2019, in line with the high end of our latest outlook, mainly reflecting strength in North America Branded Cards and TTS. Looking at results for the quarter, we saw a rebound in markets, net interest revenues, both year-over-year and sequentially, while growth in the rest of the franchise was more than offset by the headwinds of lower rates. And net interest margin increased by 7 basis points sequentially, also driven by the higher markets net interest revenue. And turning to noninterest revenue for total Citigroup, this quarter, we generated strong year-over-year growth in noninterest revenue of roughly $1.2 billion. The strong end to the year allowed us to deliver nearly $650 million of growth in noninterest revenue on a full year basis or 2%, above our original forecast for roughly flat. So, if you look at our total revenues for full year 2019, we realized 2% growth on a reported basis and 4% on an underlying basis with a balanced contribution from both, NIR and non-NIR revenues. Looking ahead to 2020, we do expect to deliver some growth in net interest revenues this year, despite the change in the direction of rates as loan growth and mix become the primary drivers, and we remain comfortable in our ability to deliver continued growth in noninterest revenues this year, driven by continued fee growth across both our consumer and institutional businesses. So, in aggregate, for total Citigroup, we expect to generate modest year-over-year revenue growth in 2020 on a reported basis. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. In the fourth quarter, our tangible book value per share increased 10% year-over-year to $70.39, driven by net income and lower share count and our CET1 capital ratio increased sequentially to 11.7%, driven by decline in risk-weighted assets. In summary, we made good progress in 2019 with broad-based revenue growth, positive operating leverage, earnings growth and a sizable return of capital to our shareholders. We improved our RoTCE by over a 100 basis points, achieving a full-year RoTCE of 12.1%, ahead of our target of 12% for the year. We drove 2% revenue growth with a balanced contribution from both our consumer and institutional businesses. On the expense side, we were able to hold expenses flat, while making significant investments in the franchise as productivity savings continued to meaningfully outpace our incremental investments as well as offset volume-related expenses. We maintained our credit discipline, growing our loan portfolio while maintaining loss rates within our medium-term expectations across every business and region. On the tax rate, we continued to work to better position the firm post tax reform, and we delivered on our capital optimization goals, returning over $22 billion of capital through share buybacks and dividends during the year. Importantly, we continued to deepen and broaden our client relationships in order to drive sustainable, client-led growth and a steady improvement in returns. Our results in 2019 give us confidence in 2020, and we are committed to delivering continued progress going forward. For 2020, we expect to deliver modest topline growth and roughly flat expenses, while continuing to manage the franchise responsibly. We expect cost of credit to remain manageable and we expect our effective tax rate to be around 22% in 2020, excluding any discrete tax items. As Mike mentioned, the revenue environment has changed since we set our targets for 2020 with lower interest rates, slower global growth and the pressure we\u2019ve seen in industry wallets in markets and banking. In an environment similar to the one we are operating in today, we expect to deliver an RoTCE in the range of 12% to 13% for 2020. So, we expect we will continue to make progress in improving our returns, and we look forward to having the opportunity to talk more about this year and beyond at our Investor Day in May. With that Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Good morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. John McDonald : Mark, I wanted to ask about deposit growth. It seemed like it accelerated throughout the year and you are kind of doing that $2 billion per quarter it seems like towards the end of the year. Is that a pace you think you can keep up with the new initiatives on deposit growth? Mark Mason : So, we\u2019ve seen good deposit growth, as you said through the year in both our consumer business as well as on the institutional side, and that in many ways I think is an important proof point around our consumer strategy. We are continuing to focus on value propositions on the consumer side in order to grow with our card customers and outside of our Retail Banking markets. We just launched the high-yield checking account, and we will continue to develop new products such as with our partner at American Airlines; and in those types of initiatives, we expect to continue to fuel continued growth on the deposit side in consumer. We\u2019ve also, as I said, seen good momentum on the institutional side. We expect that growth to continue, and that\u2019s an important metric as we think about how we continue to increase our engagement with clients. And so, yes, we do expect to see continued growth in deposits. Operator : The next question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : So, I\u2019m curious, Branded Cards doing well, up 10%, when you look at Retail Services up 1%. I\u2019m curious if you could talk about the compare and contrast of what\u2019s driving one to have better growth. I don\u2019t know if there were any partnership or repricings or lost partners along the way. Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. So, on the Branded Cards side, you\u2019ve heard us say through the course of the year, we\u2019ve continued to see good traction with our clients there, we\u2019ve seen purchase sales up 7%, and you\u2019ve seen continued growth in loans on the branded side. So, 1% growth in quarter one, 2% growth in quarter two, 3% growth in quarter three, 4% in quarter four. So, good momentum there, a good pace of increasing the average interest earning balances, and so that has been a big part and contributor to that 10% growth that you referenced and sizable growth for the full year as well. On a Retail Services side, as you know, there are multiple portfolios that make up Retail Services. And we\u2019ve seen good momentum in a good number of those portfolios. But, within that, obviously is Sears, which is a partner of ours, and that the results that we have do reflect the impact from Sears. That said, we\u2019ve delivered on the 1% we\u2019ve talked about as guidance for the revenue growth for the quarter and I think it\u2019s 2% for the full year. We would expect to see continued pressure from the Sears portion of the portfolio, particularly on the purchase sales. And that said, it is still a very profitable portfolio for us. We\u2019re still very engaged with the customers there and some 80% of the spend is outside of those stores. And so, profitable good returning, but some pressure given everything going on with that partner. Mike Corbat : In particular, the store closures, yes. Mark Mason : Yes. And very important partner, but a lot going on there. Operator : The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolf Research. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : So, Mark, I wanted to start off with a question just on some of the RoTCE guidance. Certainly commendable, and you guys delivered on the 12% this year. That said, I believe it does include about a 50 basis-point benefit from discrete tax items. And so, as I think about the core rate, it\u2019s maybe somewhere in the zone of 11.6%, and I\u2019m just thinking as we try to unpack the walk to that 12% to 13% you saw, and the fact that you do have provision likely trending higher in 2020, and assuming no further benefit on the tax side, just help us think through what are some of the key drivers to help us get to that 12% to 13%? Mark Mason : Sure. So, look, I think it\u2019s -- if you think about what we saw this year and some of the key important drivers of performance, you can kind of look across many of the businesses and see good top-line growth underlying and good EBIT performance. We expect that top-line growth to continue particularly as we continue to execute on our consumer strategy and more deeply penetrate the card customers that we have there and develop new value propositions that we can get out to market, having proven those digital capabilities that we\u2019ve invested in, so continued top-line growth on the consumer side. We do expect to see good underlying metrics with our institutional clients, particularly in TTS, which is core to our network, but also has linkages with the rest of the ICG. So, good continued momentum, deposit volumes, and engagement with both new and existing clients on the institutional side, and in TCS. And so, top-line growth of a couple percentage points in a constructive capital markets environment with flat expenses. And so, you \u2013 we\u2019ve referenced that at the beginning of this year and managed to that with all the uncertainty playing through the year, and we are targeting that again for 2020. And the combination of that and continued work on the cost of credit, and of course, we\u2019ll continue to look at the tax line, but we believe the combination of that focus and continued productivity benefits funding the volume growth that we expect to have will get us to the range of the 12 to 13 that I referenced. Operator : The next question is from Saul Martinez with UBS. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : So, I guess following up, actually first, one of a clarification, I just want to make sure I heard something correctly, you said Mark. You said on the Corporate and Other pretax estimate for next year, I thought I heard $250 million per quarter. That can\u2019t be right. Is that -- did I -- it seems awfully higher. Obviously, it\u2019s a much higher run rate than what you\u2019ve been doing. What was -- can you just repeat what that outlook was for pretax Corporate and Other? Mark Mason : Sure. So, I did reference that we would expect to see an impact of about $250 million a quarter for Corporate/Other. That is higher than the prior guidance that I\u2019d given of $100 million to $150 million the last time I gave guidance on Corporate/Other, so a bit higher. There are a couple of things that impact that or that will drive that. One of which is the impact of rates. We obviously had three rate cuts in the back half of 2019. That plays through the business performance, but some of it also plays through the revenue that\u2019s in Corporate/Other. We also have -- we\u2019ll have fewer gains. I referenced some gains that we have from investments that play through 2019 and through the quarter here. So, likely to have fewer of those. And then, we are -- and I\u2019ve referenced the investments that we continue to -- want to continue to make or will continue to make in infrastructure and controls. And those investments will be in the form of technology and people and focused on things such as data, data governance and infrastructure. And so, those are important investments that we\u2019ll be making. And those three drivers will be what impacts or is underneath that guidance. Not all in the expense line. As I mentioned, we will move to keep the expenses flat. Operator : The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Buckingham Research. Jim Mitchell : A follow-up. I appreciate the unpredictability of -- particularly capital markets revenue, and I assume that\u2019s why the wide range in RoTCE. But, if we look at the second half of last year, the operating leverage, particularly in the Investment Bank has been minimal, it\u2019s been okay. But, you had 7% -- as a firm, you had 7% growth, top line growth with some investment gains, 6% expense growth in the fourth quarter. So, I just want to understand, I think the upside, the upper end of that range would imply some pretty good operating leverage. So, is it some unusual items in the back half of the year, accelerated spending that you expect to slow, or if we see a higher revenue growth, is that going to be offset by volume-related expenses and you just can\u2019t get a ton of operating leverage. Just help me think through the expense trajectory in different revenue scenarios? Mike Corbat : Well, let me -- Mark, why don\u2019t I start and maybe just talk a little bit about the revenue environment and what may drive. So, if we look, Jim, at 2019, Mark referenced the back half of the year and rate cuts but I would say throughout the year, we saw, what I would describe as a lot of things out there that was driving uncertainty, be it the lack of a China trade deal, USMCA, where was that headed, Brexit, Hong Kong. And I think, we see ourselves in a position now where the horizon looks like some of those things make clear. Right? Hopefully, we get a trade deal in the next couple of days here, at least phase 1 of the trade deal, hopefully USMCA and it looks like it should be pretty well along the path to being ratified and looks like we will get a Brexit deal. So, I think some of the things that were overhanging some of the volume-related parts of the market might have a chance to lift and we maybe get a bit more action out of the C-suite, not if some of our investors. You would see volumes pick up, but I think as we look at the activities that we see, and again, I think a pretty reasonable close to the year here when you look at the combination of ECM, when you look at the combination of DCM banking more broadly. Obviously, M&A down a little bit. But, I think the backlog looks pretty good. And I think, the forward calendar as we look into the other areas, look good. So, one is I think is a pretty good driver on the revenue side. Mark Mason : Yes. I guess, I\u2019d just add to that I guess a couple of things. So, one in the broadest sense, again, as we think about 2020, we\u2019re targeting flat expenses. With that said, there are a couple of things that are playing through that that I think will benefit the expense line in 2020, and cover any volume-related increases or investments that we\u2019re planning to make. So, one is the productivity saves that we\u2019ve talked about over the past couple of years and those outpacing investments. And so, we expect yet another $500 million to $600 million of productivity benefits to play through 2020, and that will be used to fund some of those headwinds or investment opportunities. Two, you would have heard us reference a number of times through the course of the year repositioning charges that we\u2019ve taken, severance changes as we\u2019ve adjusted capacity. Those were obviously increases in expenses in the year that will play out or reflect or generate benefits in 2020, again creating capacity. And then, you referenced the back half. And particularly, if you look at the ICG in the last quarter, you got to kind of keep in mind that that growth in expenses is 10% topline growth, 8% expense growth but that comes with the compensation increase associated with those revenues, the volume increases associated with that activity that we saw in the back half of the year. And so, you really got to think about the full year expense base as we go into 2020 as the timing for both investments and the productivity benefits will vary through the course of the year. And we\u2019ll get into much more of this and the forward look beyond 2020 obviously at Investor Day. Operator : The next question is from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you talk about technology spend and where you are in the process and priorities for the back office and the front office. I know it\u2019s a broad question but maybe for the back-office, like the number of data centers you have or the percent of workload you intend to move to the public cloud or for the front office a little bit more color on the relationship with Google and where you expect that to go, and then just overall with total tax spend and where you are in terms of spending or reaping the benefits of past spends? Mike Corbat : Sure. So, why don\u2019t I start out, and Mark you can chime in. So, again, I don\u2019t want to steal the thunder. We\u2019ll go into a fair bit of this in detail at our Investor Day. But Mike, I\u2019ll give you a couple of examples. You\u2019ve asked a question before in data centers. And Citi at its peak had just over 70 data centers. At Investor Day, we told you we were down to 20, and today we\u2019re down to 10. What I would say is, based on the combination of the necessity of redundancies, GDPR and other things, I won\u2019t say 10 is the static number. But as you get to 10 and you run a global organization approaching 100 countries, I don\u2019t think there is a massive opportunity. And again, we\u2019ve got to see how the regulatory and how the legal landscape unfolds in terms of data and data storage. Second piece beyond data storage is around data itself that in many ways Citi personifies big data, operating all the places that we operate. And if you look at the way that the Company came together through acquisitions and through other bolt-ons, we think there\u2019s a significant opportunity to really modernize or to take our data to the next stage in terms of giving us benefits, in terms of safety and soundness, in terms of giving us benefits, in terms of straight through processing, all of those manifesting itself in better client experiences. So, a part of the number or reasonable part of the number that Mark is referencing here in terms of spend is around what I described as the modernization of our data and our data approach. And so, we\u2019re excited about that. I\u2019ll give you one example on the consumer side that we talked about last time, and I\u2019ll take you to back to page 23 again around our consumer drivers. But, if you look at as an example, the things that we\u2019ve been doing around our technology in the call centers and if you look at the upper right-hand box around agent contact rates, what you\u2019ve seen is you\u2019ve seen basically a circa $15 million reduction in calls, inbound calls into our call centers. And at the same time, the way we\u2019re handling those calls through the combination of IVR and chat has changed where we\u2019re able to dedicate our specialists to the more complex things and not being forced to deal with what\u2019s my balance, when is my payment due, how do I collect my ThankYou points types of calls. And so, at the same time, we are reducing significantly those contract rates, and you can see it there. We\u2019re also taking on more volume, right? As we\u2019re growing -- as you are growing your cards footprint, as you are growing your digital deposit base, obviously, you\u2019re getting more engagement. And so, we\u2019re not only on the absolute level reducing the number of inbounds, but we\u2019re also taking on volume at obviously very attractive rates. So, I think that underscores or highlights why we believe -- and I think you\u2019ve seen in the numbers that we\u2019ve put up as we\u2019ve made some of these investments in technology, we\u2019ve gotten pretty good paybacks. And we think the paybacks that we can get out of the things that we\u2019ve got on the slate, certainly warrant going after them. Mark Mason : Yes, I\u2019d agree with that. And Mike, I think about it, as Mike described kind of in four buckets. And so, as we think about technology investments, they are investments that we are making that are directly client-related. Think about new products, new solutions, think about the work we do with our TTS clients and as we identify pain points, whether it\u2019d be managing their receivables or managing their invoices, we invest in other technologies, we invest in our own solutions to service those client-related needs, if you will. Think about client service from a client experience point of view and the investments that we\u2019re making to do things like streamline on-boarding. I referenced that regarding digital customers on-boarding, but we also invest a lot in how we onboard our corporate clients in new countries as we enter markets with them. Those are technology investments. That\u2019s the second bucket. The third bucket is just how we streamline our own operations, our own internal processes, how we do more in the way of automation, less manual reconciliation and manual work. There\u2019s an opportunity there for to manage data from input straight through output as Mike\u2019s referenced. And there are -- and paybacks on the streamlining of internal processes. And then, the fourth bucket and I separate it because of -- in part because of its significance Mike has referenced before, which is cyber. And so, cyber is a very important technology investment for us to both protect the franchise and protect our clients. And we\u2019ve been growing that over the past five years and expect to continue to grow our investment in cyber. So, just another way to think about the lens that we look at the technology investment and need for it as we go into 2020. Operator : The next question will come from Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Mike, does the 12% to 13% RoTCE for this year fully capture the potential of the franchise or -- and I expect you to give us more detail on Investor Day. Do you think continued improvement could be realized from here, if we keep the rate curve fairly flat and there\u2019s no major change in the global economic outlook? Mike Corbat : Yes. Again, we\u2019ve kind of talked about the steps along the way. And you mentioned the word improvement. Improvement is paramount in terms of the way we\u2019re approaching 2020. And we think we\u2019ve got the ability using technology, client engagement, wallet share gains, a lot of the levers that we\u2019ve spoken to on the revenue and expense side of continuing to make improvement and make progress against those benchmarks. Mark Mason : Yes. I completely agree. I mean, we are focused on significant improvement over time. We\u2019ve made progress over the past couple of years when we talked last about our underlying performance consumer and the ICG. We pointed to consumer as having the opportunity to close the gap between where we were two years ago and something we thought was up in the 20% or so. We\u2019re making good progress on that. We think there\u2019s continued upside there. We also have talked about, when you think about our TCE and how it\u2019s broken out between consumer ICG and Corporate/Other. We know that over time, some portion of what we have in Corporate/Other, that TCE that\u2019s tied to the excess capital that we have, the DTA, Citi Holdings, over time that will work itself down and back in and of itself will contribute to improved RoTCE. So, we\u2019ve got a real sense of urgency to improve our RoTCE responsibly over time. And we intend to continue to do that. Operator : The next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: I was wondering if you could just talk about what you\u2019re working on in the equities business. Obviously, it\u2019s been an area of focus the last few years, you had some signs of progress, a tough quarter this quarter. I don\u2019t want to kind of overplay it. It\u2019s only a few percent of revenue, but, you\u2019re very strong in gaining share in fixed [ph] strong and seems like gaining some share in banking, and it\u2019s still kind of call it the missing piece in the puzzle from my perspective. Some maybe you could just talk about kind of the strategic outlook there and what you\u2019re working on? Mike Corbat : Sure. So, as you recall, several years ago we embarked on the mission and at the time, we were about number nine of moving into the top five. Today, we find ourselves at number six. And along the way, we\u2019ve consistently taken share, and this year probably not. So, we look like based on some coalition data or others, we\u2019re probably kind of flat to market. But, certainly not where we want to be and not where this ends. I think, as we look at things that we\u2019ve done, you\u2019ve seen us adjusting in particular front end capacity against the business, in particular in terms of cash, making investments in Delta One derivatives prime broker. But, I would also urge you not just to look at what we post as the trading revenues, call it roughly $3 billion for the year. I think, you\u2019ve got to look at the aggregate business, which include GCM, about another $1 billion of revenue, as well as our security services business about another $2.5 billion of revenue. So, as we look at and think about our equity business, it\u2019s about a $6.5 billion business to us. So, it is in aggregate a meaningful business. That being said, we still have our objective to break top five. That being said, we still think we can improve profitability and returns in the business. But again, we\u2019re focused on the end to end, the pre-trade the trade post-trade and trying to maximize the overall benefits of that to our franchise, but more work to do there. Operator : The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Couple questions, one on the capital side of the RoTCE. I think, you did indicate that you feel like you have some more opportunity there to give back excess capital. I guess, I wanted to understand in the most recent CCAR cycle, do you feel like you maxed out that ask or that you are holding back? And I\u2019m just asking because I\u2019m wondering if we should be expecting acceleration from here as we go into 2020 CCAR cycle? Mark Mason : Yes, thanks. So, we\u2019ve obviously worked down over time much of the excess capital that we have. We\u2019ve gone from having a CET1 ratio somewhere around 13 or so and kind of working that down to we\u2019ll end the year roughly at 11.7. And so, there\u2019ll be less excess that\u2019s there. We obviously will go through the CCAR process as we\u2019ve done in the past and try to responsibly come up with as much as we can return to shareholders. That is an important driver in us delivering on the continued progress that we\u2019ve talked about. We obviously would want to and will first look to what opportunities for growth of the business exist. So, out of the earnings we\u2019re able to generate and first to fund that growth and then with what\u2019s left and available to shareholders, including the benefits from the reduction in the disallowed DTA that we\u2019ve been targeting from year-to-year, we would love to distribute that both in form of continued dividends as well as buybacks. And so, there is some excess that\u2019s there. Obviously, there are a number of factors that go into that analysis, including the scenario and so on and so forth. But we\u2019ll continue down the path of returning as much as we responsibly can as it makes sense, given the growth trajectory we see. Betsy Graseck : And so, on your 12% to 13% RoTCE goal, is the degree of capital you\u2019re envisioning returning, I would think, a function of that range as well, that range is being driven in part by the capital. I know you discussed the\u2026 Mark Mason : Yes. The range does include continued return of capital, not at the payout ratios we\u2019ve seen in the past for the reasons that I mentioned, but absolutely, it includes a competitive continued payout in that 12 to 13 range, 12% to 13% RoTCE range. Betsy Graseck : Right. Okay. And then, just separately on your card guidance, you gave some guidance for card net charge-offs, both on the branded and the retail partner card. And I guess, I\u2019m wondering does that include your expectation for what day two CECL impact is likely to be. And maybe you could speak a little bit too, how you are thinking about CECL and what your assumptions are for the reasonable supportable period of CECL for an economic input perspective. Mark Mason : Sure. Let me kind of break that in two pieces if I can. So, on the guidance that I gave regarding cost of credit in cards or NCL rates, I should say, in cards, I referenced that would be a little bit above the 300 to 325 basis points of a medium-term target that we\u2019d set for branded. And my reference there -- and I think I\u2019ve mentioned this in the past is that, we\u2019ve seen a higher percentage of conversion into average interest earning balances. And so, with that higher volume than expected, which is a good thing, it comes with its profitable high-quality volume activity, but with that comes higher NCLs. And so, much of the increase that I referenced that would put us potentially outside of that range is driven by that. In terms of we have -- and how we think about our forecast and certainly a range that I\u2019ve articulated, we have factored in the impact of how we think about CECL. I\u2019ve referenced in the past a range of roughly 20% to 30% on the high end in terms of the day one impact. We expect the day one impact to increase the reserves by roughly 29% to get a little bit more precise, or roughly $4 billion. So, inside of the range that I\u2019ve communicated in the past. From a regulatory capital perspective, that will be about 6 basis points of CET1 capital in 2020 with a full impact of about 24 basis points by the time we get to the first quarter of 2023. As you would imagine, the significant build is on the consumer side. So, to your reference to cards, it\u2019s being driven by cards and that is based on the increased coverage from 14 months to about 23 months. And so, that\u2019s the more significant piece. It\u2019s offset by a decrease in the corporate build, which nets down to about the $4 billion. You referenced kind of day two and we will talk more about that I\u2019m sure in the forward quarters, but there are obviously a number of moving variables that go into that calculation, whether it\u2019d be kind of economic conditions or the seasonality of the business, there are a number of factors there that impact day two. And we consider that as we look at our 2020 forecast. And as I\u2019ve given you that range, it factors in that consideration. Operator : The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Thanks a lot. Good morning. Just a question on capital. I know we\u2019re all waiting just the finalization of SCB and the stress test framework. Also coming out of the year-end, any -- I assume that there was no change to your GSIB where you landed and all. And so, I guess, just the question is just what do you -- how are you setting up in terms of the expectations for -- regardless of timing around SCB, any potential changes to what the final framework might look like and any anticipated changes now you have to think about that? Mark Mason : Sure. I guess, I\u2019ll first just address directly your reference to the GSIB score. At the third quarter, we ended up at about 628, which is right below the 629, and so still in the 3% bucket. We should end the fourth quarter well into or inside of that 3% bucket as well, so below the 629 in the low 600 or so. Just given some of the seasonality that we see and the focus that we obviously put on ensuring that we\u2019re managing the business in a responsible way. And so, 3% bucket is where we expect to be by the year-end or for the year-end here 2019. In terms of the stress capital buffer, we\u2019ve heard, as you heard in a lot of, a number of comments around the interest in getting something out for this next CCAR cycle. We haven\u2019t seen anything as of yet. That would need to come out I think by middle of February. We obviously are continuing with the normal planning of our CCAR submission. When I think about how we consider that or how we factor that in, I kind of go back to the CET1 ratio that we managed to about 11.5%. And we have kind of a number of buffers in there, but one buffer in there to account for our estimation of the impact of the stress capital buffer. So, about 50 basis points above the capital conservation buffer that we have there. And then, we also have a management buffer. And so, my thinking is that as we get more information and clarity on the proposal, we should be able to cover that inside of how we\u2019re managing the target that we already have for ourselves. The final point, I\u2019ll make is that we continue to take some comfort in the regulator\u2019s comments and views that whatever we do with any one of these proposals, including the SCB that we\u2019re targeting capital neutrality across the industry and want to take a holistic approach that is factoring in how each of these proposals will work together in an integrated fashion, while preserving that capital neutrality. Ken Usdin : Got it, understand. And just outside the seasonality, is there anything that just -- given the environment and some of the ins and outs of balance sheet volatility? Seasonality got you inside that GSIB, thanks for clarifying that. Anything else is changing in terms of just flows that you see from the business outside of normal course that\u2019s coming via the repo markets, the Fed balance sheet expansion, or is it just -- really was a seasonality? Mark Mason : It was seasonality, and we obviously work to ensure that. We were meeting client needs while being able to deliver inside of that bucket, but nothing outside of that, nothing related to kind of the repo activity, as you mentioned, in the market. Operator : The next question is from Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Please go ahead. Brian Kleinhanzl : Yes. Just a quick question on the NIR guidance. Could you just kind of walk through some of the puts and takes that get you comfortable with being able to grow in 2020? And then also what\u2019s the macro assumptions you\u2019re using behind that? Mark Mason : Yes. So, as I mentioned, we expect kind of total revenue growth in 2020 with a mix from both NIR and non-NIR. We would expect that that would be driven by both loan growth as well as mix to get to that NIR growth that\u2019s there. There\u2019ll probably be some -- or there will be some kind of volatility on a quarterly basis, just due to the idea that NIR has market business, NIR that flows through there as well. And I walked through that dynamic last quarter. But, we do expect loan growth and mix to be primary drivers there, offsetting obviously some of the pressure in terms of the impact of rates of interest rates. And a point around kind of how we think about the forward look. As we plan for 2020, similar to what\u2019s out there in the way of the forward curve, we\u2019ve assumed one additional rate cut of about 25 basis points towards the back end of 2020. So, 2020 will have the full impact of the three cuts we saw in the back half of \u201819 and assumed one incremental rate cut in the back half of 2020. Operator : The next question is from Marty Mosby with Vining Sparks. Please go ahead. Marty Mosby : Thanks for taking the question. And the net interest margin kind of bounces around and it\u2019s not really at or trending like what you would see in the rest of the group. So, just was curious, the positive benefit you got this quarter didn\u2019t seem like the balance sheet really created, it looked like it was a real positive earnings impact because NII was stronger. Is it more sustainable or how do you kind of -- what are the bearings that kind of move that as we go forward? Mark Mason : So, the net interest margin grew by about 7 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And much of that, as I mentioned earlier, was driven by the markets revenue. So, we saw a big uptick obviously year-over-year as the fourth quarter rebounded. And so, that that mix resulted in an increase in the NIM up to 263. And as we go forward, I haven\u2019t really -- I haven\u2019t given a forecast on NIM going forward. I have spoken obviously, as I just mentioned to NIR and non-NIR. But obviously, all of the factors you would imagine such as the loan growth and the mix and all of those things will factor into how NIM plays out in the balance of 2020. Marty Mosby : And then, Mike, I wanted to ask you at last Investor Day that Citigroup hosted, it really was about capital. You also then talked about how you had to invest in the business. And the overall revenue outlook, it was pretty dicey. So, it feels like we\u2019re in a totally different place where revenues starting to pick up a little momentum, the investment that was required the last couple years, you\u2019ve accomplished that, so maybe not as much going forward. So, the dynamic, it kind of move away from just capital is being the driver to actually now the fundamentals of the business starting to perk up a little bit going into this next Investor Day. Mike Corbat : Marty, I\u2019d love to tell you, it\u2019s an easy environment. But, I think as we look towards the future I think one is that our levels of client engagement and what you\u2019ve seen since Investor Day, we talked about revenue gains coming off of kind of potential wallet expansion, but in particular market share gains. And I think as you look across all of our businesses -- or certainly most of our businesses, we\u2019ve had that. And I would expect at Investor Day, we are going to talk more about that as the things we do, I think continue to resonate with the clients, as the investments that we\u2019ve made in our products, the investments that we\u2019ve made in service, I think continue to reap good benefits. You will hear us talk again about continued expense discipline, but at the same time you\u2019ll hear us talk about the investments in technology and technology infrastructure and those pieces, which we think gives a multiple benefit to safety and soundness, gives a benefit to customer experience and obviously gives a benefit on the cost side of things. So, again, I think, as you sight, I think the big outsized times of capital return versus net income are probably coming to an end. But, I think at the same time, the momentum in the franchise accelerates. Operator : The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good afternoon, Mike and Mark. Mike Corbat : Hey, Gerard. Mark Mason : Hey, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, I know you just gave us some of the assumptions that you guys are looking on the macro for your revenue growth for 2020. If we\u2019re just talking on this call a year from now and you guys have better-than-expected than modest total revenue growth, what are some of the data points do you think we need to look at throughout the year where the revenue growth could come in stronger? Mark Mason : Sure. So, when I think about 2020, there are a couple of I think critically important factors that I look to. One is, continued execution on our North America consumer strategy. We\u2019ve gotten some good momentum through the course of \u201819. We\u2019ve made meaningful progress in terms of the capabilities to more deeply penetrate our customers. We\u2019ve seeing good client engagement across that portfolio. And so, that continued momentum playing into 2020 and to the extent that it plays in even more significantly, I think you\u2019ll see that as we penetrate more customers, as we grow volumes with those customers, as they use our products and services more whether through purchase sales or any of the other metrics or Citigold households et cetera. The second category is, as I think about our global corporate client in our Institutional Clients Group, and the continued great engagement that we\u2019re seeing with those clients, not just in -- in TTS around the world, not just existing clients, but new clients that we\u2019ve been able to onboard and grow with very rapidly, not just cash management products, but also with capital markets offerings, like our FX capabilities. And the benefits that those clients are realizing as we invest in technologies that bring those product capabilities together to create solutions that allow them to run their operations more efficiently, and so more traction there would be a second thing that you would look to I think. And then, the third thing would be something that -- one of the things Mike has referenced to a number of times on this call, but that discipline around the need to invest across the franchise and not just in growth, but certainly in growth around those important capabilities, but also in how we improve the way we go-to-market, the way we run our businesses and the efficiency around that. I think, the combination of those things and return of capital, obviously, will be the things that you will be able to look at, at the end of 2020, and have a greater sense of clarity as to why we ended up, where we ended up and/or better than that range. Mike, I don\u2019t know if you want to add to that. Gerard Cassidy : No. Thank you. And tying and just summing your answer Mark. Mike, obviously, the consumer business credit cards is a great example of economies of scale, and the community banks in the states, and even some of the regional banks really cannot compete with you and your peers at a profitable level that most investors would find acceptable. If we shift over now to the capital markets business, and I know you have that economies of scale and treasury and trade solutions. Do you think like in 3, 4 years, could the capital markets do something similar to the credit cards where the 5 dominant banks really kind of run the show, like in credit cards, for example? Mike Corbat : I think, Gerard, you\u2019re already seeing some of that. And we can cite different examples. But, one is in Europe, the fact today that in Europe, the top 5 banks in the market space are all U.S. banks, right? And by nature of the businesses, those banks are largely all -- certainly we are operating at scale in the businesses that we\u2019re in. And so, scale matters. And we measure scale lots of different ways and certainly in the consumer business, but also in the institutional business. Part of scale is your ability to invest, control and build your tech stack, your technology infrastructure to make sure that you\u2019re at or out in front in terms of the evolution of the business. So, I think you continue to see consolidation in the capital market space. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Couple of questions. Mark, first, in your guidance on revenue growth and outlook for 2020. When I look at your revenue growth of 2019 as a starting point, you had about $1 billion improvement [Technical Difficulty] when I see that was about 2%. So, I guess the question is, as you look out to 2020, do you expect the security gains [ph] to continue, do you have any [Technical Difficulty] and also what are you assumptions for this outside of it? Mark Mason : Vivek, I apologize. I just have had a hard time hearing your question. I really apologize. If you could repeat that please? Vivek Juneja : Sure. When you look at revenue growth. If you look at the revenue growth, it was -- when I look at it on a core basis, you excluding trade web gain and a $1 billion increase in security gains, it was about 2% year on full year 2019. For 2020, when you look at your guidance, Mark, are you expecting more security gains, or these deals to continue, any gains from further sales of businesses or portfolios? And also, what assumption do you have for rates outside the U.S., Mark? Mark Mason : Sure. So, there are a couple of questions in there. As I think about our forward look and estimate of revenue growth, we are expecting that revenue growth from all of the buckets that I\u2019ve described. So, core underlying revenue performance is what\u2019s going to drive what we see going into 2020. I\u2019d be careful about looking at 2019, just through the items that you mentioned there. There are other things that don\u2019t necessarily reflect the underlying strength of the franchise. There are some -- so anyway, just be careful about kind of narrowing it to just those two things. But the answer to your question is in fact -- is in fact that we see good underlying growth in our businesses. In terms of the forward look on rates, I guess what I\u2019d point you to is, if you look at kind of our interest rate exposure that\u2019s in our Q and will ultimately be in our K, we often talk about the impact of a 25 basis-point move, there\u2019s an analysis there for both U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar. And you\u2019ll see that the non-U.S. dollar impact to get to your question around non-U.S. rates is not a material impact on a quarter-to-quarter basis, it\u2019s a little bit less than $30 million a quarter for a 25 basis-point shift in the non-U.S. dollar rates. And obviously, there are a number of different countries that make up that. But it\u2019s less than $30 million. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. And I have a question for Mike. Mike, just going back to the equities business, and I recognize it\u2019s a relatively small business, but I know you had big hopes for this business with $1 billion increase in revenues a couple of years ago when you were talking about it. Recently, you\u2019ve had some headcount cuts. I know you\u2019ve already put more capital to work in the prime finance business. So, what do you do -- what can you do tangibly now differently to really get that revenue growth going again, because full year \u201819 was -- you\u2019re at the lower end of where you\u2019ve been in the last five years? Mike Corbat : Yes. We -- prior to 2019, and we\u2019ll see where the coalition data and other data shuttles. But, it seems like we\u2019re coming in somewhere about flat to market wallet where we had the past several years taken share. So, one is, we\u2019ve got to get back on the track of taking share. I think, the second piece is that we\u2019ve got to continue to assess the capacity of our front end and continue to use technology to drive parts of our lower or low touch business. I think we feel pretty good about the derivative space. I think we feel good about Delta One, we feel good about prime broker, we feel good about our security services businesses and all of those are obviously higher returning businesses, i.e., in some cases less capital. And again, I think, based on the nature of the clients that we cover, the consolidation of assets, not just in the U.S. but around the world, we think we\u2019ve got the ability to face off against those continue to take share. And again, as we pull the business together to drive returns that have it, makes sense. Vivek Juneja : If I may, one quick one, Mark, you went to the high end on CECL day one from the 20% to 30%. Given that the economic environment has held up pretty well, any color on what brought you towards the high end? Is that a shift in your card business, which also drove that little increase in charge-offs or is it something else? Mark Mason : Again, it was just a -- there was no particular change as we worked through it. We obviously developed our model there with shifts in balances, but there are a number of different factors that go into that. And I think I\u2019ve been communicating guidance towards the high end, not just on this call where I talked about the actual number, but on the past couple of calls. And so, no meaningful shifts that I\u2019d point to. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : The final question is a follow-up from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I wasn\u2019t able to get this in earlier. Just as you look at efficiency, clearly your guidance implies better efficiency ahead and it\u2019s improved for the last several years. But, when we slice and dice the numbers different ways, it doesn\u2019t seem to be as efficient as it could be. If you take out cards for example. So, where do you -- how much does technology help keep the expenses flat and where do you think the efficiency can go in the short-term and the long-term? And just I had also asked the prior question on the Google relationship, if I can throw that in too. Mike Corbat : I\u2019ll start with Google and Mark you can chime in as well. So, we\u2019re out with the announcement. Obviously, Q1 to Q2, we\u2019re going to be launching some products here in the U.S. with them. And so, we\u2019re not out with the exact design of that, but more to come in the not too distant future. Mark Mason : Yes. And on the operating efficiency, in the earnings deck, we kind of show a chart on page 18 of just the LTM efficiency ratio, and there you\u2019d see we\u2019ve got this continued downward trend of 56.5 for the year, 89 basis points of improvement. What I would say, Mike, is that we put out a target, we put out a target not just on returns but on flat expenses again this year. We\u2019re gearing up for Investor Day. We\u2019re going to make sure that we can talk to how we think about the future, but also how we think about technology and the role that it plays now and going forward. We\u2019ve given you some descriptions on the benefits that accrue to the firm from the investments we\u2019ve made already. I think, we\u2019ve demonstrated proof points of those generating productivity savings consistently and we expect that to continue. But, in terms of much more detail around the technology benefits or around how we think about beyond 2020, I\u2019d ask that you kind of wait for us to get to Investor Day where we can talk about it in a more holistic way. Mike Mayo : I guess, I\u2019ll reserve May 13th to my calendar. Thanks a lot. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Mark Mason : Thank you. Operator : At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing comments. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you all for joining today. And of course, if you have any follow-up questions, please feel free to reach out us in Investor Relations. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have objections please disconnect at the time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today as well as those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Liz and good morning everyone. Today, we\u2019ve reported earnings for the first quarter of 2020, with net income of $2.5 billion, we had earnings per share of $1.05. Our earnings were significantly impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, we had strong revenue performance as the economic shocks caused by the pandemic weren\u2019t felt until late in the quarter and we continue to show expense discipline. However, as you would expect, credit costs reduced our net income. The significant loan loss reserves we took also reflected the Day-2 impact of the new CECL accounting standard. In our Institutional Clients Group, we had strong performance in our markets business as we help clients navigate severe volatility that led to trading revenues that were higher than last year and what is typically a strong quarter for that business as it is. Treasury and trade solutions was impacted by the cuts to interest rates, but client engagement stayed very strong throughout the quarter. Investment Banking matched last year\u2019s solid performance as we continue to gain share among our target clients. Global Consumer Banking also fared well from a revenue perspective, considering the environment. In the US, and its strong revenue growth in cards with branded in retail services of 7% and 4%, respectively. We grew average deposits 8% with another solid portion acquired digitally. In Asia, we saw a slight revenue decline as the economic impacts of COVID-19 first materialized in that region. In Mexico, revenues rose modestly, excluding a one-time gain from 2019 as the virus had limited impact on that country\u2019s economy during the quarter. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.52 at the end of the quarter, up 9% from a year ago. We ended the quarter with a common equity tier 1 ratio of 11.2% as our risk weighted assets increased significantly due to increased client demand. As I\u2019ve said, this isn\u2019t a financial crisis, it\u2019s a public health crisis with severe economic ramifications. Although we did have good revenue performance this quarter, we exited the quarter in a dramatically different environment. While we\u2019ve built significant loan loss reserves, no one knows what the severity or longevity of the virus\u2019s impact on the global economy will be. That said, we entered this crisis in a very strong position from a capital, liquidity and balance sheet perspective. We have the resources we need to serve our clients without jeopardizing our safety and soundness. Now, I\u2019d like to take a moment to highlight some of the things that we\u2019re doing to help our people, clients and communities which you can see on Slide 3. I have to say I\u2019m very proud of how our people have responded to this fast-moving situation. We\u2019ve been very aggressive, shifting to remote working to reduce our people\u2019s chances of becoming infected, where the spread of the virus dictates it, we only have people going to our sites if there\u2019s no possible way, they can perform their roles remotely. For example, last week in North America Markets and Securities Services 98% of our people worked remotely and globally, our people adapted well to this new way of working with over 80% of our colleagues working remotely. Investments we\u2019ve made in our technology have allowed us to operate very smoothly in a set of circumstances that would have been hard to imagine with such a large share of our workforce working remotely at the same time. These investments are also helping us to serve our clients through digital and mobile channels whether it\u2019s a consumer depositing a check or a corporate treasurer managing liquidity. Our investments in risk management and controls will never complete are also serving us well in the face of the severe economic downturn and large swings across markets, whether in equities, fixed income or commodities. We\u2019ve tried to help keep our people financially healthy as well and reduce the stress they\u2019re facing. We decided last month to make a one-time payment of $1,000 to employees who make $60,000 or less per year in the US that are making equivalent payments in our international markets. And we\u2019ve halted new reductions in our workforce for the time being. From a consumer and institutional perspective, we\u2019re well positioned to serve the clients and the customer segments we\u2019ve been focusing on. We know many consumers are facing real struggles, and we\u2019re doing our best to support them. We were quick to implement the ways to reduce the burden on our consumer appliance and announced additional accommodations last week in the US. While we haven\u2019t been a large player in small business lending, we\u2019re ramping up our efforts so we can support clients who participate in the Payroll Protection Plan, and we have additional consumer relief programs in place in our international consumer franchise. We\u2019re working hard to support our corporate clients, many of whom are facing financial pressure. We\u2019ve been able to support them, while keeping within our risk and liquidity limits. We\u2019ve also been helping the communities we served during this extraordinarily difficult time, partnering with groups like the World Health Organizations, Citi\u2019s foundations have already committed $30 million today to support those impacted and we\u2019ll make additional announcements in coming days. We\u2019ve donated personal protective equipment, the hospital workers and last week we started using our cafeteria in our headquarters to make meals for food banks. Our people keep coming up with new ways to help and I couldn\u2019t be prouder. And as a Bank, we\u2019ll do everything we can to support the broader economy. We serve as the transmission mechanism for policymakers for both fiscal and monetary, which they can use as a bridge to the real economy. Looking forward, there are too many unknowns to count. The path that virus will chart, whether there will be successful interventions, the action government leaders will take either reopen the economy or put in place measures that will further restrict it. We also have to bear in mind, COVID-19 is a new disease and the medical guidance continues to evolve, as you would expect. But we feel confident in our ability to manage through whatever scenario comes to pass and with that, Mark will go through our presentations and then we\u2019d be happy to answer your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 4, Citigroup reported first quarter net income of $2.5 billion. Results included a $4.9 billion increase in credit reserves this quarter. This reserve increased reflects the impact of changes in our economic outlook due to COVID-19. These builds are larger, given a significant impact this change in our economic outlook has on our estimated lifetime losses under the new CECL standard. Revenues of $20.7 billion grew 12% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher markets revenues and the benefit of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges in our corporate lending portfolio. Expenses were roughly flat year-over-year, and we were able to deliver positive operating leverage and a 27% improvement in operating margin. Credit costs were $7 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 19% for the first quarter, below our full year outlook, reflecting a small benefit associated with stock-based incentive compensation. The ultimate economic impact of this health crisis and our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. The impact that we are already seeing varies across our franchise. We saw the earliest impact on consumer behavior in Asia as spending slowed in response to restrictions on travel and other commercial activity. We\u2019re seeing the same pattern today here in the US and now beginning in Mexico, which is likely to put pressure on loan balances. However, deposit growth remains strong across regions and we\u2019re leveraging digital channels to engage with our client. The rate environment has changed significantly. Our accrual businesses reflect the impact of the three US rate cuts seen last year, as well as some impact from additional cuts seen this quarter in response to the crisis, with an expectation for a more pronounced impact going forward. Although I would know that this has been partially offset in areas like TTS, where clients are moving volumes towards us as a stable partner of choice. A similar dynamic is playing out in markets, where we are also seen as a counterparty of choice. Additionally, we are seeing higher corporate loan volumes reflecting drawdowns and new facilities given our clients response to the crisis. And finally, our performance in investment banking reflects the market volatility we\u2019ve seen, as well as the uncertainty that remains on the corporate side. From the onset, we\u2019ve been focused on our employees and our clients and ensuring we maintain balance sheet strength to serve them through this uncertainty. As of March 31st, our CET 1 capital ratio was 11.2%, below our stated target of 11.5% even our efforts to support our clients through this period. Additionally, we had over $800 billion in available liquidity to help support our clients, and including the $4.1 billion transition impact as we adopted CECL at the beginning of the year, as well as the additional reserves taken this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $23 billion with a reserve ratio of 2.9% on funded loans.  With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserves we hold today, plus significant pre-provision earnings power, we are operating from a position of strength. We\u2019re combining this financial strength with operational resiliency, given investments in our people, operations and technology along with digital capabilities which allow us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues grew 2% as growth in North America was partially offset by lower revenues in Asia, reflecting the initial impact of COVID-19 on customer behavior. Expenses were roughly flat, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and 5% improvement in operating margin. Total credit costs of $4.8 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of approximately $2.8 billion, primarily related to the impact of changes in our economic outlook. Slide 6 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues of $5.2 billion were up 4% from last year. Although the impact of COVID-19 has only been felt in North America in recent weeks, we have leveraged our experience in Asia to inform our response strategy. We\u2019re one of the first banks in the US to provide assistance to help impacted customers starting in early March. We\u2019ve since expanded that support and continue to evaluate whether additional support is needed. In addition, the enhancements we have made to our digital capabilities have prepared us to better respond and continue serving our customers as they manage through this pricing. Digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter at $1.6 billion. We continue to drive mobile adoption of 13% year-over-year. We made change to allow our customers to use self service channels for more transactions, including increased limits for ATM withdrawals, mobile check deposits and Zelle transaction. And we\u2019ve continued to launch new digitally led value proposition such as Citi Wealth Builder, a new digital investment platform for clients in the emerging affluent segments. These capabilities are allowing us to remain engaged with our clients, even as roughly 40% of our branches in the US are now temporarily closed, driven by lower customer traffic, particularly in urban areas. Turning now to the businesses. Branded cards revenue of $2.3 billion grew 7% year-over-year, driven by 5% loan growth and continued spread expansion with net interest revenue as a percentage of loans improving to 933 basis points this quarter. Client engagement remained strong through February with purchase sales growth of roughly 10% for the first two months of the quarter. However, as seen across the industry, purchase sales declined significantly in late March with the implementation of more extensive lockdowns in many states. Categories like travel and entertainment have seen the biggest impact, while there has been some offset from higher spending on essentials as well as higher online sales. So in total, we grew a purchase sale of 3% in branded cards in the first quarter, but the trend line over the past month would indicate a significant decline in purchase activity in the second quarter, which is expected to impact loan growth. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were largely unchanged year-over-year, as a benefit of stronger deposit volumes and an improvement in mortgage revenues were offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continued to improve with average deposits of 8%. As I noted earlier, digital deposit sales remained strong this quarter even as we continue to adjust pricing, given the current rate environment. We also saw a strong engagement with existing clients, driving balanced growth across deposit [technical difficulty], including checking. While AUMs declined by 6% due to market movements, we drove continued growth in Citigold households and investment fees during the quarter and mortgage revenues grew as a result of increased refinancing activity. Finally, retail services revenues of $1.7 billion were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower partner payments and higher average loan. Purchase sales were down 3% year-over-year in the first quarter, again, including significant pressure in late March, driven by reduced client activity and store closures at some of our partners. This is expected to have an impact on new account acquisitions and loan balances as we move through the year. Total expenses for North America Consumer were down 1% year-over-year as efficiency savings more than offset investment spending and volume related costs. Turning to credit, total credit costs of $3.9 billion increased significantly from last year. We built roughly $2.4 billion in reserves this quarter, reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook. And net credit losses grew by 8% year-over-year, reflecting loan growth and seasoning in both cards portfolio. Our NCL rates in US branded cars and retail services were 346 and 553 basis points, respectively. Consistent with the uptake we\u2019ve typically seen in the first quarter. Historically, we\u2019ve seen higher NCL rates in the first half versus the second half of the year. However, given the rapidly changing economic environment due to COVID-19, we are likely to see increased pressure on NCL rates in the back half of 2020, consistent with the reserve actions we took this quarter. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 1% year-over-year in the first quarter. Despite the early emergence of COVID-19 in the region, we saw strong investment in FX revenues through most of the quarter. This was offset by lower purchase sales activity and loan balances in our card business, driven by restrictions on movement and changes in customer behavior. We also saw an impact on customer acquisitions in products like insurance, which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit growth remained strong at 8% this quarter, and we continue to drive digital engagement across the franchise. Today, we are seeing some early signs that we\u2019ll pick up in activity in China as movement restrictions have eased over the past week or so. But that is a small consumer business for us and of course, many other markets are still in an earlier stage of managing through the crisis. Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues were largely unchanged year-over-year and grew 3% excluding a residual gain last year on the sale of our asset management business. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 4%. And we\u2019re also benefitting from improved spreads in card. However, we continue to see pressure on overall loan growth. And while we haven\u2019t yet seen the full impact from COVID-19 in Mexico, we did see a slowdown in purchase sales in March, which is expected to continue as customer behavior will likely follow the pattern we\u2019ve seen in other regions. In total, operating expenses for our international business were up 3% in the first quarter, driven by Mexico, reflecting investments as well as episodic items partially offset by efficiency savings and cost of credit increased to $939 million, primarily driven by the impact of changes in our economic outlook. Slide 8 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends, which shows the seasonality we typically see in the first quarter. Overall, we have not seen a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our credit statistics, but it is still early. We do anticipate rising unemployment and therefore higher loss rates than originally expected for this year. However, it is unclear what benefit the historic $2 trillion relief package as well as our own customer relief efforts will have in helping to mitigate some of the potential stress on consumers. I would also note that we are taking appropriate actions to manage new and existing credit exposures, including investments in our operation. And importantly, as I\u2019ve noted on prior calls, we feel good about the quality of our consumer credit portfolios, both relative to the industry as well as Citi\u2019s historical risk exposure. If you look at our US card portfolios as an example, the FICO distributions of our outstanding loans and open to buy exposures due much more towards the higher end than before the 2008 crisis. And as a result, when we stress today\u2019s card portfolios to the same level as 2008, our pro forma loss rates are 25% to 30% lower than experienced in the last crisis. In Asia as you can see from our credit metrics, we maintain a very low risk portfolio targeted at high quality consumers in both our unsecured and mortgage portfolio, where our average LTV is less than 50%. In Mexico, we clearly serve a wider range of clients compared to our other region, given our national footprint. However, we generally target a higher quality segment than our local peers. The credit profile of our clients has improved over time, as we have remained disciplined and tightened down lending criteria since the crisis, which is reflected in our more stable NCL rates over the past few years. We generate strong margins in Mexico as well, with a net credit margin of cards for example, of roughly 20%. That said, clearly the impact of COVID-19 is not fully known at this point and we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.5 billion increased 25% in the first quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets as well as the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS and corporate lending. The quarter also benefited from the impact of $816 million of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges, as credit spreads widen during the quarter. Total banking revenues of $5.2 billion decreased 6%. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 5% as reported and 2% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Our global footprint enables us to have a unique relationship with our clients. Even the breadth of that relationship, we\u2019re playing a pivotal role in helping our clients navigate through these unprecedented times. We continue to see robust underlying business drivers in TTS, including 24% growth in end-of-period deposits in constant dollars, as well as 6% growth in cross-border flows. And we continue to see that benefit of our investment in technology, given the accelerated adoption of digital tools. In March, while we, as well as most of our clients were working remotely, we opened close to 1,000 accounts digitally, three times the number we opened digitally in March of last year. We\u2019ve also seen a rapid growth in CitiDirect users, up 25% year-over-year in the quarter to over 580,000 users. And within that, active mobile users increased tenfold this year. But as we exited the quarter, we did see the full pressure of the lower rate environment begins to take hold, with revenues down 9% year-over-year in the month of March on a reported basis. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were largely unchanged from last year, outperforming the market wallet as growth in M&A and equity underwriting were offset by decline in debt underwriting. However, I would note that investment grade debt underwriting was up double-digits year-over-year, as we helped our clients source liquidity in this evolving environment. Private bank revenues of $949 million grew 8%, driven by increased capital markets activity as we supported our clients through turbulent market conditions. In higher lending and deposit volumes, partially offset in lower deposit spreads, reflecting the impact of lower interest rate. Corporate lending revenues of $448 million were down 40%, primarily reflecting an adjustment to the residual value of the lease financing, as well as other marks on the portfolio. And while average loans were roughly flat, we did see a meaningful increase in end-of-period loans this quarter, reflecting the drawdowns and new facilities that I mentioned earlier, as we continue to support our clients. Total markets and Security Services revenues of $6.5 billion increased 37% from last year. Fixed income revenues of $4.8 billion to 39% year-over-year, with growth across rates and currencies and commodities. As volatility, volumes and spreads reached record levels, we actively made markets during this turbulent period for both corporate and investor clients. Equities revenues of $1.2 billion were up 39% versus last year, reflecting a strong performance in derivatives, including an increase in client activity due to higher volatility. And finally in security services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars, driven by higher client activity and deposit volume partially offset by lower spread. Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation costs, continued investments and volume-driven growth. Total credit costs of $2 billion were up significantly from last year, we built roughly $1.9 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves primarily reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as some downgrades along with volume growth in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our funded reserve ratio was 81 basis points, including a funded reserve ratio of roughly 2% on the non-investment grade portion. We provide more details on the corporate portfolio in the appendix to our earnings presentation. Total non-accrual loans increased sequentially this quarter, but the ratio of non-accrual to total corporate loans remained low at 57 basis points. Overall, we feel good about our corporate credit quality and like consumer, we remain vigilant in managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we see out there today. Slide 10 shows the results for corporate/other. Revenues of $73 million declined significantly from last year, reflecting the wind down of legacy asset, the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on legacy securities as spreads widened during the quarter. Expenses were down 24% as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs, as well as incremental costs associated with COVID-19, including a special compensation award granted to roughly 75,000 employees who are being most directly impacted by COVID-19. And the pretax loss was $535 million this quarter, higher than our previous outlook, reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, locks on security, the impact of lower rates as well as the special compensation award. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.5 billion this quarter declined slightly year-over-year as the impact of lower rates was mostly offset by loan growth and an extra day, along with higher trading related NIR. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $330 million, reflecting the lower rate environment, one fewer day in the quarter and the adjustment in corporate lending that I mentioned earlier. And net interest margin declined 15 basis points sequentially, with lower net interest revenues driving roughly half of the decline and the remainder reflecting growth in the balance sheet. Turning to non-interest revenue, in the first quarter, healthy business performance for most of the quarter as well as a strong pickup in trading activity in March drove a significant increase in non-interest revenue. As we look to the second quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline, reflecting the full quarter impact of lower rates, as well as a much more pronounced impact from COVID-19. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. During the quarter, our CET 1 capital ratio declined to 11.2% driven mostly by the increase in risk weighted assets. The increase in RWA reflected our support to our customers as well as increased market volatility and widening credit spreads. Our supplementary in leverage ratio was 6%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $71.52 driven by net income and the reduced share count. In summary, the environment changed dramatically this quarter, but we continue to operate well in a challenging environment. We ended the period with a strong capital liquidity position. We certainly saw the impact of slower global growth and macro uncertainty on our top line results as we exited the quarter. But we feel good about our ability to manage risk through the cycle. We remain disciplined in our target client strategy and feel strongly that our focus on these higher quality, more resilient segments is the right strategy in any economic environment. Looking to the second quarter and the rest of 2020, let me remind you that we are all operating with a great deal of uncertainty today. And our performance will continue to evolve over the coming quarters. With that said, given the adverse impact of COVID-19, we no longer expect to deliver a RoTCE of 12% to 13% for the full year. Based on what we\u2019re seeing today, on the top line, we expect the revenue trend in the latter part of March and the beginning of April characterized by COVID related lower level of activity, particularly in banking, and our consumer franchise, will continue through much of the second quarter. And in our markets business, revenue should reflect the broader industry. The first quarter is typically the strongest quarter, and clearly this year was particularly strong, so we would expect some normalization in activity levels here. And finally, we will see the more pronounced impact of the lower rate environment on the top line. On the expense side, there are couple things that are important to consider as we think about running the franchise and managing our expenses, including the uncertainty of the impact of COVID-19, how do we continue to protect our employees who are on the front line and how do we ensure that we are able to help our customers manage through this. And from this standpoint, we\u2019re being thoughtful about where we need to deploy resources to ensure we can deliver for our customers, in a period where roughly 80% of our workforce is working remotely. Here we feel good about the investments we\u2019ve made over the last few years in technology. These investments are allowing us to manage through this period, and support our customers and clients through digital mean. However, I would also note that during these unprecedented times, we are also exploring all opportunities to operate as efficiently as possible and potentially repay certain investments we would have otherwise made, in order to offset some of the headwinds created by COVID-19. We would also expect to see a natural reduction and some volume related expenses, including T&E, meetings and event calls. So again, there\u2019s a lot of uncertainty today, but we will have more to say on both the top line impact as well as these efficiency efforts in the coming month as the impact of COVID-19 is better understood. But that should hopefully give you a sense of how we\u2019re thinking about the environment and our pre-provision earnings power. Turning to credit. Looking ahead to the second quarter and the remainder of 2020, we do expect a higher level of losses given our current outlook. And as our outlook continues to evolve, it is also reasonable to expect additional increases in credit reserves if our outlook deteriorates further. However, given the credit quality of our portfolio, we remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers and win new business. Undoubtedly, every company around the world will feel an economic impact from this unprecedented situation. But we are confident that Citi will emerge in a position of strength, having demonstrated that we lived up to our stated objective to be an indisputably strong and stay institution and having shown that we stood by our clients and supported our customers and employees during this very difficult time. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. I\u2019m curious if you\u2019d give us a little bit more of the assumptions behind the reserve build and \u2013 because card is \u2013 is a little bigger for you guys. I\u2019m curious if you could talk about the reserve and how you think about it from a branded versus retail services partner card perspectives? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. Good morning, Glenn. So you know, you can turn to page 20, we\u2019ve broken out some additional you know, details here and you can see you know, we started or ended the year, I should say with about $14 billion in reserves, you\u2019re right the lion\u2019s share that is in cards in split between branded you know, and retail and you know our focus obviously is tends to be on the higher \u2013 the higher FICO scored you know, clients and that skews certainly the case in cards and tends to be higher on retail services, but not quite as high as on the cards\u2019 side. And so that\u2019s going to you know, impact a little bit the split between the two. You can see in terms of the day one impact that was about $4.1 billion. We talked about that on the last call, and we built another $4.9 billion, so that gets us to a total reserve balance of almost $23 billion. What it point out is you know, the cards piece obviously is at roughly $9.5 billion, but again \u2013 I mean 9.5%, excuse me of LLR to loans. But again you know, we tend to you know, to think of this as a higher quality book. In terms of the factors that become important you know, there are a host of variables that we run through our model, as well as combined with severity of a recession, probability of a recession, I would say that the two most critical as it relates to cards and again, they\u2019re all important in understanding how they work together becomes important. But two very important ones become obviously GDP and unemployment, and how that affects the underlying behavior of the consumer in each of those instances. Obviously, the retail services there, our partners that we have that are you know, more directly impacted by the COVID-19 situation, but we also have the $2 trillion relief stimulus that\u2019s been introduced and a little bit unclear as to how that ultimately plays out and impacts the behavior. So lots of puts and takes going you know, through the model, the \u2013 those economic assumptions change kind of straight through the end of the quarter, but the short of it is that you know, based on our outlook as have been you know, this additional build of $2.4 billion per cards you know was the appropriate amount for us to take. Glenn Schorr : Okay, that\u2019s a very helpful side. Thank you. Maybe just one follow-up on, I\u2019m curious your view, because you\u2019re in the midst of all of it of how much has the financial plumbing been improved by some of the government actions, and then where you, most importantly, where you see that we need the most improvement less to come on the plumbing things like, money markets, CP, I\u2019m talking about reserve banks? Mike Corbat : Yeah, Glenn, I would say that the actions that we\u2019ve seen out of the combination of the Fed and the Treasury are truly extraordinary, not just in terms of the volume of dollars and programs, but I think the breath that\u2019s there and the speed at which they\u2019ve implemented them I mean, whether it\u2019s it's been the CP facility, the money market liquidity facility, the repo facilities, the broader corporate pieces, the SBA loans and now not something that\u2019s being talked about that much, but this main street program that\u2019s there. And I think from a plumbing perspective, your question\u2019s a good one, because obviously the real economy doesn\u2019t have direct access to the Fed or to the Treasury. And I think if the banks and in particular, the big banks role, one of many roles that we played to be that transmission mechanism between fiscal monetary and the real economy. And I think you can just see in terms of in the early days, how the markets were trading, a lot of the fears and concerns that were there and whether it was the early fears of draws, whether it was the early fears of money funds that being able to get liquidity across the board, and I think the programs have gone a long way. I think that there still a few things out there that probably need some work. And certainly, as an institution, as an industry, we\u2019re in constant dialogue with the Fed and the Treasury on those. And again, as I suspect as those things create challenges, it\u2019s likely that we will see a reaction come out of those bodies to be able to address it. So I think the plumbing is actually working pretty well that in spite of working remotely and the numbers that Mark and I spoke to, and we had in late March record volumes of trading in terms of settlement, clearing, margin \u2013 margining in the system. And again, most of that done remotely and you know, we all would have said to each other 6, 9, 12 months ago you know, we\u2019re going to model for this type of stress, we probably all would have been skeptical in terms of how the system performs. So I\u2019m proud of how we\u2019ve performed and I\u2019m quite pleased so far, how the system has performed. Glenn Schorr : Excellent. Thank you, both. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Hi, Erika. Good morning. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to \u2013 Mike Corbat : Good morning, Erika. Erika Najarian : Thank you, Mark. Hi, I wanted to clarify your statement on card losses. So just want to make sure I was interpreting it correctly. You said that the losses today, the cumulative losses today could be 20% lower than the global financial crisis experienced. And when I look back at the regulatory data, \u201909 and 2010 would add up to a 20% loss rate. So wanted just to make sure I \u2013 we were interpreting that correctly that you know, you could see losses of 15% to 16% in card in a cumulative loss scenario, which is about in line with both the company run DFAST and the Fed stress test? Mark Mason : Yeah, sure I mean, what I said was that you know, if you take the cards portfolio we have today which is of a better quality, then it was back in \u201808, and you were to stress it for the \u201808 financial crisis that yes, our pro forma loss rates would be 25% to 30% lower than what we experienced in the last crisis. That is \u2013 that\u2019s what I see. Mike Corbat : And I think to be clear, Erika not \u2013 that\u2019s not a prediction, it\u2019s just a level setting based on historic data. Erika Najarian : Got it. And one of your peers noted in a call yesterday, that they were comfortable going below their regulatory minimum of 10.5% to serve its clients. And I\u2019m wondering what Citi\u2019s stance is ongoing below that 10% bright line, especially since that\u2019s where the automatic distributions on dividend and other payouts kick in? Mark Mason : Yeah, why don\u2019t I start, Mike or? Mike Corbat : Sure, go ahead. Mark Mason : You know look, I think our view is, we are clearly living in an uncertain period of time. The crisis we\u2019re facing is unprecedented. And you know, if I think about our objectives, you know, primary objective ensuring the safety and wellbeing of our employees, second to that or an addition to that ensuring that we are positioned to serve our clients, our customers and to play an important role in stabilizing the economy. And so when I think about the combination of those things, we want to be there for our clients. And I think we\u2019re expected to be there for our clients in a period like this. And you\u2019ve seen our CET1 ratio dropped to 11.2% this quarter and as the needs of our clients evolve, we\u2019re going to be there for them and that means that our ratio takes more pressure than we\u2019ll manage through that. If we were to drop you know, below the 10% that you referenced, there\u2019s still plenty of room between that and the use of the buffer that the - you know, that the regulators have authorized. And so we\u2019re managing it thoughtfully, diligently but in the context of those priorities that I mentioned. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Mark Mason : Yeah. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. How are you? Mark Mason : Good morning, Betsy. Mike Corbat : Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Question on \u2013 as it relates to the use of that capital part of it is coming from the drawdowns and I wanted to understand how you think your clients are going to be using those drawdowns. Do you expect them to persist for you know, many quarters, many years or do you think that you know, we will, over the next 12 months see some pay down of that through terming out in the capital markets and maybe also give us a sense as to the associated deposits, how much of the drawdowns came back into you know, your liquidity via the deposits and persistency there as well would be helpful? Thanks. Mike Corbat : Yeah, so Betsy I would say kind of looking at the numbers, we had roughly right around about $30 billion, $32 billion worth of draws in the first quarter, so somewhere 10% or 11%, 12% of our outstanding, but unfunded. So I wouldn\u2019t call that an overly meaningful number. And I think going back to my earlier comment to Glenn, I think that the extraordinary actions taken in the CP facilities in terms of some of the corporate facilities, some of the SBA or probably more likely the main street lending facilities alleviates a lot of that pressure. I think we saw two things there, there were clearly those industries that were under stress and those were pretty easily identifiable along the list that Mark had described. And then I think there were those that just believed that it was a good time to bring in liquidity. And I think as the Fed programs and the Treasury programs came into place, the bond markets reopened, you saw record issuance of debt in the late first quarter. And again, when you look at our portfolio, it\u2019s predominantly an investment grade portfolio and that investment grade portfolio in times with those programs in place has access to the capital markets. And so we saw people shift there. Obviously something we were paying attention to. We\u2019re in constant dialogue with our clients. But again, I think you know, certainly coming into the second quarter, we\u2019ve actually seen really de minimis draws on the facilities and I think in our dialogues, we don\u2019t see or feel that pressure right now. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And then on the deposit side, can you give us a sense as to, you know, the percentage of the draws that went into deposits and how you think about the persistency of those deposits as well? Mark Mason : Yeah let me comment a little bit more broadly on the deposits. So you know, the ICG deposits that we saw come in the month of March, we\u2019re about $92 billion our deposits grew pretty significantly just in the month of March. And if I break that down about a third of that were from corporate clients that built liquidity through draws or issuance. And it\u2019s not you know, necessarily just liquidity you know, just draws from us, but about a third of it, we would attribute as being tied towards that increase in liquidity draws or issuances that they\u2019ve done. About a third were from brokered dealers and clearing houses and financial institutions as they bolstered kind of their liquidity buffers. And then a third were from investor clients derisking and moving to cash. And so that gives you a little bit of a sense for a mix. We obviously look at the persistency of the deposits and you know, some of those are certainly operating deposits. And I think part of what will inform the view to some extent is, as Mike described you know, the additional you know, channels that are now available for clients to access additional liquidity as needed. But also how long this persist and there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty as you\u2019ve heard us reference as to how long you know, this crisis we\u2019re managing through persists. So hopefully it gives you a sense. Betsy Graseck : Got it. And you know, the fact that the drawdowns have slowed dramatically you know, de minimis in your words, Mike, the pressure, I would expect going forward on CET1 is going to you know, pull back as well. So maybe you could give us a sense as to how you\u2019re thinking about that? And then you know, in the context of that how you\u2019re thinking about the dividend? Thanks. Mike Corbat : Sure. So you know, I think as Mark described, the way you know, we thought about, you saw us kind of put a balance sheet to use and you saw the CET1 move from the 11.8% to the 11.2%, clearly leaving us lots of room, lots of buffer. And again, we\u2019re early in this, you know, we don\u2019t know and where this will go, but our gut or how we\u2019re thinking about this is \u2013 this recovery is going to be uneven. I would say that as a team, we\u2019ve pretty well discounted, a uniform V-shaped recovery. The question, is it U-shaped? Is it W-shaped or parts of it L-shaped? And I think we want to retain a lot of flexibility and capacity to be able to step into the situations that count. And again I think as we said that, if there\u2019s two roles, one is, how do we use our own balance sheet? And then how do we actually use and bring to life a lot of these programs and continue programs that have been put out there by the Fed and the Treasury. So in the right situations, we\u2019re prepared to let that ratio go down. We\u2019re in conversations with our board. We are in conversations with our regulator and I think Mark said you know, we feel that we\u2019ve got a lot of capacity in terms of capital and things that we can do before we get near triggering any conversations around dividend, but again, we\u2019re going to treat that as a time when it comes. But you know, to be clear, in our capacity here and the way we\u2019re looking at things you know, we remained committed to paying our dividend. Betsy Graseck : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. A couple of more questions on the card business if you don\u2019t mind. So if you kind of separate the branded cards from the retail services and just can you help us talk about just what you\u2019re seeing \u2013 you know, relatively speaking in terms of we can see it in the rate of change that happened in the first quarter, but would you expect divergence in either spending trends, volume balances and credit as this evolves or any color you can help us with there? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure, I don\u2019t \u2013 why don\u2019t I start just in terms of the spend. And so you know in the quarter if I think about kind of the last week of March, the card spend activity you know, just broadly for us was down about 30% US spend, you know, by category down total of 30%. The big you know, categories, if you will, impact it are not going to be of any surprise to you travel down 75%, dining and entertainment down some 60% you know, discretionary retail which would include you know, apparel, the department stores, et cetera, down 50% you know, essentials were up 10%. And so, as you would \u2013 as I think you would expect and again, that got us to a total of down about 30% in just the last week. We all have seen what has continued to happen over the past couple of weeks. And so, I would expect, we would expect there to be continued pressure on purchase sale volumes through most of the second quarter, in light of the way this is persisting, and that you know, should play out as well on ultimately loan volumes in which we expect to see some top line pressure there. You know, similarly as you referenced that we have a large retail services business and we have partner clients who we advise in that regard and we\u2019ve been working with them to help drive sales digitally. But obviously the shutdown in most of the economy and the stay at home orders as well as the temporary store closures across most of the country will certainly impact our partners and our results, including a slowdown in new customer acquisitions as well as again, a lower purchase sales volumes \u2013 volume through you know, through that part of our business. You know, that said you know, we\u2019ve got a number of partners who do operate or a large partner I should say who do operate you know as essential resources to you know, to the economy and while they\u2019ll have lower store traffic, they will be able to continue to kind of serve. And ultimately you know, as I said, we would expect the second quarter to have some of that top line pressure play through and over the course of the year to see a pickup in NCLs subject to, of course, how things like the $2 trillion relief package and some of the other customer relief offerings that we put out take hold. Ken Usdin : Yeah, and thank you and just a follow-up and you know, should and if you know balances come down, just given that card is such a bigger part of your balance sheet. This \u2013 is there a positive offset that comes through with regards to the reserving needs. Just wondering how cards specifically for you guys in that in and out with regards to you know, spend and outstandings informs how the ins and outs of card reserve builds? If that\u2019s a fair question. Mike Corbat : Yeah. So I mean, if you think about CECL and how it works in the idea of building expected lifetime losses in any given quarter, there are number of factors that come into play, you know, so your probability of recession, your severity of recession, our view on the important economic variables and how they\u2019re going to play out as well as balances. And so, as the balances you know, shift and the mix and makeup of those balances shift, that\u2019s going to have an impact on what we would expect in the way of those lifetime losses and therefore, what we would expect in a way of how that reserve balance would move. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay, thanks a lot. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Good morning. So in the US there\u2019s obviously a lot of efforts underway that kind of soften the blow to the consumer as we think about credit losses, there\u2019s the fiscal health, there\u2019s payment deferrals. Maybe you could just talk about kind of what\u2019s going on in Mexico and Asia and some of your bigger markets there in terms of you know things that might soften the blow for the consumer. And you know is that as meaningful as kind of what we\u2019re seeing here? Or how do you factor that into your thought process on potential losses? Mike Corbat : Yeah, Matt, I think that\u2019s a great question. And I think as you think about it as, we think about all the places we come to work, I think we\u2019ve got to use a series of lenses to really look at where these countries and these economies are, I would say, one is that you\u2019ve got to look first at the health crisis response. Have the government\u2019s taking it seriously? Have they put measures? Have they put social distancing? Have they put stay in place types of things and what\u2019s the trajectory of that look like? I think the second piece is around what you see in terms of both monetary and fiscal response. And not just what\u2019s been to-date, but what\u2019s been the capacity of those economies to be able to implement those and more things, potentially into the future. And I think the third important piece that we look at is the underlying demographics of the economy as an example, do they have big exposures or are they dependent on oil exports or other commodities or other types of things where there\u2019s concentrations around that. And so I would say that that it\u2019s not by region, it is really and we are taking really a country-by-country approach to what that is. And I think you\u2019ve seen it all over the map in terms of very strong responses out of the US, out of Japan. You\u2019ve seen some responses out of Europe and I think you\u2019ve seen some of those that are slower. In particular, to your question on Mexico is, we know the President has labeled himself a fiscal hawk and I think he has been reluctant to use any type of outsized spending to go at this crisis to-date. And obviously we\u2019re watching that carefully. We\u2019ve tried to be pretty prudent in terms of our credit standards there and the things that we\u2019re doing and we\u2019re obviously watching it closely. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. And then just want to follow-up on that. I mean remind us, I think your targeted customer base in Mexico you know, is much higher than I would say, the broad-based customers. So maybe just remind us about some of the credit metrics in the card portfolio in Mexico specifically? Thank you. Mark Mason : I \u2013 Mike Corbat : Mark, do you want to \u2013 Mark Mason : I don\u2019t have the credit metrics available. What I would say is that, you know, while we do appeal to the broader population there, we do tend to focus on the higher and certainly relative to our peer players in that Mexico market. And so, we do skew to the higher end in terms of the credit profile. They have a different system and the FICO system per se. And we actually have been you know, very closely monitoring as you\u2019ve seen over the past number of quarters our loan volumes have, in fact, trended lower than that of the broader industry as we\u2019ve you know, been and quite vigilant about focus and staying inside of our risk parameters, which again, do skew higher than most of the peers in that country. Matt O\u2019Connor: Yeah. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Security. Mike Mayo : Sorry if I missed part of this. In terms of additional reserve builds ahead, another $5 billion in the second or third quarter. Yes, no, maybe. Mark Mason : Hi, Mike. Let me make a couple of comments to that. One, you know, again, a lot of uncertainty here dealing with a significant crisis as you well know. Even as we have closed out this quarter, the variables you know, that we look at continue to shift you know, meaningfully. I would expect that you know, with that as a backdrop, and again, subject to a lot of things including how customers respond to the relief programs that are out there, so on and so forth that we would see additional builds in the second quarter. And that\u2019s kind of where we are. I mean I \u2013 I\u2019m not going to you know, we\u2019ve got the rest of the quarter to play out. We\u2019ve got you know, analysis and models that we have to do. We have you know, consumers that have to respond to much of the stimulus that\u2019s out there. We\u2019ve got to understand how it continues to impact the different businesses that we\u2019re in. it\u2019s way too early to give you any sense for what that number is. Mike Mayo : Okay. And what lessons have you learned from Asia? I mean, the virus was there first. You should have a little more of a head start than other banks that don\u2019t have that experience and what are you seeing in terms of you know, volumes and credit losses and your ability to work with the clients? Mark Mason : Yeah. Mike Corbat : Yeah, so I think that \u2013 Mark Mason : Go ahead, Mike sorry. Mike Corbat : I would say that you know, in some ways, Mike, we you know, if you want to call it that have been fortunate to have lived that. And I think you know, we took a lot of lessons and I think you saw in our actions in terms of the moves we took in terms of getting people \u2013 remotely getting people home of the types of client engagement. And I would say, less than one that we\u2019re watching very closely is the resurgence of cases as people start to come back in. And so I think we\u2019ve got to be very mindful about how and when or when and how we, in fact, do that. You saw us in very early March go, I think is the first US bank to go out and engage around in particular, our consumer customers in terms of opening up channels and talking about some forbearances and some forgiveness on fees and other things to get them engaged. And I think to Mark\u2019s point and you can see it in the credit numbers that so far relatively benign and we\u2019ve been putting programs in place in most, if not all of our Asian countries in terms of similar types of forbearance programs and really trying to engage around that. So it\u2019s early, but again you could \u2013 you can see the numbers that would probably 60 days in or so that we probably had a reasonably full February and March in terms of COVID in terms of Asia, but you know, again we\u2019re watching the numbers closely, but it\u2019s around the engagement and the programs and you know, some of it was dusting off the playbooks from \u201808 and in some of the things in between. Mike Mayo : And if I can just follow-up. You talked about the resurgence of cases and people come back in, in Asia. I mean are your employees coming back yet? Are you seeing this or is this just third-party you know, medical advice that you\u2019re receiving? Are you seeing this firsthand? And when do you plan to open Asia back up? You know, in Citi Asia? I mean, how many people are working remote? How many people are in the office? Mike Corbat : Yeah, you may have missed it. But we talked a little bit earlier, Mike in terms of the unevenness of this, that when you think of this virus that you know, it\u2019s not only uneven in terms of pacing in terms of where we are in the world, we\u2019ve got at least a two to three span just in the United States in terms of where the virus is. And you know, within Asia you know, we\u2019ve seen probably the most concerted efforts to get people back in in terms of China and I would say, we are largely back there. I think the last numbers I looked at as of yesterday, we were about two-thirds back in terms of Hong Kong and I would say, most of the rest of the region at lower levels than that. And so we\u2019re taking a very specific or very site-by-site view in terms of how we bring people back. So, you know, first criteria is where is the virus in its trajectory? Second criteria is, what are the things that happen at a site that are very difficult to replicate in a remote environment? And then in terms of addressing that, what\u2019s the safest way we can begin to bring people back? So that I think that \u2013 Mike Mayo : But that\u2019s pretty remarkable two-thirds back in Hong Kong. So that\u2019s you know, cautiously optimistic for what\u2019s ahead here or don\u2019t read too much? Mike Corbat : Again, I think it\u2019s place-by-place so I think we\u2019ve you know, we\u2019re taking a kind of a site-by-site and \u2013 but at the same time you know, understanding again, you probably missed this part of it, you know, we\u2019re absolutely open for business. We\u2019re just working differently, right. If you look at the things that we\u2019ve accomplished just in the month of March, it\u2019s not that we\u2019re not at work. You know, as an example, yesterday you know, we had over 180,000 people accessing our systems remotely at one time our peak search was 132,000 of those people on simultaneously. You think about the things that have accomplished Mark and his finance team, you know, closed the quarter on a $2 trillion balance sheet. You look at this submission of CCAR, you look at all the things that remediation efforts, the small business programs, all being applied remotely. So again, it\u2019s going to be bespoke in terms of how we do it, as Mark said, with an eye towards making sure we keep our people safe. And at the same time doing everything we can do to service our customers and clients through this extraordinary time. And it\u2019s going to be case-by-case. Mike Mayo : All right, thank you. Mike Corbat : Thank you. Mark Mason : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hi. Hey, good morning guys. Mark Mason : Hey, Saul. Good morning. Saul Martinez : A couple of CECL questions, so please bear with me. But you know, first I want to get your perspective on the DFAST stress losses and whether you think it\u2019s a good reference point to judge reserve adequacy under CECL, because we do get a lot of questions asking why allowance level are so much below, what the nine quarter stress losses are in the severely adverse scenario in the adversary. And I think that\u2019s true for you guys. And you know, my personal view is that, DFAST is a useful data point, but that there are fundamental differences you know, obviously beyond the differences in the economic scenarios used. The point of DFAST is to estimate loss absorbing capacity in a severe downturn. And maybe estimates are going to be on the conservative end of losses where as under CECL, like these are point in time estimates that you\u2019re \u2013 are your best guesses of what your losses will be over the life of the loans under an economic scenario. So, let alone the lot of methodological differences in terms of how you calculate those things in terms of things like you know, weighted average remaining life or whatever it is. But I\u2019m curious if you have a perspective and whether you think you know, there \u2013 the stress losses should be sort of a reference point or you know, or how useful they are to measure whether you know, a given bank or your bank has adequate reserves? Mark Mason : Look, I think you said a lot there. I think that it is a reference point, I think you\u2019ve highlighted you know, some meaningful differences in the approaches and perspectives everything from you know, the modeling, the assumptions like et cetera, et cetera. And so I think it does serve as a reference point. But I think what we\u2019re experiencing now and even as we submitted a plan from a CCAR point of view, is that you know, that\u2019s a scenario. It certainly is a stress scenario, but we\u2019re now living through a real life stress situation. And I think you know, that scenario is meant to \u2013 those scenarios are meant to inform you know, a firm\u2019s ability to withstand stress, but we\u2019ve got a real test here that has put us and I think the industry in a position where we are constantly you know, modeling and demonstrating our ability to withstand real-time pressures and the prospect of real life losses. Now with that said, you know, CECL, you know, a new approach I think that the timing is interesting in that we get to see a \u2013 we see a meaningful shift between transition and day one, which I would think in a normal environment, you wouldn\u2019t see that type of dramatic shift. But again you know, that\u2019s informed by you know, a view \u2013 a forward looking view of what is now a crisis in a stressed environment. And so that magnitude of the change that we see in the day two is a direct byproduct of that. And I think what we\u2019ll see is, that continues to you know, that what we do in the way of forward reserves will continue to be informed by that. And what we ultimately experienced in losses, however, will be informed by how much of the uncertainty that I talked to plays out. So again, no stress scenario that\u2019s been created you know, thus far you know, would have contemplated the amount of fiscal response and monetary response that we\u2019ve seen in short order. You know and so that\u2019s not modeled and how customers or consumers react to that is not part of any CCAR DFAST model that we would have run. How that offsets the impact of you know, unemployment or ultimately losses is completely unclear. And so, there\u2019s a fair amount, you know, yes, it\u2019s a data point you know, but there\u2019s a fair amount of uncertainty and now differences I would expect in light of now managing through a real life scenario. Saul Martinez : That\u2019s helpful. If I can follow-up, you guys use one scenario, most large banks use these multiple scenarios in calculating their reserves. But \u2013 sorry if I missed this, but can you just outline you know that the sort of big picture, some of the big picture assumptions you\u2019re using whether it\u2019s you know, global growth or US growth or unemployment that underlie that scenario. And I guess it\u2019s sort of an adjunct to that. Does using one scenario create more volatility, because if you\u2019re using the scenario analysis you know, you can kind of calibrate between different outcomes, whereas it\u2019s more of a a big change if you change your outlook, it\u2019s just one scenario to another in your case as opposed to maybe a grade of different outcomes if you were to use sort of a weighted average scenario analysis that most banks use. So does it \u2013 do you think it creates more volatility and more jumps and releases than you otherwise would have? Mark Mason : Yeah, so we do use a model approach, where we use a scenario, but what I would say is that, that scenario was informed by kind of a further management adjustment and the factors that are considered are not only thousands of variables like GDP and unemployment and many, many, many other stats given the nature of the business that we do, but also the probability of recession and the severity of the recession and we can toggle in our management adjustment degrees of severity that we would expect in a recession, whether that\u2019s 25%, 50%, 75% and a 100% in terms of the severity relative to an \u201808 recession or whatever the case might be. So, while we do use a model and one scenario, there is flex there, if you will, in terms of ensuring that we capture what we think best reflects the forward view of the economic outlook in our analysis. And in terms of as we \u2013 as I may have mentioned \u2013 I think I mentioned earlier at some point you\u2019ve got to put a stake in the ground at the end of the quarter and look at the assumptions that we have to work with in terms of those thousands of variables and certainly the key ones that I mentioned. And this quarter in particular, we\u2019ve seen things continue to move and so even the view that we would have taken at the end of the quarter around many of those metrics \u2013 the outlook on them have been \u2013 has continued to shift. And so we find ourselves running various scenarios to understand the impact on our ratios and on our estimated losses, including ranges of unemployment from 10% to 15% and GDP declines from 20% to 40% we\u2019re constantly kind of running those scenarios to understand the implications on our CET1 ratio and other important metrics that are required to properly run and manage and plan at the firm. Saul Martinez : Got it. Okay, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Mark Mason : Okay. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Great, thanks. Mark, just quick question first on the ICG and the reserve coverage there. I hear that you said that you\u2019re comfortable with it. When you kind of look at the reserve that you have against the total exposures. It\u2019s about an 80 basis points against all the exposures, but yeah, you\u2019re looking at non-investment grade being 21% of the portfolio. So what kind of metrics are you keying on to get comfort there? It doesn\u2019t seem like it takes a large amount of delinquencies also and have a large increase in losses? Mark Mason : You know, look we\u2019ve got, there are series of metrics that we use in the case of the ICG, GDP is an important metric, obviously a view on downgrades is an important metric, a view on energy prices, oil prices is an important metric and as you \u2013 we don\u2019t have the entire portfolio parsed here. But that 81 basis points is going to be a mix of where we feel as though we need to have more \u2013more reserves and so one example is that when we built additional reserves and you can look at kind of our reserve ratio for the energy sector for example and that\u2019s closer to 2%, 2.1% in terms of the funded reserve ratio. And so, I highlight that as just a simple example of obviously there going to be some higher, some lower and in terms of the broader non-investment grade similar to that example, I just gave you, the broader non-investment grade bucket is closer to 2% in terms of the reserve ratio. So, again, I can understand the question given the 81 basis points, but we are \u2013 obviously are using good judgment as we look through the different risk profile of the portfolio. Brian Kleinhanzl : And then with regards to the guidance that you\u2019re giving about how March and April could trend out to the rest of the quarter, I mean, is there any given update on kind of \u2013 I\u2019m sorry if you gave it already, but how purchase sales were trending in April and how the revenues in TTS were trending in April. I mean, you said March they were down 9% in TTS, is that gotten worse in April? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. I don\u2019t have the spend activity at hand. If I look here for April. I\u2019m not sure if you call it, I said earlier, but the card spend activity towards the end of March, the last week in March has been around 30%, down 30% with a mix across the difference across the differences in the different categories. In terms of TTS, again, I don\u2019t have the April stats, we did see kind of pressure in the month of March and what I was referencing there was the rate pressure playing through in terms of commercial card activity just as another proxy for spend similar to the retail card or consumer card spend levels that was down pretty meaningfully, which says a lot about our corporate client base in terms of T&E, commercial card spend was down almost 60% and kind of B2B, business-to-business, commercial card activity was down some 19% in the month of March. And so, but likely those trends continue. However, I would kind of just note that we continue to see very good engagement with our TTS client base and we see that in the higher volumes that we saw in Q1, we expect as that will continue, we see that in the new accounts that we\u2019re opening with them, we would expect that to continue, including utilizing many of our digital capabilities there. And frankly, as this continues to evolve with all of the uncertainty that it comes with, we would expect that we\u2019re going to be a critical partner to these large multinational clients as they think about what the new norm looks like. And so the metrics will move, the top line will move in light of the rate environment, but I think those underlying drivers, if you will, say a lot about what the future prospects are for the firm here. Mike, you want to comment on \u2013 Mike Corbat : If I can just quickly, Mark before we close out here. I just want to go back to Mike\u2019s question and apologize for having flipped my numbers. We\u2019ve got globally over 80% of our staff working remotely and the number in Hong Kong is that we\u2019ve got about a third back and two-thirds still working remotely. So Mike, I apologize for getting that one inverted. Operator with that, I think that concludes the call. Operator : Thanks for today \u2013 Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you all for joining us today. Please feel free to reach out to us in Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your calling. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have objections please disconnect at the time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Liz and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the second quarter of 2020, with net income of $1.3 billion and earnings per share of $0.50. As in the first quarter, credit cost weighed down our net income. However, the overall business performance was strong which shows that we've been able to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well so far. The solid revenue growth at 5% and strong expense management down 1% both on the year-on-year basis, our margin was up 13%. We grew loans and our deposits were up significantly. Our regulatory capital increased and we continue to add to our substantial liquidity and our balance sheet has more than ample capacity to continue to serve our clients. The Institutional Clients Group had an exceptional quarter. Fixed income was at 68%. We had our best investment banking quarter in recent history and private bank revenues approached $1 billion. And while Treasury and Trade Solutions continued to be impacted by the lower rate environment, we did see good client engagement and strong deposit growth in that business. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down and spending slowed significantly due to the pandemic. In North America, despite the decline in purchase sale activity, Branded Cards revenues were up slightly due to a mix shift towards earnings balances. At the same time, Retail Services saw a significant decline in consumer spending with our partners.  Retail Banking saw higher mortgage revenue from refinancing activity due to the low rate environment. In Asia, the slowdown in travel and consumer activity again reduced revenues. And in Mexico, revenues declined as the country is struggling from the effects of the health pandemic. Our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity Tier 1 ratio increasing to 11.5% on an advanced basis. I was pleased with our results from the Federal Reserve's related stress test placing our stress capital buffer at 2.5%. This leads us comfortably about our new regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share of $71.15 was down only slightly from the first quarter, but still up 5% from a year ago. We plan to keep paying our quarterly dividend as long as macroeconomic and financial conditions permit. During the quarter, we continue to support our clients, colleagues and communities through this pandemic. While I'd like to see more of our people back in the office, we've been clear that we won't do anything to jeopardize their health and safety. Most recently, we pause plans to invite a limited number of colleagues back to sites located in areas where the health data was going in the wrong direction. We've also remained committed to supporting communities through a variety of initiatives. These now total over a $100 million in contributions from our company and its foundation. But what I'm most proud of is the $2 million which my colleagues donated out of their own pockets to organization providing COVID relief as part of our matching program. And we recently made our first distribution to the Citi Foundation representing $25 million in net profits from the Payroll Protection Program to support Community Development, Financial Institutions. We're also partnering with minority-owned depository institutions to help them extend credit to businesses through PPP by purchasing their loans through a $50 million facility. This effort is even more important as we look at the economic disparities drawn along racial lines in our society. And, of course, we continue to serve our clients whether it's providing consumer relief or helping companies access the capital markets to strengthen their balance sheets. We enter the second half in a strong position to handle what comes our way. We are in a completely unpredictable environment for which no models, no cycles to point to. The pandemic has a grip on the economy and it doesn't seem likely to loosen until vaccines are widely available. We'll keep managing through this with a sharp emphasis on our risk management and continue to make investments in our infrastructure to enhance our safety, soundness and controls to ensure that we have an industry with strong and stable institution. With that Mark will go through our presentation. And then we will be happy to answer your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4. Citigroup reported second quarter net income of $1.3 billion which included a $5.6 billion increase in credit reserve this quarter, primarily reflecting the deterioration in the economic outlook since the end of the first quarter under CECL and downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio. The reserve bill also includes an additional qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and/or a somewhat slower recovery. Revenues of $19.8 billion grew by 5% from the prior year, primarily reflecting higher fixed income and investment banking records. Expenses were down slightly year-over-year resulting in positive operating leverage and a 13% improvement in operating margin. Credit costs were $7.9 billion this quarter. Our effective tax rate was 9% for the second quarter reflecting a higher relative impact from tax advantage investments and other tax benefit items given the lower level of EBIT. Looking at results for the first half of 2020, we delivered net eight number $3.8 billion even as we increase credit reserves by $10.5 billion under the CECL framework given the current environment. We grew revenues by 8% predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses, while we held expenses flat year-over-year allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a 20% increase in operating margin. In constant dollars end-of-period loans were 1% year-over-year to $685 billion reflecting growth in our institutional businesses mostly offset by the impact of lower spending activity in our consumer business. Deposits grew 20% reflecting engagement with clients and flight to quality so to speak across both the institutional and consumer franchises, which serve to strengthen our available liquidity. We maintain a strong capital and liquidity position which has been critical to our ability to support our clients as they manage through this crisis. As of June 30th, our CET1 capital ratio was 11.5%, 150 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement. We had close to $900 billion in available liquidity and including the additional reserves taking this quarter, credit reserves stand at roughly $28 billion with the reserve ratio of 3.89% of funded loans. With the level of capital, liquidity and the reserve we hold today plus significant pre provision earnings power seen through the first half of the year, we continue to operate from a position of strength. And as we discussed last quarter, we're combining this financial strength with operational resiliency which allows us to partner with and support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 7% as strong deposit growth was more than offset by lower loan volumes and lower interest rates across all regions. And expenses decreased 8% as lower volume related expenses reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19 related expenses. Total credit cost of $3.9 billion were up significantly from last year, including a reserve build of proximately $2 billion driven by the deterioration in the economic outlook. Slide 6 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Second quarter revenues of $4.7 billion were down 5% from last year. During the quarter we continued to focus on providing assistance to help customers impacted by COVID-19. Since the crisis began, we have provided relief to more than 2 million accounts representing roughly 6% of our aggregate balances across cards and mortgages. In a hopeful sign, many of those same customers have continue to make their regular payments during the second quarter although we realized it -- and to date over half of our current enrollees have rolled off the program with more than 80% of these customers remaining current. While reenrollment rates remain below expectations and about the mid-teens. Turning now to the businesses starting with cards. Branded Cards revenues of $2.2 billion were up 1% year-over-year as lower purchase sales and lower average loans were offset by a favorable mix shift towards interest earning balances which supported net increase revenues. As seen across the industry purchase sales declined significantly down 21% in the second quarter. However, in recent weeks we have seen signs of improvement with purchase sale down to the low double digits year-over-year in June compared to a 30% decline in April. Average loans declined 7% reflecting lower sales activity. We also took credit actions during the quarter including a pause in proactive marketing and a reduction in credit line increases and BAL con activity as examples. We believe these risk actions are proven given the current environment but they are likely to result in more pressure on interest earnings balances in the second half of the year. Retail Services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 13% year-over-year reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 7% as average loans declined by 6% on lower purchase sale activity. Purchase sales were down 25% year-over-year in the second quarter but similar to Branded Cards we saw improvement in the month of June with the pace of sales declines flowing to the mid-teens. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year. As we have discussed in the past, Retail Services revenues are shown net up payments related to income sharing arrangements with our retail partners, which can vary quarter-to-quarter based on the overall mix and profit outlook for our portfolios. Retail Banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 3% year-over-year as the benefit of stronger deposit volume and an improvement in mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Our deposit momentum continues to improve with average deposits of 14% driven by a combination of environmental factors including the delay of tax payments, stimulus payments and a reduction in overall spending, as well as our continued strategic efforts to drive organic growth. Digital deposit sales accelerated even as we continue to adjust pricing given the current rate environment with digital deposits growing by $3 billion this quarter to a total of nearly $12 billion. We also saw strong engagement with existing clients driving balanced growth across deposit products including checking which grew 13% year-over-year. Total expenses for North America consumer were down 10% year-over-year as reductions in marketing and other discretionary expenses along with efficiency saving and lower volume related costs more than offset incremental COVID-19 related expenses. Turning to Credit. Total Credit cost of $3 billion increased significantly from last year as we built roughly $1.5 billion in reserves this quarter reflecting the impact of changes in our economic outlook, partially offset by the impact of a change in accounting for third-party collection fees. On Slide 7, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollar. In Asia, revenues declined 15% year-over-year in the second quarter. Cards revenues declined by 22% reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down 29% year-over-year. We're seeing a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from lower travel spend in the region given our affluent client base and a greater proportion of fee revenues coming from travel related interchange and foreign transaction fees. We also saw an impact on customer acquisition in products like insurance which rely more heavily on face-to-face engagement. However, average deposit will remains strong at 10% this quarter albeit at lower deposit spreads, reflecting a flight to quality as well as continued client engagement across the franchise. While investment revenues were down this quarter, we saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 6% growth in Citigold clients and 10% growth in net new money versus last year. Today, we are seeing some early signs that were pick up an activity with purchase sales declined moderating and net new money and investment sales show a material improvement in June versus prior month. But the shape to recovery remains fluid. Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 7% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances of 9%. However, revenues were impacted by lower purchase sales and loan volume as well as lower deposit spreads in the current environment. In total, operating expenses for international business were down 4% in the second quarter, reflecting efficiency savings and lower volume related expenses and cost of credit increased to $883 million. Slide 8 provides additional detail on Global Consumer credit trend. Credit loss rates generally trended upwards this quarter as a result of the macroeconomic slowdown. Although this was much more a function of the lower loan balances as it is still too early to see a pronounced impact from COVID-19 on our net credit losses. 90 plus day delinquency rates improved in the US despite the lower balances has reduced spending combined with the benefit of significant government stimulus and our own customer relief efforts has generated liquidity which has been used to pay down debt even in the later delinquency buckets. Earlier stage delinquencies are also improved given the additional liquidity and the impact of relief efforts although it is still early and there is still significant uncertainty around the timing of the economic recovery and how customers will perform once these relief and stimulus programs start to roll off. Delinquency rates were up slightly in Asia, although still at modest and absolute levels. And in Mexico, we saw a more significant impact as COVID-19 is still peaking in that market and customers are not benefiting from the same level of government stimulus. Turning now to Institutional Clients Group on Slide 9. Revenues of $12.1 billion increased 21% in second quarter and were up 25% excluding a roughly $350 million pretax gain on our investment in trade wealth in the prior year as strong performance in fixed income, investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in GTS, corporate lending and security services. The quarter was also impacted by $431 million of mark-to-market losses on loan hedges as credit spreads tightened during the quarter. During the quarter, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses. And we've been actively helping our clients navigate through this uncertain environment. In TTS, we continue to work with our clients to sustain their operations, manage their supply chain and optimize their working capital and liquidity. We will continue to see momentum in our digital efforts as evidenced by strong growth in Citi direct users and digital account opening, which further deepen our relationship with our clients. In markets, we saw record volumes as we supported our clients, leveraging our Citi velocity platform and electronic execution capability. And similar to the first quarter, we actively made markets to both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through volatile macroeconomic conditions.  In Investment Banking, clients remained focus on both sources and usage of short-term and long-term liquidity. We continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws for clients looking to bolster liquidity. However, we also saw significant repayments which led to the sequential decline in end-of-period loan and corporate lending. And we continue to hope our clients access capital markets which drove further share gain. I'd note that investment grade debt underwriting is up 131% year-over-year as we continue to help our clients' source liquidity in this evolving environment.  Turning now to the results for the businesses starting with Banking. Total Banking revenues of $5.7 billion increased 4%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues of $2.3 billion were down 11% as reported and 7% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rate and lower commercial cards revenues. Our average deposits were 30% in constant dollars. We had strong growth in our instant payment and API volume and our cross-border flow were resilient despite the significant macro slowdown. All of which give us confidence in the underlying health of the franchise. Investment Banking revenues of $1.8 billion were up 37% from last year outperforming the market wallet and delivering the highest revenue quarter since the financial crisis. Results reflected strong growth in both debt and equity underwriting, partially offset by M&A.  Private Bank revenues of $956 million grew 10% driven by increased capital market activity as well as higher lending and deposit volume, partially offset by lower deposits spreads. Corporate Lending revenues of $646 million were down 11% as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spread. Total Market and Securities Services of $6.9 billion increased 48% year-over-year. Fixed Income revenues of $5.6 billion grew 68% reflecting strong performance across rates and currencies, spread products and commodity. Equities revenues of $770 million were down 40% versus last year as solid performance in cash equities was more than offset by lower revenues and derivatives and Prime Finance reflecting a more challenging environment. And finally, in Security Services, revenues were down 9% on reported basis and 5% in constant dollars as higher deposit volume were more than offset by lower spread. Total operating expenses of $5.9 billion increased 7% year-over-year as efficiency savings were more than offset by higher compensation cost, continued investment and volume driven growth.  Total credit cost of $3.9 billion was up significantly from last year. We built roughly $3.5 billion in reserves this quarter. The increase in reserves reflected the impact of changes in the economic outlook, as well as downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio during the quarter. As of quarter end, our overall funding reserve ratio was 1.71% including 4.9% on the non-investment grade. We provide more detail on the corporate portfolio in the appendix of our earnings presentation. Total non accrual loans increased $1.5 billion sequentially this quarter reflecting the current environment with roughly half of the increase coming from smaller size exposure. Overall, we remained vigilant and managing the portfolio and reserve levels relative to the stresses we saw out there today.  Slide 10 shows the results of the Corporate/Others. Revenues of $290 million declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates partially offset by AFS gains gain as well as positive marks on legacy security, as spreads tightened during the quarter. Expenses were down slightly as the wind down of legacy assets was partially offset by higher infrastructure costs as well as incremental cost associated with COVID-19. And the pretax loss of $343 million this quarter reflecting loan loss reserves on our legacy portfolio, as well as lower revenues, partially offset by lower expenses. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $11.1 billion this quarter declined $580 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR and the improved mix in branded cards that I mentioned earlier. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $250 million, mainly reflecting the lower rate environment, partially offset by higher trading related NIR and the absence of an episodic one-time item. The net interest margin declined 31 basis points sequentially with lower net interest revenues, driving roughly one-third of the decline and the remainder representing balance sheet growth, reflecting an increase in liquid assets, driven by higher deposits as we accommodated the needs of our clients while also strengthening our own liquidity in the current environment. Turning to non-interest revenue. In the second quarter, a strong performance in trading and investment banking drove a significant increase year-over-year. As we look to the third quarter, we expect both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues to decline year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19 as well as normalization in investment banking activities. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio improved to 11.5%, primarily reflecting the decline in risk-weighted assets. Our supplementary leverage ratio improved to 6.7% primarily reflecting the benefit of the temporary relief granted by the FRB. And our tangible book value per share declined slightly to $71.15 reflecting the debt-valuation adjustment DVA impact to OCI, as Citi\u2019s credit spreads tightened during the quarter. During the quarter, we also received our stress test results including our preliminary stress capital buffer, SCB, requirement of 2.5%. Incorporating this SCB and a GSIB surcharge of 3% results in a minimum regulatory requirement of 10%. In summary, the environment remains challenging this quarter, but we continue to perform well. We ended the period with a strong capital and liquidity position. The underlying business performance this quarter remained solid, and we were able to absorb the significant reserve build with strong results in our markets and investment banking businesses. Overall client engagement remains strong, bolstered by increased digital acquisition and engagement. And while our consumer business has been impacted by COVID-19 related lower levels of activity, we have seen a pick up through the quarter. That said, we did see a significant headwind from the full quarter impact of the lower rate environment. Looking to the third quarter and the rest of 2020, we expect the environment to continue to remain challenging and uncertain. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure in consumer, reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our core businesses in ICG. Our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. That said, we would expect normalization relative to the first half. Based on our best estimate, we would expect these headwinds in the back half of the year to result in full year revenues that are flat to down slightly, with the decline in net interest revenues more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis. On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. And we continue to feel good about the investments we are making, particularly in our digital capabilities and infrastructure and control. That said we continue to explore all opportunities to operate more efficiently to fund these investments and offset headwinds created by COVID-19. And overall, we still expect expenses to be flattish to down slightly for the full year. Turning to credit. We do expect a higher level of losses going forward, given our current outlook. However, this should be offset by the release of existing reserves. Of course, the overall level of reserve in the back half of the year remains dependent on the environment relative to our current outlook. So to wrap up, we are preparing for range of outcomes and remain confident in our ability to maintain our overall strength and stability, as well as continue to support our customers.  With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. GlennSchorr: Sorry about that. Can you hear me now? Sorry about that. My apologies. Quick question on cards in your comments you mentioned doing less balance transfer and tighter credit box impacting revenues. Could you dimensionalize maybe what portion of the book or remind us what portion of the book is promotional? Where this might take it to and how much pressure we're talking about on the card side? Appreciate it. MarkMason: Yes. This is Mark. Good morning, Glenn. Look, I'd say a couple of things we're seeing take place. We're obviously managing through a crisis here and what we've seen is we've seen less purchase sale activity, less loan volume take place and frankly less new card acquisitions both on the branded side as well as the retail side. And in light of that, in light of the environment that we're in we've dialed back the marketing spend. we've dialed back bal con and the like and what happens as you know is that as you dial back that level of spending you in the future you don't get the increase in average interest earning balances, loan balances that ultimately drive forward-looking revenues. And so the comment there is simply meant to suggest as we prudently manage through this crisis. We've needed to dial back. We've decided to dial back that's been and I think what's critically important is that we turn that back on as this crisis turns around and that's the way we're kind of planning so that we start to get those promotional balances peaking back up as the economy turns as GDP turns as unemployment falls. And we can start growing those balances again. So that mix as you know is very important. It'll be pressured as we manage through this, but then we want to be very responsive to the economy as it changes which is slightly different from the way it was handled in the past. GlennSchorr: That's fair. All prudent, I get it and apologies if I miss it in the prepared remarks. Related to the reserve build I get that there's multiple scenario, a lot of variables but can you talk about where we were at the end of the first quarter versus where at the end of the second quarter in the economic backdrop that you wrote reserves to just so we can do the compare and contrast. Thanks. MarkMason: Yes. Let me try and dimension that a little bit because I think it's important first to kind of understand how we approach the CECL modeling. And then I'll share with you the variables, the key variables that we used in the in the second quarter here specifically. So remember as we approach CECL we've got to take a view on the forward look of the economic environment. And the way we've approached that is we've established models to in order to forecast those reserve levels. And we use one scenario for that we use a base scenario for the modeling of that. In addition to that base scenario, which drives the quantitative output in the way of the level of reserves, we have a quantitative approach that drives a management adjustment and that management adjustment is designed to account for the economic uncertainty and the prospect of a more severe stress or a slower recovery. And so those two components become important to how we've established the reserve both in the first quarter and in the second quarter. In the first quarter -- sorry the second quarter to more specifically to your question, the basic economic forecast called for U.S unemployment peaking at roughly 15% or so in the second quarter and GDP falling 35% plus quarter-over-quarter. Now what's important is the shape and the pace of the recovery including whether we see a significant second wave of the virus or what impact the crisis has on broader employment et cetera and our base scenario as GDP recovering sequentially in the third quarter and beyond and bring, call it, under 10% by the end of the fourth quarter of 2020 and then trending down from that through the fourth quarter of 2021. And these assumptions kind of assume a potential second wave but one that is controlled, it assumes appropriate fiscal response if needed to maintain that pace of recovery but there's a lot of uncertainty there. And that that kind of drives the quantitative approach and then we consider the probability of an alternative downside scenario. And we build additional reserves as appropriate to that and so if you think about our total reserves, which show up on page 20 I think which stand at about $28.5 billion in terms of the ACL reserves that includes roughly a $2.2 billion or so $2.3 billion or so additional management adjustment to account for the possibility of a more adverse outcome. And so that -- so hopefully that helps. We've got a very specific base scenario then we look at a more stressed scenario, severely more stressed scenario and we put a probability to that in order to establish what our management adjustment should be. And that's what's in the $28.5 billion that's it's today. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. MattO\u2019Connor: Good morning. Could you talk a bit about the timing of when you think the charge offs will actually start to go up? And obviously you've alluded to the large reserves and that may or may not hit earnings entirely, but just as we think about the loss recognition, maybe if you can speak to when you think we might start seeing that and what peak levels and when and obviously it might vary by region. So any thoughts on those topics would be helpful. Thank you. MarkMason: Sure. We are -- if you kind of look at the information that we reported. We aren't yet seeing significant NCLs as of yet. We aren't yet seeing. There are some increases but we aren't yet seeing significant NCLs. We aren't yet seeing meaningful or increases in even the 30 to 89 buckets, in fact, they're declining so if you look at kind of North America the 30 to 89 delinquencies declined sequentially in branded cards, in retail services. They were relatively stable. In Asia, in Mexico they declined as well. All in our supplement and part of that is because as you know there are government payroll protection programs. There are stimulus checks. There are unemployment benefits. They're all of these things that are in place in many ways to kind of prop up the economy and so we aren't yet seeing the stress, if you will kind of play through those early buckets. What I would say is that as we get to through the back half of the year and towards the back after the year we're likely to see NCL start to pick up. And we're likely to see some of that at least on the consumer side start to peak towards the middle of next year. But I think what you've got to keep in mind is that we're building reserves now around lifetime expected losses and so to the extent that the forecast plays out as the scenario would suggest, you'll see those losses pick up and all things being equal as it relates to balances, you'll also see the reserves used to cover those -- to cover those losses. MattO\u2019Connor: And then just on a follow-up I mean this is the first cycle that we've all been through with CECL and I always think about there's all these reserves being built that you're supposed to use as charge-offs hit. But that kind of assumes that charge offs aren't going to go up kind of beyond the level of reserves, right? So like if charge off are going up but the macro environment continues to get worse, you don't really know if you should be using reserves or not. So I guess I'm just wondering like it should be a little bit more coincident in terms of using reserves as charge offs go up than maybe before CECL, but I would assume like the backup this year for example when charge-offs go up like you're not going to be using reserves yet until you're confident that the macro is not going to be worse than you preserved for, right? MarkMason: Again, I think in every quarter we're going to be taking a view on the forward economic outlook and so a little bit to your point if we get into the third quarter and we're seeing that our outlook is consistent with what it was at the end of the second quarter then we're going to take a view as it balances all, balances in terms of loans all things been equal related to balances. We're going to take a view as to whether we think that economic environment is going to be as we've scenario it out, get better or worse and act with the reserves accordingly. I think the other thing that I point out to your question is that remember when I described how we established the reserves, we've also built this management adjustment, this qualitative approach which is meant to account for some of that uncertainty and the prospect for a yet worse scenario. Operator : Your next question from the line is of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. ErikaNajarian: Hi. Good morning. I hate to ask yet another question on the reserve, but just wanted to make sure we got the right takeaways from everything that you just said, Mark. As we think about your current outlook for the economy are you done with significant reserve building? And in that case in terms of what you're alluding to should we assume that once the charge off actually starts to manifest that are drawn against your reserves and you have a longer, reasonable and supportable period versus peers. And I'm wondering as investors start evaluating banks on normalized earnings how we should think about the end state reserve to loan ratio relative to that longer RNS period? MarkMason: Yes. I guess here's the way I think about it which is we obviously, you've heard us say in terms of the uncertainty unprecedented crisis. We've taken a view on our forward look of the economy and how it plays out. And that is in fact the view that drives what we've established in the way of reserves. Now we're sitting at reserve levels of $28.5 billion, 3.9% or so of funded, 7% against the global consumer bank in terms of against balances the ICG at 1.7 even within the ICG non-investment grade is nearly 5%, 4.9% in terms of the reserves against the loan balances. We're sitting with reserves that we feel the level we feel comfortable about the level of reserves that we have, but that is for all the reasons that I described tied to the scenario that I've described for you. A scenario where we see the meaningful drop in GDP this quarter but we also see a recovery sequentially in the third quarter and unemployment start to start to fall by the fourth quarter and so to the extent that those things -- a little bit of room there I would say because I do have a management adjustment then I would expect that the first half would reflect by and large the majority of the reserves that we would need to take. And so -- and losses started to play out that we'd be utilizing that reserves in order to cover them. So hopefully that that helps. ErikaNajarian: Yes. That helps and I'll follow up offline on normalized reserves. But I wanted to get the second question and your peer earlier today noted that we should essentially cut trading revenues in half for the second half of the year in terms of normalization and should we be doing the same for Citi for the second half of the year. And I suspect probably more applicable to the fixed side than the equity side. MarkMason: Yes. Look, we have seen very strong performance in our markets business and in -- FICC particular, was up 68% and we adjust for the gain that we had last year is up as much as close to a 90% little bit under 90%. So very strong performance there. We have -- I did mention in my prepared remarks that we would expect to see our markets revenue, our investment banking revenue normalized in the back half of the year and I think that certainly holds in terms of what we're expecting. And I also gave a little bit of guidance in terms of how to think about full year performance and that should hopefully inform how to kind of model our performance. And I talked about total revenues or full year revenues that are flat to down slightly with a decline in net interest revenue that's more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis. And I think if you can kind of model that out and it will, I think, reflect that normalization that I'm speaking to with regard to markets which will show up in both but you'll see a good part of the normalization in the non year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: Hi. I have a few questions, so I'll ask a couple then I'll re-queue at the back end, if that's okay. But Mike the one line that got me was that we will be struggling until we get a vaccine, which might be correct. Nobody really knows how this is going to play out but that's a little bit more pessimistic than some of the guidance given by others and certainly the timeframe for a vaccine is uncertain too. So I'm just trying to reconcile the comment that in the reserves are fine. It sounds like the second quarter reserve a build is a high water mark, so that's reflecting everything. On the other hand, if we have to wait until we get a vaccine and also you did mention Mexico not having the stimulus and we have had some data since the end of the quarter that looks a little bit worse. So I guess my question is, Mike, how confident are you that you've built enough reserves as of the second quarter in light of what you said about Mexico, the vaccine and what's taking place since quarter end. MikeCorbat: Sure. Thank you, Mike. So let me just kind of touch on the comment in terms of the vaccine. As we think of as I think of these health pandemic and not necessarily specific dates, but a broad-based timeline effectively I think of this going through four stages, containment, stabilization, normalization and ultimately a return to growth. I would describe that today the economy as we've seen the global economy, the global health pandemic is not all in the same place. We didn't enter it at the same time. We didn't have the same response either from a health or from a fiscal or monetary perspective and therefore we're going to see exit and exit rates different and we're going to actually see the numbers in terms of resurgence of COVID in some areas in different ways. I would describe right now that broadly in the world we are somewhere between containment and stabilization, right. Containment is that we can bend the curve in terms of the transmission of cases. Stabilization is that as we remove or start to take down some of the barriers or actions that were put in place. Working remotely, social distancing kind of all of those things that have been put there and as that start to get lifted that you actually don't see cases come back. And when you get to the third phase around normalization and simply put normalization to me is am I willing to get on the airliner? Am I willing to get in a subway? Am I willing to go into a crowded venue to watch a sporting event or a concert or what it may be. And I think realistically when we get to that third bucket, I just don't see that coming and I would say many don't see that coming until we feel like there's a an anti-virus vaccine that's available for the mass population around that. And so I think one of the things that people struggle with today is the disconnect in some ways between where the market is in some ways and actually where we are in terms of this health pandemic. And the number of questions that are out there. So I don't want to be pessimistic in there. I want to be a realist and I just think that in order to truly normalize that's what's necessary to do that. To the second part of your question, we've seen different responses in different ways. We've seen different health responses. We have seen different economic responses and I think the approach specific to your question in terms of Mexico is that in both cases those responses have been pretty straightforward, right. We really haven't seen the extraordinary actions that we've seen from the US or UK or some of the governments around the world. It's been much more of a BAU response and I think as part of that we're seeing that economy being hit fairly hard and it's still relatively speaking in the earlier stages and by the way that's not just Mexico, more of Latin America and other parts of the world. And I think as we forecast growth rates going forward I think our forecast right now is for a contraction of about 8% in Mexico in terms of GDP as we look forward. So the economy has been hit, will continue to be hit. That being said I think the actions that we've taken in terms of the risk approach, we've taken in terms of the ways that we have looked at and been mindful in terms of risk going into this. I think should serve us well but again I think the effects of this are likely to be felt longer in Mexico. MikeMayo: And the last part of my question was since quarter end you see the COVID cases increase in Florida and Texas and see what's happening in California. Any change in assumptions in the last couple weeks? MikeCorbat: When you say functions, Mike, what do you -- MikeMayo: And your assumption sorry. MikeCorbat: Oh assumption, I'm sorry. Sure, yes, well to me right if we want characterize what's happening in this in some cases as resurgence or the second round of this. One is I would say that we've seen both societal and behaviors changing right that I think what we've seen in these states where we've seen resurgences is in some ways a dichotomy of the population I think those that have reverted back to original protocols from the early stages of COVID and what needs to be done. And I think those that are, I think being much more for lack of better term free spirited or kind of moving forward with their lives. And I think you can see that in the spend rates that while these cases have had a resurgence, we've seen spend come back off in some of those places, but we haven't seen it necessarily go back to the lower levels of the darkest days of early COVID. I think the second thing in there and it's in all of the national health reports are that the demographics have changed. We were actually seeing and part of it can be attributed maybe to testing or more mass testing but we're actually seeing the average age of the infected population coming down round one it was in the 50 to 50year plus range on average and the last numbers I saw coming out had the most recent cases in these states actually in the mid-30s as an average. And so we're actually seeing a different demographic in there and again I think that has some impact in terms of the way people respond and what spend and what other things are. And to Mark's earlier point Mike just finishing on this, I think that what we're seeing is that the extraordinary actions of the Fed and the Treasury leave not just ours but industry models kind of wanting for more insight. But we've never seen this type of action whether it's the checks people receive, whether it's payroll protection 500 plus billion, whether it's the holiday in terms of income tax payments, but we're actually seeing a consumer in the US that actually kind of goes into this and it's not all even but in pretty good shape. Savings rates are up, obviously spending levels are down. Mark talked about some of the delinquencies and some of the positive things that we're seeing there in terms of the buckets and the roll rates. It's early but again I think as we look at a potential spike back up in some areas obviously over the weekend stimulus round two came on the table. It seems to be bipartisan and so it's likely we're going to get more from that and so again I think those things give us, I won't say comfort but give us I think a good a view based on what we've been through in terms of the consumer in particular to be able to withstand some of these variations and contagion rates as we go forward. MikeMayo: Sorry so a 10 second summary, your $28.5 billion reserves as we stand here at July 14 reflect all that 8% contraction in Mexico, some spending come off; some spike in cases and everything else that's out there now. It's not like the first quarter we had all this new information. The $28.5 billion is your best estimate now for your future losses under CECL. MikeCorbat: Yes and the one correction. The one correction I would make to that Mike is it's not -- again, we close and our view is as of the quarter end is as of June 30th but again the models are very sensitive to unemployment. They're insensitive to GDP and as we went through last quarter, as we were doing different flashes those numbers moved around. So again the models are sensitive to those inputs and my guess is as those inputs continue to change, there'll be variation but absolutely as of quarter end we are comfortable with where we set those and the reserving around that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. GerardCassidy: Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike. Mark, you gave us good detail in the slides as you pointed out on the commercial portfolio, the wholesale portfolio and you showed us some of the migration trends from AAA to BBB et cetera. Can you share with us what percentage of the corporate portfolio was reviewed and was downgraded? And second and how often do you now need to review the portfolio for potential future either upgrades or downgrades in that portfolio? MarkMason: Yes. So, look, we are constantly reviewing the portfolio and we ramp that up that timing up significantly as we've managed through this crisis. They're obviously, I start by saying kind of all companies all sectors have been impacted by this obviously there's some more significantly impacted than others. When I think about sectors that that drove a good portion of the reserve build that we've seen is, I think, about aviation I think about energy; I think about autos, commercial real estate to some extent and retails and retailing and that combination probably drove a third of the build that we saw. We did see significant downgrades through the quarter and you heard me reference the non-investment grade reserves sitting at 4.9% of the loan balances and so we are actively reviewing the portfolio as you would imagine. We're looking at both the 80% investment grade, the 20% non-investment grade of our balances and we're adjusting that accordingly, and we'll continue to do that through the quarter and continue to work through the entire book there, just to put it in perspective there were probably a couple thousand names that were involved in the driving of the downgrades. And so they're meaningful names and meaningful review and assessment that we go through in the quarter. GerardCassidy: Very good. Thank you and then as a follow-up shifting over to the consumer side, in the slides once again you gave us the relief efforts that you're making with some of your customers or forbearance. I guess you could call it in credit cards mortgage et cetera. It's a two-part question. Is there any way of you, Citigroup finding out what percentage of those customers are unemployed, but receiving enhanced unemployment benefits so that the delinquencies across in your portfolios, as well as your peers are quite low. And part of the reason possibly is due to the unemployment benefits being so beneficial to the people that are unemployed. Is there any way of carving out the higher risk components of these forbearance areas where they could end up turning into charge-offs later in the year or next year? MarkMason: Yes. Look, we're constantly again reviewing the portfolio but in terms of specific unemployment information that's something that we have available to us as we work with our customers and review their specific credit statistics. So we don't have that. We do have as you know the early signs of both customers who took advantage of the forbearance globally and them still paying. So we've got if you think about it globally we have 40% to 60% of the customers that were -- that are enrolled in the consumer relief programs continue to make payments and they aren't contractually obligated to do. So almost 50% in branded cards and 40% in retail and again high numbers around the globe. So that is a good sign that people are benefiting from the program and taking those benefits and applying them to their exposures and the other important stat that I think is a good indicator and probably gets a little bit closer to what you're trying to get a sense for is that the first time enrollment volumes have come down significantly, while we're offering reenrollment, the rates are running below expectation. They are kind of in the mid-teens so to speak or but around there and more than half of the total enrollments that it rolled off to date and over 80% of those remain current. And so we're seeing good signs of those rolling off enrollment continuing to remain current, which we think is a positive indicator. That said we've said it a couple of times on the call now there's still some uncertainty, fair amount of uncertainty out there in terms of how this thing continues to evolve. But the good leading indicators between purchase sales, between re-enrollment levels, between continued payment both on and off the programs. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. JohnMcDonald: Thank you. Mark, I was hoping you could drill down a little bit on the outlook for consumer revenues. You mentioned the outlook for continued pressure on the top-line there. Just wondering it sound like maybe you're seeing some improvement in Asia, you're down 15% revenues in the quarter but sound like maybe a little bit improvement there. Latin America wasn't sure so maybe just a little bit of dimensioning what you see in the outlook for consumer revenues international and domestic. MarkMason: Yes. Sure. So, look, I mean I think that we're going to continue to see pressure on the consumer revenue line. And I think that as you know if you think, if we could be just kind of taken in pieces very quickly in the US, our branded cards, our retail services, the unemployment stats are very important indicators for those businesses what those stats are. We've seen -- while we've seen improvement in purchase sales, they're still down in the 20s year-over-year and so we do expect that we will see continued pressure on the loan activity there and so and as a result continued top-line pressure on the consumer business domestically. Similarly when I look at Asia for example, there we have a large card business. We're focused on the wealth segment there again purchase sales are still under pressure there. The nature of that activity and card skews towards travel and I commented on the prospect of travel recovering and what that looks like in the future and so we'd expect to see continued pressure in Asia. Similarly, there's pressure in the insurance business that's there in light of the face-to-face interaction that's involved. And in Mexico as well just given the GDP deceleration. So I think consumer will continue to have some top-line pressure. I think the underlying indicators there are still strong for us in terms of the deposit growth; in terms of the engagement; in terms of the digital access in use of our offering. And so we've got good indicators including investment AUMs in Asia that show positive signs as we come out of this. But as we're managing through it we're going to have top-line pressure there. JohnMcDonald: In Latin America just to finish it up? MarkMason: Yes. So in Latin America and in Mexico specifically as Mike suggested we're seeing a continued pressure from a GDP point of view. They are later in the cycle in terms of addressing or managing through this COVID-19 situation. There's likely to be some continued pressure on employment there. And so I think there's going to be top-line pressure in Latin America consumer, Mexico in particular as we go through this as well. That said I feel good about where we're positioned. We kind of started to dial back lending activity a little bit in some of the prior quarters. I think we're well positioned from a reserve point of view and I think we're positioned for when Mexico recovers from this to continue to kind of gain ground there given some of the investments we've made in the prior years. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. BrianKleinhanzl: Great. Thanks. Maybe just a quick question for Mike. I know there's been a lot changes in Hong Kong so a big piece of your portfolio and what are the operations over there? Is there any change and how you're thinking about the business there? And how you think about that in a go forward basis to start? MikeCorbat: Yes. Brian, I would say one is that I think as we look at the region you can't just look at Hong Kong. I think you've got to take a bit of a broader view and the word I would use is that it's complex right. We've got the combination of a sideline trade deal with China; you've got the interaction between China and Hong Kong. You've got the recent announcement or creation of this new national security law which is I think fairly specific in terms of calling out financial support in terms of China against its sovereignty with significant penalties around that. And so I think we've got to be mindful of all those. From our perspective, we've been in Hong Kong a long time. It's an important place. It's our Asian hub as we operate in a number of countries there. And I would say a couple important things as to that. One is we do obeyed local laws; second is that our goal really is to be there to support our clients. And that we're fairly used to operating in charged or complex environments and as part of that I think we have found both the Hong Kong government and the HKMA and others very supportive of our business and our approach. And at the same time we have I think received the same support from China and haven't in any way kind of received restrictions or other things from them. So obviously it's something we pay close attention to. It's important to us but obviously we're committed to being there and obviously are monitoring things closely. BrianKleinhanzl: In a separate question. And Mark mentioned that in the retail services that there was some pressure from partner payments. So are those higher partner payments fully in the run rate now or should we expect those to kind of increase on a go-forward basis and what were those exactly? Thanks. MarkMason: Sure. So as you know, we've got a number of partners that make up our retail services partner business and many of these arrangements call for the sharing of profitability. So contractual profitability of sharing between us and the partners and we will determine that based on our outlook in any given quarter for the balance of the year. And so we make an estimate for what we think profitability will look like and then we obviously account for the share that goes to the partner in the revenue line. That profitability estimate excludes ACLs so the reserves that we've been building. It does include any NCLs that we realize and so important to note that again when we're calculating that the lifetime reserves that we're building despite the fact that we'll share them when they become losses that's excluded from the profitability estimate. And so essentially what's happened and what's caused part of the drag on retail services is that we've seen the losses that we expect from retail services push out beyond kind of 2020. As I mentioned earlier, we see good signs in some of the early buckets and as such our view as to when those losses will actually come through as NCLs has been pushed out into 2021. As a result, the 2021 view on profitability for some of these partners is going up and therefore the amount of sharing has increased thus putting pressure on the top line. To answer the other part of the question, so we believe at this stage based on our view for the balance of the year that we've accounted for the level of profit sharing that we would expect, but as things evolve we would need to adjust accordingly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. SaulMartinez: Good morning and thanks for taking my question. So, Mark, I want to go back to CECL and get your perspective on the stickiness of CECL reserves as its charge off start to happen. And I guess the willingness to release reserves that I think we've all been focused on reserve builds, when we see the peak in reserves and less focus on what happens in the cadence and pace of releasing reserves and declines in reserves as the actual loss start to occur. And I mean as you know CECL kind of works backwards every given quarter you need to -- you estimate when you built your lifetime losses are in portfolio, your charge-offs and kind of back into a plug with loan loss provisions. So I'm curious given all the uncertainty that we are -- we still have and will likely continue to see whether as you start to see charge-off start to materialize and whatever the fourth quarter or the beginning part of next year in the more material way whether there's sort of a bias to maybe maintain reserve levels at fairly high levels and not necessarily release reserves because even if we're not -- even if reserve releases are happening or we're not building reserves as charge-offs happen that could imply that provision credit costs remain pretty high for a while. So I'm curious whether you think there will be sort of hesitancy or a natural inclination to kind of wait it out and have a little bit more stickiness in the reserve levels and until we get more clarity and all of the things going on in the world. MarkMason: I think it largely depends on our outlook at that point in time in that given quarter. I mean it's just know -- there's no other way for me to kind of explain it when we get into the -- like we're in the third quarter now as we go through the third quarter and the fourth quarter, we will have a view a forward-looking view and if that forward-looking view is still meaningfully uncertain to worse than it was in the second quarter then we will likely continue to have to adjust reserves accordingly. If that forward looking view is better, we can -- or the same for that matter, it will support the release activity that you're alluding to. And that's the way I think about it. I think that's how it's probably going to work. SaulMartinez: Okay. Got it. I guess maybe just getting more granular even that I guess if there's -- if your baseline economic you -- I know you only use one scenario your baseline has a change or even not maybe getting a little bit better but you still have a high degree of uncertainty in potential in the range of outcomes. Some of which were far worse. I would assume that your qualitative adjustments will factor that in some way shape or form is that and that's reflected? MarkMason: That's right. So I mean it the way we think about the qualitative piece now as you know we cover kind of a 15% probability that the recovery is worse or slower right. And that has an impact or an implied higher unemployment et cetera. And so if we view things as getting better we would toggle that probability so to speak to adjust the way we think about the management adjustment that should be there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. KenUsdin: Thanks. Good morning. First question just on expenses, Mark, you've done a very nice job this year keeping the level flat and that $10.4 billion, $10.5 billion zone through the first half you've got $3billion more revenue and flat expenses and I heard you point earlier that you expected to keep it flattish from here given that we'll see a likely decline in second half revenues from here though can you talk about just what optionality you do have to adjust the cost base lower given your point about supporting employees, investing in technology and then the pushes and pulls of compensation and staff levels et cetera. Thanks. MarkMason: Sure. Thank you. So I guess a couple things. One is as I mentioned in my prepared remarks that I do expect that we will maintain our full year expenses roughly flattish. And that's what we're kind of managing to and part of that against revenues that are flat to slightly down and if you think about what we're managing through in the midst of this crisis, we've got a lot of puts and takes. So we've got some headwinds that kind of fall into a bunch of different categories including the things we do to support our employees including building out our collection capabilities, including enhancing our fraud detection capabilities all of which I think are important to ensuring that we're managing through this crisis in a thoughtful and responsible way. Sanitization of buildings, ensuring that people have remote access and the equipment to support that all of those things come with cost. Cost that we were not planning for in the year. There are obviously some tailwind. So we've got marketing expenses that you heard me mentioned we've dialed back. We've got T&E expenses because people are doing more Zoom than they are traveling to meet with clients. And so you've got some tailwind there that offset that but net-net when you think about those expenses they are headwinds for us. We also have investments that we will continue to make. Investments in technology, investments in enhancing our digital capabilities which have proven to be quite valuable as we've managed through this crisis. Investment in infrastructure and controls that ensure that we not only protect the franchise but we're improving our efficiency in operations and improving the quality of our data et cetera, et cetera and then we've got productivity initiatives and the other levers that pull or that we do pull quite naturally with revenues. And so the compensation expenses obviously will adjust accordingly. The transaction expenses will adjust with how we see volumes move and we'll continue to deliver on our productivity savings in the way of right placement and reducing our number of centers and the like and so, yes, they're levers but they're also meaningful headwinds and that's kind of how I get to that outlook of roughly flattish as we manage through this particular year. KenUsdin: Got it. Thank you. My second question just on capital. This year you've been bound a little bit more on CET1 by the advanced approaches with advanced RWAs a little bit higher than standardized. It's only about 20 basis points but as we get into the SCB construct can you do anything to optimize the advanced RWAs vis-\u00e0-vis the standardized approach and how much of a focus will that be? MarkMason: Yes. Look, I mean we're part of a big part of kind of what's driving the advanced -- the down grades that are associated with the prices that we're managing through. And so that is a factor that's likely to persist for a while and we're actively managing and optimizing the balance sheet to identify ways to impact or reduce that persuaded assets and aid in the calculation here of the CET1 and but that is the headwind that we've got to manage. Now what I point out is that the regulatory minimum for CET1 in both on standardized and advances are running at about 10%. And so we sit on an advanced basis at a ratio as Mike and I've said at 11.5%. So we're still 150 basis points above that regulatory minimum, which we think gives us room to manage through this period of uncertainty and a range of different outcomes. It also gives us room if you think about some of the additional stress analysis that's in front of us in the industry. So, yes, advance; yes a byproduct of the prices were in, yes we're constantly looking to manage it effectively where that makes sense and where we can continue to serve our clients in a way that is great for the franchise. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. JimMitchell: Good morning. Mark, maybe just can you help us unpack a little bit the -- how we think about the trajectory of NII? What would -- how do you deposit, flight to safety deposits have been stickier than I would have thought still seeing growth in deposits. What are your assumptions I guess around balance sheet growth and NIM? Where do you see kind of NIM bottoming out? Those kind of things would be I think helpful and just understanding your assumptions and versus ours. MarkMason: Yes. So, look, we kind of mentioned in my opening remarks that we obviously saw NIM decline some 31 basis points quarter-over-quarter. And that's a combination again of lower rates, loan mix shift that we've seen so lower NIM cards in higher ICG in terms of that mix and the balance sheet expansion which is really a reflection of the strong growth in deposits in the solid liquidity position that we have. And so when I think about that dynamic we are likely to continue to see as I mentioned pressure on our cards lending activity around the globe. We're likely to kind of continue to see rates kind of impact some of our banking businesses, businesses like TTS and the like. And as a result, I think that we'll continue to see some pressure on the NIM line in the outer quarters but again I'd point you back to the total revenue forecast that I've given because obviously there are other components here. And that is getting back to flattish to slightly down. JimMitchell: I mean that's all fair. I just was curious if you're assuming a flattish balance sheet or further growth. Obviously, I've heard your comments on some of the pressures just try to figure out what your base case assumption is for the balance sheet. MarkMason: Yes and then the balance sheet will see, they'll likely be some growth in the balance sheet but that will be driven by the client demand that we see out there and our ability to meet that. But we will likely see some continued growth in the balance sheet from a GAAP asset point of view. JimMitchell: Okay. Just as a follow up on capital. I mean what is your, Mike, do you think you need to see getting back to your earlier comments need to see a vaccine before banks can sort of confidently return to buybacks or do you think it just -- you just need to have a little more macros, stable macro data. How do you think about returning to buybacks given your capital position? Obviously you can't do it in the third quarter but beyond that. MikeCorbat: Yes. I think it's based on as we look and project forward what we see from an economic perspective and obviously what's going on in the economy both consumer and institutional. And how we're projecting loss and loss rates that going forward and do we feel comfortable about the trajectory of the pandemic and using my timeline do we feel like we're somewhere in that stabilization moving to normalization, right. So I think in here there's the fear that as we get into colder weather maybe that's now been debunked with Florida and Texas and others. But in the fall maybe we start to see resurgence and some of these things spike up. I think we'd like to see this roll over and hence have some comfort that we've got the ability to keep it down. And that again we see a better sense. I'm not sure what the new normal is but we see a better sense of normalcy whatever that is returning to the global economy. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. CharlesPeabody: Good morning. A couple of questions regarding your capital, your tax position and how it affects your capital. First in the stress test, I believe the CARES ACT provided some capital relief around your tax position. I was wondering if that was true. And if you could size that and secondly going forward if tax rates are raised as Biden suggests, how much would that enhance your CET1 ratio? And then finally, I think Jamie Dimon this morning implied that he would love to restart buyback sometime in the fourth quarter after the election. I was curious if you saw buybacks as a regulatory issue or a political issue. Thank you. MikeCorbat: Okay. In terms of the CARES ACT, there is a benefit associated with that. I don't think that it is significant in our case to the CET1 ratio. But I don't have that specific number in front of me. In terms of the tax rate and the prospect of the rollback of taxes that will come with many puts and takes including the impact to the DTA and other things that we have across the firm. And so I apologize I don't have the exact math on that but we can n certainly kind of been beneficial. CharlesPeabody: But you would have to write up your NOL by billions of dollars, is that correct? I would add by -- MikeCorbat: We would have to make a number of adjustments such as that would add to capital. CharlesPeabody: Go ahead. MikeCorbat: I was going to say, Charles, the other piece that you've seen in our tax rate is given the breadth of our business we haven't necessarily enjoyed the benefit that the more you fully US-centric institutions have had. And so again ours would be the blend of the US versus international and in that tax rate going up again I don't think we would go back to a global taxation system. We would say a territorial system which again vis-\u00e0-vis some US counterparties could on a relative basis would probably be to our benefit. And I think to your final point, I view when the US industry made the decision to go ahead and to stop buybacks, it was not political; it was done, we thought from a prudence perspective of the right thing not knowing what to expect going into this. I don't view this today as being political. I view it as and as the Fed has said it will ultimately be our choice to come back into reinstate buybacks at the right time. And again as we said in the previous questions, we'll be monitoring that and when the time is right we'll be back in there filing to re-begin or to begin the buybacks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. BetsyGraseck: Hi. Good morning. Two quick questions. One on Mexico, I know, a couple years back you invested something around $1 billion in the infrastructure there and I'm wondering is that investment finished, completed and is it now in the run rate or does that represent a level of funding that could then come out and pay for other things as an efficiency opportunity is basically the question. MarkMason: So, yes, we did announce an investment a number of years ago. We are largely through that if we got this somewhere probably 80% or somewhere on through having deployed that investment. What is left it does serve as a lever for us that we reconsider as we take on these decisions. And just keep in mind those investments were made in building out enhancing our technology and branches and digital capabilities and the like and so I think they have certainly been beneficial. But we are largely through that and what's left is available to us to the toggle as we need to do. BetsyGraseck: Okay and then as I flip to the US could you give us an update on where you are with the efforts to drive deposit growth in the US? I mean I obviously see that deposit growth was up not only in the US but in International in the quarter. But I'm really kind of honing in here on the consumer side and you had had the announcement around some partnerships with American Airlines and with Google and so I just like to understand where you are in that strategy and do you think that there's anything that you can do to drive up the consumer deposit growth in the back half of this year and into next? MarkMason: Yes. So we've had very good consumer deposit growth, excuse me, through the quarter. I think that we benefited from the investments that we've made in our digital capabilities, as you've seen the digital deposit sales grow meaningfully as high as $12 billion as we ended the quarter. And we continue to see those benefits play out both in our market and outside of our markets, which, as you know, has been part of our strategy to ensure that we are leveraging the breadth of our customer base in cards that has a broader presence in the U.S. than we do in terms of the Retail Banking footprint. And so, we continue to see those benefits of the strategy play out. Some of that is fueled by some of the things that I've mentioned earlier in terms of the stimulus that's out there and the delay in terms of tax payments, but nonetheless we've been able to capture upside from both new and existing clients, and we expect to continue to do that through the balance of the year. I'd also highlight -- I know your question was around consumer, specifically, but I would also highlight that we're also seeing very good continued traction on the institutional side in our TTS franchise. And that growth in many ways is, as we've seen and worked very closely with our corporate clients to shore up their liquidity positions, whether it was early on where they were drawing all in lines or in the quarter where we partnered with those same clients to access the capital markets, we've been kind of that partner of choice, that flight to quality on both the consumer side in the U.S. and internationally as well as the institutional side. BetsyGraseck: Yes. I know I figured that institution was extremely strong. I'm just wondering out of that -- it does -- is there more room for the consumer to accelerate and kind of move it forward from here? MarkMason: And on the consumer, you've seen it in both the U.S., you've seen it in Mexico, you've seen it in Asia. We've had strong consumer growth across all of the regions. But we are pleased with the growth that we're seeing here. Mike, do you want to add something? MikeCorbat: Yes. Sure. The other piece Betsy is that, I think very consistent with what we've spoken about in the past of that $12 billion that Mark mentioned, two-thirds, which again is a pretty stable number for us, is coming from outside our branch footprint, which we obviously play -- we pay close attention to, given our branch model. BetsyGraseck: Two-thirds of the growth in consumer is coming from outside of the branch footprint. MikeCorbat: Two-thirds of the digital growth is coming from outside the branch footprint. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: Hi. Thanks for letting me have my follow-up questions. I just say -- so just to be clear, so you are not guiding for positive operating leverage this year, Mark, because earlier you said expenses flat to down, and then you said flat. And it sounds like your guess, and I know there are a lot of COVID costs that make this a difficult year, but -- so no positive operating leverage this year? MarkMason: Yes. I'd repeat what I said earlier which revenues are kind of slightly down and expenses flattish, right. MikeMayo: Okay. I guess -- and as far as the equities business you guys didn't participate as much as others. And help me with this logic. I mean you had the corporate draw-downs in March that was replaced with the fixed income markets. And now, maybe we have a reequification with more equity activities, and then one of your competitors showed a lot of pickup in equities. You talked about normalization in capital markets. Do you expect equities to improve? You recognized under performance is a timing thing. How do you think about that? MarkMason: So I would say, one is, let's kind of break the business into a few different buckets. So one, I would say that our cash trading performance was good. It was strong. And I would say that, again, it's early to see, but we did not do as well in either of Prime or Delta One -- Prime Finance, Delta One derivatives. From equification perspective, if you actually look into our capital markets numbers, you see a very strong number in ECM that our ECM business was up 56% on a year-over-year basis. So in terms of the capital raising aspects of it, we were quite active in most of the headline deals that were done. And so again, cash trading okay. We'll see where things come out, but not as good performance in derivatives, Delta One, Prime Finance and a strong performance in terms of ECM. MikeMayo: And then just a summary question. Through the course of this call, your stock price went down. You're underperforming the BKX. It's just one day. I know stocks move. Don't read too much into that. But there is, I think a feeling that I'm getting that either your -- being more maybe realistic pragmatic about the realities of the world out there, and that goes back to -- you mentioned about the vaccine. You're seeing something specific to your franchise that gives you more caution or maybe, me and others are just interpreting your comments too negatively. I just say that because when you talk about the revenues, the NIM was down 31 basis points. It still goes lower. You talked about the consumer being under pressure, less partner payments, Retail Services, ICG normalizes ahead, TTS gets hurt by lower rates, you won't have positive operating leverage and expenses, the loan losses, you have Mexico with COVID, and we are only somewhere between containment and stabilization and no buybacks for some time to come. So those are all -- that's a summary of some of the negatives that you had from this call. So maybe that was unintentional or maybe that was intentional. So this is kind of a last chance to either put some positives on the other side, like with digital banking or deposit growth or things like that or to say you know what, I'm actually in the camp where this is going to be a long road and maybe you differ from the rest of the world. MarkMason: Well, I would start off Mike and say that it is not our intention to be negative. I think we're all in this together and I would certainly say that the unknowns outweigh the knowns. And if somebody has the crystal ball, I would love to see it. But I think what we are seeing and what we've described coming through four very challenging months, is the first half of 2020 with revenues up 8%, expenses flat, our ability to absorb significant reserve builds under the new format of CECL, broad scale or wide-ranging engagement from our clients. I think you will continue to see in the numbers as they settle that we continue to take market share, we've continued to build capital, we've continued to build liquidity and feel very good about where we are and how we're going into the second half of the year. The unknowns are the unknowns. We don't know. And that in there, we're seeing resurgences in places where cases had been down, and they've come back up. And the U.S. is uneven in the approaches and the rest of the world has been uneven. And so again, I would say we go in feeling very well positioned against this. But we don't want people leaving the call simply thinking that the world is a great place and it is a V-shape recovery. It's our view that we will see V, we will see U, we will see W. And as an institution, we need to be prepared to deal with all of it. And I think you've seen across our businesses while in certain areas, revenues have been under pressure that we've managed through this very well so far. And I'm really proud of the team in terms of what they've done. But again, I don't think anybody should leave any bank earnings call this quarter simply feeling like the worst is absolutely behind us and it's a rosy path ahead. So, feel good about where we are. The environments are unknown. I think the actions we've taken so far have been spot on. And I think we're well positioned for what the future brings.

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have objections please disconnect at the time. Miss. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. On our call today are CEO, Mike Corbat will speak first. Then Mark Mason, our CFO will take you through the earnings presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com. Afterwards, we will be happy to take questions. Before we get started, I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Mike Corbat : Thank you, Liz and good morning, everyone. Today, we reported earnings for the third quarter of 2020. We had net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.40. We continue to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic extremely well. Credit costs have stabilized, deposits continue to increase and revenues are up 3% year-to-date. As you know last week we entered into consent orders with the Federal Reserve and the OCC and I will discuss how we are approaching those after I go through our business and financial performance. Our institutional clients group continues to perform extremely well. Investment Banking had another strong quarter accessing the capital markets for our clients and private bank revenues are now up 9% year-to-date. Treasury and Trade Solutions, the backbone of our global network is down only 4% for the quarter and 5% for the year in constant dollars, despite significantly lower interest rates. Trading performance were strong as well, with fixed income and equities up 42% and 18% respectively year-to-date. Global consumer banking revenues remained under pressure due to the economic impact of the pandemic, predominantly driven by the decline in credit card spending. At the same time, deposits continued to increase significantly, credit costs decreased and we saw more investment activity from our wealth management clients. On balance, our global consumer banking franchise has shown resilience in light of the challenges we're facing. Our capital position strengthened during the quarter with our common equity tier one ratio increasing to 11.8% well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $71.95 up 4% from a year ago, and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders over time. Turning to the consent orders, they focus on four areas that impact our risk and control environment; risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. What ties these areas together is the need to modernize our infrastructure, governance and processes. We've had remediation programs in place, and while we've been making progress in these areas, we're simply not where we need to be. While this is disappointing, we're committed to thoroughly addressing the issues identified in the orders and modernizing our bank. As many of you know, we've been making structural changes and accelerating investments. We've centralized program management and learned from unsparing root cause analysis from outside firms. We're laser focused on reducing manual touch points, automating processes and ensuring accurate data can be accessed quickly when we're producing management and regulatory reports. More importantly, we're making strengthening our risk and control environment and achieving operational excellence, a strategic priority for the firm going forward. This won't be a quick or easy fix, we need to conduct an in-depth gap analysis to ensure our solutions are tailored to the issues we face and get us to the necessary end state. While we can't fully scope out the cost yet, for a multi-year transformation, I can tell you with certainty that we're committing all the necessary resources while continuing to serve our clients. Importantly, we're aligned with our regulators, as far as timelines are concerned, so we\u2019ll not jeopardize the quality or completeness for speed. Collectively, these investments will not only further enhance our safety and soundness, they'll also create a digital infrastructure that will make us more efficient, more competitive, and significantly improve our ability to serve our clients and customers. So these are investments we need to make. In hindsight, we should have done them faster and prevented it from coming to this. But our firm has made tremendous progress in recent years, whether it's de risking our balance sheet are improving our efficiency and business performance, to close the gap and returns with our competitors. Our foundation is sound stable and secure. Our performance during this pandemic shows the progress we've made achieving excellence in our risk and control environment and our operations is necessary for Citi to take the next step forward. Our franchise is made up of committed and capable people who make us proud every day. They've done everything asked of them and I know they'll continue to do so in the times ahead. Ahead of the transition in February, change is driving this transformation and the entire management team is committed to getting Citi to where it needs to be and doing it the right way. With that, Mark, will go through the presentation and then we'd be happy to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike and good morning everyone. Starting on slide three, Citigroup reported third quarter net income of $3.2 billion, which included a modest increase in credit reserves of roughly $300 million this quarter. Reported results also include the $400 million civil money penalty in connection with the consent orders that Mike just mentioned, which negatively impacted EPS by $0.19. For the quarter, revenues of $17.3 billion declined 7% from the prior year. While trading and investment banking remains strong, this is more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of activity in consumer. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, as we continue to invest in infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment. Credit cost of $2.3 billion were meaningfully lower relative to the first half of the year. Our effective tax rate was 20% for the third quarter. Looking at year-to-date results, we delivered net income of over $7 billion, even as we increase credit reserves by roughly $11 billion. We grew revenues by 3% predominantly reflecting continued strength in our markets and investment banking businesses, while expenses increased 1% year-over-year, allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and a 6% increase in operating margin. In constant dollars, end of period loans declined 4% year-over-year to $667 billion, reflecting a higher level of repayments across institutional and consumer, as well as a slowdown in draws in our institutional businesses, and lower spending activity in consumer. Deposits grew 16% with consistent client engagement, reflecting the benefits of our global platform across both the institutional and consumer franchises, which also serve to strengthen our available liquidity. And three quarters of the way through the year, we continue to manage well through this crisis, with significant capital and liquidity, as well as a significant cushion in the form of credit reserves. As of September 30, our CET1 Capital ratio was 11.8% close to 200 basis points above our regulatory minimum requirement. We have over $950 billion in available liquidity. We have more than doubled credit reserves since the end of last year. Today, they stand at nearly $29 billion, and including the modest increase taking this quarter, our reserve ratio was roughly stable at 4% on funded loans. And as we discussed last quarter, we feel good about our ability to continue to support our clients as we all manage through this crisis. On slide four, we provide additional detail on reserving action so far this year. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario, as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides some room in the event of a more adverse outcome. In the first quarter, our base scenario reflected a short lived downturn followed by recovery in the back half of 2020 with unemployment falling to 7% by year end, and full year GDP close to prior year levels. By the end of the second quarter our base case assumed a more severe and protracted downturn this year, but with a sharper recovery into next year. And now you can see we are expecting a somewhat more muted and slower recovery in both unemployment and GDP through 2022. I would note, however, that our forward looking view on a rolling 13 quarter basis in unemployment, as an example, is continuing to improve as we move further beyond the peak of the crisis. And outlook for other variables like VIX and oil prices is also important and generally improved this quarter. So on a net basis we did not see a significant impact on reserves from the change in our base macro outlook this quarter. But we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which grew from $2.3 billion to $3.1 billion during the quarter, partially offset by lower loan volumes and other small items. Today, we are factoring in a downside scenario that is more adverse relative to our base case. For example, we are incorporating a more significant deterioration in U.S. GDP growth rates, which is now close to 9% lower than our base case in 2021 versus our second quarter outlook that was only 1% lower than the base case. So all else being equal, if the management adjustment had not changed, we would have seen a reserve release of roughly $500 million in the quarter. Looking at the level of reserves we hold today, we believe that we're well prepared for expected credit losses, having reserved for something worse than our base case. And given the lifetime nature of the CECL methodology and the conservative nature of our management adjustment, it is now more likely than not that we'll see reserve releases and our ACL come down in 2021 to offset future losses as we continue to progress through the crisis, assuming our base case holds. Although this may be offset somewhat as we would likely need to build additional reserves to cover future loan growth as the economy recovers and we support our client\u2019s needs. Turning now to each business. Slide five shows the results for global consumer banking in constant dollars. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.4 billion. While revenues remain under pressure, credit costs were down considerably this quarter, reflecting a small ACL release, and lower net credit losses in particular in the U.S., where we're seeing a continued benefit from government stimulus and other relief. Revenues declined 12% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Asia, wealth management was more than offset by lower card volumes and lower interest rates across all regions, and expenses decreased 2% as lower volume related expenses, reduction in marketing and other discretionary spending, and efficiency savings were partially offset by increases in COVID-19 related expenses. Slide six shows the results for North American consumer in more detail. Total third quarter revenues of $4.5 billion were down 13% from last year. Branded Cards revenues of $2.1 billion were down 12%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans. As seen across the industry purchase sales have continued to recover during the third quarter of 16% sequentially, but still down 9% versus last year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid and we have not yet seen stress and their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly resulting in pressure on our loan balances. This is creating a revenue headwind, but it is also benefiting cost of credit as delinquencies and losses have outperformed our initial expectations for 2020. Retail services revenues of $1.4 billion were down 21% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 16% as average loans declined by 10% on lower purchase sales activity and higher payment rates. Similar to Branded Card, purchase sales recovered sequentially this quarter up 18%, but remained down 8% year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower loss expectations in 2020, and therefore higher income sharing. During the quarter, we launched a new digital credit card program with Wayfair. With this partnership, we further diversified our portfolio with a leading e-commerce retailer and now provide half of the top 10 U.S. e-commerce companies in 2020 with consumer credit card programs. Retail banking revenues of $1.1 billion were down 2% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spreads. Average deposits were up 19% including 26% growth and checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with more than two thirds coming from customers outside of our branch footprint. And we will continue to look for opportunities to deepen our relationships with these customers, including through our investments in digital wealth capabilities. Total expenses for North American consumer were down 3% year-over-year, as we managed our marketing and other discretionary expenses, while recognizing efficiency savings and lower volume related costs, which more than offset incremental COVID-19 related expenses. Total credit cost of $1.2 billion decreased 23% from last year, reflecting lower net credit losses as well as a modest reserve release. On slide seven, we show results for international consumer banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 13% year-over-year in the third quarter. Cards revenues declined by 23% reflecting lower activity levels with purchase sales down 17% year-over-year. We're continuing to see a disproportionate impact on Asia card revenues from the decline in travel spending, including lower travel related interchange and foreign transaction fees. However, our strength and wealth management continued. We saw record investment revenues this quarter up 16% reflecting continued strong client engagement with 7% growth in Citi gold clients and 13% growth in net new money versus last year. And average deposit growth remains strong at 13% this quarter. Turning to Latin America, total consumer revenues declined 10% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw a good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter, with average balances of 13%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending revenues were impacted by branch closures and a continued decline in the macro environment. In total, operating expenses for our International consumer business were down 1% in the third quarter, reflecting efficiency, savings and lower volume related expenses. And cost of credit declined to $392 million, with lower net credit losses and a modest reserve released this quarter, reflecting a change in accounting for third party collection fees. Slide eight provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. As I noted earlier, credit trends remain broadly stable to improving this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S. lower spending and the benefits of relief programs. However, we do expect losses to begin to rise next year and likely peak towards the end of 2021 as government stimulus and other programs roll off, and unemployment remains elevated. Turning now to the Institutional Clients Group on slide nine, ICG delivered EBIT of $3.7 billion this quarter and $10.8 billion year-to-date. Revenues of $10.4 billion increased 5% in the third quarter, as strong performance in fixed income and equity markets, investment banking and the private bank was partially offset by lower revenues in TTS, corporate lending and security services. In the third quarter, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses given our highly differentiated global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions for clients and our full service model which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise. Turning now to the results for the businesses, starting with banking. Total banking revenues of $5.3 billion declined 2%. Treasury and trade solution revenues of $2.4 billion were down 6% as reported, and 4% in constant dollars, as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, and lower commercial cards revenues. Our average deposits were up 26% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth and underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown. One example of the continued client engagement that we have seen is in instant payments, where we are now live in 26 countries and have seen significant client demand for these capabilities. Investment Banking revenues of $1.4 billion were up 13% from last year, reflecting solid growth in capital markets and continued share gains. Capital Markets continue to be extremely strong equity underwriting in particular, which allowed us to continue to support our clients in raising liquidity through IPOs, convertibles and follow on offerings. Private Bank revenues of $938 million grew 8% driven by strong client engagement, particularly in capital markets, as well as improved managed investments, revenues, and higher lending. Corporate lending revenues of $538 million were down 25% as higher volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. And while we continue to provide new loans and facilitate additional draws, we also saw significant repayments as we helped our investment grade client access capital markets, which led to the decline in end of period loans. Total markets and security services revenue of $5.2 billion increased 16% year-over-year. And as we've seen over the prior two quarters, we continue to actively make markets for both our corporate and investor clients as we help them navigate through the continued uncertain environment. Fixed Income revenues of $3.8 billion grew 18% driven by strong performance across spread products and commodities. Equities revenues of $875 million were up 15% versus last year, as solid performance in cash equities and derivatives, reflecting strong client volumes and more favorable market conditions were partially offset by lower revenues in prime finance. And finally, in security services, revenues were down 5% on a reported basis, and 4% in constant dollars, as higher deposit volumes were more than offset by lower spreads. Total operating expenses of $5.8 billion increased 3% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls as well as higher compensation costs. Total credit costs of $838 million were up meaningfully from last year, although down significantly on a sequential basis. We built $529 million in reserves this quarter. The increase is largely due to continued uncertainty in the economic environment going forward. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.8% including 5.7% on the non-investment grade portion. Total net credit losses were $326 million. Finally, total non-accrual loans declined roughly $400 million sequentially to $3.6 billion, reflecting write-offs and repayments across the portfolio. Slide 10 shows results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year reflecting the wind down of legacy assets and the impact of lower rates, as well as marks on securities. Expenses were up as the wind down of legacy assets was more than offset by investments in infrastructure, risk management and controls, incremental costs associated with COVID-19 and the $400 million civil money penalty that I mentioned earlier. Excluding the onetime impact of the penalty, the pre-tax loss for corporate/other was $657 million this quarter. And looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we would expect a similar quarterly pre-tax loss. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion this quarter declined $930 million year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances partially offset by higher trading related NIR. On a sequential basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $670 million driven by lower loan balances as well as lower trading related NIR and net interest margin declined 14 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues. Turning to non-interest revenues. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined 2% to $6.8 billion given lower levels of consumer activity, partially offset by strong trading and investment banking revenues year-over-year. As we look to the fourth quarter, we expect the continuation of these dynamics with both net interest revenues and non-interest revenues down year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19 as well as the normalization in trading and investment banking activity. On slide 12, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 Capital ratio improved to 11.8% driven by net income, our supplementary leverage ratio was 6.8%. And our tangible book value per share grew by 4% to $71.95 driven by net income. Before I conclude, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for the fourth quarter. On the top line, we expect to see continued pressure and consumer reflecting the impact of rates and lower levels of activity related to COVID-19. And we would also expect the low rate environment to continue to weigh on our cool businesses in ICG. Our markets and investment banking businesses should reflect broader industry trends. In total, we expect this to result in full year revenues that are roughly flat, with the decline in net interest revenues, more or less offset by non-interest revenues on a full year basis consistent with prior guidance. On the expense side, we remain focused on protecting our employees and supporting our customers. We are making targeted investments in the franchise where we see the best opportunities for the future. And we are accelerating investments to achieve excellence in our risk and control environment and enhance our operations for a fully digital world. As a result, we could see expenses that are up a couple percent or so on a full year basis. Turning to credit. As I mentioned already, if our macro outlook holds, we wouldn't expect additional reserve builds. But given the remaining uncertainty, we are also unlikely to see any material releases this quarter. And for the fourth quarter, we would expect a level of losses similar to those seen this quarter. In summary, the environment remains challenging this quarter, but we continue to perform well. Year-to-date, we have demonstrated the significant earnings power of the franchise, we ended the quarter with a strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value this quarter, and we have remained focused on supporting employees, customers, clients and communities. With that, Mike and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : ` Hi, good morning. Mike just wanted to ask your question as in terms of lessons learned on the consent order and the need to invest here. I guess, the question is why weren't these issues addressed earlier? Was, was there a misread of regulatory expectations? Or was management attention and resources just needed elsewhere? And you didn't get to it yet? Can you hear me? Mark Mason : John, this is Mark, can you hear me? John McDonald : Yes, sorry. Could [Ph] you hear the question? Mark Mason : Yes, we did hear the question. I think Mike's mic may be muted -- you muted. Mike Corbat : Oh, can you hear me? Mark Mason : Yes, yes, we can hear you now. Mike Corbat : Like, I'm sorry. Sorry. So I was saying, John, that over the over the past decade or so I think we've done a lot of work in terms of positioning the firm for both a financial and a strategic perspective. And I think we've made a number of investments across areas that we felt were critical. And we're going to continue to make, continue to make targeted investments. At the Barclays Conference, Mark spoke about our next phase of our transformation. And, I think as we think about that, we have always been focused in terms of how we operate. But I would say we haven't gone fast enough, that, we feel that, again, I think if you think you look at COVID and the way we've come through COVID, I feel quite proud about kind of what we've done and what we've been able to do, obviously not over. And we've initiated a number of significant remediation projects along the way to strengthen our controls, our infrastructure and our governments. But that being said, we didn't do it fast enough. And we've got to we've got to move faster. And that's certainly where we're going to be focused. I think in terms of what the expectation should be, in terms of how we're going to approach that I think, really four, four pillars that we're going to be focused on. One is the organizational component. And you've seen this already go with that in terms of the establishment, and hiring of our Chief Administrative Officer, Karen Peetz coming in. And I think creating and putting a framework around the way we'll go with this. I would say the strategic component, which is really agreeing on what the end state vision for our processes, and I think, being critical, and as I said, in my opening, we have brought people in to give us an external assessment of what needs to be done and where we fell short. And I think it's making sure that the work that we do comes together across the institution. So as opposed to simply addressing specific issue, solving holistic problems, I think there's an operational component behind this in terms of making sure that around things like data and technology to make sure that we're driving the proper automation, the elimination of manual touch points and other things that we've spoken about. And I think importantly, the fourth component is the cultural piece, and making sure that all the businesses, all the regions, all the functions understand that it's everyone's responsibility to get this right. So I would say it hasn't John been from lack of effort, and commitment to it, but I would say that we certainly could have ensured to work smarter around getting to the, the endpoint. John McDonald : Okay, that's helpful. And then a follow up for Mark. Mark obviously, with the consent orders, and the work required additional expense, and investment will be needed in the coming years. Do you still think you can make progress closing the profitability gap to peers? Will that still be a goal? And also, if you can't do significant M&A, or our portfolio acquisitions, are there opportunities potentially to slim down and simplify the company over time that could help profitability? Thanks. Mark Mason : Thanks, John. So the answer -- the answer is yes. I mean, our intent is over time to continue to narrow the gap to continue to increase profitability, improve returns over time and so that that hasn't changed. With every -- with every crisis, in some ways comes a unique opportunity. And that is a unique opportunity to take a hard look at your business model and you see corporations around the world having to think through that as they manage through this crisis and similarly, we will with the benefit of a new incoming CEO, and as well as managing through this crisis, we'll continue to look at our business model, continue to look at our strategy, and see what makes sense as we come out of this, and how we can best capture opportunities to serve our clients. John McDonald : Okay. Thanks. One quick follow-up. Is it clear to you what will be deemed significant acquisitions or portfolio additions versus ordinary course? Or is that something that's still to be defined? Mike Corbat : It's still to be defined. But there are some things that obvious in terms of BAU activity, in terms of securitizations, and other types of activities that we do within different parts of the franchise. But we still have to define what significant means and get regulatory agreement on that. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there. Just maybe a quick follow-up. Good morning. Just a quick follow up on the Consent. Are the expenses going to be inside of Corporate/Other and outside of the businesses? And then, and related to the question is it clear to you that if and when the group comes off capital return suspension that you will be able to act -- as any of the other banks will act on the capital return front? Mark Mason : Yes, sure. In terms of the first question, as you heard me mentioned before, we're spending more than a $1 billion in terms of incremental spend in 2020. That is split between Corporate as well as some of the other businesses depending on the nature of the spend. I would expect that as we go forward it would be a similar dynamic, again, depending on the nature of the spend would be booked in Corporate/Other or in some of the respective or one of the respective businesses. To give a quick example, in some of the consulting spend that we do, that is meant to help scope out and state vision or a key process, for example, we'd likely book that in Corporate/Other, it would serve to benefit the entire franchise. And so that's just one example. In terms of capital actions, going forward, there's nothing in the Consent Order that prevents us from making capital action decisions, and taking capital action decisions going forward. And so, we would expect that we'd be able to act similarly to our peers as we come out of this crisis. Glenn Schorr : Appreciate that. One quick one on cards if I could. You down double digits -- well into double digits in Asia and Mexico, but just overall. I wonder if you could parse out how much you think that the macro environment and some of the obvious that you've already spoken on. Because we're trying to build back to is what takes us to the other side where we have a bottoming out and building of off bottom. And that includes how you're marketing, meaning, our promo and teasers on whole given the macro backdrop and how you're marketing into the banking base? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes. So look, there are a couple of different dynamics that I think are important. I think the key one you hit on, which is we're still in the midst of a crisis. And so, we're very much still seeing pressure on purchase sales. It's better than it was in the prior quarters, but there certainly is still pressure there. We're seeing that across the franchise. One of the big drags this quarter you see is retail services. That's in part tied to the partner and revenue sharing that we have with partners where an improved forecast in loss expectations ends up resulting in us sharing more revenues with the partners. But the dynamic that's important to watch as this plays through is how unemployment, how GDP evolves, and what that means in the way of purchase activity starting to pick up. And that's going to be an important factor. We are keeping a close watch on that. We have dialed back advertising, marketing spend about cons et cetera, et cetera, and we want to be thoughtful about when we leg back in as we see signs of things turning. And so, we keep a close watch on that. We don't want to be late to that. And we'll be very proactive at getting after it where it makes sense and testing it where we think we're seeing good signals that warrant us increasing some of that spend to drive some of the future volume activity that we see. But as of right now, we're seeing the pressure on volumes. That's really a direct byproduct of the crisis we're managing through. Glenn Schorr : Thanks, Mark. Mark Mason : Yep. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Good morning. Maybe just a question, a follow-up on expenses. You guys have done a pretty good job over the last few years sort of investing, spending on investment and offsetting with efficiency saves. Obviously, that may not happen perfectly this year, because of the incremental spend. How do we think about that going forward? Is this ramp up start to stabilize next year? And you can kind of get back on that path? Or how do we think about beyond 4Q? Mark Mason : Yes. So look, I think that -- as I mentioned, we've got an incremental spend of about a $1 billion this year that has gone towards infrastructure, risk and controls. We started that incremental spend path if you will in 2019. So to some extent in our run rate is more spend towards those types of activities. There will be an opportunity to look at that spend, the billion dollars and recalibrate it or point it in a different direction or reprioritize the spend. There's some of it that is a one-year spend that we'll have an opportunity to spend again, so to speak as we get into 2021 and we'll take advantage of that opportunity. The order requires, I think a very important step, which is that we step back and come up with a target and state vision for some of these key processes, and the risk management and controls that incompliance around them. And I highlight that step, because we need to do that in order to appropriately dimension the reprioritization of the spend we already have in our expense space, and what incremental spend is necessary. And so, we'll do that over the time period that's been allotted to us over within the order. It is an investment. And I highlight that, because many of the things that Mike described in terms of automation, in terms of reduced manual touch points, in terms of straight through processing. Many of those things will yield benefits in the way we run our organization, in the way we not only improve our operations, but in the way we're able to go to market and compete and serve our clients. And so, I do expect benefits to accrue from these investments down the line. And we will separate and away from that, because I won't compromise the dollars needed in order to make those improvements in those investments. Separate and away from that, we will continue to be responsible managers of the firm. And that means, ensuring that we look across the franchise and make sure -- and to ensure that we're spending wisely. Jim Mitchell : Okay. That's helpful. And maybe just pivoting to just NII. I appreciate the year-over-year guidance. But where and when do you see it kind of stabilizing, given where the rate picture is right now? Mark Mason : Yes. So look, I mean, there are obviously a lot of factors that played through the quarter and 2020, the combination of not only rates, but the volumes that had played through are all important factors here, let alone the amount of liquidity that's in the market, and the impact that has on the balance sheet. I'd expect for near to stabilize and stay relatively flat as we go into the remainder of the year, assuming current trends kind of play out. We project some near growth on the accrual businesses, as hopefully COVID diminishes a little bit. However, as I've said before, the markets near could be somewhat volatile. So, a little bit hard to predict as you well know. But I'm looking -- we're looking at stabilization as we come through the end of the year here. Jim Mitchell : Okay. Thank you. Mark Mason : Yep. Operator : Again, please limit your questions to one question and one follow up. Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. My question is for Mike. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Mike Mayo : Look, Mike, we've agreed a lot about Citi's improved resiliency. Since you started Citi is simpler, stronger and safer and you look at the CDS spreads. They were four times wider when you came in as CEO and that's progress. But what we've disagreed on is the pace need for more restructuring. And so the question is where is the sense of urgency? Speaking on behalf of investors, people I speak with, there's collective sense of extreme disappointment with technology, the new regulatory order and tech, the route problems were not transparent to investors, but execution, eating go fast enough. And you said this new tech fix will take time on the business mix. Many questions continue on why you have this global consumer footprint, which has terrible efficiency, and returns, worst in class ROTC this quarter 8%. Even if we give you the 12% from last year, that's still below the 19% of JPMorgan this quarter alone. So where is the sense of urgency? So recognizing the improvement that you've had with the balance sheet, but still a long way to go with strategy? Why not step aside now and have the new CEO, Jane Fraser take over as a way to demonstrate the increased sense of urgency. Thank you. Mike Corbat : Sure. So I would start out, Mike, by saying that I think it is important to the board, it's important to the company that we have a real transition. As you recall, my transition was about five minutes. And as part of this process, I did commit to the board that I'd stay throughout the year and close out the three-year plan, which we announced in 2017. We are starting the transition now. And I think that allows, Jane to be very much involved in terms of our financial plan. And if you recall, when I started, I thought it was important kind of going into the budget and planning process that the CEO own that. I think I was fortunate in terms of my timing of coming in of that being the case. And I think with Jane coming in that will very much be the case. And because she will be accountable for delivering next year and into the future. I think it's also important that Jane has taken on the transformation work and working on the gap analysis and other related things to the Consent Order. As part of that, by the way, Jane continues to have a day job in terms of running consumers. She's also overseeing our return to the office in terms of our North American business. And I think the orderly transition is the right thing to do. I think in terms of the accomplishments, I appreciate what you said in terms of some of the acknowledgement. But again, kind of grounding where we started, net income increased from $7.5 billion to the end of last year north of $19 billion. Our return on assets went from 39 basis points, to right about 100 basis points. So return on tangible common equity, yes, still behind our peers went from 5% to 12%. But went a long way towards closing that gap. We went from returning hardly any capital in 2012 to returning nearly $80 billion over the last six years in returning our share count by about 30%. And so, I don't think you accomplished those things without a sense of commitment and a sense of urgency. And I feel great about the team that's in place and their commitment to that. And so, I think we have made significant progress. And I think Jane's got a foundation to build on from that. And I think she and the team will be kind of focused on those things. And again, I think coming out of COVID, as Mark talked about here or as in when we come out of COVID and the environment, I think there's things that they can take advantage of. And I think they will and I think they'll certainly act with that sense of urgency. Mike Mayo : reins: Mike Corbat : Well, shareholders absolutely do matter, Mike. And if you've got to look at throughout the firm, whether it's the pay structure, employees and in particular, more highly paid employees getting paid significantly in stock or stock related types of instruments of the different programs and scorecards being very linked to how we perform and the things that hopefully over time drive, share performance. And again, I think there's no one thing in particular. And so I think getting those metrics right is critical, I know the board. I know the compensation committee, all work hard in terms of trying to create that alignment. And again, I think, from a disclosure perspective, we've been kind of very public and transparent in terms of the metrics and the scorecard process that leadership and broader management is held to at the firm. Mike Mayo : Alright. If I can squeeze in one more just for Mark. I mean, obviously, if disappoint with execution, strategy controls, transparency, but let's just looking forward now with financials. As far as the expenses, Mark, you're already asked about this, you're already spending a billion dollars. You see some of this as a one-year spent. I guess, you have to do a review. So you don't really know the exact spending to fix these problems. But should we think of the billions. We think of $2 billion as a bigger than a breadbox. Again, when we hear it's not a quick fix, and not a easy fix. It's going to take a while. People's imaginations run wild. Is this $10 billion? Is this $5 billion. It's somehow frame this the best that you can. Again, given that you're at the early stages of a more full review? Mark Mason : Yes. Mike, you know, what I would say is -- look, if you look back, we have been, I think, quite responsible at managing our investments over the past number of years. And what people should expect is that we'll continue to be responsible around that. The second thing I'd say is that these are investments, as I said earlier, I think they are necessary investments to improve the way we operate and our ability to compete. And these are investments that we're going to make, right. It's hard to pinpoint a number as you've said. I would expect, as I mentioned earlier, to an earlier question that we would -- we will continue to increase our profitability. We will continue to improve our returns. But I can't dimension the number for you next year or the year after, except to say, we are still running the firm. We have performed, I think quite well through this crisis. There is still a crisis for us to manage through. And we will continue to do that with a focus on our clients, and responsible management of our overall financials. When we get more clarity on the actual spend, and as we get through the budget that's here, and the response to the order, I'm sure, I'll be able to give you more color on that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. First, thanks for taking my questions. I guess it doesn't sound like, Jane, is on the call, which is fine. It's not surprising. But when should we expect to hear from her in terms of the transition and kind of her thoughts on the regulatory issues and process forward? Mike Corbat : Yes. I think we should let her kind of get her feet under her and go through some of these processes and get educated and start to form her opinions that I described. And so, we'll probably start to introduce her on the January call in terms of maybe having more view towards a forward look. And then obviously, the quarter after that, she'll have the range. Matt O'Connor: That makes sense. And then, understanding that there could be more views in a room, so to speak. But for now, far from addressing the regulatory issues is that a matter of spending money and fixing the processes, did kind of like allude to. There could be some strategic changes. So, is this the business model that you think Citigroup will have going forward? Or more structural changes, potentially coming to address the regulatory issues and better position the company? Mark Mason : Yes. Let me let me perhaps try and clarify the earlier comments. So to be clear, we have, as Mike described, Consent Order that we need to address. And I think importantly, when you look at that consent order, it is an opportunity for us to take a step back and look at these key processes and the infrastructure controls, compliance activity that support them. So that's kind of one important step that as responsible managers of the franchise we intend to execute against and some of that we've begun already and that was referenced in the consent orders. Separate and away from that what I was alluding to was just simply put the idea that we are in a crisis. And as you go through a crisis, you learn things about your business. And as I mentioned, we talk to clients all the time. They're learning things about their business as they manage through this crisis. We're learning things about and identifying opportunities about our business, for example, the investments that we've made in digital have turned out to be very wise investments as we manage through this crisis. What are the opportunities to accelerate that type of spend as we go forward, given the acceptance of digitization has probably been accelerated by a couple of years now. The importance of revenue mix and growing our fee base revenue or the traction that our wealth management businesses getting in this type of environment, presents opportunities for us to look at how we can expand that aspect of our business and business model. So the crisis will create and has created an opportunity for us to take another look. On top of that, with any new CEO, I think you would expect an opportunity for that person to take a step back and take a look at the business that we have, take a look at the environment that we're playing into, and to make an assessment as to what the right path forward is in light of where we think the growth trajectory is, and where we think the return opportunities are. And so, that is the other leg that would Jane coming in February. I'm sure, she will want to take that opportunity and see what comes of that. So hopefully that clarifies the point. Matt O'Connor: Yes. It does. Thanks for the color. Mark Mason : Yep. Operator : Again, ladies and gentlemen, please limit your questions to one question and one follow up. Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Mark, I apologize. But I'm going to have to re-ask the question that you've been asked many times. And I'm wondering if this could be a successful attempt. But as we think about productivity savings versus investment in risk management for 2021. Is $11.9 billion, or rather $10.9 billion a good starting point in terms of how we should think about quarterly expenses as we think about the next several quarters? Mark Mason : Well, the expenses that we have in the quarter that you referenced include, obviously a $400 million civil money penalty, that's part of that, that's booked in operating expenses. And in terms of 2021, we're in the midst of constructing our plan right now. And so, hard for me to give you an exact number, or run rate number for you to forecast in 2021. So sorry to disappoint. But I don't have much beyond the way. I've answered that question already. Erika Najarian : Thanks. And I guess my second question is to Mike. And I think it's always hard to call out competitors by name. But going back to Mike Mayo set of questions, the questions that we as analysts got ever since that journal article came out, is why isn't Citigroup, the new Wells Fargo in terms of regulatory issues. And many investors pointed out that when your consent order came out last week, that the asset cap and business activity limitation for Wells actually came out two years after the consent order. And without listing the things that you've already accomplished, and perhaps just looking forward, how can you reassure your current investors and prospective investors that you're not going down, the same laborious regulatory remediation route as one of your peers, which could clearly be impactful in terms of business activity restrictions? Mike Corbat : Sure. So I would say, one very important part of that, Erika, is what we spoke about in terms of no widespread customer harm. The company did not profit from the activities. And you can kind of go on with that. I think the second piece is that around customer harm, and around some of those things there were not just Wells Fargo, but there were kind of widespread industry deep dives into sales practices and other pieces in here. I think in this you've seen and we've talked about the four areas of focus. And where we're going to be spending our time. And we've been asked to do the gap analysis. We've obviously been at this for a while, and we will obviously do extensive gap analysis, but I think we've got to get a reasonable idea. And again, we're open to the findings that come from that in terms of the things that need to be done. And I think that, as importantly, in there is kind of the understanding of the process failures that got us here. Again, no fraud, no customer harm, no benefit around that. And if I could just go back and touch on the question that you asked Mark, I think an important way to think about it is historically, you've heard us kind of speak to the way that we've gone at the expense side of things is really working hard to offset the costs that we've been putting out there in terms of some of this transformation work. I think the way you're going to hear us talk about it and the way you should think about is those are separate streams, the remediation work will cost what it will cost. But don't think as a result of that, that there's still not significant work that we recognize, that we can do from a business improvement process. And so, we're not linking the two is those necessarily being offsetting, but we will continue to work on those things to better the efficiencies of the company away from this. I think the second piece is that that while we're not speaking to it, we've referenced it, I think that this work will have, this transformation will have an ROI in terms of what this allows us to do and do differently. We talked about from the client customer perspective, the business process in terms of the way we aggregate data, the way that we kind of move, risk and controls through the firm in a more automated way, we think gives us the ability not just to improve the process, but we do think that over time, we'll have a return in terms of the benefits and costs that are associated with those both directly and indirectly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolf Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Steven Chubak : Well, maybe a question for Mark, pertaining to capital. One of the things that has happened recently is that the advanced CET1 has now become your binding constraint. And one of the key questions that we've been getting and was an expectation that we would see a significant uptick in RWAs relating to operational risks. And it looks like that, generally speaking, there hasn't been much movement in terms of RWA divergence and was hoping you could speak to whether the impact from recent events is fully reflected in that number? Or whether we could see further upward pressure in the fourth quarter? Mark Mason : Sure, yes, the -- you're speaking to the civil money penalty. The answer is yes. We have reflected our estimates of the impact in the in the RWA for operational risk associated with that. And just given how it falls in terms of the level, the magnitude of the impact relative to other operational risks, there was not a material change in the RWA as a result of it. Steven Chubak : Got it. Okay. And then, just one follow up, Mark, related to discussion about profitability targets and the need to -- and the desire to close the gap with peers, and that's still your intent. This year, you plan to do an Investor Day. It was delayed due to COVID, then in the consent order and in a CEO transition. Now is the management team intend to provide refreshed targets in the coming months? And are there any plans to actually hold an Investor Day, so you could provide a more fulsome update? I know, it's challenging to answer without Jane on the call, but we're going to get some perspective as to how we should think about the timing for when we can get at least some updated targets to hold the management team accountable to? Mark Mason : Yes. Again, that's a -- as you said, that's a tough question to answer. I would like to give obviously, Jane the opportunity to get in the seat and to work through some of the things that Mike has referenced, that I've referenced earlier. Obviously, in the fourth quarter, at least historically in the fourth quarter, we've tried to give you know some context, not only for full year performance, but in terms of what we're seeing in the market going forward. We'll see how this fourth quarter plays out. And then obviously on the fourth quarter earnings call we'll give an updated perspective on what we think performance might look like in 2021 and also the timing for which we can give you a more comprehensive view on how we think about things, how we think about things going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : Hey guys, good morning. Mark Mason : Hey, Saul. Saul Martinez : I'm sorry, I'm going to beat a dead horse even more here with the consent order and it's a potential applications on cost. But I know, it's hard to know was it the time horizon is around this. And in terms of having more color, and it's clear, you're taking -- you want to take this serious and you're not going to scam. But these processes can be expensive and you have to improve outcomes in the short term, and then as expensive, but build more systematic solutions to the operational risk efficiencies, which require longer term investments and whatnot. So, with all of that, how -- I mean, when do you think you will know what you're up against. And when I say, what you're up against, I mean, meaning, not only the incremental expenses, and I'm not just talking about things -- which is in absolute terms, how much you're going to have to spend to fix these issues and the time horizon to fix these issues? When do you think you'll have better handle on the multitude of different dimensions to this? Mark Mason : Yes. So let me try and go at this again. So look, we spend, call it $42 billion to $43 billion a year in terms of total expenses. You've heard me reference, about $9 billion of that is associated with technology. And maybe half of whatever is associated with kind of compensation. But I highlight that to say that we obviously have a large expense base, one that we've been managing very, very diligently over the past number of years. And with that expense base, there are a couple of different areas that I think are useful to point out as we think about the incremental need. So one is the billion plus and incremental spend that we've made. And as I mentioned earlier, the opportunity to re-spend those dollars, to reprioritize, those dollars. There's also spend that we make on the current operations and infrastructure, that we make every year. And that too, I think, will give us an opportunity to re-look at that spend, that base, and reprioritize that spent, right? So there are multiple categories where we can re-point if you will to a better approach, if you will of addressing what's been highlighted in the order. And it's not until we kind of work through the incremental that's already in there, the base that rolls off and gives us an opportunity to re-spend that we then are faced with, okay, what more is required around the investment. Now, a couple percentage points of an increase is pretty significant in the way of absolute dollars that can be put to work on these types of initiatives. In terms of the when -- well, let me have one of them. And the second thing I'd highlight is, as Mike pointed out, separate and away from the required spend to address the opportunity or the investment and infrastructure risk and controls, there also remains opportunities for us to look at our data centers for us to look at, where we have -- to ensure the right placement of people around the organization. So our footprint for us to look at some of the roll off from some of the COVID spend that we've had to make this year. So there are other opportunities for us to look at dollars that we have let alone capacity adjustments that may be warranted coming out of this COVID-19. And so my -- what I'm trying to highlight is that there are many puts and takes through the budget process that we're constructing now. And the process that we will use to dimension the spend associated with this order. In terms of timing, the order actually points out that we've got some 120 days or so to identify the gap, a gap between our current state and an end state target. And then some 90 days or so to develop and have a plan approved after which we can move towards executing or continuing to execute against. And so, that gives you some sense for how we're thinking about the timing and the dimensioning of this. But again, I think we've got a track record now as has been pointed out of being very thoughtful and responsible around investment dollars and our total expense base and you and others and shareholders should expect that we will continue to be disciplined and responsible as it relates to that. And again, as I mentioned earlier, we're looking to improve profitability and returns as we do this, right? Saul Martinez : Okay. No, that's helpful. And hopefully, they'll be able to succeed on that latter point. Just a quick follow up and a little bit more of a mundane question. I think just more of a correction [ph] or clarification. I think you mentioned, Mark, in the fourth quarter that corporate and other pre tax losses should it be similar to this quarter that I [Indiscernible] with no civil fee in this quarter? Mark Mason : Sure. So ex the $400 million. So I said roughly the 657 that we see, excluding the $400 million civil money penalty is likely to be the levels that we see in the fourth quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning. Mark, if I could go to a different topic, you mentioned that you don't really expect NCOs to start peeking until the end of next year. So I was just wondering if it's just a time shift difference? And you can just kind of walk us through how you're expecting the loss curve generally to appear over the next year or so? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes, sure. So, again, it's -- when you look across the portfolio, we're seeing payment rates coming in higher than we expected. And the consumers are proving to be quite resilient when you think about the stimulus and the forbearance programs that have been in place. And so, as we look at loss curves and delinquency buckets, and what they're suggesting, over the next number of quarters, it looks as though the aggregate level, we're likely to see -- we're likely to see losses towards the fourth quarter or back end of 2021. Obviously, assumptions around GDP, assumptions around unemployment, all of those factors come into play. But that is in fact, what we're seeing. That's going to vary by regions. And so, in Asia. in LatAm, we may see that earlier, but what I was referencing on the back end was kind of when you look at the aggregate portfolio. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. And if I could follow up on a question on just taxes, obviously, when taxes went down, you guys had to write down the DTA. And just in terms of the outlook, at least, from what we know, about a potential rise to 28%, depending on the outcome of the election, and the eventual plans. Any ideas of what type of impact a directional change might have to the others to the positive in terms of either tax rate, and being able to write back up the DTA? Mark Mason : Sure. So, hard to know exactly what happens, but in the event that we did see, or we do see a tax rate increase to 28% or so, and it went into effect in the latter part of 2021. It would likely result in our DTA increasing by about $4 billion. So, a one time increase in our detail about $4 billion. And obviously would have the impact of our rate being close to that level, our tax rate being close to that level. And as a result of that, less income given the higher tax rate and less income contributing to the CET1 ratio. And then, in terms of the disallowed DTA, with a higher corporate tax rate, we would expect to return to our usage levels of roughly a billion dollars per year. So that gives you a little bit of a sense of a couple of the moving pieces should that happen. Mike Corbat : And Mark, I think an important nuance there is what comes out between remaining territorial or a reversion to global taxation. I think what people are talking about today is it would likely remain territorial, which, again with a average global tax rate of about 25%, that would certainly benefit us in some of the jurisdictions that we operate in. Ken Usdin : That's a good point. Yep. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : Good. Thanks. One quick question first on the NII. I heard you saying that, its going to be stabilizing after the fourth quarter as you look out to 2021. But you kind of just outlined some of the factors that are leading to that stability? Then what gives you confidence that it's actually stable off that level? Did you think about the potential for stimulus and maybe further consumer deleveraging if we get stimulus in that statement? Thanks. Mike Corbat : Yes. And so, look, again, that is that is based on kind of current trends that we're seeing in terms of roughly include improving unemployment and improving GDP. Obviously, there is talk of another stimulus in terms of its impact. We've assumed that kind of a bit later in terms of in the first quarter of 2021. It does assume that we continue to see the purchase sales activity improved quarter over quarter. We've seen some of that certainly in Q3. We continue to see that as we look even in the early days of October. And so that playing out would be another important factor. And then obviously, what happens in terms of the overall liquidity that's in the market is a factor that influences mix and the NIM as well. Brian Kleinhanzl : So maybe the second question on the NIM. I mean, if you think about the yield on the earning asset side, I mean, are you getting closer to the top yields as you think about the repricing cycle? And where rates are stabilized at a low level? So are you kind of expecting earning asset yields to be closer to the bottom as well? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes. So look, in terms of the in terms of the NIM, we've seen some of the -- obviously, the pressure from rates. We've seen the pressure in terms of the market, in terms of the mix of assets that we have, but also pressure in terms of the deposit levels coming in quite high with a, frankly a lack of loan demand to put that to work. And so, subject to how that liquidity that's in the market evolves. And what happens with ultimate asset pricing is going to have an important factor on that. The NIM is really an output of how those near [ph] revenues play out and how the balance sheet evolves. And so, a bit of continued uncertainty a little bit in terms of how some of those market factors play out, but we see that as well stabilizing towards the end of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. Jeff Harte : Good afternoon, guys. Unfortunately, I have one more consent order kind of related question. Do you have a feel for regulators views on the adequacy of existing remediation projects that have been underway versus just not having moved fast enough? Mike Corbat : Sure. So I would say that not have moved fast enough, and not have been holistic enough, Jeff, to use my words. And so again, I think this gap analysis will give us a better sense of that. But again, as I said, we've brought others in to help us look at and think about these things. And so again, we'll see what the final analysis yields. But I think we've got a sense of the right approach and direction. Jeff Harte : Not necessarily starting over? Mike Corbat : Broadly defined no. There may be some more refined areas where it may make sense to do that, but not broadly. And again, I think if you look at kind of how -- as an example, we've kind of managed through this crisis, which I think is a good real life live test. Again, I think we've been able to get the data. We've been able to make the right decisions. We've been able to act in a timely manner. But again, I think this pandemic has shown us the accelerated move to digital, and the ability to continue to work remotely or more remotely over time and the ability to make faster and better decisions as critical and in particular, as I think appropriately our regulators continue to raise the bar on the larger institutions, in terms of their expectations. Jeff Harte : Okay. And just kind of something fundamental. Mexico is a relatively large exposure for Citigroup and the geography upon which the market has some macroeconomic concerns. Can you talk a bit about the credit related trends you're specifically seeing down in the business in Mexico? And currently what your expectations are? How much things like deferrals has helped down there? Mike Corbat : Yes, sure. So I mean, look, Mexico, similar to other parts of the world also had forbearance, as part of the program although, unlike the U.S. the in Mexico, customers needed to be less than 30 days past due as of the end of February to be eligible. And so what we, what we saw is that, when you look at our loss rates for the quarter, you see a tick up in Latin America largely driven by Mexico and the impact of those customers kind of playing through the delinquency buckets and into losses. That said, Mexico also comes with a, higher NIM in the way of -- in the way of overall performance. And we would expect for losses there to certainly come to a peak of sooner than the end of 2021. In terms of more broadly our exposure, in Mexico is about $57 billion in terms of total country exposure, and that's down a little bit since the second quarter. At the end of the third quarter, about $30 billion of loans between, GCB and ICG. In Mexico, 13 or consumer loans about 16 are corporate loans. And about half of that 13, a little bit more than half is in credit card and in personal loans. And remember, we tend to target a higher quality customer segment than most of our peers there, and we price the risk accordingly. And so, we would expect for that to play out in a relatively favorable way. And then there's another 81% of our payroll loans in the portfolio are concentrated in sectors that have a lower risk of layoffs, like government, employers, and pensioners. And so that too, should be helpful as we think about the quality of our book. And then there's the portion that's in mortgages is it weights towards LTVs of 50%, less than 50%. And so that, too, should speak to the quality of our books. So overall, we feel as though we're appropriately reserved, and are managing reasonable levels of performance there. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. Charles Peabody : Yes, I just had some follow up questions on net interest, revenue guidance. You kept using the word stabilization as we entered 2021. So my first question is, does that imply further weakness in the fourth quarter before it stabilizes? And then the related question on page 11, you show the mix of net interest revenue between the core bank and then the markets related? You saw a big drop in the markets related net interest revenue. And I was wondering if you can talk about what drove that in is, which of those pieces to expect to stabilize first? Mike Corbat : Yes, and so just to be to be clear, the stabilization that I was referring to is kind of as we go into the fourth quarter and so I\u2019d expect net interest revenue to stabilize in the, in the fourth quarter for total Citi. And for many of the factors that I mentioned already. Look, the markets revenue as you've heard me mentioned before, it's really important to look at total revenue. The total revenue there in part because the nature of how transactions are structured with clients impacts, whether that revenues coming in the form of near and non near. And so, I think it's very important to, as I mentioned, look at total revenue there. And our total revenue in the quarter, as you mentioned, as I mentioned earlier, is up in terms of in total markets revenue, in light of the strong, fixed income, and the strong equities performance that we saw there. And so, that that part is lower than the prior quarter as we see some of that normalization in markets take place, but still very strong in light of the environment that we're managing through and candidly, as we go into a fourth quarter with an election and in the case of Europe, Brexit and speculation around the stimulus and uncertainty around vaccines, hard to predict exactly how customers clients decide to reposition their books, as some of those things become clearer. And so total revenue in the way of markets revenue is the way we think about it, and a fourth quarter that I think will show near revenue stabilizing, but keep in mind, markets performance, will have will likely have puts and takes. Charles Peabody : And my follow up question, let me just ask that same question about mix between markets related NII and core bank. Would you expect the core bank NII to actually grow in the fourth quarter sequentially? Mike Corbat : I would expect? Well again, I would expect that our fourth quarter will show net interest revenues and non-net interest revenues kind of down year-over-year. But the aggregate of the two, relatively stable. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Thanks for taking my questions. Mike Corbat : Good morning. Vivek Juneja : Morning, Mike. On the whole regulatory issue, it\u2019s quite disappointing to read in the consent orders of the incentive comp, did not account for risk management and the comments about the practices that the regulator's made. Given that what changes should we expect, in senior management incentive comp? And, can you talk about why you didn't prioritize risk management, which is such a cornerstone since the last crisis? And what changes should we expect in the board, as well as other senior executives, as a result? Mike Corbat : So the notion of accountability. And I think what they're speaking to goes more broad than just the executive management team. But obviously, you've got a number of work streams here, you've got a fair number of people involved in those processes. And it's kind of taking it down and kind of making sure that the people who are responsible for each of those processes have the appropriate waiting. And I think the challenge comes that in many of the instances or in many of the work streams, you actually have people that it isn't, it isn't their sole job. They are a practicing expert, or practicing practitioner in terms of the markets business or in consumer or in different functions. And we have seconded [Ph] them as part of their job into doing this regulatory work, because they, they're the expert. They're the area through which a number of these things would flow. And the question is, how do you create the proper balance and proper accountability around that? So I don't look at it and say that it's executives, just the executive team. I think it's striking the right balance. And so as an example, should someone in risk be responsible for delivering on financials of the firm profitability expenses, or are there pieces that are in there? And so I think it's kind of creating the right balance to drive the right behaviors, get the right outcomes and -- in people in both directions properly. So again, I think that it's the way it's written, it's my interpretation is actually broader than the way you've described it. Vivek Juneja : And so does that mean, you'll be adding more people do you think as a result to be able to hold some people fully responsible for this? So how are you thinking as you look forward? Mike Corbat : Well, we have in risk and controls we've been, we've added thousands of people since the beginning of the year, and we were adding people last year to these projects. So without a doubt, we've been bringing those resources and getting that expertise in and we've tried to bring in subject matter experts, from other firms from other industries to help us as we think about these things, and I think we've made a number of very key strong external hires. I think we've made some very strong internal moves in terms of people and I think we've also moved strongly in terms of what I would say single adding people i.e. making this remediation, not just their primary, but in many case their sole responsibility in terms of delivering on. So again, yes, we're absolutely committed to having the right resources, the right expertise, the right talent, and then having the right accountability around delivering against this. Vivek Juneja : And Mike, you may have mentioned, but Karen Peetz obviously we brought in as the CAO, and to help kind of, to help kind of lead in this transformation, across the organization. So as you say, we're bringing in the people that we need and getting after it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Good morning. Yes so, like you just mentioned, Karen was brought in June. And Mike, I know you became CEO of the Citibank USA, like literally back in June timeframe. So I guess I'm kind of looking at all this thinking, you must have expected, you've been working on this for a while, and I was, I was thinking you probably expected some kind of requirement from the regulators, that you were already partially executing on is that fair? Like, is this consent order, might be a surprise to the street, but is it really a surprise to you? Mike Corbat : Well, around these, around these work streams, as we've acknowledged, we have been working on them for a while. So it's not like, all of a sudden, we woke up one day and said, gee, we're going to, we're going to go at some of these things as de novo or new project. So we've been working on them for a while. And I would say that, again, what we've been focused on is really bringing these projects together. I would say a historic approach that we've taken as we've gone at these, in some ways serially or individually, and I don't think that has yielded the outcomes that either I either Citi or regulators necessarily would want. And so as we went down this path, it became apparent to me and I think the board and others that we needed to really join these processes and create a body to be able to go at it. And I think we're very fortunate to have Karen with us who has been through some of this and have this expertise to be able to, I think bring these work streams together. Because when you think about data as an example, data feeds through risk, data feeds through compliance, data feeds through lots of your controls, and making sure that we're taking a holistic approach to the way that we go at and modernize our data approach is critical. So that we do it once, we do it right, we do it, we do it holistically. And so again, I don't think the word for some of the work streams are new. I think the broader, more encompassing, holistic approach, in some areas is newer. Mark Mason : And Mike, just to that point in terms of us having started this already, again, the incremental billion we're spending, we're not -- we started spending that at the beginning of the year, right. And we spent incremental dollars in 2019 as well. And by the way, that billion dollars wasn't something that I kept, it was what do we think is required to make as much traction as we can in the year and we're spending that incremental billion dollars and still managing our total expenses responsibly. Alright. Betsy Graseck : Yes, it's interesting point, cause, when I look at the stock. I'm looking at a stock that's priced for, effectively a 5% ROE. Okay? And if you say, hey, that is right because the expenses are going to go up that much to drive a 5% ROE. That's like a 5 billion increase in expenses. And Mark to your point earlier, you were mentioning that you're planning on -- are hoping to execute this improving profitability, which is obviously above 5% today. So could you help us understand what kinds of profit improvements you think you can, focus on over the course of the next couple of years? I mean, I'm wondering, what some big threads are? Is it? Is it better deposit, core deposits that can bring down your cost of funds? Is it greater execution with your current customer base? Is it incremental customers, help us understand what you're thinking about there? Mike Corbat : Yes, look there. There are multiple components to it right there. There are additional linkages that we try to capture across our franchises whether it's doing more with our TTS clients. I mentioned earlier that we are seeing a lot of traction as a relates to instant payment capabilities, whether it's doing more between our capital markets business and in spread products and trade lending that we do with corporate law clients in terms of unique structuring opportunities there. And so, there are linkages opportunities across the franchise that we will continue to capture that I think will help in the way of top line performance. There are opportunities to grow in the wealth management space, more where we\u2019ve seen 16% growth and investments in Asia this quarter, we think there's more, we think there's more upside, we think there's more wealth growth, upside in the U.S. as well. But there are also operational benefits from again, when, when we say manual activity, when you replace manual activity with an improved technology, or an automation or straight through processing, you remove the manual, removing the manual improves the quality of the output in a more timely fashion. But it also over time is less costly when you don't have those manual steps. And so I say improved profitability as we go into 2021 and 2022 and beyond in part in getting both top line, ultimately getting expense benefits from a host of activities, including capacity adjustments that we may decide to take as we come out of this crisis. And then the other, the other items play through as well, including cost of credit, and so on and so forth. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Good morning, Mark. Good morning, Mike. Mark Mason : Good Morning. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, you've given us some good detail on the consumer portfolios. Can you share with us on the commercial side, when you look at your ratings that you give us in terms of investment grade to BB, B, CCC, they really haven't moved very much since the fourth quarter of 2019. So can you share with us what you're seeing in these portfolios, and what are the energy portfolios and the leisure and hospitality travel portfolios, still the ones that give you the most risk course, you see the most risk in terms of credit losses over the next 12 months or so? Mark Mason : Yes, yes, sure Gerard. Let me let me start by saying, as you know, we have coming out of the last crisis, we have really adjusted our risk framework, our risk appetite, we have rethought our client focus to ensure that we're focused on clients that can take best advantage of the breadth of our offering, but also on the multinational investment grade type clients. And so we have maintained a skew in terms of ratings towards, 80% or so of our portfolio, being in those investment grade names. We've got a long history of, operating in all of these sectors that you that you see on page 23. And we've got, deep experience through cycles, and expertise in each of these industries, and that includes client selection. And in many instances, we are banking many of the leaders in their respective industries. And, it's important to note that because I think that speaks to not only the quality of the name, but what we can expect when you go through downturns, and it speaks to why we're so committed to staying alongside our clients and helping them manage through the uncertainty. When I think about some of the sectors that we point to in this crisis, we've been thoughtful about the way we have dealt with these clients over time. So you look at the aviation space, and our exposures there tend to be secured. They tend to we have extensive experience with structuring to mitigate risk there, whether that's secured or guaranteed by export credit agencies. We've got extensive experience with valuation of collateral there. You look at autos and in many cases; the lending there is in securitization vehicles. So, the risk of bankruptcy is remote and with underlying consume obligors in that case. You look at energy and a lot of that is reserved based lending with borrow -- borrowing basis that go through a periodic redetermination. And that helps in terms of reducing exposure when oil prices fall. And so you look at these you look at our activity with these clients in these sectors, our deep experience, and we think that it positions us as well to manage through this with them. And certainly feel good about the reserves that we have. And we have taken proactive actions. In the pre-crisis we went through exposure reductions, just given where we were in the cycle. And we've aggressively downgraded names that are in impacting sectors early in the crisis and put enhanced monitoring in place. But as I mentioned, we feel we feel good about the portfolio we have, we feel good about the reserves that we have, and we feel good about our ability to manage through this with these clients.

Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2019 Form 10-K.  With that said, let me turn it over to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you, Liz, and good morning, everyone. Given this is my last earnings call with you, we're going to do things a little bit differently today. After I'm done speaking, I'll turn it over to Mark and before we open up to Q&A, Jane will make some comments on the transformation she's been leading and how she sees our strategy evolving. So, with that, let's go ahead and get started.  We had a strong finish to a tumultuous year with net income of $4.6 billion and earnings per share of $2.08 in the fourth quarter. We ended 2020 with over $11 billion in net income despite the doubling of credit reserves as a result of the pandemic and the impact of CECL. Overall, we increased our ACL by $10 billion over the course of the year.  As a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise, our revenues were flat to 2019 despite the massive economic impacts of COVID-19 globally. Our deposits were up nearly 20% as we supported our clients throughout the year, and we see significant franchise value in the growth that we're seeing in the deposit base.  Turning to the fourth quarter, our Institutional Clients Group performed well as they have throughout the year, highlighted by our markets businesses which saw revenues up 14% from the fourth quarter of 2019. Banking saw a 7% revenue decline as Investment Banking activity slowed and low rates continued to impact Treasury and Trade Solutions, although the Private Bank was a standout with a 6% increase. Our Consumer Banking revenues continued to be impacted by the pandemic, although we did see deposit growth in every region.  In the U.S., our retail business did benefit from exceptionally high mortgage refinancing as homeowners saw opportunities in this ultra-low-rate environment. And we saw continued momentum in digital deposits. In Mexico, lower loan volumes pressured our revenues. In Asia, card spending was down again, but we continue to see strong performance in wealth management.  We remain very well capitalized with robust liquidity to serve our clients. Our common equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our tangible book value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago, and we welcome the Federal Reserve's decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital we can return to shareholders, and we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter.  Given my upcoming retirement from Citi at the end of February, I recently looked through some of the challenges we faced when I became CEO. And while there's always more work to do, I'm very proud of what the firm has accomplished. We're in a fundamentally different place than we were in October 2012.  We've streamlined our consumer business and embraced the shift to digital, so we could serve our clients the way they want to be served. We've reestablished Citi as a go-to bank for our institutional clients throughout our global network. No matter what part of the world you're in, our bankers have a seat at the table during the most significant transactions.  We've optimized our capital base, working through our legacy assets and reducing our DTA by more than half, generating $7 billion of regulatory capital in the process. We dramatically increased the return of our capital to our shareholders. We went from a $0.01 dividend to returning over $85 billion in capital since 2013, and we've reduced our share count by 30%. Before the pandemic, we had significantly improved the quality and consistency of our earnings, our return on assets, and return on our equity. As a result of the pandemic, while the financial results this year aren't what I would have wanted them to be for my last year as CEO, in many ways, I couldn't be prouder. All the work we did to strengthen our firm helped us get through this extraordinary year, and I'm proud of the fact that we've shown we can go through a crisis and emerge even stronger unlike the events of more than a decade ago.  Just for context, let's compare 2012 to 2020. In 2020, the year of a pandemic, we had nearly $4 billion more in net income, a 12-basis-point higher return on assets and 180 basis points higher return on tangible common equity than we had in 2012. That shows you just how far Citi has come.  And we also showed what our firm is about by serving our customers, our clients, and our communities. We were the first bank to launch an accommodation program for consumers when the pandemic hit. We stood up a small business program for lending in just a matter of weeks. We donated these profits to COVID relief efforts, part of $100 million in such grants we made throughout the year. And in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, we announced $1 billion in strategic actions to help close the racial wealth gap and increase economic mobility in the United States.  As I said, there's always more to do. But I feel really good about the firm as Jane prepares to take over. She's thrown herself into the transformation we've launched to strengthen our risk and control environment and ensured the firm operates with excellence in every area. I know she'll do everything she can to maximize returns and move Citi forward for the benefit of all of our stakeholders. With that, Mark is going to go through the presentation. Mark Mason : Thank you, Mike, and good morning, everyone. Starting on Slide 3. Citigroup reported fourth quarter net income of $4.6 billion. Revenues declined 10% from the prior year. While trading remained strong, this was more than offset by the combined impact of lower interest rates and lower levels of consumer activity. Expenses were up 2% year-over-year, reflecting continued investment in our transformation, including infrastructures supporting our risk and control environment, along with higher repositioning costs as we look to adjust capacity in targeted areas.  Credit performance remained strong with credit losses of $1.5 billion, down sequentially as well as year-over-year. And cost of credit was roughly neutral for the quarter as these losses were offset by an ACL release of $1.5 billion, driven primarily by an improvement in our base macro scenario. EPS was $2.08 and ROTCE was 11.4%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 4% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 19%, reflecting consistent client engagement with corporate clients building liquidity, along with higher savings rates and reduced spending in consumer. Turning to full year results. In 2020, we delivered solid performance despite the pricing with net income of over $11 billion, even as we increased reserves by roughly $10 billion. We ended the year with strong capital and liquidity and grew tangible book value throughout the year. On the top line, while the pandemic had a significant impact, we held full year revenues flat in 2019, with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenues. Expenses increased 2%, in line with guidance as we invested in our transformation. Results also included COVID-19-related expenses and the civil money penalty in the third quarter offset by lower discretionary spending and continued efficiency savings.  Full year EPS also includes a $0.16 impact related to revising the previously determined accounting for third-party collection fees, reversing the benefit to net income with a corresponding increase to opening retained earnings, capital neutral as of year-end.  On Slide 4, we provide additional detail on reserving actions. As a reminder, these reserves include our estimate of lifetime credit losses tied to a specific base scenario as well as a management adjustment for economic uncertainty, which provides for the possibility for a more adverse outcome. Our reserve release this quarter primarily reflects our improving macroeconomic outlook, although I would note, we did add to our management adjustment for economic uncertainty as the pace and shape of the recovery is still evolved.  Overall, looking at the reserves we hold today, we believe that we are well positioned with nearly $28 billion in reserves, which represents an allowance for credit losses of roughly 4% on funded loan.  Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $4.8 billion, up 30% from last year. Operating margin declined 5% on lower revenues and a 2% increase in expenses, primarily reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, while credit costs were down considerably given a $1.3 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvement in the outlook for global GDP as well as fewer downgrades in the portfolio. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.4%, including 4.4% on the noninvestment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $210 million. Looking at full year results, the ICG business has performed well this year with 13% revenue growth, positive operating leverage and operating margin growth of 24%. But given the ACL build this year, ICG EBIT declined 6%. And for the full year, ICG delivered a 13.8% return on allocated capital. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Revenues decreased 1% in the fourth quarter as strong trading performance was offset by lower revenues in TTS, Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. On the banking side, revenues declined 7%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 8% as reported and 6% in constant dollars as strong client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenue. Average deposits were up 22% in constant dollars, and we had solid growth in our underlying drivers despite the significant macro slowdown, with increased digital adoption, cross-border transaction volumes growing over 10% and a record quarter in clearing. Investment Banking revenues were down 5% from last year, as solid growth in equity underwriting was more than offset by lower revenues in M&A and debt underwriting.  Private Bank revenues grew 6%, driven by capital market strength as well as improved managed investment revenues and higher lending. Corporate Lending revenues were down 25%, driven by lower spreads, higher hedging costs and lower average volume. Total Markets and Securities Services revenues increased 13% from last year. Fixed Income revenues grew 7% as higher revenues across spread products and commodities were partially offset by lower revenues in rates and currency, although I would note that we saw solid performance in FX and global rates and good client engagement across the entire business.  Equity revenues were up 57% versus last year, driven by strong performance in cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting higher client volumes and more favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were unchanged on a reported basis, but up 2% in constant dollars as higher volumes from new and existing clients with broken deposits, settlement volumes and assets under custody were partially offset by lower spreads. For full year 2020, revenues increased 13% driven by the significant strength in markets this year, along with a solid contribution from Investment Banking and the Private Bank. Throughout the year, we continue to see strong client engagement across all of our institutional businesses as we actively helped our clients navigate through this uncertain environment, given our global platform, our progress in creating new digital solutions and our full-service model, which allows us to capture natural linkages that exist across the franchise.  And given the momentum we've seen this year in key drivers, including digital adoption, deposit growth and client engagement, we're even better positioned to ensure additional share gains in 2021 as these clients more fully recognize the benefits of using Citi as their platform of choice.  Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. GCB delivered EBIT of $1.7 billion. Revenues declined 13% as continued strong deposit growth and momentum in Wealth Management were more than offset by lower card volume and lower interest rates across all regions. That said, we did see signs of stabilization sequentially this quarter.  Expenses increased 4% across both North America and international consumers, driven mostly by higher repositioning. Excluding repositioning costs, total GCB expenses were flat as COVID-related costs were largely offset by efficiency savings. Credit cost decreased 45% as lower volumes and improved delinquencies led to lower net credit loss, coupled with an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions. And looking at full year results, GCB delivered EBIT of $1.1 billion, down significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of the pandemic and higher reserve builds under CECL.  Slide 8 shows the results for North America consumer in more detail. Total fourth quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, but we did see positive momentum in our drivers this quarter. And on a sequential basis, revenues grew 3%. Branded cards revenues were down 13%, reflecting lower purchase sales and lower average loans. Purchase sales grew 9% sequentially on both seasonal activity as well as the continued recovery in consumer spending but were still down year-over-year. At the same time, we're seeing an increase in payment rates as consumers remain liquid, and we have not yet seen stress in their overall ability to pay. So while purchase activity has improved, our clients are also paying down more quickly, resulting in continued pressure on our loan balance. Retail services revenues were down 16% year-over-year, reflecting lower average loans as well as higher partner payments. Net interest revenues were down 12% as average loans declined by 11% on lower purchase sales activities and higher payment rates. Similar to branded cards, purchase sales grew 18% sequentially but remained down year-over-year. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower losses in 2020 and, therefore, higher income share.  Retail Banking revenues were down 1% year-over-year as strong deposit growth and higher mortgage revenues were more than offset by lower deposit spread. Average deposits were up 21%, including 29% growth in checking. We saw continued momentum in digital deposit sales with digital deposits increasing $2 billion quarter-over-quarter. We saw continued underlying growth in our wealth management drivers with 18% year-over-year growth in Citigold client and 11% growth in assets under management.  Overall, we feel good about our client engagement as we exit the year, with spend activity continuing to recover, underlying strength in wealth management drivers and significant deposit growth giving us the opportunity to grow and deepen these relationships going forward as we continue to invest in our products and digital capability.  On Slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 16% year-over-year in the fourth quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 16%, with a 7% increase in Citigold client and 13% growth in net new money. And average deposit growth remained strong at 14%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year with purchase sales down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we did see sequential improvement in purchase sales this quarter, in line with our expectations.  Turning to Latin America. Total revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits in Mexico this quarter with average balances up 13% and purchase sales improved sequentially. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment.  Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit loss rates generally trended downward this quarter, given high levels of liquidity in the U.S., lower spending and the benefits of relief program. However, in Asia, credit loss rates increased, mostly driven by those accounts that exited relief programs in line with our expectations. The year-over-year rise in delinquencies outside the U.S. is concentrated in accounts rolling off relief programs and reflects more modest levels of stimulus in these regions relative to the U.S. Given these trends, we continue to expect peak losses to occur in Asia and Mexico during the first half of 2021 and should begin to recover thereafter.  Meanwhile, in the U.S., while we do expect losses to begin to rise in 2021, given today's delinquency trend and the expected impact of recent stimulus, we now expect peak loss rates to be pushed out to the first half of 2022. Whether continuing to push out these losses is simply a matter of timing or if it will ultimately result in lower aggregate losses remains to be seen, and it's something we are watching closely. Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues declined significantly from last year, reflecting the impact of lower rates, the wind-down of legacy assets and the absence of episodic gains. Expenses were roughly flat as the wind-down of legacy assets offset investments in infrastructure, risk management and control. And the pretax loss was $690 million this quarter, roughly in line with our prior outlook.  Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trend. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.5 billion in the quarter declined $1.3 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances, partially offset by higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and excluding market was roughly flat to the third quarter. And net interest margin declined 3 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenue and balance sheet expansion due to strong deposit growth.  Turning to noninterest revenues in the fourth quarter, non-NIR declined 6% to just over $6 billion, given lower levels of consumer activity year-over-year. Turning to full year results. Revenues were flat with the decline in net interest revenues fully offset by higher noninterest revenue driven by continued strong performance in markets throughout the year as well as strength in investment banking.  On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.8% or 180 basis points above our regulatory minimum. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $73.83 driven by net income. Before I hand it back to Mike, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the top line, we saw an extraordinary year in market performance in 2020 and would expect some degree of normalization this year. And subject to how that plays out, we can see revenues down in the mid to high single-digit range this year, largely driven by market. This outlook assumes industry wallets more similar to 2019 levels. And for net interest revenue specifically, it assumes continued stabilization in the first half of the year with an improvement in the back half to our base case, which assumes loan growth by this point in the recovery.  On a full year basis, the decline in net interest revenues is somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion versus 2020. On the expense side, we expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation. Our cost of credit should be meaningfully lower than 2020. And we expect a tax rate of roughly 21% for the year.  So pulling this together, we expect operating margin pressure this year. But given lower credit costs, we should still see significant improvement in profitability relative to 2020. And finally, as Mike mentioned earlier, we look forward to repurchasing shares through the balance of 2021, subject to Board approval, starting this quarter.  To wrap up, as I look at how we performed in 2020, we demonstrated the significant earnings power and resilience of the franchise. We sit here today with strong capital and liquidity position. Overall client engagement remains strong. We grew book value every quarter, and we remain focused on supporting colleagues, customers, clients and community, all of which give me a great deal of confidence as we move into 2021. With that, let me hand it back to Mike. Michael Corbat : Thank you, Mark. Now I'd like to turn it over to Jane, so you can hear from her for a few minutes. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Mike, and good morning to everyone. I want to thank Mike for his support and for working so closely with me during this transition. It was important to him to ensure Citi has a seamless CEO transition and has obviously been tremendously helpful to me as I prepare to step into the role at the end of February.  I am extremely excited by the opportunities ahead for our firm, and I am equally determined to address the deficiencies in our risk and control environment that have been raised by our regulators. We've embarked on a transformation program that will clearly benefit our clients and investors as well as meeting the regulators' expectations of one of the world's most globally significant financial institutions. And of course, we still have to get through this pandemic. While we hope the end is in sight, this virus has surprised us and taught us the folly of best-laid plans, so we will remain vigilant and adaptable. My two major priorities as I transition with Mike are our transformation effort and refreshing our strategy so we ultimately achieved 3 things : best position Citi to win, to improve our returns significantly and to address the issues raised by our regulators. While it's early days, our work on these priorities is well underway.  So on the transformation, we're taking the time to step back, to tackle the root cause issues, to define our target end state and develop the detailed plans to get us there. We put in place specific work streams against risk and controls, data and compliance, but we also have work streams on creating a culture of excellence and accountability and on strengthening our critical business processes. Each stream is led by a member of the executive management team. Together, we are accountable for simplifying and modernizing the bank.  In February, we will deliver our gap analysis to the target state; and in May, the detailed implementation plan. This effort will take time and it will require significant investment in technology and talent.  You have my commitment that we will invest your capital wisely, and that you, our clients and our regulators, will all see and benefit from the results. At the end of the day, we want to achieve a state of excellence in our risk and controls, in our operations and in our service to clients. Switching back the strategy. I have the benefit of having worked in a number of businesses and regions in Citi over the last 16 years. Nonetheless, this transition is giving me valuable time to step back and to take a dispassionate look at our strategy and businesses. You wouldn't expect me to come out with specifics at this rather early stage, but I can talk about how we are looking at this.  We have a wonderful franchise, first-class capabilities and a terrific brand name. We are the world's most global bank with a network no one can match. And this means we are uniquely able to help clients grow and succeed globally. Our capital and balance sheet is strong. We have a deep talent bench around the world. So while we have work to do, this is a pretty good hand to play. A few principles will guide how we refresh our strategy. We're taking a clinical look at our strategic positioning, assessing which businesses can attain leading market positions in a much more digitized world. Similarly, I believe in the value of focus and directing our investments and resources to the businesses that will drive stronger growth and improve returns over the long run. I also believe in ensuring the businesses we're in fit well together. So collectively, they are competitively advantaged and generate synergies. And finally, like any true Scot, I believe there is value to unlock by simplifying the firm. As you know, on Wednesday, we announced that we will integrate Consumer Wealth Management and our Private Bank into one business line. It's a growth opportunity I'm particularly excited about in Asia as well as the U.S. Earlier in the week, we also announced the new head of our TTS franchise and our U.S. consumer leadership. And I look forward to sharing new opportunities and moves with you as we go.  I want to end as I began, by thanking Mike. He has spent his 38-year career at Citi. No one has been more dedicated. He always put Citi first. And he took over at a very difficult time. He had to make tough calls, steering the company through the post-crisis restructuring. He made Citi a simpler, smaller, safer and far stronger institution, returning it to growth, closing the gap with our peers and returning a significant amount of capital to our shareholders just as he promised he would.  His steady leadership this year helped us through this very difficult period for all of us, but this last year showed how the work he led has strengthened our firm as we supported our people, clients and communities through this pandemic. He leaves us with a tremendous foundation, and I am committed to building on his success. We are very grateful to him and proud of him. And all of us at Citi wish him the very best in the next chapter.  Mike, would you like to say something to close? Michael Corbat : Thank you, Jane. I appreciate your comments, and I know the firm is going to be in great hands. Jane, Mark and I are now happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Jane, I think it's great that you came on, so I can't resist asking you one. So, I agree with you focusing on strong business, positioning on its own and then making sure businesses fit well together. You came for part of your tenure from the Latin American consumer side and global consumer. I'd love to get your perspective and thoughts on the question that's come up over the years of how much does global consumer \"fit well together.\" Are they individual business on their own? How much can they leverage going forward to be a true global consumer platform? Jane Fraser : Thanks, Glenn, for your question. So, we are just beginning the work on this strategy. And as I say, we're taking a step back, and Mark and I are working on a dispassionate view of all of the businesses and looking at what are the leading franchises we want to invest behind, what are the others that we want to grow to win. And as we do that work, we will let you know what's the direction we're going to be taking, and as we have done already in the announcements this week on wealth and on the new leadership in TTS.  But I would say, let us do the work and then we'll let you know how everything fitted together. And if there are pieces that end up not being part of the core, we'll let you know, but let us do the work first. Glenn Schorr : Okay. That's cool. Maybe I'll follow up with a more nitty-gritty one. On the card side, I think part of the plan for the last couple of years has been converting card customers into digital banking clients. I noticed in the appendix that there's been growth in customers, but there hasn't been a tremendous amount of growth lately in active digital and mobile customers, I would say, the last 5 quarters. So, I'm curious if that's -- what you're doing to attack that opportunity and in fact fit into the going-forward plan. Jane Fraser : Yes. So in terms of the digital customers, it's a different picture in different parts of the world. So, we saw a tremendous growth in Mexico that starts with a much lower digital base. And so with COVID, we saw a pretty rapid acceleration across the industry, and we're a major leader in that. When we look at the States, we already have an extremely active card customer base on the digital front. And so, we weren't expecting to see the same levels of pickup.  I'd say the other piece as well is customer acquisition across the board is lower because of COVID, and you typically do tend to see that the new customers, when they come on board anyone's platform, they tend to have a higher digital adoption rate. So, I think we're pretty optimistic that as and when we see the recovery that we'll also see growth in that digital adoption in the U.S. going forward. Mark Mason : Jane, the only thing I'd add to that is that we have been seeing greater e-statement penetration -- or e-statement usage, I should say, and e-payment usage. Our e-statements usage and payment usage is up some 15%. And so, as you would imagine through this crisis, people have been actively engaged with our digital capabilities, and that's in part a byproduct of the investments that we've been making in digital technology. And so, we feel good about that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Mark, I was wondering if you could unpack some of the drivers of your 2021 expense outlook between investment spend, maybe the transformation spend and where you're saving money? Mark Mason : Sure. So look, as I\u2019ve said in the outlook there, we look at -- we see expenses being up about 2% to 3%. Most of that is likely to be driven by the transformation spend as we get our arms around what that cost is going to be. You know already we\u2019ve spent $1 billion this year. That's in our run rate already.  But there is a broader investment strategy that we're working toward, and we're doing that in the context of -- we'll obviously do that in the context of how the strategy Jane spoke to evolves. And so, continued investment in digital capabilities both on the consumer side as you heard me mention, but also on the ICG side, particularly in our TTS platform where we've seen good benefits from the investments already made there. But as you know, that's an area where innovation in technology is what's required to maintain a competitive advantage there.  We just announced the wealth management business, if you will, bringing together wealth from the consumer and in the private bank. And that, I would imagine, will be -- not I would imagine that will be an area of investment for us as we grow fee revenues, as Jane has pointed to, as an important objective of ours. We'll also see growth in advertising and marketing.  So, in that outlook, I talked about net interest revenue stabilizing, but picking up in the back half of the year with growth in loans, and that growth in loans is going to be a byproduct of us starting to put money to work again back in advertising and marketing, which was down materially this year as we managed through this crisis.  So, those are a couple of areas that we would look to invest in, in the context of that 2% to 3%. But again, a lot of it is going to be towards this transformation. And it is an investment, which I continue to remind folks of, and that is to say that we expect to and we'll focus on ensuring that we get a payback on that in the coming years. And so hopefully, that gives you a good sense, John. John McDonald : No, that's helpful. And just to follow up on the net interest income outlook you mentioned. I think you said it could be down $1 billion to $2 billion on a year-over-year basis. What are the swing factors that would bring you into the low end of that versus the high end of that? Mark Mason : Yes. So again, the net interest revenue could be down, and that's in part because you got to look at the pace of the recovery that we're forecasting. And so how loan volumes trend will be an important factor there. Obviously, the GDP forecast that we have factors into that. And obviously, the rate curve and how that evolves will be another important factor that comes into play. That said, I would add that we have seen -- on the card side, you heard me mention this in my prepared remarks. We saw good sequential momentum across purchase sale activity. Some of that's seasonal, but some of that just really good activity with our customers, and we're looking for that to continue. We -- obviously, there's been a stimulus that's been announced already. There are certain talks of significant stimulus or additional stimulus to come. And hopefully, that kind of bridges us to a place where it fuels some of the GDP growth that we're seeing in our forecast. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : My first question is for Jane. Like Glenn, I can't resist. I think investors are very excited to hear about your strategic plans because the constructive criticism that I get on Citi is that I think that investors are on board with your current plan and remediation and recovery. But I think they continue to wonder whether you have a lot of breadth but not as much depth in terms of market share and businesses.  And that's the long-winded way to ask this question, I'm sorry. Your peers seem to be settling on a mid-teens ROTCE or a little bit higher on a normalized level. And as you think about the wonderful franchise that you already have and the opportunities that you have to improve upon it, do you think that Citi can get to that level eventually whenever that normalized period arrives? Jane Fraser : Yes, it's a great question. It's one we've been spending a lot of time working on and talking through, as Mark and I look at what is the right configuration of businesses, how do we -- as I said, in the principles we're laying out for how we're looking at the Citi of the future, particularly in a digital environment as the world is changing quite quickly on that front. So once we finished doing the work, we'll be laying out what are the different metrics and milestones to measure us, both in terms of progress and in terms of the desired outcomes. I've been talking to a number of our key investors, which have been great, very helpful conversations, over the last few weeks and getting input from them around what sorts of outcomes are desirable. And they're very much part of mix as we look at doing this work on the strategy and on the transformation. As Mark said, the two go hand-in-hand going forward. So we look forward to getting back to you with that picture when we're ready. And Mark, I know has been key in all of this. So let me pass the mic to him. Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks, Jane. Look, in your prepared remarks, you rightfully focused on strategies that are geared towards identifying growth opportunities and improving our returns and narrowing the gap to peers. And I think that type of strategic focus, along with the investments that we've made -- that we're making, both transformation and growth-oriented investments, will certainly put us on that path.  I think the normalization of GDP in the credit environment is going to be helpful as well. And then as many people know, we've got a deferred tax asset and some legacy assets that we'll continue to work down over time. And I think those -- the combination of those things, starting with the strategy and a plan to continue to return capital and return on capital, put us in the right path to getting to those improved levels of returns, not to mention the prospect of increasing rates over time or in the normal part of the cycle. Erika Najarian : And my follow-up question is for you, Mark. It seems as if the stimulus plan so far and potentially the additional stimulus could build a bridge that's strong enough and long enough to perhaps not delay losses but lower actual cycle losses in card. How should we think about the stimulus related to how that could impact spending and loan volume trends as we trace that back to that NII guide? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, I mean we -- when we think about our reserve levels and the activity there, we certainly did factor in the impact of stimulus. I think what's important to point to is the stimulus thus far has resulted in high payment rates and a consistent kind of ability to pay for the consumer, and that's been good. And it showed up not only in our payment rates, but it also shows up in the lower level of delinquencies that we've seen and obviously the lower level of losses that we've seen. There certainly is a need for additional stimulus. And I think the good thing about that is it should continue to support the payment rates that we've seen. And if it is significant enough, can ultimately drive greater consumption and support improved GDP, improved unemployment. Our current forecast, as you heard me mention earlier, assumes that, that loan momentum picks up towards the end of -- or the mid -- I'm sorry, the back half of 2021. If we see that take hold sooner, we could see higher levels of volume in loan growth. And obviously, that would be beneficial to our NIR forecast.  So stimulus is good in that regard. It also will put -- as it takes hold, there'll likely be some early pressure on lending volumes because people tend -- are using it as a liquidity tool and to pay down. But over time, I think it will be beneficial. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : One simple question and one hard question. Mark, you get the simple one. When can Citigroup start repurchasing shares? And how much do you think you can repurchase in the first quarter? And I don't think you were allowed to purchase yet this quarter, but did you? Mark Mason : Sure. So as you know, the Fed guidance allowed for us to reinstate buybacks. There was a cap on the first quarter that's based on the trailing 4-quarter average of income for us. That would equate to about $1.8 billion or so in buybacks in the first quarter. And so with -- subject to Board approval, we will approve some level of buybacks in Q1. We have not started those buybacks as of yet. Michael Mayo : All right. And then the hard question is for Jane is -- who does Citi want to be in 2030, when we step back 5 or 10 years from now and have a picture of Citi? And the reason I ask that is you mentioned Citi being global. But despite this global status, Citi's fallen short of expectations in each of the past 5 decades. You can go back to Walter Wriston, you can go back to the '80s, you can go back to Sandy Weill and John Reed, the financial supermarket, you can go back to the financial crisis, and even with the retrenching and derisking, and I agree the chance of bankruptcy is far less, the return on capital has fallen short of the cost of capital for the last decade. So you'll be the seventh CEO at Citigroup when you take over. Why will it be different this time? What can you do differently, whether it's business mix or customer mix or geographic mix? Because from my perspective and I -- it's great. You can take a clinical look, a dispassionate look. But I'm extremely passionate about the underperformance of the Citi over almost any time frame over the last 50 years. And so I'm just trying to figure out what you can do given your 16 years at Citi, your experience at McKinsey to actually finally change Citi to generate sustainable returns above the cost of capital. So once again, where -- what's Citi's endgame? Jane Fraser : Well, thank you, Mike. So I think the end game, and you asked a question in terms of what do we look like in 2030, it's pretty simple really. As you said, we're a global bank. We want to be the leading global bank. We're very well positioned from that from our businesses. That means top-tier franchises in their respective competitive sets with a strategy that has been well understood by the market over that time frame. We want to be best-in-class in serving our clients and our customers, certainly in safety and soundness. And I'd add in, we want to be seen as playing a positive role in society as I think that's a very important part of mix these days. But all of that is with the purpose of generating the desired returns for our investors.  So to be fair, while we have made demonstrable progress over the last 10 years since the crisis, equally know that there is a gap to close with our peers. You can hold me accountable for doing so along with the management team. We're a team on a mission to get this done, and we will get this done. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Not to beat a dead horse, maybe just one quick follow-up, if there's any help you can give us. I think one of the biggest concerns on investors is they can't see the path to the kind of peer-level returns. Do you think of it -- as you look at it -- without giving away specifics on strategy and things like that, is it really an efficiency issue? Is it a capital issue because of the DTAs? How do you think about where you are today and what's driving the gap? Jane Fraser : So these are all the questions that Mark and I are sitting down and looking at our different businesses and saying how do we make sure -- as I said in the opening remarks, we're looking at how do we drive our resource allocation and how do we drive our investments into businesses that will be important growth drivers for the franchise and high-returning areas for the firm going forward. We've come out with one already that we think is an important one on that dimension in wealth, where we've got many different parts of the puzzle that we think will enable us to be highly successful in this domain, bringing the different pieces of the firm together to drive this forward and is clearly going to be one of several areas that we see helping us improve our returns.  And as Mike said, that's not the only piece. There are other elements, as I said, in the different principles. We see value from simplification. And that's in terms of, obviously, the operating efficiencies and the like that we would get from that as well as potentially business mix. And we want to drive the businesses to make sure that they're really fitting well together so that they are achieving the synergies as well as the competitive and collective comparative advantage.  So it's going to be a combination of pieces. But as I say, we're doing this work. We'll let you know as we go of what the decisions we make along the way and look forward to sharing them with you, frankly, with the intent that we have both a leading global firm as well as an organization that's delivering the desired results to our investors. Mark, anything to add, my friend? Mark Mason : Yes, I think you said it well, but I want to repeat one thing you said, which is that we're going to get this done, right? And it is a combination. We'll continue to refine the strategy here. We've got some very strong businesses with competitive advantages that we want to continue to shore up. We're going to make investments in the franchise because that's what it's going to take in order to continue to drive improved returns.  Yes, there are some drags. I mentioned that earlier. They certainly do weigh on the returns between the DTA and legacy assets. But we also have excess capital as we sit here with the CET1 ratio of an 11.80% versus 11.50% target that we have. And so we're going to continue to work all of those things in combination. And I believe those are the things -- we believe those are the things that are going to get us back to continued improved levels of returns that we saw coming into this crisis. Jim Mitchell : Okay. No, fair enough. And maybe just talk -- speaking to one of those businesses where you see growth you've been investing. Can you talk to the underlying -- obviously, with pressure in interest rates, it's hard to see it, the underlying growth in TTS. How do you feel about the businesses? We've seen competition, whether it's in treasury services or payments, wholesale payments, it seems like it's a competitive environment. How do you think about that business and growth from here? Mark Mason : Yes, sure. I'll take that. So first of all, we feel very good about the TTS business that we have. We think of it as part of our services business inside of the ICG services would include TTS and security services. As you know, we have a very unique position within this part of our franchise. And you're right, the headline numbers are affected by interest rates. But we feel very good about the underlying momentum in the business, and we think that's evidenced by a couple of key drivers.  You're aware we're in 95 countries. That gives our clients the ability to transact in over 140 currencies. And we do that on a global platform. We have 600,000 users on that platform, which is up about 9% from last year. And within that, the mobile users are up about 95%.  We're continuing to grow accounts with our clients. And we now have the ability to open accounts digitally in 50 countries. In 2020, we opened over 14,000 accounts digitally, representing more than a 200% increase. And growing accounts deepens our relationship with clients and allows us to penetrate new activity centers, that allows us to capture more flows across our platform. And ultimately, that delivers more revenue. And so this digital activity drives revenue for us in the future, and it also is more -- in a more efficient way for us to do business with clients. We're also seeing good transaction volumes across different payment types with these clients. We've had very good clearing performance and cross-border flows through the year. And so those things give us a lot of insight into what the momentum will look like coming out of this crisis. And that's not to mention additional opportunities with new clients. As you know, we've moved our commercial business squarely into the ICG. There's more upside for our TTS platform with a commercial -- with the commercial client base.  And so we feel very good about where we are. We're not taking our position for granted. We're going to continue to invest in this platform, and we're looking forward to capturing the growth and supporting our clients as they come out of this crisis. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I want to follow up on expenses. So the guidance implies about $44 billion this year, and as you alluded to, a lot of investments in that. As we think out -- it's a little hypothetical because there might be changes to the strategy and simplification that can impact the expense base. But as we think out beyond this year, should we view that as kind of a bloated expense base, that some of these investments are running at higher-than-normal levels and you can bring them down? Or is this more of kind of a normal run rate and then the efficiency will really come from growing revenue? Mark Mason : Yes. Let me make a couple of quick comments. One, as I mentioned and as you repeated, we will see expense growth here. Jane mentioned we're in the midst of making progress against our transformation. And we'll need to submit a plan in May and get that plan approved and continue to invest to get that executed against. And that will inform the thinking around some of the outer-years. But to answer your question around a bloated expense base, I would say no. It's not a bloated expense base at all. These are investments, as you've heard me mention repeatedly, and they're going to be -- there is going to be a return on the investment. The return will come in both revenue and a more efficient operating platform.  We've got a history now. We've got some credibility now with having demonstrated productivity across our platform, whether that's through automating processes or reducing data centers or low-cost location strategies. Since our Investor Day, we've continued to improve our productivity. And that's what you should expect. That's what we're expecting of ourselves and we'll deliver on kind of coming out of these investments that we need to make. And so no, not a bloated expense base.  With that said, so put that aside, we are going to continue to invest in the business. And so if there are opportunities that present themselves, either as a byproduct of the strategy, refresh that Jane has mentioned or otherwise, we intend to take advantage of making those investments because that is the only way we get to those improved returns that we're targeting and focused on. So hopefully, that answers your question. Matthew O'Connor: That is helpful. And then just separately, as we think about the strategic review, I think there's been some speculation in terms of which businesses, if any, you might exit. And I'm not going to name them, but some of them are pretty high-return businesses, if you just look at them on a stand-alone basis, some aren't. But how do you think conceptually about as you potentially exit or sell a certain business, there might be a gap between you're giving up some earnings before you can deploy them in things like digital and TTS and wealth in terms of the payback, right? Because there could be -- you lose some earnings initially and you might have bloated capital and, again, some of the investments take time to play out. So is that something like you're mindful of or... Jane Fraser : Yes. What we're looking at the moment is much more around what do we want to be going forward. And where we are in the work is looking at how -- what are the different businesses, how do they best fit together. Digitization is changing quite a few things, as Mark was referring to. It's providing a lot of new opportunities, but also some important investments for growth as well as for returns. And if it ends up that there are businesses as we look at it that we don't think that fit well into the mix, then I think we've got good skills in terms of thinking about how we divest of those in a way that makes sense. But that's honestly not where we are at the moment. We're focused on what we're going to be. So as I say, wait for us to get the work done, and then we can come back to you with the plans of what we're looking at and what that path looks like. I think it's too early to speculate right now. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Two questions. One on the improving profitability that you -- that we've been talking about here. I know we've been talking a lot about it from the expense side and from the revenue growth side, but I'm also wondering about the funding cost side. And given the fact that you have a great brand in the U.S., you have a really good mobile app and we have a relatively low interest rate environment, why not put up a high-cost savings product and reduce your wholesale cost of funds by switching from wholesale to a high-cost savings product, which, at this rate, you can actually -- you should be able to pick up some ROA on that? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, we have seen very good deposit growth, and some of that is a byproduct of our high-yield savings accounts. But we've also seen strong checking account growth this quarter, and we've seen the growth in our digital deposits as well. And so you're right, there's a funding cost advantage to that. We've seen that play out and the liquidity that's in the market. We intend to continue to grow as it relates to increasing those deposits. And we've been smart about how we've been managing our liquidity, keeping some liquidity, obviously, there for lending needs as they may evolve for our customers and clients but also paying down wholesale debt. We did that through the year and also investing.  We've made some investments through the year. I think we've invested as much as another $78 billion or so, up 21% for the year. And so we've been thoughtfully managing the liquidity that we've seen through the course of this year. We'll continue to do that, and we'll continue to grow deposits on the consumer side because you're right, it is a lower-cost funding alternative. And we'll do that as it -- if it makes a lot of sense. Betsy Graseck : The other question for you, Mark, is just on how you're thinking about credit. I know you mentioned that credit costs will be lower in '21 versus '20. I think we can -- we all agree with that. Trying to understand how much flex there is there. Maybe one question there is on the reserve analysis and what kind of level of unemployment you're looking for in your reserving today at year-end '21. And is there some room for that reserve release to be potentially larger as we go through the year?  And then maybe -- I know you talked about how stimulus could help net charge-off peaks. It's hard to give an estimate on that. But maybe give us a sense as to how you're thinking about the trajectory for credit costs year-on-year. Mark Mason : Sure. So I guess a couple of pieces there. So one, as you know, Betsy, when we model this, we look at kind of the macroeconomic variables that we have at any point in time. And so you look at kind of Page 4, we laid out the variables that we've used this quarter. And you can see that both for U.S. unemployment as well as for U.S. real GDP, we've seen improvement since the third quarter forecast that we ran.  And I'd tell you, even as you look at this, there's been further improvement even off of the fourth quarter '20 forecast that's here. And so those are important factors in the assumptions and what we're able to model in the way of reserve levels. And as we see that improve or improve further, we would expect that, that would be -- that would play out in the way of even lower reserves.  I think the other important factor is the stimulus and how that -- and the additional stimulus that is out there and how that ultimately evolves and what that means and whether that drives consumer consumption and whether that drives even further levels of improved unemployment will be important factors that come into play here.  And then I guess the final piece I'd mention is that we continue to hold management adjustment for economic uncertainty. And as we see these variables continue to improve, that's going to impact how we think about severity and probability associated with that downside scenario. So all of those factors come into play as to how we think about the reserve levels that we carry. While we still feel good about the $28 billion roughly that we have in the way of balances, we feel very good about the direction that these economic variables appear to be moving.  In terms of losses, again, it's been interesting the way this has played out. And so really, what we're all trying to figure out is whether the lower delinquencies and lower level of losses that we've seen thus far is a delay or is it a deflation of losses, right? And that only time will tell as we sit here today. And as you heard me say in my prepared remarks, we think it's a bit of a delay in that we would expect to see losses peak in 2022 now, particularly for U.S. consumer. But again, with another stimulus right around the corner, that, in fact, could be further delayed and ultimately we would hope that it would just go away and be deflated and come down. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : A follow-up question, Mark, on the fee side. Understanding that you're -- we'll see this tough comp year-over-year. Just wondering if you can separate when you expect normalization for some of the areas back to19-ish. I know that's a moving target given the environment. But just if you think about separating out Trading and Investment Banking, can you just talk to us through about like the visibility stuff that you see a little bit more easier, how you see that trajecting, notably Investment Banking, TTS, et cetera? Mark Mason : Yes. So again, we see -- we continue to have good dialogue on the Investment Banking side with our clients. Obviously, we've seen very strong performance as it relates to the SPAC space and equity capital markets, and that will continue to play out just when you think about the nature of those deals. And so that will continue to play out into 2021.  But the dialogue has been very good. And that's both in investment banking, but also just broadly with the corporate clients as corporate clients are trying to figure out what coming out of this crisis means for their own business models and how they think about their digital capabilities and needs and how they think about their supply chains and how that might be shifting. And those types of dialogues they're having both internally but also with us. And so we're part of that conversation. And being part of that creates opportunities on the TTS side, on the Investment Banking side and potentially even as it relates to the corporate lending activity, which we hope to pick up in the back half of the year as well.  And so very, very strong and continued corporate dialogue, and I think that's going to contribute ultimately to driving some of that fee revenue that you mentioned. In terms of the markets piece, we -- again, we've had an extraordinary year. The industry has seen a great deal of wallet growth in markets. And that's got to normalize at some point, obviously, and we are forecasting that it does. But I'll tell you in the early days of January, we've continued to see robust activity. And it is early days in the quarter. But we have seen that. And so we'll have to see how that plays out over the balance of the quarter and going into the balance of '21. Kenneth Usdin : Understood. And a follow-up on rates. It's always a little harder to dig out how much rates benefits you guys -- just given the global nature of all the yield curves that you guys face. But is there a way you can help us or just remind us just how sensitive or not to the company is to just -- if the long end were to move here in the U.S. and how much contribution that might be able to add? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, we tend to be more sensitive to the short end of the curve, but we disclosed some IRE information in our Qs. And in fairness, that's kind of tough to compare relative to peers. So we show what 100 basis point increase would be on the long end. And -- but the reality is that we would see -- with curve steepening, we would see some upside as we would think about investing out on the curve and as it would also impact the pressure we've been seeing from MBS repayments and the like. And so we're more sensitive to the short. But with the steepening, we think we would see some benefit. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Christoph Kotowski : I'm looking at Page 10 of your handout and the global consumer trends. I'm trying to understand that. And I guess, I have 2 questions, one narrow, one broader. And the narrow question is just looking at Latin America, the losses are down and the delinquencies are significantly up. Is that an accounting thing, a forbearance thing? Or is that a real underlying economic thing? And does it have to do with COVID? Or does it have to do with other economic variables? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, what we're seeing there is as people come off of the relief programs that have been in place, we're seeing delinquencies pick up as was expected. And so that's what's playing out in the increase that we see in the fourth quarter. And ultimately, that will play out in the NCLs. But again, that is along the lines of what we were expecting in Latin America. Christoph Kotowski : Okay. And the decline then presumably is the flip side of that, the forbearance? Mark Mason : That's right. Yes. Christoph Kotowski : Right. Okay. And then I guess just looking at the picture more broadly. And I mean I guess if you look at infection rates of COVID, North America is high, Asia is low and Latin America is somewhere in between. Normally, I think all of us like 9 or 10 months ago would have kind of thought that the economic disruption and the loss rates would somehow mirror that. And it doesn't seem to be in any way, shape or form that I can tell. And I'm wondering if you can account for that. And how are we to gauge kind of the disruption that COVID is causing and, I guess, particularly in your kind of global businesses? Mark Mason : Go ahead. I'm sorry. Michael Corbat : No, Mark, I was going to say, Chris, I would say that we've got to look at what I would describe as the unevenness, right? The unevenness, the way that we went into this in terms of timing, in terms of position, in terms of health response, in terms of economic response. You look at the demographics, and clearly, in -- at the different layers or different strata, you see different things. Headlines in the paper this morning, 1 out of every 5 in New York City on rent subsidy are behind in their payments, at least 2 payments. But at the same time, we continue to see paydowns in terms of credit cards. Businesses on different trajectories.  And so again, as I think as we see vaccines roll out on a state-by-state basis, that will cause different outcomes. And then as we see the second round and what President-elect Biden announced last night and ultimately what comes through and how that makes its way into the sector.  So from our perspective, not just in the U.S., but around the globe, we are really taking a very granular approach on a geographic by geographic, client segment by client segment around that and trying to remain very sensitive to each of those. And so I don't think there is a single formula that allows you to look at this and come with the outcome. It's got to be done at a pretty granular level. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. Charles Peabody : Yes. I had a follow-up question on the markets commentary or trading businesses. And specifically, I wanted to focus on your FICC trading businesses. Can you give us a little bit more color as it relates to the fourth quarter where the strength in FICC was and where the weakness was in terms of rates, credit, commodities, currencies?  And then as part of that, it's my understanding that you were caught wrong-footed in the rand. And I was wondering -- and I'm assuming that losses there were not material because it's not a deep market. But is there something changing about the environment that's going to make it more difficult in 2021 for positioning or market making or trading? Because you do talk about normalizing. Was there anything in that rand experience that you can extrapolate? Mark Mason : Sure, this is Mark. Sorry, Mike, go ahead. Michael Corbat : First off, Charles, I would say that in the rand piece that, that was more of a research recommendation than an actually a firm positioning play. And so it was our analysts going out with what they believed was a recommendation around that. And so that shouldn't be read as the firm necessarily having that position. Independent research came out with that. On your second piece, I think as you look at FICC trading, for us, if you look at the fourth quarter and the numbers that we've posted, I think you should look in there, I think relative strength in terms of credit and credit spread products, again, as we measure that against our rates and currencies business, it's not as large. It's still a meaningful business for us but not as large. Some of that other people have spoken to as having outsized, quite significant returns in the leverage lending space. We're not as large in that space.  And I think as we look at our trading revenues, we tend to look at those over not just quarter but longer cycles. And if you look at The Street research today, it's indicating that the trading wallet for 2020 was up somewhere in the neighborhood of mid-20s. As you look at our trading revenues for 2020, we're probably up somewhere in the mid-30s. So again, quarter-to-quarter, less important. But again, for us continuing to take share in there and the underlying mix tends to kind of bounce that around a little bit. But again, I think we feel pretty good about our position and the dialogues where we are. I think as we think forward, I think it's unlikely to think that we're going to see wallets up to the same degree, certainly in the trading space that we saw this year. We think seasonality will resume. But as Mark said, as we kind of started and it's early in the new year, we have seen activity remain high. And as I think we see more potential stimulus or governmental programs coming out, the Fed and others continuing to take stances on rates and trajectory and where things go, that could keep trading volumes, keep creating volumes relatively high.  So again, we think we're pretty well positioned, and we're in dialogue around those, but we clearly can't escape all of the market dynamics of where the wallets go. Mark Mason : And Mike, the only thing I'd add is if you look at the numbers, right, FICC is up 34% for the year. Raise in currency is up 32%. Spread products, up 40%. We've had very strong performance this year. It's hard to be upset with those numbers. And so everything you said is exactly right, Mike. And I think the business has been fully engaged with clients, and we're going to continue to do that. Charles Peabody : Just as a follow-up, I mean I recognize it was an unusually strong year and particularly in FICC, which was nice to see. But does that make it -- when you look out at 2021, are you looking for FICC to be less robust, and equity sort of offset that? Or is there any mix between FICC and equity in your thought process? Mark Mason : Look, our equities is up. We're up 25% this year as well, right? So the normal -- and the wallets were up for equities as well. So we'll see a normalization take place across the board next year or at some point? Michael Corbat : And I would also say, Charles, we need to look at the new issued calendar. And clearly, the calendar on both the debt and the equity side was strong. We saw the seasonality, and we saw clearly debt issuance slow in the fourth quarter. There are recommendation, and the uptake around our clients was to go ahead and to build lots of liquidity and to shore up the balance sheet. And so probably less debt financing needs in terms of 2021. But at the same time, I've got to say, and I reviewed it last evening, that the equity calendar remains very strong. And again, we'll see what the markets afford, but we've got to be able to have a market that's welcoming to new issues and in particular the SPAC space, which we've excelled and has been strong. And so again, that will also, I think, then dictate some of the secondary activity as we go forward in the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, coming back to share repurchases, obviously, there's limitations based on income, and you explained it very clearly, for you and also your peers. If those limitations are lifted possibly after this year's stress test and we go back to the more traditional or the regulations that are in place that went into effect October 1 with the stress capital buffer, where as long as you pass your CET1 requirement, you're free to do whatever you'd like. That as the backdrop, would you guys consider an accelerated share repurchase program if you got the green light rather than doing it every quarter like it was done in the past because that's what the regulations required in the past? Mark Mason : Yes. We'll need to look at -- first of all, the stress capital buffer, obviously, is an important component to how this all comes together. And coming out of the recent resubmission, you saw the prospective stress capital will have to go up by 10 basis points. They haven't applied that. We're still subject to the 2.5% stress capital buffer, but that will be a factor that we have to consider in the outer-quarters from 2021.  And then post that, there'll be another CCAR submission, and we'll get results that inform the go-forward there. Every quarter, we'll look at what our projected performance would suggest, including that stress capital buffer juxtaposed against our target. And that view will allow for us to take the capital actions that we think are appropriate inside of what those results would suggest.  And so we will take this in quarterly decisions, so to speak, ensuring that our outlook supports the capital action that we want to take. And so that's how we intend to approach it. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And Jane, you pointed out that a lot of work is going to be done about looking at the opportunities to drive growth for Citigroup so that you can narrow the gap between your peers in terms of profitability. And I don't expect you to give us the answers, obviously, on this call. But one of the differences between Citigroup and 2 of its biggest peers that are more profitable is your U.S. consumer banking franchise. And those 2 peers, which announced their numbers today, have ROEs in that business of over 25%, whereas when we look at your global consumer business based on your fourth quarter numbers, the ROE was about 15%. Is there an opportunity for depository acquisitions in the United States? Is there an opportunity to grow the Consumer Banking business in the U.S.? Jane Fraser : We certainly believe there is a strong opportunity. And the strategy we have as we put all of the U.S. consumer business together over the last year or so has been to make sure that we capitalize on that by building out and deepening our customer relationships in the U.S. And we've had a number of important thrusts digitally and digital acquisition, as Mark referred to. So yes, we do see important growth opportunities, and our home market is an important one for us. The specifics of that, as we said, more to come. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Societe Generale. Andrew Lim : So for the system -- sorry, for the system as a whole, we've seen excess deposits really grew quite a lot at banks. I think one of your competitors has noted how this is putting pressure on certain ratios, one of which would be your supplementary leverage ratio. And I think if you took away the temporary exclusion of cash and treasuries and its nominator of that ratio, then things would look quite tight. I just wanted to see how that pans out for Citi, whether you see that same kind of pressure and how you think about that. And then if I could ask two short technical questions. I didn't quite catch what you said about LatAm NCLs coming down. What was the reason for that? It just strikes me as a bit surprising that, that should be the case.  And then just lastly, on your risk-weighted assets, they climbed quite a bit this quarter. It doesn't seem to be that it could be entirely credit driven. Just if you could give a bit more color on that. Mark Mason : Sure. Let me start with your first question, which was on, I think, the impact of deposits. And so yes, we have seen a significant increase in deposits. That does impact a number of the important metrics. From an SLR point of view, if not for the relief, which kind of goes away at the end of the first quarter, we'd have a lower SLR by 109 basis points. So the reg relief provided 109 basis points of relief there. It also has had an impact on -- and by the way, we are managing to that SLR relief going away at the end of the first quarter. So we're aware of that. We're managing accordingly to that.  It's also had an impact on our GCIB score, which is -- has kind of tripped into the next bucket, the 3.5% bucket. And the large percentage of that increase that we've seen in the GCIB score was also driven by deposits. And so we'll have to manage that as well. Obviously, there -- we have a view that some consideration needs to be given to both of these metrics as the Fed has been clear in terms of their view that there's enough capital in the system. And so we're hopeful that as kind of things evolve, that some consideration is given to that. But in the meantime, we're managing the balance sheet and deposits and capital accordingly and with full knowledge of how the relief might evolve in the case of the SLR.  In terms of your question on credit risk in Latin America, the point that I was making here was that because we've had customers that were part of a relief program, that the NCLs that we've seen have been lower than what they would have been if those customers were not running through the relief program. So you see the NCL -- the lower NCL in the quarter, but you also start to see delinquencies pick up. And those delinquencies are picking up as people come out of that relief program and start to -- or stop paying, I should say, and therefore, you see delinquencies take up.  And so shortly, you'll see the NCL start to pick up as people go beyond the 90 days past due delinquent and go into losses. Hopefully, that was clear. The last question you asked was on advanced RWA growth. I mean we did see RWA increase quarter-over-quarter. The drivers there was -- they were a combination of credit risk, market risk and operational risk. And inside of that, we saw FX drive some of that increase as well as derivatives and mostly derivative and FX exposure increases, including CVA. So those are the major drivers of the RWA on an advanced basis tick-up that we saw. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your final question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : I just have a quick clarification. I know you've been talking about wealth management being a focus. And we see the stats that you give us for Asia, like investment sales up 58% linked quarter. But the fee revenue in Asia consumer is actually down linked quarter by 10%. So is this a really small business in revenue? Since there's no disclosure, it's hard for us to tell. Or what are the other offsets? Because I hear you talk about it as a material part of Asia, but there's no way to put any context around this. Mark Mason : Yes. And look, we're going to -- we just announced, obviously, the creation of this wealth management business where we'll bring the private bank together with the wealth management business we have globally on consumer. So we'll provide more detailed metrics as it relates to that. But our Asia wealth management is a sizable business, and we are going to continue or expect us to continue to see growth there. And so stay tuned on kind of more disclosure there and more details around the strategy for how we get after that. Operator : There are no further questions. Are there any closing remarks? Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you all for joining us today. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to us in IR. Thank you again, and have a nice day. Operator : This concludes today's earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to Citi's First Quarter 2021 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions]. Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, Operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. Before we get started, I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including the cautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 2020 Form 10-K. With that said, let me turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I am delighted to join you for my first earnings call as the Citi's CEO. Mark and I have a lot to cover today, so let's get cracking. Earlier today, we announced our earnings for the first quarter as well as the initial strategic actions we're taking in our Global Consumer Bank to focus on our competitive advantages and to improve our returns to our shareholders. I'll start with some observations, therefore, in the first quarter, and then I'll update you on the ongoing work on our strategy. It's been a much better-than-expected start of the year, and we are optimistic about the recovery ahead of us, and we're positioning the bank for a period of sustained growth. For the quarter, we reported earnings of $3.62 per share on net income of $7.9 billion. This was a record quarter in net income, driven by good performance in our Institutional business, and a release of $3.9 billion from our allowance for credit losses as a result of the improving economic outlook. In the Institutional Clients Group, our Markets businesses benefited yet again from an active environment. We saw solid performance in fixed income after a very strong first quarter last year and a record quarter in Equities. We also had a record quarter in Investment Banking, reflecting high levels of activity in equity underwriting. Treasury and Trade Solutions, which is the backbone of our global network grew deposits even though revenues continued to be impacted by low interest rates. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down quarter-over-quarter as a result of the pandemic. However, we clearly see a recovery taking root in Asia as well as the U.S., and that was reflected in our ACL release. And I'd note, this is the healthiest we have seen the consumer emerge from a crisis in recent history, driven in large part by the U.S. government stimulus package. Now while loan demand was down, we did see strong growth in wealth management and in digital engagement, both of which are central to the consumer franchise we are building. And our capital levels remained strong and stable, allowing us to respond to the needs of our clients and to return capital to our shareholders. At 11.7%, our common equity Tier 1 ratio was unchanged from the fourth quarter, and we resumed the repurchase of common stock which we voluntarily paused at the onset of the pandemic. Our tangible book value increased to $75.50, up 5% from a year ago. Now turning to our strategy. When we spoke in January, I pointed to 4 principles which we're using to guide the refresh of our strategy. First, we said we will be clinical in assessing which businesses we can retain or secure leading market positions in. Next, we're going to be focused by directing resources to high-returning businesses and away from the others. Third, we're going to be connected so we ensure our businesses fit well together and that they generate synergies. And last, we're going to be simpler to better serve our clients, fulfill our obligations to our regulators, and unlock value for our shareholders. We also committed to take the strategic decisions needed to best position Citi to win and to close the gap in return with our competitors, and we committed to share these decisions with you as we make them, and that's what we're doing again today. When I spoke in January about our new focus on wealth. we believe we're very well positioned to capture strong growth and attractive returns in this business, particularly in Asia and the U.S. Today, wealth at Citi represents roughly $6.5 billion in revenues, with three quarters of $1 trillion of client assets. And there's many synergies with our markets, BCMA, and commercial banking franchises across our global network. Yesterday, we announced the management team for Citi Global Wealth and the work in investments are well underway on the business strategy and growth plans. And today, we announced our decision to focus our consumer banking franchise in Asia and EMEA solely on 4 wealth centers, namely Singapore, Hong Kong, UAE, and London. This positions us to capture the full spectrum of the wealth opportunity through these important hubs where we can serve onshore and offshore clients. And in Asia, this will allow us to continue operating our leading consumer businesses in Singapore and Hong Kong, which are both scaled and very high returning. We will, therefore, pursue exits of our consumer businesses in the remaining 13 markets in Asia and EMEA. Now, while these are excellent franchises, we don't have the scale we need to compete, and we've decided we simply aren't the best owners of them over the long term. So, consistent with the principles we outlined for the strategy refresh, we believe our capital, our investment dollars, and our other resources are better redeployed against higher returning opportunities elsewhere. What does this mean? This means that Global Consumer Banking will consist of 2 scale [ph] franchises in the U.S. and Mexico and these 4 hubs serving 100 million customers in total. Let me be very clear on one very important point. Citi will continue to invest behind and serve our institutional clients in these 13 new markets. We have a high-returning and leading institutional franchise in Asia, and it is an absolutely central part of our success going forward. And we see important opportunities to invest and gain share with our institutional clients regionwide. Indeed, I saw from my own experience in Latin America how the institutional businesses in each market really benefited from the increased focus once we have exited our subscale consumer franchises and simplified the operating model in the region. I fully expect the same will be true in Asia. And in the meantime, the comprehensive work on our strategy refresh continues. We will continue to share the decisions we make with you as we work to close the gap in returns with our peers. In parallel, we are, of course, hard at work on our transformation. We're making our next submission to the SEC this quarter. It's a massive body of work. We continue to work closely with our regulators to meet their expectations, and we expect to submit our complete plan to both regulators no later than the third quarter. We've identified the end states, performed the gap analyses and are currently working through the detailed resourcing and program plans and interdependencies and we've begun execution on several fronts. The investments required go hand-in-hand with our strategy work. So, for example, when we talk about simplification, we're pursuing it through changes to our operating model, but also by removing manual processes and controls and make no mistake about it. We want to achieve nothing less than a fundamental transformation by delivering excellence in our risk and controlled environment in our operations and in our service to clients. So, I am excited about the road ahead, and I have no doubt that these investments and others that we're going to make in talent and technology are all going to help us modernize the bank and position Citi to win. And finally, I want to update you on some of the commitments we're making in terms of ESG. Now we've prided ourselves in being a leader in many dimensions of ESG over the years. I see it as embedded in what we offer to our clients and the communities we serve around the world. And as you may know, on my first day as CEO in the beginning of March, I committed that Citi would reach net 0 greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, and we will deliver our plan on how we will do so within the next 12 months. Critical to helping our clients transition to a low-carbon economy is a support we provide them through our environmental finance activities. So to that end, we're going to extend our current environmental finance target from $250 billion by 2025 to $500 billion by 2030. And in addition, we finance other activities in support of the UN's sustainable development goals outside of environmental finance. And these include our important investments in affordable housing, in health care and workforce development. We are committing an additional $500 billion to these activities by 2030, making our total sustainable development goal commitment $1 trillion by 2030. And with that, I am going to turn over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Mark? Mark Mason : Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Let me briefly review the results for the quarter, and then I'll go into more detail on the strategic refresh and specific actions we announced earlier today. Overall, we had a stronger-than-expected start to the year, driven by a constructive capital markets backdrop as well as a benefit from the cost of credit for the quarter. For the quarter, Citigroup reported net income of $7.9 billion. Revenues declined 7% from the prior year, while we saw continued strength in Investment Banking and a solid markets performance, it was more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates, along with lower card loans in consumer and the absence of the prior year mark-to-market gains on loan hedges. Expenses were up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued investments in our transformation, including infrastructure supporting our risk and control environment as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit performance remained strong, with net credit losses of $1.7 billion, more than offset by an ACL release of $3.9 billion driven primarily by an improvement in our macroeconomic outlook as well as lower loan balances. EPS was $3.62 and RoTCE was just over 20%. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 10% year-over-year, reflecting lower spending activity in consumer as well as higher repayments across institutional and consumer. Deposits grew 7%, reflecting consistent client engagement with both corporate and consumer clients continuing to hold higher levels of liquidity. Before I go into more detail on each business, on Slide 4, I'd like to cover the strategic refresh that Jane discussed earlier. Last quarter, we spoke about the significant opportunity wealth represents for Citi going forward and announced the formation of Citi Global Wealth in order to better connect assets and capabilities across the consumer and institutional franchises and to transform the way we serve clients across the wealth spectrum. We've continued the build-out of Citi Global Wealth this quarter and have provided some details on the scope of the business on the slide, with additional information on key drivers in the appendix. Citi Global Wealth represented roughly $6.6 billion in allocated annual revenues. And it delivered 15% growth in investment revenues last year, driven by higher client activity and growth in client investment assets. As we continue to integrate the component businesses into a single wealth platform, we will finalize how best to implement this strategy from an organizational standpoint over the coming quarters and update you accordingly. Turning next to the actions we announced today. Given our strategic focus on global wealth management, we announced the decision to focus our Global Consumer Banking presence in Asia and EMEA on 4 wealth centers. As Jane mentioned, this strategic shift will allow us to simplify our operating model, while directing investments and resources to the businesses where we have competitive advantages and the scale necessary to drive higher returns over the long run. Let me describe the 13 markets where we will pursue an exit, shown on the slide, with added details in the appendix. Last year, these businesses contributed roughly $4 billion of revenues. And while historically profitable, like other consumer businesses, the impact of CECL weighed on full year results given the pandemic, with cost of credit nearly doubling in these markets year-over-year. Total assets were $82 billion as of the end of 2020, and the businesses are supported by roughly $7 billion of allocated TCE. We have a good track record of reducing expenses in similar situations. However, as noted on the slide, we are including fully allocated expenses to these markets, which could differ somewhat from the ultimate expense reductions. We will continue to manage these markets as part of the GCB franchise but we already have relevant actions well underway. We plan to share more information with you as we make progress against these and other actions as part of our ongoing strategy refresh. Finally, I want to emphasize a point that Jane made earlier. We will continue to serve ICG clients, including our commercial banking clients, in all these markets. And more broadly, this strategic shift will allow us to focus more investments on ICG in Asia. Turning now to each business. Slide 5 shows the results for the Institutional Clients group. We delivered a solid performance in the quarter, driven by strong execution in the constructive operating environment. For the quarter, ICG delivered EBIT of $7.7 billion, up 65% from last year. Revenues decreased 2%, reflecting the absence of mark-to-market gains on loan hedges seen last year. Excluding this, revenues were up 5%, with 9% growth in banking and 2% growth in markets and security services. Expenses increased 8%, reflecting investments in infrastructure and controls, along with other strategic investments, higher compensation cost and volume-driven growth. Credit costs were down considerably, given a $1.9 billion ACL release. The release this quarter primarily reflected improvements in the outlook for global GDP as well as modest improvements in portfolio credit quality. As of quarter end, our overall funded reserve ratio was 1.1%, including 3.6% on the non-investment-grade portion. Total net credit losses were $186 million, and ICG delivered a 25.7% return on allocated capital. Slide 6 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were up 5%, driven by record revenues in both equity underwriting and equity trading. Looking at these strong results across our overarching equities franchise, we feel good about the strategic investments we've been making which enabled us to leverage our full service model to better monetize the current market. On the banking side, revenues increased 9%. Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were down 10% in constant dollars, as good client engagement and solid growth in deposits were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates and lower commercial cards revenues. Despite these headwinds, we continue to see strength in our underlying business drivers, including 14% growth in average deposits in constant dollars this quarter. And over the past year, we've seen significant increases in digital adoption and penetration as well as 7% growth in cross-border flows and 6% growth in clearing volumes. Investment Banking experienced its best quarter ever with revenues up 46%, driven by equity underwriting given our leading position in the SPAC market. Private Bank revenues grew 8%, also its best quarter ever, driven by higher lending volumes and managed investments revenues. Corporate Lending revenues were also up 8%, reflecting the absence of prior year marks, partially offset by lower volumes. Total Markets & Securities Services revenues increased 2% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 5%, reflecting a strong performance in rates and currencies last year. However, spread products revenues were up from the prior year as clients search for yield in this low rate environment, with steady demand across flow and structured products. Equities revenues were up 26% versus last year, driven by cash equities, derivatives and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. And finally, in Securities Services, revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and roughly flat in constant dollars. Here, we saw good growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in deposits, assets under custody and settlement volumes, offset by lower spreads. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 7. While we are still seeing the impact of the pandemic and high payment rates on revenues, consumer spending continues to improve and credit remains healthy, pointing to a recovery as we move through the year. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.8 billion, up significantly from last year, primarily driven by improved credit costs. Revenues declined 15% as lower card balances and lower interest rates across all 3 regions were partially offset by continued strong deposit growth and momentum in wealth management. Expenses decreased 1% as efficiency savings and lower volume-related costs were partially offset by investments. Credit costs decreased significantly driven by an ACL reserve release in all 3 regions and lower net credit losses. The release this quarter primarily reflected lower volumes as well as improvements in the macro outlook. And GCB delivered a 25% return on allocated capital. Slide 8 shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. First quarter revenues were down 15% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues. Branded cards revenues were down 11%, reflecting a 15% decline in average loans as clients are using the liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt. Retail Services revenues were down 26%, reflecting higher partner payments as well as lower average loans. Net interest revenues were down 18% as average loans declined by 13% on higher payment rates. Higher partner payments drove the remainder of the revenue decline versus last year, reflecting the impact of lower forecasted losses and, therefore, higher income sharing. Looking more broadly on our cards businesses, we're continuing to see a recovery in sales activity. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were unchanged year-over-year, but essential spend was up 12%, and we are starting to see the recovery in areas like travel and dining. And in Retail Services, purchase sales grew 4%. So purchase sales are improving slightly faster than our prior expectations. And with the vaccine rollout, this should support a further recovery in discretionary spend. The bigger impact on loans is from the high payment rates. This is creating revenue pressure, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. So the good news is that we're seeing the recovery in spend, which should continue, and our credit portfolio is proving to be quite resilient. We are now focused on loan and revenue recovery through driving spend activity, reentering the market for new account acquisitions, and investing in lending capabilities and new value propositions. Turning to Retail Banking. Revenues were down 8% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 22%, including 30% growth in checking. And AUMs were up 32%. We're also continuing to broaden our digital capabilities to extend from deposits to wealth management to mortgage lending. As Jane mentioned, we're committed to the franchise, and all of this gives us confidence in our ability to scale our U.S. retail bank with a digitally led, client-centric approach supported by light physical expansion in new markets over time. On Slide 9, we show the results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. In Asia, revenues declined 12% year-over-year in the first quarter. We continue to see good momentum in wealth management as investment revenues grew 22% with a 14% increase in Citigold clients and 13% growth in net new money. And the numbers are meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the 4 global wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 13%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Card revenues remained under pressure year-over-year, with purchase sales down 5% and average loans down 13%, given a continued significant impact on travel in the region. However, we are seeing some signs of a recovery, with the pickup in new card acquisitions and purchase sales year-over-year in the month of March. Turning to Latin America. Total consumer revenues declined 16% year-over-year. Similar to other regions, we saw good growth in deposits and assets under management in Mexico this quarter, with average balances up 9% and AUMs up 17%. However, deposit spreads remained under pressure and lending volumes continue to decline given the macro environment. Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. And so peak losses may not occur until late 2022, depending on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. By contrast, in both Mexico and Asia, we saw a peak in credit losses in the first quarter of 2021. This was expected driven by the impact of customer accounts rolling off relief programs. The impact was pronounced in Mexico, with a peak NCL rate of over 10%, as we saw most customers roll off the relief programs at the end of the third quarter of last year. Excluding those accounts that participated in relief programs, our credit trends in both Mexico and Asia remain stable. And you can see improvement this quarter in delinquency rates. Slide 11 shows the results for Corporate/Other. Revenues were roughly flat in dollar terms as the impact of lower rates was offset by the absence of marks versus the prior year as well as some episodic gains this quarter. Expenses were down 1% as investments in infrastructure, risk and controls were roughly offset by the allocation of certain costs to the businesses. This change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level. And given it was immaterial, we have not reflected the change retrospectively. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, the pretax loss was $231 million this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $500 million for the remainder of 2021, although with some variation quarter-to-quarter. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends. In constant dollars, total net interest revenue of $10.2 billion this quarter declined $1.4 billion year-over-year, reflecting the impact of lower rates and lower loan balances as well as the impact of 1 fewer day versus last year, partially offset by slightly higher trading-related NIR. Sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize and, excluding the impact of 2 fewer days in the quarter, was roughly flat to the fourth quarter. And net interest margin declined 5 basis points, reflecting lower net interest revenues, partially offset by treasury actions and balance sheet optimization. Turning to noninterest revenues. In the first quarter, non-NIR declined slightly to just over $9 billion, predominantly driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges offsetting strong Investment Banking revenues. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics, which, as Jane mentioned, remained strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio remained 11.7% as net income was roughly offset by buybacks and dividends, along with the impact of OCI and an increase in risk-weighted assets. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $2.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $1.6 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 7%, and our tangible book value per share grew by 5% to $75.50, driven by net income. Before we move to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. First, our full year top line outlook has improved since last quarter. At that time, coming off the performance of 2020, we had expected industry wallets to return closer to the 2019 levels this year. Given the strong start to the year as well as the increasingly positive signs of a recovery ahead, we now believe wallets will be somewhat higher relative to 2019. Meanwhile, our outlook for net interest revenues is unchanged, and we continue to expect a decline in net interest revenues of somewhere between $1 billion to $2 billion, with stabilization continuing into the second quarter and an improvement in the back half. Taken together, this suggests revenues down in the mid single-digit range, better than our prior guidance for a mid- to high single-digit range decline. Second, on the expense side, we continue to expect full year expenses to increase in the range of 2% to 3%, mostly driven by investments related to our transformation agenda. In addition, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I mentioned earlier, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. Finally, on cost of credit, we continue to have an overall favorable outlook with regard to credit performance. And depending on the macroeconomic outlook, we could see further reserve releases, although given the size of the reserve release this quarter, we would not expect to see the same magnitude of ACL release going forward. With that, Jane and I are happy to take any questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Jane, I wanted to ask you a bit of a strategic question. Just for some more color on this idea that the investments you're making in the risk and controls will also help advance your goal of modernizing Citi's technology for the benefit of customers. Could you elaborate on that a little bit? And maybe give us some examples of where you've seen technology gaps as you've done your listening tour across the company. Jane Fraser : Thank you very much, John. So, it's fascinating at the moment. I have a chance to go and talk to the CEOs of banks who are our clients all around the world and all of us talk about the same thing, which is there's a major transformation that's going on, a digital transformation in the industry. And so, as we look at the consent order and the transformation, the transformation we're going through is much broader than just the consent orders, although they're obviously a very critical component of it. And so as we look at the -- as we look at the investments we're making, I look at the ones that we're making in our infrastructure, in our data as very much linked into a strategic need, as well as what's being required and asked of us from the consent orders. So I gave you one of the examples just earlier. But data would be an obvious example of this, where investment that we make in the quality of our data will have a big impact for our shareholders in terms of driving revenues, improving our client experience in making faster decision-making on risk or on business decisions as well as making sure that the data that we do have is properly governed from a safety and soundness perspective. So many of the investments we've got at the moment are really the strategy and transformation work coming together as it is for many banks. John McDonald : Okay. And then a quick follow-up on that for Mark. Mark, how should investors think about the multiyear cost of this transformation? Obviously, you've given us some sense of what's embedded to get to your expense guidance for this year of up 2% to 3%, but is this something that does get spread out over multiple years? It doesn't sound like an easy or a quick project. Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks, John. As Jane has referenced, it is, and I've referenced in the past, it is a multiyear effort, and we've been working very diligently on identifying the gaps that we have and identifying the root causes. And as Jane has mentioned, we're working very aggressively on constructing the plans to move towards more comprehensive execution, but those plans have to come together, and we're still working through that. And as you've mentioned, I've been very clear as we develop the information as to what we can expect in the way of headwinds, that 2% to 3% this year, $1 billion in the prior year. And as we as we bring those plans together, I'll continue to share openly what our best estimates are for how the expenses continue to evolve. What I would say, John, is that, and I say this a lot, I guess, these are investments. As Jane mentioned, there are benefits that we expect from them. The data was a great example as to how we leverage that with our clients but also how getting that quality data in and not having to rework it and reconcile it, et cetera, et cetera, saves us on the operating cost as well. And I highlight that because as we make more investments, we will undoubtedly continue to seek out productivity opportunities that move to offset those. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : I guess a simple one that's probably not so simple to answer is if there's not this -- there's not a huge revenue or earnings impact from divesting the 13 markets, but there is a lot of like resources and bandwidth freed up. I guess my question is, what do you do with the capital? Just conceptual, meaning everyone has been looking to you for a huge capital return story, which you are. But putting the consent order aside, how do you think about using that capital offensively to augment the businesses that you're doubling down on? Mark Mason : Sure. Look, I think this is one of the reasons why it's so important that we're doing a refresh that Jane has described. It allows us to very clearly focus on the parts of the franchise where we think we have a significant competitive advantage. And as Jane has mentioned, those are going to be the parts of the franchise where we allocate more resources, both in the way of expense dollars and investments, but also in the way of capital allocation so that we can capture the growth that we see with client opportunities there. And after that, after kind of ensuring that we're capturing those opportunities that deliver returns, that are consistent with our objective of narrowing the gap to peers, then we want to, obviously return excess capital to shareholders as we've been doing. So that's the way we think about it. First, let's lead with what is the strategy. Second, let's make sure that strategy is rooted in growth opportunities and commensurate returns that make sense for us. Let's allocate capital there to take advantage of that. And then what's left, let's return it to shareholders. Jane Fraser : Yes. And I would just jump in on this one as well. I mean I've been on a great listening tour with our investors and hearing their perspectives, and I'm very clear around our priorities, which is closing the return gap with all our peers, making sure that we put a strategy in place that has the investment profile as well as the different actions to do so. And as Mark said, this is our #1 priority. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. I'd love to follow up on just one piece. So on that front, wealth is definitely something that sets a high-return profile. You mentioned you're doubling down. I'd love to discuss, as a combined entity, what metrics do you think we'll be looking at to determine success? What are the important linkages with the other businesses that can be maximized better? What systems and product platforms do you need to add to get to these higher aspirations? Jane Fraser : I better be careful because I could talk for hours on this one. I think we're incredibly well positioned in wealth. Mike gave you -- Mark gave you some of the visibility into the size and scale of the business today. When I look at it, we've got a phenomenal brand name, an aspirational one, in the wealth space, particularly in Asia, but around the world. We have our commercial bank which operates in 30 different geographies around the world and is where a lot of the wealth is being created. So we have relationships and are helping with the actual wealth generation and source of wealth from many of our clients as well as obviously in ICG. We've got a top-tier institutional platform and capability. And we've got our presence very well established in these major wealth hubs around the world. So I do feel we're incredibly well positioned when we can bring these different assets and capabilities into a single platform. So the investments that we've already begun making is putting a single wealth platform organization in place. We made the announcement yesterday around the leadership, you'd have seen that. We've started investing in growing our relationship managers and FAs around the world and really bringing together the best of the firm. And I expect, as we work on the technology plan, we'll have some different tech stack lined up against that, too. So Jim O'Donnell, putting the plans together right now, but we see this as a tremendous opportunity, and you'll be able to measure us and hold us to account for this in terms of the returns that we generate, the growth in the fee income and continuing to steadily capture share in the years ahead. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with Bank of America. Erika Najarian : Yes, just a follow-up on Glenn's question. So Jane, you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were now refocusing on consumer businesses where you have scale, and that's the U.S. and Mexico. And I guess we're wondering, I'm sure you're still in the middle of your strategic review, what is your vision for the Citi consumer franchise in the U.S.? And as we move past a world where hopefully your multiple is more reflective of your ROE potential and you're past the consent order, would you entertain inorganic opportunities for market share growth in the United States? Jane Fraser : Erika, great question and certainly what I have heard loud and clear from many of our investors as well as we've been talking with them. Look, the U.S. is our home market. We have to get it right. It's a great franchise in terms of brand, the client base that we have around the country. We certainly see upside potential in wealth, as we've been talking about. We have a large cards business where the pandemic has accelerated the cross-sale of our broader banking proposition. And I think the broader theme of digitization, we have very high-quality clients in and out of footprint. And they've been very digitally engaged, and that's only increased. 50% of the new accounts this quarter in the retail bank were acquired digitally and about 75% of our clients, for example, are digitally engaged already. And we have tremendous partnerships. So I think we've got some -- we've got terrific assets and building blocks. But as you said, the work is going on right now on the strategy refresh. And we're looking forward to coming back to you in reasonably short order when we've done the work and have the plan on what actions we will take. We're looking longer run. And for now, partnerships are going to be very important. But we'd love to do inorganic moves if they make sense for our shareholders and for us further down the line. But at the moment, we'll focus on partnerships. Erika Najarian : And my second question is with Mark. Is this probably partially -- how you laid out guidance probably partially answers this question. But investors seem to believe that there could be upside to revenue for banks, whether it's continued expansion of wallet in your ICG business or in more traditional NIR sources. And I'm wondering -- it's a 2-part question. One, if we get a better revenue from here, could you still achieve the 2% to 3% expense target? And as a follow-up, on the expenses that would be carved out from those exits, we heard from one of your peers that if you exclude overhead or expenses allocated to businesses exited, we would see a sort of a net expense saves of about 75% to 80% of identified expenses. And I'm wondering if that's the right ratio to think about those 13 markets that you're exiting. Mark Mason : Sure. Thank you. So the first thing, just in terms of revenue, I did speak to this in the guidance. And what I referenced was, I talked about in the last quarter, the normalization of the markets' wallets and what we're seeing just at the on start of this year and the strong start that Jane referenced is that while I do expect there'll be some normalization, I would expect at this point that the market wallets will be above the 2019 levels. And so we do think that, that presents some upside. I talked about the -- and that's what kind of feeds in part the down mid-single-digit guidance that I gave for total revenues. You're right with the steepening of the curve. That does present some opportunities. We've got dry powder to put liquidity to work. And we've done some of that, but we have more dry powder to do that. With that said, as I mentioned earlier, we are seeing higher payment rates from the consumer business that offsets some of that potential upside. And I did describe the NIR in the way of a range, down $1 billion to $2 billion. And so that range gives you some sense for the ability or the opportunity if we were to capture more of that upside. In terms of the expenses, two things. One, you mentioned relative to revenues. And the answer is that if wallets continue to perform even stronger or the recovery is even more significant on the lending side or consumer side or ICG side for that matter, then that will come with higher expenses, transaction expenses, compensation expenses. But I think everyone would agree that, that would be good cholesterol. And so we'll see how that plays out. Obviously, I did mention episodic costs associated with the exits. What I'd say about that is -- and your point around allocations, both Jane and I have deep experience at this. I have experience from Citi Holdings and being part of that team and ultimately running Citi Holdings. Jane has run Latin America. Both of those parts of the franchise historically have exited countries, and we have both been keenly focused on ensuring that we get as much of the stranded costs associated with exits out of the organization in the past. And you can rest assure that, that would be the same type of focus we put to these exits. So that's kind of the view there. I don't have a ratio that I'd want to share at this point. But please know that, that will be a focal point for us in order to ensure that we get the most value out of this decision. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matthew O'Connor: I know this is a tough question to answer, but as we think about the timing of the consent orders, should we think about the ones that came out in October of last year as essentially restarting the clock? Or since some of them was going on for several years and the Fed and OCC acknowledged that you've made progress, maybe don't think about it as a resetting the clock. And the reason I'm asking is, if we look at other consent orders in the industry, it tends to take several years, 3, 4, 5 years. And it's a little bit trickier with you guys because, again, it's not like you're starting from scratch. But I was wondering if there's anything you could comment with respect to the timing and how I frame that. Mark Mason : Yes, sure. Why don't I start and then, Jane, you may have some thoughts on it as well. What I'd say is, look, this is -- the consent order was clear in its way of directives in areas that we need to focus. As Jane has described, we're looking at this, frankly, a little bit broader. We're looking at this as a transformation. And it will take -- it is a multiyear effort that is underway here. Yes, there are some things that you heard us referenced that we had started even before the order. There were a number of remediation efforts that were underway in some of the areas that are referenced in the order. We're leveraging the work that we had started already. But candidly, what's different about this transformation versus a remediation is that we're looking at this end-to-end as opposed to a very narrow or silo or tactical approach to an issue that's identified. And in order to do that, you do have to pause for a second, take a step back and look at things on the front end of a process where things come into our systems and understand how you can improve those processes, the technology that support them, the governance around that. I highlight that because your answer is -- your question is a tough question. There's some of it that we will keep accelerating, but we want to make sure that we do that in a broader context so that we get it right. And that's what's really important to us. Jane, anything you want to add to that? Jane Fraser : No, I think you said it very well, Mark. Remediation is tactical. Transformation is more strategic and much more fundamental, and that's what we're doing. We take a soup to nuts approach. We're looking at the target states we want to get to, making sure that we've got real excellence in what we do. And that is the focus. So we're looking forward rather than looking backwards. Matthew O'Connor: And then just a follow-up there. Like isn't the reality that you need to kind of fix the regulatory issues so that you can accomplish some of the things that you want in the transformation, right? Because I think your ability to do deals, ability to open branches, there's just a lot of restrictions. So I think it's good to hear about like the long-term vision. But you kind of need to get the house in order first, right, before you can accomplish some of those things? Or can you do both at the same time? Jane Fraser : Oh, you can -- you absolutely do both at the same time, and that's what we're very focused on. As I say, the transformation and the -- the work on the transformation, the strategy in many ways go hand-in-hand and are getting us to the same goal, which is make sure we're excellent for our investors, for our clients as well as for our regulators and the safety and soundness agenda. So the two go very much hand-in-hand. Risk and controls are clearly important, particularly in a digital world, and we need them to be at a very high standard to operate as one of the world's most significant financial institutions. That's the intention as is the intention to make sure our operations are the same. So one in the same goal here. Mark Mason : To your point, Jane, exiting these 13 countries, that simplifies the organization, right? Creating Citi Global Wealth and bringing what was the private bank and our wealth organization and consumer together allows for us to come up with an investment platform, a unified investment platform. That simplifies the organization, makes it easier to have controls in place around those processes. So Jane is exactly right, the strategy is aligned with the transformation that's underway in many ways. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Saul Martinez with UBS. Saul Martinez : I have a bit of a hodge-podge of questions related to your strategic refresh. So first, you gave a lot of color on the financial metrics of the 13 exit markets. But do you also happen to have what the reserves are on the balance sheet that could be released over time in those countries? Second, time horizon. I know you indicated, Mark, that you'll give us more detail as it presents itself. But just any sort of guidance on the time horizon, are we looking at quarters? Or is this going to play out over a number of years? Just any guideposts. And then I guess thirdly, I'll just finish up. Maybe more importantly, Banamex, any -- how are you thinking about Banamex in the context of your strategy refresh? I mean it certainly is not a subscale business, but Mexico does have some macro challenges, as you guys have highlighted, and a government that has very heterodox views, policy views on a whole host of things. So just any thoughts on how you're thinking about Banamex right now. Mark Mason : Jane, you want to start? And then I can piggyback on that. Jane Fraser : Yes, so in terms of -- why don't we go start off with timing and... Mark Mason : Yes, and then I'll take the reserver. Jane Fraser : Yes, I can chuck the reserve one over to you, Mark. So in terms of timing, look, we're already getting going, there's no dillydallying here. What we're looking at doing is we've begun the work. The actions are underway in several markets. We'll look to complete the exits in a timely fashion and we expect to be out in some markets this quarter. Equally, this is -- we're going to be thoughtful about who the buyers are and the -- how we do this and the value that we create for shareholders in the process. So while there is urgency on action, we're going to make sure that this is a good move for our shareholders and act appropriately. And the timing is going to be driven by regulatory approvals in different geographies. So as Mark said, as we know more, we'll update you on the process, but we've been very transparent about what we're intending to do. And then in terms of Mexico, look, Mexico is a scaled franchise. When I compare Mexico to our Asian consumer franchises, they really benefit from their scale. The returns are good. And there's a lot of upside potential there. The investments in digitization have really paid off. So while the country is going through a very challenging time at the moment, there's a lot to like in the franchise over the longer term. And we'll give you a better sense of the strategy there as we carry on the strategy refresh work. But a lot to like. Mark, do you want to cover the reserves? Yes. Mark Mason : Yes. So let me just -- I guess I'll make a couple of comments and I don't think I'm going to get into a specific reserve number, so apologies for that. But what I will say is, as you see what we shared on the page that it's roughly breakeven in 2020, and we all recognize in 2020 there were significant reserves established in light of the pandemic, what I'd say is if we would look at 2019, which would have been a more normalized year, the EBIT associated with the 13 markets would have been a little bit under $1 billion or so. And so it gives you some sense for how the build in reserves, at least to some extent, has impacted what the financials are that we've shared here. And again, as we go through these transactions, we'll be appropriately transparent with the impact that we see from them. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Michael Mayo : Jane, so about -- what are you, 45 days in the job, and you announced the asset disposition, so I guess you're not wasting any time. As you think about these assets dispositions or future dispositions, how do you -- what lens do you use? Because you can consider returns. You can consider growth. You can consider synergies with the rest of the firm. You could potentially consider regulatory benefits as it relates to consent order. Do you get credit for simplifying less systems to resolve? Or what other measures do you use? I note that the -- it looks like the exit of the 13 consumer markets, those were capital hogs. So I can't imagine the returns were very good. But there's a lot of parameters you can look at. What lens do you use? Jane Fraser : So interesting question, Mike. And frankly, I look at it in terms of what we want to be, not what we don't, because what you don't want to be kind of falls out a bit pretty easily. So the main consideration we have is how do we close the return gap with our peers and make sure that the businesses we're in that can win. And we're very disciplined about going back to those principles I laid out at the very beginning and we talked about back in January, we've been using this consistently in the strategy refresh work. So the first thing we're looking at is, is this sector or is this client segment or is this business? Does it have attractive dynamics as we look out over the medium and long term? And importantly, within those dynamics, can we win? Does this make -- can we be well positioned in this? And I think we're certainly seeing in the world of financial services today that scale is obviously a very important consideration. So the corollary of that is if you don't have scale, that's usually a disadvantage. We look at it in terms of connectivity. I think it's very, very important that we have synergies across our major platforms and our client segments. And you'll hear us talking about that a lot more going forward and what are some of the metrics that we'll look at to demonstrate that we're really capturing those synergies. We look at fees and returns. So therefore, if it's capital, is it generating returns? Are we getting the growth? We're efficient on the fee revenues relative to what Mark and I would like to be. So that becomes a consideration. And then does it really fit with the strategic identity that we have for Citi and we're working on as part of the refresh? If it's yes, then this is a candidate for investment, laying out what the strategy is. If it's not, it's the opposite. And dispositions, we're always going to take into time -- into consideration timing. As I said in the last question, there's no fire sales here. We are going to be thoughtful on how we ensure we generate value for shareholders on the exit at the potential value of partnerships with the potential buyers, et cetera and how best can we monetize and generate value as we do this. So in many ways, it's a little bit of all of the above on your list, but we kind of -- we start in the opposite place, if you know what I mean. What are we going to be, and then focus on making sure that we generate the greatest value from that. And the other decisions kind of fall out of it pretty quickly. And I think you can see that being demonstrated in the decisions we made on both why wealth and the hubs that we're investing in, in Asia and EMEA, but then equally, the other decisions on the remaining 13 markets on consumer being the exit. Michael Mayo : And then one follow-up. It is early, but do you have a sense of what sort of return you'd ultimately like to achieve? And ultimately, what is the identity that you would like to have for Citigroup? Who is Citigroup? What's your -- what's your elevator summary, elevator pitch? Jane Fraser : Citigroup is fabulous, Mike. When -- again, when I go back to what have our investors been talking to me about, the areas that -- as we've been going around and listening to them, they want us to have -- they want us to close the gap of the returns with our peers. I think Mark's given some indication. I mean as we see a more normal -- when we see a normalized rate environment, we get the strategy there, a mid-tier range seems reasonable, but I would certainly add and let us do the work, because I want to make sure that we have a very thoughtful strategy and we've got clarity around it. And when you ask us about what is Citi going to be, we'll be back to you with, again, a lot more precision and clarity around it. But I think you can see from some of the moves that we've got, we want to be -- we really want to be excellent. And that's not just in terms of how we serve our clients, many of whom are very -- have global needs, and there's a lot of consistency around that. But also, I would say what Citi is, I want the word excellent to be one that is used about us in our operations, in our culture, in our accountability and in what we do. And so that's the word you'll hear from me a lot, and that's the standard I'm holding myself and the firm to. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So I wanted to start off with a question. Just looking at the strategic actions that you guys had taken, if I think back to 2014, right, and what was outlined then, Jane, was actually pretty similar in terms of the profitability profile of the businesses that you are exiting, the capital benefits that were ultimately going to be reaped. And it was at least difficult to see some of those benefits if I look at how the profitability profile has changed. So I guess from your point of view, having been at the firm when that was undertaken, what lessons did you learn from that process? And are there any differences in the approach that you might take this goal around to potentially drive maybe more conspicuous or clear benefits to the bottom line? Jane Fraser : So sorry, just in terms -- I just want to make sure I'm understanding the question, you're asking in terms of the benefits of digitization? Steven Chubak : Not in digitization, just if I think back to the exits, there were strategic actions that you had pursued in 2014, exiting a handful of markets to try to optimize that global consumer footprint. And it was very similar in terms of the disclosure around the exit markets were barely profitable, there were capital benefits that were going to be reaped. But ultimately, we didn't see those benefits at least translate into bottom line impacts. And curious if you could just speak to some of the learnings from that experience and what approach you might take a bit differently. Jane Fraser : Yes. When I look at the -- in LatAm, the benefits we got were pretty tremendous. So I think, first of all, we were able to very much focus on our strengths in our institutional franchise. We were able to make sure that we had truly world-class talent. We invested in our technology and platforms. We were very focused on that client base of the multinationals we serve there, in particular, in the investor base, engaged in Latin America. And we drove the returns up from teenagers to mid-20s in a pretty short period of time. We rose up the rankings in the banking side and really solidified our leadership on the institutional front. I'd also say we simplified the management structure as well in the region and gained quite a lot of benefits from simplification that hit the bottom line as well. So I'd say my experience has been one in which there's real benefit from focus. You get better at the businesses that you're in. You get strong talent and you're able to bring more focused talent. That's what's different. And you get -- you're able to really get the linkages across the different businesses and hone in on them. Mark, I don't think -- I don't know if you've got anything else to add because you and I are both in these journeys together. Mark Mason : Yes, Jane, I think you captured it well. The only thing I'd emphasize in terms of kind of what's different now as we go at this is -- or the last couple of points you made, which is that keen focus on making sure that you've got -- that we've got the right talent in the right places as we go through this strategy refresh and ensuring that the org structure supports that. Again, I go back to the wealth example and the resetting of that org structure. You can point to the idea of moving commercial into ICG to ensure that you got that focus against that strategy and you can really capture the linkages across the firm. And then the last piece is the focused investment. We're moving away from kind of a spreading of the investments and really wanting to focus them on where we think the biggest growth opportunities are and where the highest returns are. But I think you captured it all, Jane. Steven Chubak : No, that's great color. And just for my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the TTS business. It's a really strong franchise and like the underlying balance growth historically has been quite strong and relatively steady-eddie. In more recent quarters, there's been some pressure. It feels like a lot of that's actually NII- or rate-related. But I was hoping to give some perspective on what are some of the underlying trends that you're seeing in that business. What's your outlook at least from here and now that most of the rate pressure at least should be fully absorbed or reflected in the run rate? Mark Mason : Yes, sure, why don't I start? And then Jane, you can add on as you'd like in terms of some of the client perspective. But look, the revenues, you're right, were down about 10% year-over-year on an ex FX basis. And you hit it right on the head. I mean, the low rate environment that we've been in is a very big driver in what we've seen in the aggregate TTS revenues now. Now we have seen higher deposit volumes, and that obviously plays through with that impact. What I would say in terms of your broader question, what we look at is, one, the engagement that we have with clients. And we have very meaningful, significant engagement with clients throughout the entire crisis that we've been managing through. And that engagement kind of plays through. And the increase in number of accounts, digital accounts that we've opened for them, really kind of reinforcing some of the investments that we've been making in onboarding and enhancing -- and in enhancing our digital capability, that engagement plays through in the clearing activity and cross-border transactions that we've seen, which are both up 6% and 7% over the past 12 months. So good solid underlying drivers. While we do see pressure on commercial card activity, fee revenues ex commercial card activity has been good. And frankly, as we see the economy recover and we look at some of the GDP forecast and that starts to play out, we would expect to see the business activity turn in a way that starts to play through the top line. But we see again, very, very strong continued engagement with our clients and with how they're evolving their own strategies. And the last example I'd mention is many of our clients with the acceleration of digitization are focused on business-to-consumer activity. And that's an important area of growth. And we're part of that dialogue. We're part of creating that solution as it relates to their business model or business models. Jane, I don't know if there's anything you want to add to that. Jane Fraser : Yes. You're going to hear quite a lot more about our TTS business and the services platform it represents for so many of our clients around the world. The client -- in my discussion with clients over the last few months, they love our TTS platform. More than that, they depend upon it. It is strategic for them, the different services, the data it represents, the other dimensions of it. And so the growth that we're going to see from this next year is, I think it's going to be very material. You'll hear us also talk more about the commercial bank going forward as well because the mid-market clients and the born digital clients are ones who use our TTS platform and their capabilities and services around it to also themselves start growing internationally and it becomes a core part of them. So this is -- we've got more to grow with our existing clients. We've got a lot of new clients that are coming on board this. And this is going to be an exciting part of the story going forward and the underlying opportunities here separate to the rates environment. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Jane, Mark, I was wondering if I could ask you just about global recovery and pacing. As you look through the supplement, you see different growth rates when you look -- whether you look at loans, cards or deposits at different paces and as the currency translation impacts as well, of course. But just how would you help us understand, as you look forward to revenue stabilization over time, just how do you see the global customer base recovering in terms of pacing, U.S., non-U.S.? And if you can juxtapose that to any extent in the wholesale side, that would be great as well. Jane Fraser : Yes. I'll kick off with a little bit more on the macro side. Mark will jump in on some of the other important dimensions for ourselves. Look, it's asynchronous growth out there is what we're seeing. I think you're seeing that U.S. and China is certainly leading the recovery with Asia. Europe is delayed, but certainly not derailed. And parts of the emerging markets are struggling. So you do see a different picture in different parts of the world. And as I think you heard from me at the beginning of the call, we're pretty optimistic about the U.S. in particular over the next few years. There's a lot of unspent savings out there with consumers. Huge amount of liquidity in the market. Corporate balance sheets are broadly healthy. And then you've also got a lot of dynamism from digitization that's changing consumer behaviors and driving investment. So overall, it's certainly a very improved outlook around the world, but it is an asynchronous one. And we're seeing, as Mark had talked about, strong pipelines, a lot of client engagement, a lot of client activity. But Mark, why don't I turn to you on how you're seeing some of this translate? Mark Mason : Yes. Let me make a -- I guess I'll make a couple of comments. One, we are seeing continued pressure on our consumer business, right? So we talked about loan volumes being down, particularly in Branded Cards, almost 15% or 15%. Retail Services average loans, down 13%. What I would say is we are seeing signs of the recovery. And while those loans are down, payment rates remain high. That helps from a cost of credit point of view. And purchase sales are starting to show some good signs. So Branded Cards purchase sales were flat year-over-year. The Retail Services purchase sales were up 4% year-over-year. And the outlook is positive in terms of kind of GDP and unemployment. And so the stimulus that's out there still has to play out in North America. But we are optimistic that consumer spending trends look like they're going to go favorable. And that will undoubtedly help the forecast that I spoke to, which is recovery in NIR and some loan activity towards the back half of the year. On the corporate ICG side, similarly, we're certainly seeing good signs as it relates to the markets activity, we've talked about that, and that's continued since last year. But when I think about even ICG loans, we've seen loan activity in the private bank. We've seen loan activity in parts of markets. And so those are good. And loan activity as it relates to trade, which is -- which are all good signs of the recovery that we're all marching towards. Ken Usdin : Yes. And one follow-up on card, Mark. You had mentioned in your prepared remarks about how we knew that we would get the bounce in card losses. But you mentioned generically that card losses would still remain pretty low. Any way of helping us kind of understand just how you expect card losses to traject overall? Mark Mason : Yes. Let me mention a couple of things on that. So one is -- let's take it in pieces. So Latin America, on the chart on Slide 10, big jump in the -- in the quarter, almost 11% of NCLs. But again, that is a byproduct of customers coming off of the relief program in the third quarter. And as we look at the delinquency buckets, we're not seeing meaningful signs of increases in those buckets. And that gives us comfort in the case of Latin America that we've reached the peak there. Similarly for other regions, there are no signs in the delinquency bucket to suggest that we're going to see big increases in our NCLs. And in fact, in North America, what you heard me say is that we likely would not see that until late in 2022. And so it's the payment rates that we're seeing. It's the low activity as it relates to the delinquency buckets. It's obviously the impact of stimulus playing through all of that, that give us some comfort at this stage that we're not likely to see a pop in NCL certainly in 2021. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Kleinhanzl with KBW. Brian Kleinhanzl : So yes, I have two questions. Maybe first on the corporate lending. Balances there were down 30% year-on-year. I'm just trying to get a sense of how much of that is driven by client demand versus overall risk appetite. Maybe it's -- just trying to see if you get more risk appetite that those loan balances could come back sooner. Mark Mason : Yes. I mean, look, as you know, we're managing through this crisis. But if you look back to early last year and the second quarter last year, this was about ensuring that clients had an appropriate level of liquidity. And that has continued to happen, as you see in our deposit growth, as you've heard others mention, as you've seen monetary action there. Our corporate clients have lots of liquidity by and large. And they have a -- many of the clients we serve have the option of how they want to access the market for that liquidity. And you saw that in some of the ECM, DCM activity through the balance of last year and even some of it continuing. So long-winded way of saying it is -- this is a client-driven business. This is about client demand. And so it's not a question of risk appetite. Risk appetite is always important. We operate inside of our risk appetite framework always. But the dynamic that you're seeing here is about client demand. Brian Kleinhanzl : Okay. And the second question on cards. And I heard you desire to grow new card accounts. Can you maybe just go into a little bit deeper on the strategy behind that? Is it more going back to promotional balances and opening up that back again? Or how you're going to grow those new card accounts? Mark Mason : Yes. Again, the card dynamic here is about ensuring that we get the timing right as it relates to market reentry, right? And so obviously coming into this, we wanted to be very thoughtful about how we managed our risk and we tightened risk criteria in order to ensure that we would manage responsibly through this pandemic. And now as we sit here and see all the signs of recovery that you've heard us mention, it's about a responsible reopening, right, and ensuring that we're targeting the customers that we want longer term, the existing customers that we're opening line availability to them where that makes sense, in the case of our Retail Services that we are pursuing new account acquisitions both there as well as in Branded Cards. So it's about that reentry strategy and consistent with the target market customer that you've heard us describe before, which tends to be of a higher quality. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chris Kotowski with Oppenheimer. Chris Kotowski : My question is on the exit markets, and in particular on the markets in the Pacific Rim, are there operational linkages between the operations in all those countries that would make those companies better to sell as a unit to one of the pan national companies? Or is it very modular and could be pulled apart in each country sold to the highest bidder? And then secondly, I was wondering also, do you -- do the Citi Branded Cards go with these dispositions? Or do you maintain that separately and continues to try to solicit and grow the card base? Jane Fraser : Chris, so in terms of the exit markets, I'd say it's probably a tad early to speculate on the buyers. These are fabulous franchises, and we've got really tremendous talent, tremendous capabilities there in the individual markets. And so we expect to get a lot of interest. But as to who and what, I'm certainly not going to speculate yet. When you ask about operational linkages, I mean this is something, as Mark said, he and I have gone through quite a few divestitures in different geographies. And we are well skilled at how to make sure that we can separate out the consumer franchises and then invest in the capabilities for the ICG businesses. It's not been a problem in any of the divestitures that we've done, which were many. I think it was about 11 or 12 across Latin America and others before. So our team is good at this. It's not going to be an issue. And in fact, it will enable us, as we said, to target our investments more into the institutional platforms and wealth in the hubs, as we talked about. And then in terms of Branded Cards, do Branded Cards go as part of the sale? Yes is the very simple answer to that one. Transaction services, of course, remains an important part of the franchises in these 13 geographies. And so our capabilities in commercial cards and our capabilities and payments, et cetera, for the GTS side of the business remain intact and will be invested in. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, can you share with us -- many of us are trying to take a look at what your bank and your peers will look like when we get back to some sort of normality were beyond the pandemic. And one of the areas of focus is loan loss reserves since, as you and your peers said, you built them up dramatically. Now you're drawing them down, of course. Can you share with us -- I think if I recall back on day 1, January '20, when the new CECL rules came into place, your loan loss reserve to loans was about 2.6%. And I think today, it's about 3.3%. Can you give us some color of directionally do you think you could get there? I know there's a lot of moving parts in change of mix of loans and different economic outlooks. But the economy looks a heck a lot better in the next 12 months than it did prepandemic and when you guys all did the day 1 reserves. And that was, of course, we didn't know the pandemic was coming back then, of course. Mark Mason : Yes. Yes. It's a really tough question to answer because there's so many moving pieces that come into play here. So while we sit at 3.3%, as you pointed out, the macro environment continues to improve, this is based on an outlook. And as those economic variables change, whether it be U.S. unemployment or GDP, but also as our balances change, so as we continue to reenter the market, as I kind of suggested in my other response, we're going to start growing balances and we're going to start -- and that's going to impact the mix of balances that we have. And so all of those factors on top of, in our case, how the probability and severity of a downside continues to morph, become important considerations in not only answering your question, but also how we think about future reserve releases. And so I'm not trying to dodge your questions at all, but it is a question that will be a kind of a byproduct of how we get to some sense of normalcy and how the portfolio continues to evolve. Gerard Cassidy : Got it. No, I completely understood. And Jane, I may have missed this, but I obviously sense the excitement in your voice about the new refresh on the strategy. How long -- if you have to sit back, is this a 3-, 5-year project? Any idea of the -- how long it will take to get Citi to the place where you wanted to go to? Jane Fraser : That's an interesting question. I mean what we're looking at as we do the strategy refresh work is looking with a long-term perspective for the firm. I don't think it takes us a long time to complete the strategy refresh work, and we'll be looking forward to sharing that with everybody as we go along, as we said. And we get on with execution as soon as it makes sense. So I don't honestly know, as a former consultant, as to whether you're ever done with strategy. This world is highly dynamic. It's a fascinating world. I think part of the excitement is I'm excited about the franchise. I'm excited about the prospects of the firm. I'm also realistic, we've got quite a bit of work to do. And we're very -- Mark and I are very clear on what our priorities are. So I don't think it's going to take us very long to come back to everybody with a clearer view of where we're going. I'm looking forward to doing so and, more than anything, looking forward to getting on with it. And I don't think we're ever done. Mark Mason : I can assure you, Gerard, that Jane is moving all of us with a sense of urgency. And that's the right focus that we should have on the strategy refresh. But Jane, you're absolutely right, strategy doesn't just stop, right? So well said. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Jane, I wanted to get -- understand from you. So you've gone through these exits as you've talked about in Latin America and now you're doing in the consumer bank and that you've announced for Asia now. What do you see as the differences in your consumer franchise in Asia versus Latin America? And pointedly, the investment sales, what is that as a percentage of revenue, for instance, in your Asia consumer bank versus Latin America? That's a little second detail on that. And will that -- will those revenues also go away? So two different questions, 1 a little higher level, but tied to it is this whole investment sales and where do you see that. And implications for your -- because what I'm trying to get is a sense of implications for your private banking revenues, which I guess are different than this investment sales revenue that shows up in the consumer bank. Jane Fraser : Yes, and I think the differences between our Asia consumer franchises and Latin America, Latin America, let's be clear, is our franchise and Citi Banamex only today. And that's a single geography with about 20% market share and a full -- and is a full offering to the consumer as opposed to our franchises in Asia that were a bit of smaller. They're excellent franchises. As you know, they've got a good brand name. They've got terrific card franchises and an affluent client base, but they haven't had the same scale that we have in Mexico. So I do view them as rather different. And in terms of what are there -- I guess the question you're asking is what's the ramification of the divestitures for this -- for our wealth business in Asia. If you look at the individual Asian markets, the domestic capital markets are not that well developed. And so the offshore markets in Hong Kong and Singapore, and indeed in the Middle East and in the states and in London and the like, become very important markets. So the onshore wealth opportunity is usually massively dwarfed by the offshore wealth opportunity. And that's where we feel we're best placed to focus our attention and resources. What I would also say, though, is one of the advantages for Citi is we're not just an investment sales proposition, that we also do have the deposit franchise, the card franchise. We have the capital market platform for sure. We've got the ability to offer our clients tremendous managed investments. The content that we're able to offer, thanks to our ICG franchise, that's really best-in-class. I know it's quite extraordinary in the asset allocation advice. So this is really the capabilities we can provide. The client is very well diversified from lending, banking as well as the investment and the managed investment capital market revenues that you see. So I don't just think of this as investment sales. This is something that we're able to offer that's much more broad in those wealth center hubs. And the offshore is far greater than the onshore opportunity in those 13 markets. And we'll get -- you'll get more guidance on this as we go forward, as Mark said, and as Jim fleshes out the strategy and the plan that we've got. So you can expect to get some more details. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you all for joining today. Please feel free to reach out to Investor Relations if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you again, and have a nice day. Operator : This concludes the first quarter 2021 earnings call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello, and welcome to Citi's Second Quarter 2021 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today's call will be hosted by Elizabeth Lynn, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Lynn, you may begin. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results, capital, and other financial conditions may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including the precautionary statements referenced in our discussion today and those included in our SEC filings, including, without limitation, the Risk Factors section of our 20 Form 10-K. Before we get started, I'd also like to welcome our incoming Head of IR, Jennifer Landis, who will be joining Citi next month and hosting this call beginning in October as I leave the seat to assume a new role within Citi, I'd like to thank you all for your partnership and support over the past few years. With that said, let me turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Liz, and good morning to everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. And first, I'm going to discuss the results of my first full quarter as CEO and then update you on the progress against our strategic priorities. For the quarter, we reported $6.2 billion in net income or $2.85 per share. We continue to benefit from an improving macro environment as evidenced by another significant release of our allowances for credit losses. Indeed, the pace of the macro recovery is exceeding earlier expectations across the globe, and with it comes growing consumer and corporate confidence. And this also came through loud and clear in my conversations with clients over the course of the week I just spent in London. Now clearly, we have to remain mindful of the unevenness in that global recovery due to continued contagion and challenges in vaccine distribution in several parts of the world, but we are optimistic about the momentum ahead and as a result, we deliberately accelerated some of our investments. In our institutional businesses, we saw the expected normalization of fixed income trading compared to the striking volatility of Q2 last year and our equities franchise had a particularly strong quarter. Looking forward, we do expect the volatile markets to be higher than pre-COVID levels. Performance in our Investment Banking franchise remained healthy with good momentum in M&A and a very solid pipeline ahead for the rest of the year. We saw very good progress in our strategies to increase fee revenues with double-digit growth in our ICG fee revenues and specifically over 20% year-over-year fee growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions and Securities Services, and in the private bank. Now, TTS is the backbone of the unique global network we deliver for our clients. And while the business continues to be impacted by lower rates, we particularly like how we are positioned here from a market share perspective as the post-pandemic recovery takes shape. In Consumer Banking, while our loan book and revenues were impacted by the elevated payment rates in cards, spending is well above pre-COVID levels now with a 38% increase in global purchase sales year-over-year. We expect this to translate into loan growth in the second half of the year. And we continue to have good momentum in both deposit growth and AUMs across our consumer franchises. In the U.S., as we discussed, we are investing in our home market as demonstrated by the well-received launch of our innovative Custom Cash Card in June. Internationally, the picture for our consumer business is the budget. So, while there is still the softness in the Mexican economy, in Asia, loan growth returned and that's despite new COVID outbreaks. Turning to capital. For the first two quarters of 2021, we returned close to $7 billion to our shareholders, which was the maximum amount permitted under the Federal Reserve's rules. Going forward, we are committed to returning any excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise. So, while our stress capital buffer increased to 3% as a result of the Fed's recent stress test, that won't impact the common equity Tier 1 target we would be managing to, of approximately 11.5%. We ended the quarter at 11.9% on a standardized basis and have excess capital to return to our shareholders through a healthy dividend and ongoing stock repurchase program. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $77.87, up over 9% from a year ago. Now let's turn to three of our strategic priorities : Strategy, Transformation, and Talent. I'm very pleased with the progress we've made on our strategy refresh. We have moved swiftly to begin the sales process for the 13 consumer markets we plan to exit in Asia and EMEA. The first round of bids was very encouraging and competitive, which isn't a surprise because these are terrific businesses for the right owners. In those regions, we are off to a running start in our wealth strategy. We are making significant strategic investments in product capabilities, technology, and talent and have already seen this in increased client acquisition. We continue to do thorough and vigorous work to refresh our strategy across our consumer and institutional businesses guided by the four principles I outlined to you earlier in the year, being clinical, being focused and ensuring both connectivity and simplification. Our overarching goal is to increase the returns we generate and close the gap with our peers by investing in the franchises that will drive the most growth, the three most notable of which are TTS, wealth, and commercial banking. And I'm very confident in the growth and return prospects these connected franchises will afford us. As we have done so far, we will share our decisions with you as we make them on the strategy and we are also looking forward to presenting our plans to you more comprehensively during an Investor Day, which we intend to hold in the first quarter of next year. We're going to put our entire vision for the firm in front of view. So, you can then hold us accountable for executing against it. As we discussed in the call last quarter, we are also working very hard and diligently on our transformation. This is a significant, it's also an exciting body of work and we're working closely with our regulators to meet their expectations and we intend to submit our plans to them this quarter. Now, while addressing the consent orders is an intense focus of the transformation, our work here goes well beyond the orders themselves. We've set out to modernize our bank. We want to achieve nothing less than excellence and this means investing in our risk and control environment, but also in the infrastructure we need to serve our clients in an increasingly digital world. So, let me give you an example in TTS. These investments will improve the scalability of our platform, automation will drive efficiency and client experience, and investments in data will enhance revenues and the investments we're making will help position us to retain our leading position as the preeminent global corporate bank. And that leads me finally to talent, where we have made material progress over the last few months. I'm delighted with the caliber of talent we have been attracting to the firm to grow our businesses and support our transformation. We've enhanced our existing ranks with best-in-market hires in data, risk, strategy and controls, as well as in the front lines of wealth, the commercial bank, and BCMA, in particular. We continue to invest in a culture of excellence and our own people, providing them with new leadership and growth opportunities. And it\u2019s this combination of new perspective and our existing high-caliber talent pool that will enable us to take the firm forward with excellence, urgency, and accountability. Now, before I turn it over to Mark, I would like to thank Liz Lynn for her great work leading our Investor Relation efforts over the past several years. And as you know, and as she mentioned, she is going to be our Finance Lead for BCMA where we all know she is going to do a wonderful job. With that, Mark will go through our presentation. And then we'll both be happy to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 3, Citigroup reported second-quarter net income of $6.2 billion, EPS of $2.85, and a 15.2% RoTCE. Revenues declined 12% from the prior year, reflecting a normalization in fixed income markets along with lower card loans in consumer as well as the impact of lower interest rates. Expenses were up 7% year-over-year, in constant dollars expenses were up 4% reflecting a normalization relative to the low print last year along with continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of $1.3 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $2.4 billion, reflecting portfolio improvements as well as the continued improvement in our macroeconomic outlook. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans declined 3% year-over-year, reflecting higher repayment rates across institutional and consumer. Although, I would note that we are starting to see some pockets of loan growth emerge and for the first time in over a year loans were up sequentially. Deposits grew modestly up 4% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients. Looking at the first half of 2021, total revenues declined 9% year-over-year, and 10% in constant dollars mainly driven by the normalization in fixed income markets and lower card balances in consumer, although we did see strong fee revenue growth across consumer and in ICG excluding fixed income markets. Total expenses were up 6% on a reported basis and 3% in constant dollars midway through the year. I'll talk more about our outlook for the remainder of the year in a moment. Cost of credit was a benefit of roughly $3 billion as we released over $6 billion in reserves and we delivered roughly $14 billion in net income and in RoTCE of 17.6%. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $7 billion in capital so far this year. And we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as well as returning any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework. Turning now to each business. Slide 4 shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. For the quarter ICG delivered EBIT of $4.9 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues decreased 14% driven mainly by the decline in fixed income markets, expenses increased 4% and were up 2% in constant dollars as investments in transformation along with other strategic investments were mostly offset by lower incentive compensation and efficiency savings. Credit costs were down considerably given a roughly $900 million ACL release as well as lower net credit losses. And ICG delivered a 16.4% return on allocated capital. Slide 5 shows revenues for the Institutional Clients Group in more detail. Product revenues were down 17% in the second quarter, primarily reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period, particularly in fixed income markets. However, we are continuing to see robust client engagement and strong underlying growth in our fee businesses across the franchise including TTS, Investment Banking, Securities Services, Commercial Banking, and the Private Bank. And excluding the markets related component non-interest revenues were up 24% this quarter and we are confident in our outlook for continued strong fee growth in the back half of the year. Looking at the results in greater detail, on the Banking side, revenues decreased 1%. In Treasury and Trade Solutions significant growth in fee revenues of roughly 25%, reflecting solid client engagement as well as growth in trade, were more than offset by the impact of lower interest rates with revenues down 1%. We're continuing to see momentum across our Payments Business with 13% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearing volumes over the past year as well as the early days of a recovery in commercial cards. And as of the end of the quarter, TTS loans grew roughly 5% reflecting increasing client demand and improving macroeconomic conditions. Investment banking revenues were up 1% as higher M&A and equity underwriting revenues were largely offset by a decline in debt underwriting. While the overall DCM wallet was up in the second quarter, all the growth was in non-investment grade which did not benefit our results given our SKU to investment grade. But, looking at results versus a more normal year revenues were up 38% versus the second quarter of 2019 with strong growth across all products. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by higher fees and lending volumes reflecting momentum with both new and existing clients, partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates. Corporate Lending revenues were down 15% primarily driven by lower volumes. Total markets and securities services revenues decreased 30% from last year. Fixed Income revenues decreased 43% reflecting a comparison to a strong prior-year period in both rates and spread products. However, we remained engaged with our clients with steady growth in both corporate and investor client revenues relative to the historical average. Equities revenues were up 37% versus last year, primarily driven by good performance in both derivatives and prime finance reflecting robust client activity and favorable market conditions. In securities services, revenues were up 9% on a reported basis and 5% in constant dollars. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues with both new and existing clients driven by growth in assets under custody and settlement volumes partially offset by lower spreads. Finally, looking at first-half results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking as well as good results in the Private Bank and Securities Services which helped to offset the expected normalization in fixed income markets. I would also note that equity markets revenues are up over 30%. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars on Slide 6. For the quarter, GCB delivered EBIT of $2.4 billion, up significantly from last year. Revenues declined 10% as continued strong deposit growth albeit with lower spreads and momentum in Investment Management were more than offset by lower card balances across all three regions. In cards, while we are encouraged by the continued improvement in consumer spending with purchase sales up close to 40% versus last year and almost 20% versus last quarter, we are still seeing the impact of high-payment rates on revenues. Expenses increased 7%, reflecting continued investments in our transformation as well as other strategic investments along with an acceleration in marketing and higher volume-related costs from the low point a year ago, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit remains healthy and credit costs decreased significantly, driven by the $1.4 billion ACL reserve release and lower net credit losses. And GCB delivered a 20.8% return on allocated capital. Finally, looking at results for the first half of the year, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers, which gives us confidence in our outlook as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 7, shows the results for North America Consumer in more detail. Second-quarter revenues were down 11% from last year, primarily driven by lower cards revenues but better than the 15% decline last quarter on a year-over-year basis. Revenues declined in both branded cards and retail services by 12% and 14% respectively, reflecting continued headwinds from higher payment rates as consumers have continued to use liquidity from stimulus and other relief programs to pay down debt, driving lower loans and a shift in mix towards transactor balances. This is creating pressure on our net interest revenues, but it's also benefiting our delinquency and loss trends. However, we are continuing to see a recovery in sales activity with purchase sales now above pre-pandemic levels led by discretionary spend including travel and dining. In Branded Cards, total purchase sales were up 40% versus last year and importantly, up 11% versus the second quarter of 2019. And in Retail Services, purchase sales also grew versus both second quarter 2019 and 2020. So, the good news is that we're continuing to see the recovery in spend and we're also returning to pre-COVID acquisition levels. Looking ahead, we expect the growth in purchase sales to translate into loan growth by the end of the year as stimulus moderates and consumers return to more normal payment patterns. Turning to Retail Banking, revenues were down 7% year-over-year, reflecting pressure from lower deposit spreads and lower mortgage revenues. That said, we are continuing to see good momentum as we grow and deepen our retail bank relationships as well as improve the quality and stickiness of these relationships. Average deposits were up 18% including 24% growth in checking and the number of Citigold households increased by 16% contributing to a 23% increase in AUMs. On slide 8, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year in the second quarter with an 11% decline in Latin America and a 3% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we are seeing good momentum in Investment Management with 15% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia and the numbers are meaningfully higher, if you look specifically at the four international wealth hubs. Average deposit growth remained strong at 8% albeit at lower deposit spreads. And similar to the U.S., we saw a 26% increase in purchase sales year-over-year with cards loan growth remained a challenge this quarter. With average card loans down 8% due to elevated payment rates. Slide 9 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. In the U.S., both NCL and delinquency rates remained favorable, driven by the significant amount of customer liquidity due to stimulus and other relief programs. Given the delinquency trends we are seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021 and the ultimate timing and level of losses as we look into next year will depend on whether or not the stimulus results in a permanent benefit. And as expected, credit losses and delinquency rates trended downward in both Mexico and Asia following a peak in the first quarter of 2021. So, overall we are seeing a rebound in activity along with a consumer who is in a very healthy financial position suggesting good momentum as we move into the back half of the year. Slide 10 shows the results for Corporate/Other, revenues were down slightly in dollar terms as episodic gains this quarter were more than offset by previously disclosed one-time items in the prior year. Expenses were up slightly in dollar terms, mainly reflecting the impact of FX, and similar to last quarter, we have further allocated cost to the businesses related to investments in infrastructure risk and controls. As we mentioned previously, this change had no impact to EBIT at the Citi level, however, we have recast prior periods to enable better comparability of results. Credit costs declined year-over-year driven by a release this quarter compared to a build in the prior year. Finally, EBIT was breakeven this quarter. Looking ahead, we would expect a quarterly pretax loss in the range of $200 million to $300 million for the remainder of 2021. Slide 11 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. We've also provided net interest revenues in constant dollars on Slide 19 in the appendix for comparison to prior periods. In the second-quarter, net interest revenue of $10.2 billion declined $880 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates sequentially, net interest revenue continued to stabilize as the extra day in the quarter was offset by lower cards revenues. Net interest margin declined three basis points, driven by lower cards NIR and modest growth in the balance sheet due to deposits, partially offset by the increase in markets NIR in the quarter. Turning to non-interest revenues on the bottom of the slide, in the second quarter, non-NIR declined $1.4 billion driven by normalization in fixed income markets. However, outside of markets, we did see strong broad-based fee growth of over $600 million across GCB and ICG. And for the past two quarters, we've seen these fee revenues return to pre-pandemic levels of roughly $4.4 billion per quarter pointing to a somewhat faster than expected recovery. Looking at these results, midway through the year, we are comfortable with our prior outlook and continue to expect total Citi revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a full-year basis. Although the composition is likely to be somewhat different, which I will talk more about in a moment. On Slide 12, we show our key capital metrics, which remain strong and stable again this quarter, allowing us to support clients and return capital to shareholders. Our CET1 capital ratio increased to 11.9% as net income was mostly offset by buybacks and dividends. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4.1 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was 5.9%, a decline from the prior quarter, largely driven by the expiration of the temporary SLR relief. And our tangible book value per share grew by 9% to $77.87 driven by net income. Before we move on to Q&A, let me spend a few minutes on our outlook for 2021. On the topline for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits on a reported basis. But as I mentioned, the composition is likely to be somewhat different than we originally anticipated. Year-to-date, we've seen stronger than expected growth in non-interest revenues and we do expect the strength in fee growth to continue in the back half of the year, driven primarily by ICG. Meanwhile, for net interest revenues, we expect continued stabilization in the back half and we should start to see some loan growth by the end of the year. So, while net interest revenues are down roughly $2.2 billion year-to-date just outside our original outlook for the full year, assuming this base case holds, we do not expect a significant further decline in net interest revenues from here on a full year basis. So, again in aggregate for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down mid-single digits. On the expense side, based on our latest work on the strategic refresh, we've made the decision to further accelerate certain strategic investments in part in reaction to what is shaping up to be a faster than expected recovery. As a result, we now expect total Citigroup expenses to be up mid-single digits. These are strategic investments that we are making to strengthen our franchise and drive long-term growth. For example, we've accelerated investments where we believe there are significant opportunities for growth, including holistically across Wealth and the Commercial Bank. We've also doubled down on our existing strengths and businesses like TTS, Securities Services, and the Investment Banking business. Finally, given the faster recovery we are seeing today, we are accelerating investments in areas like cards marketing to capture this upside. All of these investments will have significant benefits over time. Meanwhile, expenses related directly to the transformation, which we had expected to drive the 2% to 3% increase in total Citi expenses this year, are coming in largely as expected. These investments include the work around the consent order as well as the broader work to modernize the bank, which will improve our risk and control environment as well as allow us to better meet the needs of our customers and clients through an improved operating environment, leading to faster decision-making, better efficiency, and improved client experience. And I'd point out that the mix of this spend is 30% technology and 70% non-tech related investments. Finally, this outlook includes the realization of productivity savings as a byproduct of the investments we've been making over the past few years. And to be clear, we will continue as we have done in the past to look for ways to operate as efficiently as possible during this investment period. And one additional note, we could also see some episodic impacts this year related to the market exits we are pursuing. And as I've mentioned previously, we will be very transparent about the impact of these actions on our financials. So, in summary, we feel good about the investments that we're making and firmly believe these investments will position us well to close our return gap to peers over time. Before we get started with questions also want to take a moment to thank Liz Lynn for her time as the Head of Citi Investor Relations. Liz has been with the Citi IR team since 2013 and has led the Group since 2019. I know that she has built strong relationships with all of you and has been a key part of my team since I was named CFO, a little over two years ago. She will be moving on to be the Chief Financial Officer for our Investment Banking business. And as Liz mentioned, Jen Landis will be joining us in August as our new Head of Investor Relations. I hope you will all join me in congratulating Liz on her new role and welcoming Jen to Citi on our next earnings call. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead with your questions. John McDonald : Hi, good morning. Mark, thanks for the comments at the end there about the expense outlook and the revision to your outlook for this year. I was wondering if you could just unpack that a little bit more. You're not the only bank that's been kind of raising expense guidance. So, I was wondering how much of this might be inflationary to the cost of doing business as a big bank here, how much is Citi specific? And does the run rate that you're expecting to be on expenses in the back half of this year feel like that's the run rate you would go into next year with or are there things that are elevated this year? Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Good morning, John. Thanks for the question. Look, I'll start by saying and repeating a little bit of what I said in my remarks, which is that we are taking a very deliberate decision on how we manage the franchise, right? And so what I spoke to was Jane and I, along with the leadership team, are going through a very thoughtful strategy refresh. And as we go through that we are identifying, particularly given the pace of the recovery, some real strategic opportunities to invest in the franchise. And we don't want to - we're not going to miss this window of opportunity. You've heard me mentioned that before. And it's in parts of the franchise that will undoubtedly grow and are high returning. So, when we talk about TTS, we talk about the Commercial Banking business, we talk about Wealth, those are businesses that have strong growth prospects and have returns that are north of 20% in a normal environment. And so, like I said, we're jumping at that. On the transformation side, I've been very clear and consistent that we expected that to drive the 3% - 2% to 3% increase year over year, that's coming in largely as expected and again the right thing to do, an important thing to do to modernize this bank. Inflation of course is going to be a factor, particularly as we look at labor and the competition for talent, but again that's - we deal with that on a regular basis, and we continue to look for productivity and efficiency savings that largely tend to offset that. In terms of 2022, I'm not going to give any guidance on that, but again this is, I think, an important period of time as we come out of this to ensure we're putting money to work in a smart fashion that prepares the firm for the future. Operator : Your next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Sorry, I was on mute there for a second. Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jim Mitchell : Maybe the first question - hey, good morning. Maybe first question on branded cards in North America. Average balances were pretty flat, but there's a little pressure on spread. Can you just maybe clear that up, is that just sort of greater teaser rate activity, or does that bounce back. How do we think about the revenue trajectory there and the spread compression we saw this quarter? Mark Mason : Yes. So again the dynamic on cards revenues, branded cards in particular in North America, which were down 12% is largely driven by what we're seeing in the way of - in the way of loan balances. And if you look at average interest-earning balances, our average interest-earning balances for branded cards are down about 11%. Now, the good news is, as we've said, purchase sale activity is up meaningfully year-over-year and relative to the prior quarter, but it's really those payment rates are remaining quite high, quite elevated. The good news is that plays through in the form of a benefit as it relates to cost of credit, lower losses than expected, and now lower reserves as we see releases, but it's really that dynamic of payment rates high, lower loan volumes, average interest-earning in particular that is putting pressure on the top line. Jim Mitchell : All right. That's helpful for the clarification on the transactor balances. And then maybe just more broadly on the Wealth business, you guys put out a press release saying you made some significant investments and new hires in Asia Wealth with a pretty substantial and aggressive target to grow headcount. Where do you stand on that build out? And are you making similar investments in other markets? Jane Fraser : Yes, look, I think as we said, we're pretty excited about the wealth opportunity for us because we have all the different pieces to be successful here, the brand, the client relationships, the platform, the commercial banking franchise, and we are already a sizable player. We're number three in Asia, for example, where a lot of the growth is coming from. The opportunity for us is pulling all of the pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients. And so we've been investing in that platform, the technology, you'll have seen the announcement yesterday in the U.S. about a self-directed digital offering there. We've been expanding and growing talent in the front line as well, and very pleased as well with the investment product revenue growth, which is - where from a mix point of view, we see the greatest upside for us. So, early days in the execution of this, but I think pleasing progresses as we pull this together into this single integrated offering, invest behind it and you'll see the benefits in terms of growth as well as obviously return and revenue mix going forward for the bank. Mark Mason : Yes. Jane, only thing I'd add to that, we are already seeing good performance in the quarter, right? So, Private Bank revenues up 4%; our continued strong growth in client assets up 26%, including AUMs that were up 29% and deposit strength, et cetera. And as Jane mentioned, even as we invest in strengthening the platform, we just announced yesterday that we were launching the self-directed investment digital offering, which again is targeted towards U.S. consumer and wealth management clients and so good progress while we invest and position ourselves to capture further opportunity here. Operator : Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Hello, Betsy. Your line is open. Please proceed with your question. And we will move to the next question in queue. Your next question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Please proceed. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good morning, Jane and Mark. Mark Mason : Good morning. Ken Usdin : Wanted to ask you a little bit just on capital, when we got the SCB results, you had indicated a dividend of at least 51% and implied that you'd be buying back stock. But just wondering if you could help us just flush that out a little bit more in terms of how we should be thinking about the type of capital return or any increases that you might consider on the dividend from here and how to put that into context with prospective changes in the SCB and your minimums? Mark Mason : Sure. But the first thing I'd say is that, as you can tell through the second quarter, we bought back as much as the regulatory rules would allow for in the way of the average four quarters of net income. And so we continue to be very excited about the prospect of continued capital return. As it relates to the SCB and the recent results, as you know, we have a target of approximately 11.5% from a CET1 ratio point of view. The target includes an estimate for the stress capital buffer that's somewhere between 2.5% and 3%, up until this recent set of results, the prior couple had been at the 2.5%. The 3% will go into effect at the end of the third quarter. And more importantly, we will actively manage the drivers that impact that Stress Capital Buffer. That is to say PPNR as well as the balance sheet risk-weighted assets and we intend to do so with an eye towards how we bring that Stress Capital Buffer back down. As we think about capital actions, as you know, with the SCB in place, we have the flexibility to take those decisions in a given quarter, in line with our - with the reg minimums and we intend to do that. Given where the stock trades, it makes a lot of sense for us to be buying back shares and so, we'll continue to skew towards that. And as of right now, our dividend is going to remain at 51%, but as I mentioned, we will continue to look at that quarter-to-quarter given the flexibility from the SCB. Jane Fraser : And the only piece I'd add in is, as we are doing this work on the strategy and the plans going forward. Both Mark and I have a high degree of confidence around the capital generating capability of the franchise and look forward to returning excess capital to you over and above what we'll be doing to invest and close that return gap with our peers group. Operator : Your next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Mike O'Connor: I just wanted to follow up on the dividend commentary. I understand a preference to buyback stock and you are very explicit about wanting to do that below tangible books, that makes sense. But I guess just kind of signal to the market keeping a stable dividend. Is there, like a message there about the underlying earnings power or limited ability to increase the dividend. So, I would think you'd want to at least top it up by a couple of pennies just to signal a positive trend, if it doesn't take that much capital to do that. So, maybe you can elaborate a little bit on the dividend. Again, specifically on should we read into implied underlying earnings power, are there any limits on interest from dividend? Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Let me be very clear. There is no underlying message there at all, right. It's, as I stated in terms of where the stock is trading and in making sense to do buybacks. Our dividend yield is quite comparable to that of peers that close to 3%. And so, and there is no constraint on our ability to take capital actions and we don't have any concerns about the earning power of the franchise. And in fact many of the areas as I mentioned earlier and as Jane has mentioned, we know are going to contribute to continued strength in our earnings power. So, well capitalized, we feel good about our earnings power and no concerns or no underlying message to the capital actions and direction of them that we spoke to and again, we have the flexibility given the stress capital buffer, as we go quarter to quarter to adjust as we sit see fit in the best interest of our investors. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Hello, Steven, your line is open. Steven Chubak : Sorry, I was muted as well. My apologies. Mark, I was hoping to unpack just some of the NII guidance. I think there was just a little bit of confusion how it should be interpreted. So, it sounds like were down $2.2 billion year-to-date and that we - the full year, we shouldn't see any incremental declines from there. So, that would imply about a $10.5 billion NII run rate in the back half. I just wanted to make sure that's the right way to interpret the remarks. Mark Mason : Yes. So look again. We do see kind of the NIR stabilizing and you see some of that particularly ex markets, but also in total on the page, again the guidance for total revenues unchanged at down 5% or mid - down mid-single digits, excuse me. You're right, as of the half, we're it down $2.2 billion as it relates to net interest revenues. Look the market's component of that can often be hard to predict, but what I'm suggesting is that any offset or any further pressure there will be offset likely in the fee momentum that we expect to see given the strength coming through this quarter. Operator : Your next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : I do have a question for Jane and you Mark, the question has to do with how you're thinking about the importance of scale in the business refresh, I guess I could call it that you're doing. And Jane really, maybe you could help us understand how important scale is in what you're looking to execute here. I ask because many times I get questions from investors around what is - what is that you are doing on the pieces of the business that don't have as much scale as you know the stand-out areas like Global Search or Treasury services or Mexico? Jane Fraser : Yes. First of all, scale is clearly very, very important here, particularly in a more digital world. And as you point out Betsy, TTS for example has - we're moving $4 trillion of volume a day around the world and we've got a number of franchises that have material scale and we expect them to be growing. And this is where the transformation program will be very helpful in ensuring the scalability of our platforms. We made the decision on Asia-Pac and EMEA to exit the 13 markets where we didn't believe that we would be able to achieve the scale needed to compete in those very local part of the business. So, that we can focus our firepower in those areas where either ensuring we retain a leading market position or in other areas where we want to be investing to attain the scale that we think is going to be needed going forward. U.S. consumer is an obvious example of that. So, I think as we will hear from us going forward more and more focus around what are our plans for those businesses for retaining the leading positions in this, aided by the transformation program or in the areas where we'll be investing to attain greater scale and as I say, U.S. consumer is the obvious one, there are pockets in Commercial Bank we're excited by Securities Services, one where we think it is very, very readily attainable particularly given our pre and post-trade capabilities. And part of that scale finally, it will come from the linkages between our businesses as we create more connectivity that will also provide us scale. So, collectively the different franchises we have will be competitively advantaged and not just individually strong. Operator : Your next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Please, proceed. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just a quick follow-up, understand you're being deliberate in terms of strategy, leading up to I guess the Investor Day you mentioned next - first quarter next year. But as we think about just the investment spend and the expense outlook handicap, Mark, if you could the risk that we could see a little bit of expense creep as you dig further deeper into this, both in terms of your guidance for mid-single-digit expense growth this year and as we think about just the duration of that investment cycle over the next few years? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, again, this is - this is something that we control, right? So, again, I want to reiterate that we are making very deliberate decisions around the opportunities that we see across the franchise and it's the right thing to do, right. So, we're going to continue to do that. In terms of kind of risk to it, I don't think there are any surprises here, right. So, if revenues come in meaningfully different, there is a certain component of our expense base that's tied to revenues and so that would obviously move around, but aside from those volume-related expenses, transaction, compensation, et cetera, you should expect what I've guided towards, in terms of the very deliberate decisions to put the money to work in this fashion and we're going to continue to do that. If we see more investment opportunities in '21 or 2022, we're going to go after them. Because again, we know that we can deliver on the benefits and the returns that are associated with putting that money to work. Operator : Your next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, you said something interesting about the investment banking business revenues. I think you said that they were 39% or 38% higher than 2019 or lower. I don't - or higher, I'm checking my notes here. So, your business is still nicely above the 2019 levels and we came through period, up until the pandemic that you're well aware of that. It was somewhat challenging, the growth in this investment banking and trading businesses. As you look forward, when you talk to your people in Investment Banking and in Global Markets, why do they see this, because there seems to be an elevated amount of business due to what we just came through in the last 18 months. Do they think it's sustainable or do we get back to 2019? What are those guys telling you about the next 12 to 24 months in those businesses? Mark Mason : Yes. I'd start by saying we continue to have very, very good dialog with our clients across the franchise and specifically in Investment Banking. And if you think about it, many businesses, many companies across industries are really having to take a look at their business model. And think about how they want to transform their businesses coming out of this pandemic. Everything from how to think about digitization, how to think about going direct to consumers, what the pandemic means for supply chains, how people work remotely, how they manage their liquidity levels, what to do with that excess liquidity, should they be buying or what and so we're part of that dialogue which is incredibly representative, I think, it represents strongly the franchise that we have. The general view from our clients is optimistic in terms of the go-forward environment. Yes, there are some things to kind of manage too, but there is a general level of optimism. And so what I represented relative to '19 is, while we are seeing normalization, we're normalizing at a higher level than where we ended in 2019 and we'd expect continued momentum and we'd expect to take - continue to take share over time. Jane, anything you want to add to that? Jane Fraser : Yes. Mark, I think you covered it very well. There is a high level of client engagement with us at the moment, really around the world and a lot of demand we are seeing in addition to the investment banking side, the shift to e-commerce with clients needing our TTS services or cross-border flows that we are seeing this translating into demand in trade starting to tick up nicely. The commercial banking side is another area that we're seeing a lot of new demand coming through from clients, both from strategic activity with our investment bank as well as their own expansion globally that we are supporting them through our Treasury Services and the like. So, I think there is a general sense of optimism. We have a fabulous pipeline, one never wants to jinx these things, but we really have a fabulous pipeline heading into the second half of the year around the world and it does give you a good sense of confidence of continued momentum. Operator : Your next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : I'm going to ask my question here and then re-queue. The real question is just on capital. I mean, you're not blind to the fact that your tangible book value is $78 and your stock price of $68. So, we should probably be selling your desk chairs and you're silverware, and anything you can to buyback your stock, I would think. So, along those lines, the first question is when you're looking the sales of assets in 13 consumer markets, do you expect to have a gain on those or loss on those relative to where they are marked currently? Mark Mason : Yes, so, look. I think I'd tell you Mike that we, as Jane mentioned, we've seen strong interest from buyers as it relates to those assets. And there's no surprise, just given we think those are good businesses just not of scale, as Jane mentioned, for us. We've got to run that process through and see what that result in, and I'll continue to be transparent with you as to where gains and losses or how it flows through our financials. But I'm not going to sit here and tell you whether it's gains or losses or what it means specifically for those 13 markets. What I will tell you is that as capital is freed up from those transactions, we'll continue to make very deliberate decisions around what to do with that capital. First looking at growth opportunities that can deliver returns above our cost of capital and then looking towards how we can return as much of it to shareholders as it makes sense in the form of buybacks, dividends et cetera. And we've been disciplined about that to date, and we're going to continue to be disciplined about that. Mike Mayo : So, to clarify, if I got this right, your CET1 ratio was 11.9 and your return on capital above 11.5. So if you were to quantify the dollar amount of that, how much would that mean in potential buybacks at this point and then I assume that would not include any capital freed up from any sales. So, you could have potential buyback of a lot of stock if you were willing and able, is that correct? Mark Mason : A little bit over $4 billion of excess capital between the 11.5 and the 11.9 and so that's what that equates to. Operator : Your next and final question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Please proceed. Vivek Juneja : Mark, any comments on promotional trends that you're seeing and card pricing given everybody is back focusing on the business you mentioned marketing spend, but can you talk a little bit about what you're seeing in promotional pricing in that? Mark Mason : Yes. I guess, what I'd say is simply that as expenses would suggest and as we stated, we are lagging back into bringing on new card customers. And so - and what we're seeing is that our acquisitions are largely at pre-COVID, pre-crisis, or pre-pandemic levels and frankly, we're seeing normal behaviors as those card customers come on and has always been the case, it is going to be a mix in terms of the acquisition strategy, but thus far, we're seeing normal behaviors, if you will. And look, the new account acquisitions skew towards branded cards and they are in products that are less reliant on the 0% offers and products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan, which will generate interest immediately as those balances grow. Operator : We do have one more question in queue from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : An unrelated question. Just, Jane, as you think about the technology approach doing it yourself through Citigroup and pairing up with partners, what's the status of the relationship with Google and Google Plex and your desire to use third parties to gather new customers at lower initial cost that maybe not as much lifetime value. If you think of that trade-off, what's your current thinking today and we haven't heard much about the Google relationship despite some initial headlines. Thanks. Jane Fraser : Yes. Hey there, Mike. Excellent question. The part the partnership with big tech is an important part of our disruptive strategy in the U.S. as we are looking at both, how do we enhance value propositions to customers, the customer base itself and then these new ecosystems that are evolving. And I think there's no question that COVID has accelerated the embedded finance model in the U.S., just think of the travel ecosystem, think of home improvement ecosystems and the benefit we've got is that for us, it's not a new space to us. We've been very much engaged with partners in Asia, Grab, Paytm and We Bank as well as our traditional partners. What we find with these partnerships is that we learn a lot, because it is still early days in the development of these new ecosystems. We learn a lot about marketing, about user experiences around the tech stacks. It certainly enables us to tap into next generation customer bases, but also importantly it goes beyond consumer and so if we look on the corporate side, our partnership with Stripe, the work that we're doing in TTS with Project Spring of enabling payments around is a core piece, particularly as wholesale and retail, kind of collapses some of these payment chains into one. So, with the Google Plex and several other tech partnerships that we have in the States and elsewhere in the world, we are very deliberately going about creating a broad suite of APIs and partner integration capabilities. So that we're able to integrate other partners into our offerings, develop more innovative solutions without necessarily having to build it or buy it all ourselves and Citi plex with Google is an example of that. We are actively testing features with our own employees at the moment. We'll be finalizing dates, we'll share with that - we'll share that with you when available. But it's one of many different partnerships that we have and an important partner for us, but far from the only one here in the States to help us disrupt and grow going forward. Operator : We do have a follow-up question from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : But, I have a second question and that's on capital. Given that you're headed towards a higher GSIB bucket, Mark, Jane, what you're all thinking in terms of that in terms of not just capital targets, anything you can do about that, because I know that's a year or a little over a year away from going into effect, but obviously you're thinking about target capital, we'll have to keep in mind, what's coming down the pipe for you? Mark Mason : Sure. And look, as you, as you know, with all of the liquidity in the market, many of us have seen pressure on our GSIB score. That certainly has been the case for us and it wouldn't go into effect, the higher GSIB score of 3.5% until the beginning of 2023. And we look at the entire capital stack holistically, the 11.5% target in our case, which is well above reg minimums, but certainly does consider that - consider that and there are elements of that, as I mentioned earlier, that we can influence and control. So, the stress capital buffer is part of that and I talked earlier about our ability to influence those levers without having full understanding of the Fed models, we know we can influence PPNR, we know we can influence the balance sheet and how it gets allocated and ultimately what stress losses come out of it. And so we will continue to manage that. We will still have a buffer obviously even with a higher GSIB score. And as you know, regulators continue to talk about capital as being at about the right levels in the system. And they will continue to look at drivers that influence the stack as well including GSIB and balance sheet size et cetera and we'll see how that evolves. But again, we feel good about where we are. We are well-capitalized, we have a good sense for the drivers going forward that will create capital capacity for us and we intend to again invest that where it makes sense and return that otherwise to our shareholders. Operator : I would now like to turn the call back over to Elizabeth Lynn for closing remarks. Elizabeth Lynn : Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to us in IR with any follow-up questions, thank you again and have a nice day. Operator : This concludes the Citi's second quarter 2021 earnings review.

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Mrs. Landis, you may begin. Jennifer Landis : Thank you, Operator. Good morning. And thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filing. Before we get started, I'd like to thank Liz Lynn for being such an incredible partner during these last few months. I really enjoyed getting to know the entire Citi team, and I'm honored to be the next Head of Investor Relations. And I look forward to working with you all. With that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen, and good morning everyone. I'm delighted to join you today. So let's kick off the call with what we're seeing from a macro perspective and the tremendous engagement we continue to experience with clients before I give you an update on our results and priorities. Certainly, the recovery from the pandemic continues to drive corporate and consumer confidence. I particularly like the robust pipelines we see through the rest of the year and beyond. Corporate client sentiment remains very positive with healthy cash flows and liquidity driving M&A activity and deleveraging. And consumer Balance Sheets remain unusually strong on the back of the increasing consumer network during the pandemic. Now all that said, growth has come off the ball a tad. We're watching three things very closely : the slowdown in China and its impact on global growth; inflation and supply constraints in labor, materials, and energy; and finally, what happens next with the U.S. debt ceiling negotiations. These are also the issues that repeatedly surfaced in our conversations with clients. So turning to the quarter, we reported a net income of $4.6 billion and EPS of $2.15. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss related to the sale of our Australia consumer business, which Mark's going to provide the details on. Excluding this transaction, our 3rd quarter revenues would have been up 3% over last year, and our EPS would have been $2.44. In the institutional client's group, we grew revenues by 4% year-over-year as we continue to see strong client engagement with momentum in Investment Banking, equity markets, and Securities Services more than offsetting the 16% decline in the fixed income market. I'm very proud to tell you that it was Citi's best M&A quarter and the second-best investment banking quarter in a decade. And lending in the ICG grew again this quarter, albeit modest state. We also had a very strong quarter in the equity market with revenues up 40% year-over-year. So despite that normalization in fixed income versus the pretty extraordinary performance of 2020, overall markets revenues were only down 5% and they were up 11% versus the third quarter of 2019. We continue to successfully execute our strategy to grow fee revenue across the ICG businesses. For example, while TTS continues to be impacted by interest rate headwinds, our fees this quarter was the highest in a decade. You can also see how our global network uniquely positions us to help our clients navigate the supply chain challenges so many of them are facing; a dynamic that we expect to exist for the near future. Similarly, we drove double-digit fee revenue growth in Securities Services and the Private Bank as client assets under custody, and assets under management continued their vigorous growth trajectory. In Global Consumer Banking, a healthy consumer balance sheet, and persistently elevated payment rates, did mean that loan growth remained under pressure. The other key drivers are a bit more encouraging, however, U.S. branded card purchase sales are well above 2019 levels, and acquisitions across branded cards, Mexico and the Asia hubs are also all now at or above pre - COVID levels. Ultimately, we continue to benefit from double-digit growth in deposits and assets under management across the franchise. Let me briefly touch on our U.S. retail strategy. Now, our digital strategy and investments are starting to pay dividends. Digital deposits stand at $19 billion, having grown 26% in the last year. And we see more than 2/3 of our digital deposit balances coming from customers outside of our branch footprint, with about half of those deposits from our cardholders who did not previously have a retail relationship with us. Now obviously, we were disappointed by Google's decision to discontinue Google Plex. But we learned a lot through the effort and the vast majority of the investments will be leveraged for our proprietary efforts and future partnerships. So all in all, we ended the quarter with a Common Equity Tier 1 Capital Ratio of 11.7% on a standardized basis. And our Tangible Book Value per share increased to $79.07, up over 10% from a year ago. So far this year, we've returned close to $11 billion to shareholders, through a healthy dividend and share repurchases. We remain committed to returning excess capital over and above the amount necessary to invest in our franchise and to maintain our safety and soundness. So overall, I'm quite pleased with these results given the environment we're operating in. And while we have much work ahead, we're seeing the results of the previous investments that we have made. Now, I'd like to update you on our strategic priorities. Turning to slide three, we've included a page that clearly lays out our top priorities and some of the actions we've taken to date against them. And we're going to share this page with you each quarter to ensure you're up-to-date on where we are and the milestones and progress along the way. And as you can see, we've been hard at work acting against the priorities that I've laid out, the transformation, the strategy refresh, and our culture and talent. Now, clearly, the transformation is our number one priority right now. And the key to that transformation is our safety and soundness and addressing the consent orders by modernizing our risk and control environment. During the quarter, we submitted our plans to our regulators, and continue to have a constructive dialog with them, as we pivot now firmly towards execution. We're already well underway in the investments in our risk and control environment. And we're really bringing a culture of excellence to this effort and we are moving with urgency. We also continued to make progress, refreshing our strategy. In addition to announcing the sale of our consumer business in Australia, we're deep in the 2nd round of bids for the remaining exit markets. We began the work on how these exits will enable us to simplify our operations in Asia, and eliminate stranded costs. And we're really looking forward to bringing you all the strategy work together for you on Investor Day and presenting our vision for the firm. And as Mark's going to touch on, we've begun executing on many of the decisions that we've already made, including in TTS, wealth, and commercial banking, with investments in front-office, hires, as well as enhanced digital products and service offerings. And we're already starting to see the impact of these investments emerge through key drivers across these businesses. And finally, turning to culture and talent, we continue to attract high-caliber external talent, whilst driving towards our diversity goals, ensuring clear accountability, and breaking down the silos that have historically impeded our progress as a Company. It's a new Citi. And all of this work has one overarching goal -- to responsibly narrow the returns gap with our peers. We will update you with the metrics and milestones that we'll use to hold ourselves accountable, so you can hold us accountable to them as well. And with that, let me turn it over to Mark to go through our performance in more detail. And then we will both be delighted to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. Starting on slide 4, as Jane mentioned, Citigroup reported a third-quarter net income of $4.6 billion, EPS of $2.15, and an ROTCE of 11% on $17.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results is a pre-tax loss of $680 million related to the sale of our Australia Consumer business. Excluding this item, EPS would've been $2.44 with an ROTCE of 12.5%. As a reminder, while we received a premium to book on the sale of the business, we did incur a pre-tax loss primarily related to the currency translation adjustment that has built up over time and is already included in our capital. Upon closing, the capital impact of this loss will be largely neutralized, and we will release approximately $800 million of capital allocated to the business. Revenues declined 1% from the prior year, excluding the loss on the sale, revenues would have been up 3%, largely driven by Investment Banking fees, as well as strong growth in Equity Markets and Securities Services. Expenses were up 5% year-over-year, and constant dollar expenses were up 4% in the quarter. On a year-to-date basis, our expenses have grown by 5% with two main drivers : investments in the transformation, including the six programs to address the consent orders, which drove about 3% of the growth so far this year. And business-led investments which focus on our front office expansion in the Investment Bank, Wealth, and Security Services, and investments to improve our client experience and digitize our network. So far this year, we added over 500 bankers, advisors, and other front office support in Wealth, including Private Bank and the consumer wealth businesses, and 200 corporate and investment bankers globally in high-growth areas, including senior hires across tech, healthcare, fintech, and private equity coverage. In our services businesses, TTS and Security Services, we continue to improve client experience and digital capabilities, which is enabling us to capture significant new mandates. In Consumer, these investments include development and marketing for new offerings like the Custom Cash Card and installment lending, as well as investments in our mobile and digital user experience. In addition, there were also increases in volume and revenue-related expenses, as well as businesses' usual expenses which were largely offset by efficiency savings. As a reminder, we will continue to analyze our expenses to look for opportunities to self-fund investments. And now turning to credit, credit performance remained strong with net credit losses of just under $1 billion more than offset by an ACL release of $1.2 billion, largely reflecting continued improvement in portfolio quality. In constant dollars, end-of-period loans were down 1% year-over-year, reflecting the impact of the Australia exit. Excluding this impact, loans would have been up 1% year-over-year, driven by active client engagement in TTS, Private Bank, and end-of-period of-period deposits were up 6% year-over-year, reflecting continued engagement with our consumer and corporate clients, as well as continued momentum in client acquisition and deepening across both corporate clients and consumers. Finally, as Jane noted earlier, we returned roughly $11 the lion in the capital so far this year. And while we remain committed to continuing to invest in our franchise, we will continue to return excess capital to shareholders. Turning now to east business. Slide five shows the results for the Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year and sequentially, mainly driven by Investment Banking, Equity Markets, and Securities Services. Expenses increased 9%, with about half of the increase driven by transformation, and the other half business-lediness led investments and higher revenue-related costs, partially offset by efficiency savings. Credit costs were largely benign in the quarter as minimal net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL reserve release. This resa resulted in a net income of $3.4 billion, which grew 21% in the quarter and 60% on a year-to-date basis. And ICG delivered an ROTCE of 14.5% for the quarter and 18.8% year-to-date. Slide 6 shows revenues for the insticlient'sl client's group in more detail. On the banking side, revenues were up 11% and Treasury and Trade Solutions continued growth in fee revenues of 20% year-over-year, the highest quarter for fees in a decade reflected solid client engagement and client acquisition, as well as a recovery in commercial Card revenues. However, all of this was more than offset by the impact of lower deposit spreads, driving total revenues down 4%. We're continuing to see momentum across our payment busina ess with 15% growth in cross-border flows and 10% growth in clearings transactions over the past year. As of quarter-end, TTS loans grew 15%, mainly in trade loans where our technology invest the ments in supply chain and deep local knowledge is enabling us to meet our clients' needs across the globe. Investment Banking revenues were up 39% year-over-year, largely driven by M&A as we continue to see the benefits from our front office investments, which positioned us well to take advantage of increased deal activity. As Jane mentioned, this was the 2nd best quarter for Investment Banking revenues and the best quarter for M&A in a decade. Private Bank revenues grew 4% driven by growth in assets under management, loans, and deposits, reflecting momentum with new and existing clients. This quarter, we added almost 200 bankers, investment counselors, and other front office support, and onboarded over 200 new clients. Our investments in talent continue to drive growth, which bodes well for our overall strategy and wealth. Corporate lending revenues were up 17% primarily driven by lower cost of funds and a modest gain on sale, partially offset by lower loan volumes. Total markets and Security Services revenues decreased 4% from last year. Fixed income revenues decreased 16% reflecting the continued normalization in market activity across rates and spread products. However, we saw strong activity with our Corporate clients, engaging with them in foreign exchange products to support their global operations, and hedging solutions to assist with their risk mitigation efforts. Equity Markets revenues were up 40%; our second-best quarter in a decade, driven by cash equities, derivatives, and prime finance, reflecting solid client activity and favorable market conditions. This is another business where we see our investments in talent and technology paying off. In Security, Services revenues were up 10%. Here we saw strong growth in fee revenues as the investments that we've been making in our platform and product capabilities enabled us to grow revenue with both new and existing clients, partially offset by lower deposit spreads. Finally, looking at year-to-date results in ICG, we've seen a strong contribution from Investment Banking and Equity Markets, as well as solid results in the Private Bank and Securities Services, which helped to offset the expected normalization and fixed income markets. Turning now to the results for Global Consumer Banking in constant dollars, on Slide 7. Revenues declined 14%, and 5% excluding the loss on the sale, as solid deposit growth and momentum in investment management were more than offset by lower card balances and lower deposit spreads. Expenses increased 5% with about half driven by transformation, and the remainder driven by business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by efficiency savings. Cost of credit was a modest benefit this quarter, as a roughly $1 billion ACL reserve release, more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in a net income of $1.3 billion, which grew 44%. And GCB delivered a 15% ROTCE and a 21.5% ROTCE, excluding the loss on the sale. Finally, looking at year-to-date results, we've seen steady improvement in our drivers over the course of the year with purchase sales up 5% relative to 2019, and acquisitions nearing pre - COVID levels globally. And the business delivered 22.4% ROTCE, excluding the loss on the sale. Slide 8 shows the results for North American consumers in more detail. Total third-quarter revenues were down 4% from last year as we continue to see headwinds from higher payment rates and deposit spreads. That said, we are encouraged by the trends we're seeing in both cards and retail banking. In branded cards and retail services, purchased sales were up versus the prior year by 24% and 14% respectively, with both above 2019 levels. And in retail banking, average deposits, and within that, checking deposits, were both up 14%. AUMs were up 16% and Citigold households were up 13% this quarter. We're also making progress on our U.S. digital strategy. U.S. digital deposits grew 26% compared to the prior year. An installment loan balances, including our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products, have also grown substantially, up 22% compared to the prior year, and over 80% of these loans are originated digitally. On slide 9, we show results for International Consumer Banking in constant dollars. Revenues declined 30% year-over-year in the third quarter. Excluding the loss on the sale, revenues declined 5% with a 7% decline in Latin America and a 4% decline in Asia. Looking at International Consumer overall, we're seeing good momentum and investment management with 10% growth in assets under management, primarily driven by Asia, and the growth is meaningfully higher if you look specifically at the four international Wealth hubs. Purchase sales grew 8% versus the prior year. And average deposits grew 3%, albeit at lower deposit spreads. Slide 10 provides additional detail on global consumer credit trends. Credit remained favorable again this quarter across all regions. And given the delinquency trends, we're seeing today, we do not expect credit deterioration in the U.S. portfolio in 2021. Slide 11 shows the results for corporate other. Revenues increased by over $300 million driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses declined by $300 million due to the absence of the civil money penalty, which we incurred in the 3rd quarter of last year, offset by an increase in expenses related to the transformation. Credit costs were still a benefit in the quarter or reflect the lower ACL release in the legacy portfolio relative to last year. Finally, EBT was a loss of $330 million. Slide 12 shows our net interest revenue and margin trends, as well as non-interest revenues on a reported basis. In the third quarter, net interest revenue of $10.4 billion declined roughly $100 million year-over-year, reflecting lower loan balances and the impact of lower rates. On a year-to-date basis, net interest revenue declined by roughly $2.3 billion. Turning to non-interest revenues, on the bottom of the slide. In the third quarter, non-NIR declined by approximately $50 million year-over-year. Driven by the impact from the loss on the sale of the Australia Consumer business. Excluding the loss, non-interest revenues would have grown by over $600 million or 9% driven by strong growth in fees in ICG. On Slide 13, we show our key capital metrics. Our CET1 capital ratio ticked down to 11.7%. During the quarter, Citi returned a total of $4 billion to common shareholders in the form of $1 billion in dividends and share repurchases of $3 billion. Our supplementary leverage ratio was largely unchanged at 5.8%. And our Tangible Book Value per share grew by 10% year-over-year to $79.07, driven by Net Income. Before we move to Q&A, let me touch briefly on our outlook for 2021. On the top line for total Citigroup, we still expect revenues to be down in the mid-single-digit range on a reported basis, excluding any divestiture-related impacts. On the expense side, we continue to expect full-year expenses to be up in the mid-single-digit range, excluding any divestiture-related impacts as we continue to transform our risk and control environment and invest in our businesses. And we will continue to look for ways to partially self-fund these investments over time. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator's Instruction] Please limit your questions to one question. Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Mark -- Mark Mason : Good morning. John McDonald : I wanted to ask about the net interest income. It seems like, overall, it came in a little bit better than you might have expected when you spoke at the Barclays conference in September. Could you give us a little more color on what drove the improvement in the core ex-markets NII this quarter and how that makes you feel about the setup for NII growing from here? Mark Mason : Sure. Good morning, John. When we look at it, it's on page 12, we came in at about $10.4 billion. I think there were a couple of factors that play through here. One was the Treasury investments that we've been making contributed to that as we put some of the excess liquidity that we have to work. On the 2nd, I mentioned earlier that we saw some loan growth in Cards, sequentially, branded cards, in particular, up 3%, but also, within that, we saw some of the late fees and bow con fees and cards playthrough.  As you know, there's an extra day in the quarter. And so the combination of those things contributed to the tick up here that we've seen. In terms of the balance of the year, that all feeds into the guidance that I've given for total revenues, and that really hasn't changed, but we continue to look to invest in the cards portfolio through new acquisitions with a long-term perspective of how we grow loans over time there. John McDonald : Okay. And just as a follow-up. On capital returns, while your total return is very healthy, it doesn't look like it increased much from the $4 billion that you did in the 2nd quarter, despite the Fed lifting its restrictions. Is this something you are being conservative on, giving a lot of change going on at the Company right now? As you free up capital from the business exits, your stocks trading in a low valuation, how are you thinking about allocating that freed-up capital between investing in the business and returning it to shareholders? Mark Mason : Yeah sure. So look, our philosophy really has not changed on this in terms of -- you've heard me say a number of times, that as we generate income, as we utilize our DTA over time, as capital gets released from the transactions that we do, we want to ensure that we're able to serve our clients. We want to ensure that we can invest in the business, and then anything in excess of that we want to return to the shareholders.  That perspective has not changed. Obviously, the SCB allows for us to make those decisions in the given quarter, based on what we're seeing in terms of our expected performance and based on all of the other factors I mentioned, including the capital release, and SA-CCR, and things of that sort, and so we'll continue to make those decisions with that philosophy in mind, which is how do we return any excess we have to shareholders over time. John McDonald : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Two interesting things outside [Indiscernible]. Wonder if we get your quick comments on perspective. One was you became the first custodian to receive regulatory approval in onshore business -- custody business in China. I wonder if you could frame my perspective on how material that opportunity is. And then the same kind of thing on your plans and to enter the Australian buy now pay later market, and what that means for not just Australia, but more globally, how you're viewing that in connection with the rest of your consumer business? Thanks so much. Jane Fraser : Thanks, Glen. Why don't I take that one? In terms of start-up, our operations, and business in China, I'd say we've been in that country for 100 years, we understand the dynamics in the local market well. We're currently serving a very large number of investors in that market. 70% of the Fortune 500 corporations in China, how they operate on the ground and gain access to China's Capital Market.  And we're looking at -- we're very happy to have the custody license in China. It will also help support our operations in Hong Kong. And it's part of the growth of our Securities Services strategy that we've got. You've seen the benefits starting to [Indiscernible] through in this quarter's results from some of those previous investments. And this is just another one of the investments that we're making that business that we like a lot and we think we're well-positioned in.  And in terms of buy-now-pay-later, I think this is one way, obviously, we're divesting our operations in Asia on that front, but we've certainly taken -- we've taken the learnings from our operations throughout the Asian region, and particularly been applying them to the U.S. over the last few years. So we've certainly not been sitting still in the U.S. We've been building out our personal lending platform since 2019, and that's part of our broader digitization strategy in the U.S. consumer.  We've been seeing very strong growth in our Flex portfolios, both as we leverage some of our existing partnerships such as American Airlines. And we watch it expand with new partners in POS. And one of the areas I'm particularly excited about is the partnering that we're doing with the largest e-commerce player, Amazon, on point-of-sale lending for our Cards customers.  And those capabilities are and will be leveraged with many additional partners and channels in the state and into Mexico. And finally, we've been expanding our product suite by developing off Cards lending capabilities. And if you've heard from Mark, payments on installment loans to existing Cards customers, 88% of those total sales are in digital channels.  So if we look at all of this, I would say, clearly, there's a trend towards multiple different formats of how a customer can and wants to pay. And we're really on the front for this, and making some strong progress on the back of the investments that we've been making over the last few years and will continue to do so. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : Wanted to understand a little bit more about what you think you can do in the U.S. cards business. I know we just spoke a little bit about some of the things that you have been executing on. But when I look at the Card business while it's up on a year-on-year basis, it is trending a bit below some of the peers in terms of growth rates.  And then you've got the Retail Partner Card program, which has some opportunities there to, in my opinion, get a little bit of a refresh to be as dynamic as some of your best-in-class peers. So wondering how you're thinking about that and as well on the deposit side in the U.S. with Google Now partnership not going forward. What are you thinking about with regard to leveraging your mobile app across the U.S. in a way that might not be understood well by the investor community because it seems like you've got a great app and it's just under penetrating your opportunity side with your brand? Mark Mason : Thanks for that. Why don't I get started and Jane may want to jump in, and I'll start with your comments related to Cards. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, particularly when you look at U.S. branded Cards, we did start to see a tick up there as it relates to loan balances. The loans Were up about one percent year-over-year. They were up about 3% quarter-over-quarter. You know what I think is really important here is the market re-entry.  Because as you're seeing, purchase sales are up, but payment rates are still quite high. And we've got to see how stimulus and liquidity play out over time. And so what we're focused on is how we're reentering into the market, and we're doing that both through our Custom Cash launch, which is helping to drive new acquisitions. In fact, our new acquisition volumes are back to 2019 levels. Over half of those acquisitions are in proprietary cards.  We're being thoughtful about that, so over the last 5 years, we've been shortening our promotional periods and adding higher fees for balanced transfers, and targeting a lower mix of promotional balances. And those things, as you know, will feed future average interest-earning balances as our experiences that roughly half of those balances ultimately convert to revolving over time. So that's an important step.  The second thing that I'll mention is just to reiterate what Jane pointed out, which is worth thinking about lending more broadly. And we're driving growth on the On-Card lending products like Flex Pay and Flex Loan. And those don't have promotional periods associated with them and they start to generate interest from day one.  And so we're, we're keenly focused on this. We're obviously a big player here. It's obviously an important part of our portfolio and generates healthy returns. But we need to be positioned to capture growth. As the economy continues to recover and behavior normalizes and we need to be prepared if Behavior doesn't normalize as quickly as we'd like with things like broader lending products. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. My question is maybe just focus a little on rates. I think we're so focused on U.S. rates, but given your global exposure, we've seen rate hikes in Mexico, Brazil. Now we're contemplating rate hikes soon in the UK. How do we think about your rate sensitivity to the rest of the world? And do you see some benefits coming up over the next few quarters on the NII side? Mark Mason : Yeah. Look, I mean, we have seen a number of rate hikes, and then with the talk of rate hikes here in the U.S. As you look at our IRE that we report, we're not that sensitive to the short-end or long-end, but that said, the rate in price increases are beneficial for us. And so we've got a lot of liquidity that's available for us to invest as we see rates increase.  But also have enough dry powder to ensure that we're taking advantage of client demand as that starts to return as well. But for our firm, as you pointed out, the global impact on rates is quite important. And increases internationally helped to fuel our performance in parts of the franchise like TTS and elsewhere. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Good Morning. Thanks for your update on just the reiterated cost guide for this year. And I know, might early to talk about next year. But can you just help us understand just the moving parts underneath incentive comp transformation, and what we should be thinking about in terms of run-rate costs from here? If we can even stay away from what next year's growth looks like. But any color, the question that's coming up a lot for sure across the large bank group in terms of required investments versus other things going on at the bank. Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes. Sure. So look, let me start by saying, as I pointed out in prepared remarks, our expenses in the aggregate are on guidance, so to speak. Both as it relates to the transformation expected span which year-to-date is up 3%, as well as our total expenses which are up 5% year-to-date. Again, consistent with the guidance. As I think about this, those are 2 very important categories of spend. As Jane has pointed out, transformation's our top priority, and we're going to spend what's necessary to get that done, and we need to ensure that we're investing long-term across the franchise, and so we're going to continue to do that. But I would also highlight that expenses are something that we control.  So we're very deliberate about the spending that you are seeing. And in fact, I'm scrubbing -- we are scrubbing every single expense line that we have to ensure that the dollars that we're putting to work are being put to work in an optimal fashion, that they're necessary dollars to be spent. And in doing that, we're also looking for productivity and efficiency opportunities. And in fact, we've seen that play through the expense levels that you see today. If you look at -- if we -- as we look at our expenses, we've generated somewhere between 300 and $400 million quarter inefficiencies through 2021. Right. Expense management is something that we're very disciplined about, were very deliberate about, and we handle that in a very controlled fashion, recognizing the priorities that we pointed out.  I'm not going to give you guidance for 2022, I will tell you that our guidance hasn't changed for the balance of 2021. We're obviously in the middle of our budget season. And as we firm that up and finalize that, we'll share that with you and our investors more broadly. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi. My question's for Jane. Jane, you said on this call, it's a new Citigroup. And I'm just referring to the 8-K from August where it announced a bonus scheme for top executives. Apparently, that'll be broadened out to many more. And so we as shareholders and those who represent shareholders we see this bonus scheme before we see the targets, so my question is, do you have the targets, and if so, can you reveal those, although I suspect that won't be until March 2nd, or do you not have targets yet, or what's happening. Because either way doesn't feel good for us investors. Thanks. Jane Fraser : Mike, I'm actually really glad you brought this up, as we obviously saw your note the other day. If you'll bear with me for a minute, let's just take a step back and start with our compensation for Las Vegas. I think it's really important for our shareholders to understand this. So the compensation of the management team is designed to be performance-based. It's aligned with the interest of our shareholders. Most importantly.  So first, any of the deferred of what we have, have downside built-in and we clearly saw this last year in the PSU performance, which paid out only 28% of its target. And then, secondly, the annual process hold management accountable for is out as we also saw last year with meaningful comp reductions resulting from the consent orders. So then -- if we then turn to the transformation program, as I said in the opening, there isn't anything that's more important than the successful execution of the program. It's our number one priority. We want to make sure the bank is modernized in its risk and control environment and it will also benefit our shareholders in terms of the performance of the bank. The board and I hold the senior leaders driving that transformation accountable for its successful execution. I'm certainly driving this program with urgency.  And I also need to retain key talent because it's a pretty tight talent market right now, as we all know. And we need to do this so that we can hit the milestones and deliver with excellence. To hold people accountable and drive the outcomes, we need both carrots, and we need sticks.  And to your question, we're going to put in rigorous metrics, to determine if the rewards get paid out at all. And if so, what percentage will be paid out? And we laid out the criteria in the 8-K and the final metrics will be ones that reflect input from the Board, from me, and the other stakeholders involved.  And we'll make a note of, obviously, [Indiscernible] in the proxy, etc., so you'll see them. So as you can see, the main message for me is there will be consequences if we fall short of what is expected, just as there were last year for the management and the leaders of the program. I'm accountable, my team's accountable, and very simply we must and we will deliver. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I just want to, Jane, go back to -- you mentioned disappointment at Google Plex pulling out. Just talk to us in terms of did you view that as a critical client acquisition tool, and given that that's not moving forward, does that put some urgency in terms of other partnerships that you may strike to improve sort of the deposit gathering efforts? Jane Fraser : Yes, obviously as I said in the opening, we were disappointed in their decision. But it is just one part of our digital strategy. We certainly didn't have all the eggs in that basket, as we've been talking about for a few quarters now. And what I am pleased with is the strength of the digital engagement that we are seeing across the U.S. It's lagged in other geographies around the world across the industry on this dimension. And also the growth in a sticky digital deposit that we're seeing in the U.S.  The piece I like is we deliberately invested in very reusable capabilities for future partnerships and existing ones that we have, as well as our own proprietary efforts. I can try and make that come a bit alive. We've added APIs, which really make it very easy to operate with partners. We've developed a whole suite of embedded services that are ready to deploy. That's things like real-time, digital alerts, partner branded communications.  And probably most importantly, and maybe this is the geek in me, we put together new tech stacks and we've learned a lot about doing this. But it's very valuable for what we're doing right now and for partnerships going forward. So at the end of the day, I think all the things that we've been doing both in some of the work with Google, but also with partnerships around the world, is going to further our digitization strategy and U.S. consumers continue helping us grow and drive the returns here. And I would say, we're always feeling the urgency in improving the performance, the growth, and returns in the consumer franchises. Jennifer Landis : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hey, Matt. Matt O'Connor: So you submitted the plan to the regulators this quarter. Can you give us a sense of when you expect to hear back from them? And then what kind of things you'll be able to communicate to all of us. I know there are always limited abilities in what you can discuss about the regulatory stuff. But what are the data points that you're looking for internally, and when do you think you can share them? Jane Fraser : Yeah, as you heard from me, this is our number 1 priority. I think it's the benefit of all of us stakeholders that we get this done with excellence and we get this done right. And as we said, we submitted our plan in the 3rd quarter, I'm personally very proud of it. It is a multi-year plan.  As Mark said, it comprises six major programs. And it will position us to operate with excellence in the years ahead in a digital world. In particular, it provides very clear target states for our risk and controls and for our core operating model element. As we said, we've now firmly pivoted to executing that plan. And I have to say we have very constructive, and frankly, a really helpful dialogue that's been ongoing with our regulators. So is not as if you submit and then you haven't spoken as being -- This has been very constructive all the way through.  In terms of execution, in a way, we're going full steam ahead here. I'm really pleased with the caliber of talent we brought in from inside and outside of the firm, as Mark talked about, so we can ensure that we're executing with excellence, know some of the areas on new hires and data.  And I think importantly, with putting as much effort on culture as on modernization, Karen Peetz and her team are ensuring we have the capabilities and rigorous governance, so we're executing in a very disciplined way. We deliver the outcomes from the investments we're making. We put in a new accountability framework.  I have to say our board is certainly holding us firmly and regularly to account. So we'll be sharing more details, obviously at Investor Day and as we go through this, but I think the main message for me is we've pivoted to execution and we're getting on with this. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Jane. Just wanted to clarify this compensation 8-K that you talked about. You always had bonuses for short-term and you've had a long-term incentive comp that you always paid your Executives, similar to everybody else. So the transformation project seems to be over and above that, shouldn't that be part of what long-term compensation and incentive rewards are meant for? I'm trying to understand the logic behind adding an additional payment here is. Because that's what management is already being partly compensated for, which is longer-term moves and changes and performance. Jane Fraser : Look, I think it's exactly as I will first of all thank you. Thank you for that. I think it's as I said earlier in answer to Mike's questions. We want to drive the program with the agency. We need to retain key talent and it is a very tight talent market, as you know, and I want to make sure that there is no question from anyone involved in the programs that this is their number 1 priority, for the bank to execute this with excellence, that there are both carrots and sticks here.  And those come through the individual program and the individual assessments that everyone participates in every year, as well as in this piece. So I think this is fully aligned with the shareholders' interest. You want to have management incentives to deliver this with excellence, but equally with all the downsides if we fail to do so. And the program is designed to do just that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Andrew Lim with Associate General. Andrew Lim : Morning. Thanks for taking my question. It's a bit of a technical one. Wondering if you could give a bit of color on the SA-CCR implementation for the CET1 ratio in terms of the quantum of the impacts and the timing of the implementation? Thank you. Mark Mason : Sure. Thank you. Look, we're working towards the mandatory compliance date, which will be January of 2022. We've not adopted SA-CCR early and we don't plan to. Obviously, the impact can range from impacting risk-weighted assets to impacting one's G-SIB score. What we're -- like I said, we're working through that now. I'm not prepared to share that with you, but it is a factor in how we're doing our planning and we'll share that when we adopted it at a later day. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jane. How are you? Jane Fraser : Hey. Gerard Cassidy : Can you guys share with us, in looking at your Global Consumer Banking business in North America in your supplement, I think it's page 8, you guys give us a nice breakdown between the Retail Banking's, Citi -branded cards, and Citi Retail Services. And I noticed that in Retail Banking, there was a loss in the quarter. And can you just give us some color on what's maybe driving that and just the outlook for that part of the business? Thank you. Mark Mason : On the retail banking performance, the drag there is in part the higher expenses from the transformation spend that's playing through and impacting income there. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Hi, I just wanted to follow up again. The follow-up to my other question and as Vivek expressed. Jane and Mark, you mentioned that you have to serve regulator, it's number one. I think that's clear to everybody in this call. And then you mentioned serving stakeholders. I think the comp question really gets to -- what's being done for shareholders? And shareholders have been left behind at Citigroup over almost any time frame. And why -- and Mark, maybe I might disagree with the philosophy a little bit. Your philosophy said \"Is first serve clients, then investment business, then you do buybacks. \" What you definitely changed in your philosophy is because the discount to book value is just getting greater and greater. Your discount versus peer has increased. Citi has worst-in-class returns, adjusted efficiency, and stock market valuations.  So why not a little change in that philosophy to more buybacks versus investing, if you have such a great opportunity with your share price? So what can you do from a symbolic nature, as everyone gets paid in stock, or what can you do about the capital freed up from the sale of Australia and use all that to buyback stock, or what can you do to show that obviously regulars matter, stakeholders matter, but what can you do to show that shareholders also matter, given such the underperformance of the share price?  And then, since we're only giving one question at a time, just a little bit more follow-up on your U.S. consumer strategy as far as digital deposits, cross-selling credit cards, point-of-sale with Amazon, a little bit more on that. Thank you. Jane Fraser : Okay, Mike. It's Jane. Let's go, obviously. Let me kick this one-off. Unequivocally, our shareholders are incredibly important to us. And when we look at where we're trading on that and the underperformance around that, it is something that we all determined in the strategy refresh, in the transformation of what we're doing, and in the culture and talent work we're doing to address this.  We're going to do what is necessary to narrow the gap with our peers. We're going to ensure we have the right business mix and strategies to drive up the returns. And you're starting to see where that is -- where we're headed to with that from the different decisions we've already announced, and obviously, it will all come together Investor Day, but secondly, we're also going to do it by running the bank better. And we've laid out, on page 3 of the presentation, what are the different priorities so that our investors realize the value that we think lies in Citi and what we are going to be doing to unlock that for their benefit. I think -- I hope it's pretty clear in terms of the framework that we're using and the principles around that.  In terms of, as Mark said, from not only unlocking the value that we see in Citi, which I really do think is pretty tremendous and I'm quite excited about, is also then, what will we do with our excess capital? You've heard me say, given where we trade so disappointingly below book, obviously share repurchases make sense for our shareholders.  We also do have a healthy dividend yield, but that's an important part of the mix. But there's no question around the attractiveness for shareholders relatively at the stock buybacks. And we will certainly be returning excess capital to our shareholders and be very mindful of the bar that is required for investment internally.  And you've seen that with the decisions that we've made on the exits in Asia on Consumer and some of the other moves, that we will exit the businesses. We think of their returning and reinvest where appropriate, but we'll return that to shareholders. And I can see my CFO is chomping at the bit here to jump in as well. Mark Mason : Yes, thanks. I think you answered it very wide, I just add a couple of quick things. One, that when we invest in the business towards clients, or more broadly in the business, we're doing it where returns are above our cost of capital.  We're making smart decisions about how to redeploy that capital to ensure that we're narrowing that gap to peers. The 2nd thing I'd point out is that, in the 1st couple of quarters of the year, we've maxed out the capital return that was available for us to deliver before the SCB came into play. That is because our shareholders are so important. And then the third, as Jane mentioned, is that we have a skew towards buybacks. Again, just given where the stock is trading and given where our dividend yield is. So thank you for the question. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Thanks for squeezing me in here. Good morning, Jane and Mark. Jane, I was hoping to ask about the wealth management opportunity. And this is an area of great competitive intensity. You have a large -- many large peers have been investing heavily in this space for years. And I know you're going to cover some of this on Investor Day and provide more detail. But just at a high level, I was hoping if you could speak to what differentiates Citi's value prop from some of the peers in the space, whether you have the technology or infrastructure in place to support some of your growth ambitions. And then, just lastly, whether you can engage in M&A, or is that precluded under the consent order, if you were to look to expand into that arena inorganically. Jane Fraser : Yeah. Thank you so much, Steven. So I'm pretty pleased with our opportunities here because we have all the pieces to be very successful. We have a strong brand amongst the affluent, not just here in the States of our Retail Banking franchise. We've got a pretty heavily affluent base, but around the world, and when you go into Asia, in particular, this is the aspirational wealth management brand on the ground there.  We've also got a real breadth s of client relationships, and this is where the connectivity points also become important in those full principles that we laid out for the strategy refresh. We have Commercial Banking operations in certain geographies around the world, where they've been operating for many years now. This is the engine of wealth creation in the world, and we have a relationship with the owner already. And so, the synergies that we will be out to generate by much more closely connecting them will be very important. Similarly, the elevator from the affluent client base in our consumer franchise all the way up to the ultra-high net worth in the Private Bank is obviously a natural area to build out that we haven't really invested in that elevator.  I'm thinking of it that way. We have a great -- we have some great platforms. Our institutional client business around the world means that we've got top 2 platforms for our Private Banking clients, in particular, to take advantage of, but it's also ones that our consumer clients have as well, so the opportunity here is to bring all these different pieces together into a single integrated offering across the full spectrum of clients in the U.S. and in the global offshore Wealth centers.  And I would also point to the fact that we are already the top 3 players in Asia. It's not as if we don't have scale, and that this is a startup business here. And we've already seen that this is coming to fruition quickly. We obviously announced the focus on Wealth at the beginning of the year. We've already acquired 21.5 thousand new-to-bank clients in Asia so far this year. We've added over 500 bankers, advisors, and other front office support year-to-date. We've done one of the biggest tech releases for wealth in the 3rd quarter of this year, with over 70 plus features going live on the back of the digital platform we launched last quarter.  I think the fact that we got all these different pieces, we're putting them all together, is really giving us momentum and accelerating your opportunity for us. And this is a trend, the Wealth trend is going to be one that is one of those unstoppable trends, particularly at our Asia in the years ahead. We would look at acquisitions at the moment. Obviously, it's more focused around what are digital capabilities, what are other things to enhance the value propositions and the technological side. And those aren't just acquisitions, it's partnerships and the like that we've been investing in so that we really serve the wealthy client across the full spectrum of their needs, rather than just narrowly as some of the other players are. In just this [Indiscernible] investment products, we've got the benefit across the board. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jennifer Landis : Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to IR with any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you.

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions]  Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thanks, Jen, and happy New Year, everyone. I am delighted to join you again today. Well, we've been busy, and we have a lot to talk about today. I'm going to start with an update on our strategy refresh. Then I'll share my thoughts on our fourth quarter and end on all the progress that we've made against our major priorities. As you saw earlier this week, we announced that we intend to focus our franchise in Mexico solely on our institutional and wealth management businesses, and therefore, to exit the consumer small business and middle-market banking operations there. This was not a decision we took lightly. We took a clinical look at our franchise in Mexico, and we drew the hard conclusion that the noninstitutional businesses do not fit our new strategic direction. Now to be clear, these are terrific, they're scaled, high returning franchises. But our strategic goal is to invest in businesses that are fully aligned with our core strengths and to simplify our firm. As we did the work, it was also clear that there continues to be a tremendous opportunity for our Institutional Clients Group in Mexico. Citi is Mexico's leading institutional bank. We've served corporate clients and investors there for almost a century, and that isn't going to change. Mexico has a bright future, and we are committed to playing an important role in building it. We expect Mexico will be a major recipient of global investment and trade flows in the years ahead. Therefore, we plan to maintain a significant, locally licensed bank there and invest to capture growth in a core and high-returning hub of our institutional network. This won't be a simple transaction. We have spent the last several months working through how to get the best results for our shareholders and be true to our local stakeholders. We will begin the separation process immediately and expect to begin the sales process in the spring. And of course, there will be an opportunity to return excess capital from the transaction to our shareholders. This is our final decision in terms of market exits as we conclude our strategy refresh and approach Investor Day. I'm really looking forward to talking to you about the future Citi on March 2. Today, we are going to talk you through the changes we're making to align our organization and financial reporting with our refreshed strategy. Now these changes will also allow us to reduce structural complexity and its associated costs. Amongst other things, this is going to help make Citi easier for our investors to understand. You'll be able to see and assess more simply the core businesses that make up Citi going forward. First, we're creating a new personal banking and wealth management segment, which will be run by Anand Selva. This will consist of two distinct reporting units : Our U.S. personal banking businesses; and our global wealth management business, which is going to include the private bank. Second, on the institutional side of the house, which will continue to be run by Paco Ybarra, we will begin reporting under three units : services, banking and markets. Services will include Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services, and this reflects just how important we believe these businesses are to Citi's future. Finally, we will create a new segment, legacy franchises, which will house all the businesses we intend to exit. We're going to begin reporting our financials along these segments and reporting units no later than the second quarter, to ensure you have the information you need to measure our progress and hold us accountable, and we really look forward to sharing our strategy and plans for how these businesses will work together and deliver for our shareholders on Investor Day in March. Now turning to earnings. We had a decent end to 2021. As you can see on Slide 2, we closed out the quarter with net income of $3.2 billion and EPS of $1.46. That includes a $1.2 billion hit to EBIT, primarily related to the wind down of our Korean consumer business. Excluding those impacts, our net income would be $4.2 billion, with an EPS of $1.99. Our net income for the full year of $22 billion reflects an improved credit environment and we had a resulting RoTCE of 13.4%. In ICG, we had another strong quarter in investment banking and gained share for the year in M&A. And we continue to make significant investments in talent, and we see a very solid pipeline of transactions ahead of us. Now while we could have had a better balanced performance in fixed income in the quarter, equities finished 2021 up 25% for the year. The rebound TTS is seeing in trade flows and cash volumes was not quite enough to offset the current rate environment, but it bodes well for 2022. Indeed, we think the cycle has turned for this business and it is poised to benefit as monetary policy changes and growth accelerates. You've heard Mark and I talk about improving the revenue mix of our institutional businesses as a priority, and it's yielding results with another quarter of strong momentum in fee growth across products. Parts of our consumer businesses are still weathering COVID's disruptive impact on customer behavior. In the U.S., strong purchase sales continued to be offset by elevated payment rates, but we did see loans increase in branded cards this quarter. Deposits and AUM continued to grow, with digital deposits up nearly 20% for the full year. For the year, we returned nearly $12 billion in capital to our shareholders and we grew our tangible book value per share by 7% to $79.16. We ended the year with a CET1 ratio of 12.2% on a standardized basis as we built the capital needed to resolve the impact of [stack up]. Now keep in mind, that regulatory change didn't take effect until January 1. While this caused us to temporarily pause our stock buyback, we will resume buybacks this quarter now that, that impact has been addressed. Finally, as Slide 3 shows, we are executing and delivering against our priorities : The strategy refresh, the transformation and our culture, and we are doing so with a real sense of urgency. First, on the strategy. We are laser focused on swiftly and successfully implementing the strategic decisions we made over the past year to improve returns to our investors. We have signed deals in 6 of the Asia consumer markets including the agreement to sell 4 markets that we announced yesterday. This means that within 8 months of making the decision to exit these 13 businesses, we have a clear path in a majority of them, and we are well into the process in the remaining markets. In Korea, we were decisive in determining the best path for our shareholders was to wind down our consumer operation, and we're able to get most of that charge behind us this quarter. Another area where we haven't wasted any time is wealth management, where we grew our ranks by a net 800 advisers relationship managers and others over the course of the year. They helped us add about 750 private bank clients and 45,000 Citi gold clients in 2021. In what we know as U.S. Personal Banking, we've seen good uptake of new products such as the custom cash card, and we've been building out digital platforms to capture opportunities in installment lending. And in addition to the progress we're seeing in TTS, we've also been building out our security services platform. We couldn't be more pleased to deepen our relationship with BlackRock by becoming the largest custodian for their iShares ETFs. Second priority, we continue to execute on our transformation agenda in order to demonstrably strengthen our risk and controls as well as modernize our bank for a digital world. This work, it's foundational for everything we want to achieve. We are enhancing our operating model to improve long-term efficiency and our service to clients. As it relates to the consent orders, we are deep into execution mode. We continue to be in constructive dialogue with our regulators as we get their feedback and incorporate it into our ongoing execution and project plans. Third, and relatedly, we are building a culture that expects excellence and demands accountability. We're driving this effort in a variety of ways, including a more robust performance management process at this past year-end, shifting the mix of compensation to better align with shareholders' interest and various culture-changing initiatives.  A culture of excellence also means creating a record of achievement that our people can be proud of. One area that our people take particular pride in is our ESG efforts. Later this month, we will share with you our plan to reach net zero by 2050, a commitment I made on my first day as CEO 10 months ago. And of course, we are going to do all this with a singular focus on our clients as we help them navigate COVID. We certainly hope Omicron is the final disruptive phase of this pandemic, but there are also quite a few other issues to navigate, whether macroeconomic, such as inflation, or geopolitical such as tensions with Russia. We have seen the resilience and the importance of Citi as we supported our clients through unchartered waters, and we will be with them in the next chapter as well. So now I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we would be delighted to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start by walking you through the financial reporting changes we plan on making in more detail. Then I'm going to walk you through the 2021 financial impact from the 13 Asia market exits as well as Mexico, and changes we are making to our financial disclosure. And then finally, the quarterly results. As part of our strategy refresh, we've started to make changes to better align with our vision and strategy. We refreshed our earnings presentation and included additional metrics and key drivers for the ICG businesses. Our goal is to simplify our financial reporting to make it much easier for our investors to understand our performance and our key assets. Turning to Slide 4, we lay out the details of the changes in the financial reporting that Jane mentioned. First, we intend to move the consumer, small business and middle market banking operations of Citi Banamex, and the 13 Asia consumer exits under a new segment called Legacy Franchises. This will allow you to better understand the financials of the remaining company that will exist post these exits. We've experienced managing businesses being divested and are putting a dedicated team in place to manage the new segment. This will free up the management teams of the go-forward businesses to fully focus on executing on the firm's strategy. Second, we are reorganizing our reporting units to help you better understand the financials of our businesses and the value they bring to Citi. Starting with ICG, we will move TTS and security services to a reporting unit called Services. These businesses are foundational for us as they have a unique position given their global footprint and full suite product offering. Markets will, therefore, no longer include security services and instead will only include equity and fixed income markets. And lastly on ICG, banking will only include advisory, equity underwriting, debt underwriting and corporate lending. The Global Consumer Bank, GCB, will be renamed Personal Banking and Wealth Management, PBWM. The Private Bank will move from ICG to PBWM.  As a reminder, we announced in January of last year that we created a single wealth management organization under Citi Global Wealth, now called Global Wealth Management, which is a distinct reporting unit. The creation of this unit unifies the wealth management teams creating a single, integrated platform serving clients across the wealth continuum from the affluent segment to the ultra-high net worth clients. North America Consumer will be renamed to U.S. Personal Banking and will remain a reporting unit under PBWM. This unit will continue to include branded cards, retail services and retail banking. We plan on providing the financials for the new reporting units on this page under the ICG and PBWM segments, starting no later than the second quarter earnings. And our Investor Day will be a natural opportunity to bring together all the work over the past year and lay out our medium-term vision and strategy for the firm. Slide 5 shows the contribution of the Citi Banamex businesses that we plan to exit as well as the contribution from the 13 Asia markets. Hopefully, this gives you a better sense of the financial results for the combined exits. And in the appendix on Page 18, we have more detail on the 13 Asia exit markets and the deals that we've announced to date. Turning to Mexico. As Jane mentioned, we remain committed to Mexico and will continue to serve our institutional and private bank clients there. That said, upon very careful consideration and analysis, we decided that we are no longer the optimal owner for the businesses that we're exiting. Mexico consumer and small business banking operations included in the intended exit represents the entirety of the Latin America Global Consumer Banking unit and the Mexico middle market banking business that is currently included in Citi's Institutional Clients Group segment. On the left side of the page, we show key figures for 2020 and 2021 for the businesses we intend to exit in Mexico. In 2021, the businesses contributed $4.7 billion of revenue and $1.1 billion of net income. The businesses in total had $20 billion of loans, $31 billion of deposits and approximately $4 billion of allocated TCE. Again, we do not yet have a transaction and are pursuing multiple divestiture path, so the ultimate financial impact of a transaction is not yet known. We will keep you updated on our progress as we run a thoughtful process that takes into consideration what is in the best interest of our shareholders as well as our clients and employees in Mexico. In addition to the opportunity to return additional capital to shareholders, these divestitures will also allow us to simplify the management and organizational structure across the firm. Now turning to Slide 6. As we've gone through our strategy refresh and simplification, we've been reviewing our disclosure in terminology and have decided that now is the right time to more closely align with our peers. First, revenue that we previously referred to as net interest revenue will now be called net interest income, and revenue that we previously referred to as non-NIR will now be called noninterest revenue. Second, as you can see on the page, we've revised how we account for insurance paid on our deposits, including FDIC and foreign deposit insurance. We have previously accounted for the deposit insurance as a control revenue and net interest income. However, beginning this quarter, we will report it as an expense and remove it from net interest income. And as a reminder, this change is earnings neutral. We've made this change to make it easier for you to compare us to our peers, and we have revised prior years to reflect the same reporting treatment to assist with comparability for 2019 to 2021, and the rest of the presentation will also reflect these 2 changes. On Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and an EPS of $1.46, an RoTCE of 7.4% on $17 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are costs of approximately $1.2 billion primarily related to the voluntary retirement program we offered in conjunction with the wind down of our Korea consumer business, as well as some additional Asia exit impacts which I will collectively refer to as the Asia divestiture impacts going forward. Excluding these impacts, EPS would have been $1.99, with an RoTCE of approximately 10%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 1% from last year as strength in noninterest revenue driven by ICG, specifically TTS, Security Services and Investment Banking, was mostly offset by lower net interest income across GCB and ICG. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, an increase of 18% versus the prior year. Excluding the Asia divestiture cost, expenses would have increased by 8%.  Increased expenses were largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a net benefit in the quarter, primarily driven by an ACL release of approximately $1.4 billion related to the improved macro backdrop and continued improvement in portfolio quality. Now turning to the full year. Our revenues were down 5%, driven by the normalization in markets as well as elevated payment rates in consumer, somewhat offset by strong noninterest revenue growth across ICG and in particular, in investment banking, TTS and security services. Our full year expenses were up 9%, but excluding Asia divestiture costs, our expenses were up 6%. Also for the full year, we generated RoTCE of 13% and 14% excluding Asia-related divestiture impacts. As a reminder, we had a benefit of close to $9 billion in ACL releases for the full year. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2021, excluding Asia divestiture impacts, expenses were up 6%, in line with previous guidance. Looking forward, we recognize that we have a lot more work to do. The divestitures provide an opportunity to simplify our management and organizational structure. We're also taking a hard look at our structural expenses, with an eye towards operating as efficiently and soundly as possible and self-funding investments. We have a lot more to say about this at our Investor Day. On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $130 million on a sequential basis, driven by North America Consumer. Sequentially, net interest margin remained relatively stable. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income was flat. Also on a year-over-year basis, average deposits grew in the quarter as we continue to deepen relationships with our institutional clients as well as our consumer clients, particularly in North America. Average loans were roughly flat year-over-year as growth in the ICG was offset by a decline in GCB. As the probability of higher rates has increased over the last few quarters, let me make a few comments regarding the potential impact from higher rates. In our 10-Q, we disclosed interest rate sensitivity assuming a parallel shift and a runoff balance sheet. This is different from our peers' methodology, which tends to assume a static balance sheet. Assuming a static balance sheet and a 100 basis point parallel shift, we would expect Citi's total net interest income across all currencies to increase by over 3x more than what was disclosed in our third quarter 10-Q, or roughly $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. On Slide 10, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.3 trillion balance sheet, about 25% or $530 billion consists of HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. And we continue to optimize our balance sheet, deploying excess liquidity into securities as we took advantage of opportunities in the market, as well as reducing our short-term and long-term debt sequentially and year-over-year. On the loan side, corporate loans represent approximately 60% of total loans with loans to corporates outside of the U.S., representing approximately 30% of total loans. And as we've mentioned in the past, about 80% of our total corporate loans are investment grade. From a capital perspective, we ended the year with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 12.2%, as we prepared to adopt SACR on January 1. Having adopted SACR and maintained our capital ratio target, we are resuming buybacks this quarter to similar levels to what you saw in the second and third quarter of 2021. As we look into the remainder of the year, there are a number of variables with respect to capital. These include regulatory headwinds that are impacting us, along with the rest of the industry, such as elevated GSIB surcharges, as well as the timing and impact from the divestitures of the 13 Asia exits and Mexico. In light of this, you should expect us to manage to a CET1 ratio closer to 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GSIB surcharge increase at the beginning of 2023. That said, we remain focused on all aspects of capital with the goal of maintaining a CET1 ratio of 11.5%. And as you know, under the SCB framework, we can assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks, and we will continue to do so throughout the year with the goal of returning excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased 4% year-over-year, driven by investment banking, private bank and security services fees, partially offset by a decline in markets. Expenses increased 10% year-over-year, driven by transformation, business-led investments and revenue-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings.  Cost of credit was a net benefit of approximately $300 million as net credit losses were more than offset by an ACL release. And we continue to see strong credit performance, with net credit losses declining on a year-over-year basis and nonaccrual loans down sequentially and year-over-year. This resulted in net income of $2.5 billion, down approximately 22% from the prior year, largely driven by the higher expenses and a smaller ACL release versus the prior year. And ICG delivered a 10.8% RoTCE for the quarter. We also saw a 5% growth in both loans and deposits on a year-over-year basis as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. As for the full year, ICG delivered approximately $16 billion of net income on $44 billion of revenue with an RoTCE of roughly 17%. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and key drivers for our ICG business for the fourth quarter. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were slightly down versus the prior year, driven by continued headwinds from rates offset by 18% growth in fees, in fact our highest fee quarter ever. And revenue did increase sequentially, driven by both net interest income and strong fee growth. We continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS on a year-over-year basis that indicate continued strong client activity. Since this is the first time we are showing key metrics that demonstrate this momentum, I want to briefly walk you through each one and what it represents. U.S. dollar clearing transactions are up 4%, which reflect the clearing and settlement activity of commercial and treasury flows for financial institutions. Cross-border flows were up 15%. These flows represent our global payment flows, where we provide cross-border solutions for our clients that are fully integrated across our TTS and Markets business and over 145 currencies. And importantly, this client activity drives recurring fee revenues and generate significant operating deposits. Commercial card volumes, which reflect travel, purchase and virtual card activity across all clients are up 48%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and, on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Investment banking revenues were up 43% year-over-year, driven by growth across products, including record advisory performance, the best advisory quarter we've had in over a decade. Private Bank revenues were up 6% year-over-year as we continue to see strong momentum in new client acquisitions. Overall markets revenues were down 17% versus last year. And while there were different dynamics that played through fixed income and equity markets performance, the performance is against a very strong quarter last year. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 20% year-over-year. While we had solid growth in FX and commodities, this was more than offset by a decline in rates and spread products. Equity Markets revenues were down 3% year-over-year as continued growth in prime finance balances and structured activities was offset by a decline in cash. Security Services revenues grew 5% year-over-year as fees grew 11%, driven by higher settlement volumes and higher assets under custody, partially offset by interest rate headwinds. Now turning to Slide 13. Here we show the results for our Global Consumer Banking business for the fourth quarter in constant dollars. Revenues declined 6% year-over-year, driven by lower revenues across regions. Expenses were up 34% year-over-year, driven by the Asia divestiture costs. Excluding these costs, expenses were up 9%, driven by transformation and business-led investments, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $105 million benefit this quarter as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. The NCL rate for the quarter was 1.2%, a decline of 61 basis points year-over-year and 20 basis points sequentially. We released over $900 million of ACL this quarter related to continued improvement in our economic outlook and portfolio quality, partially offset by volume growth.  This resulted in a net income decline of 42% and an RoTCE of 8%. Excluding the Asia divestitures impacts, Net income would have grown 44% and resulted in an RoTCE of 20%. As for the full year, GCB delivered $6 billion of net income on $27 billion of revenues, with an RoTCE of 17% and 22% excluding Asia divestiture impacts. On Slide 14, we show GCB revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics for the fourth quarter. Branded cards revenues declined 3% year-over-year on higher payment rates and portfolio mix. We're seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 43%, card sales volumes up 24% and average loans up 3%. In fact, the fourth quarter acquisitions exceeded the same quarter in 2019 by 2%, the first quarter to do so since the onset of the pandemic. Retail Services revenues declined 10% year-over-year, driven by a 2% decline in net interest income due to elevated payment rates as well as by higher partner payments driven by improved credit performance. But despite this, we are seeing positive underlying drivers with account acquisitions up 6% and spend up 16% on a year-over-year basis. While we're encouraged by these underlying drivers in both cards businesses, payment rates do remain stubbornly high, impacting our loan growth and revenue growth in both cards businesses. Retail banking revenues declined 6% year-over-year driven by lower deposit spreads as well as lower mortgage revenue. However, underlying drivers remained strong, with deposits up 13%, Citigold households up 9% and assets under management up 8% year-over-year as we continue to execute on our North America retail strategy with a focus on our global wealth unit. Asia revenues declined 7% year-over-year largely driven by rate headwinds and higher payment rates. Performance in the wealth hubs exceeded that of the overall region with deposit growth of 12%, AUM growth of 13% and 16% growth in Citigold and CPC clients. Latin America revenues declined 3% year-over-year, mainly due to lower loan volumes in both retail and cards. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased year-over-year, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down year-over-year, largely due to the wind down of legacy assets. Cost of credit was benign. At this point, we typically give a full year outlook. However, since we have our Investor Day coming up on March 2, we plan on bringing everything together at that point to talk about 2022 in the full context of our strategy and medium-term performance expectations. As part of our strategy refresh, our goal is to be as simple and transparent as possible. And I hope you like the new earnings presentation, and we will continue to evolve it going forward. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of John McDonald with Autonomous Research. JohnMcDonald: Good morning. Mark, thanks for the - all the detail there, and Jane, for the strategic update. Mark, I wanted to ask if you could just go over the restatement of the net interest income sensitivity. Just want to make sure we caught that. What's the difference that's driving the new presentation there? And just what are the key drivers for your net interest income outlook this year? You might not have to give a number, but kind of when you think about trading and then core NII card growth, maybe some of the thoughts there. Thanks. MarkMason: Sure. Thank you, and good morning, John. So on Slide 9 is where I kind of covered that. You will recall, John, that historically, we have looked in our disclosure at a run-off balance sheet. And that obviously has deposits running off as they term out, that has loans running off as they mature. Others take an approach where they look at a static balance sheet, right? And so we've run the analysis around assuming a static balance sheet and assuming a 100 basis point parallel shift in a rising rate environment, obviously, across all currencies. We obviously have a mix of U.S. dollar and foreign currencies as well. And when we run that analysis, now assuming that the balance sheet is static, that is the deposit levels, loan levels, et cetera, that delivers 3x more than what we disclosed in the Q -- in the third quarter. So that's the $2.5 billion to $3 billion of net interest income. So obviously, retaining -- or assuming that the deposit levels stay the same, allow us to generate more net interest income and that's a major driver in the number range or the range that I provided. In terms of\u2026 JohnMcDonald: Got it. MarkMason: Sorry? JohnMcDonald: Yes. That\u2019s helpful. MarkMason: Great. In terms of the forward look, I'm not going to give you guidance, as you mentioned. But I think there are a couple of things that are important to keep in mind that we're looking at for 2022. One is the drivers that we mentioned earlier. So a lot of the underlying drivers in our franchise look very strong and are driving healthy fee revenue growth. And I would expect with an outlook for positive GDP that, that's going to continue to play to our advantage in 2022. The second thing I'd point out is the assumptions around interest rate hikes in 2022. I have many as three or four depending on the economists' view that you listen to. And that obviously is going to play to our favor as well when you think about the number of accrual businesses that we have, whether it's our TTS franchise, or our private bank, et cetera, et cetera. So those are important factors that impact the top line, and that we expect to help contribute to some growth coming out of 2022. I mentioned the loan growth on the branded cards portfolio. For cards, it's really going to be about payment rates. I mean, how they taper off \u2013 hopefully, taper off. They've been stubbornly high through all of 2021. So hopefully, we start to see some of that taper off and we get a little bit of growth in average interest-earning balances in the back half of the year, but those are important factors that need to play through into 2022. JohnMcDonald: Okay. Great. And then just as a follow-up, as you're managing capital, you mentioned you'll return to some level of buybacks this quarter, and you've got a lot of capital that you expect to free up in transactions that haven't happened yet. So I guess, how are you kind of thinking about that, that future capital is something that you'll deploy as you get it? It's part of your long-term thinking, but you're not planning on using that throughout this year, I assume? MarkMason: Yes. So obviously, we look at capital planning with a -- in the context of our strategy and our ability to actually deploy that capital, but to return as much excess capital as we can to our shareholders. And so as we think about the divestitures, which are underway as that capital frees up, we're going to factor that into the capital plan for the year and the quarter. And where we can, we're going to return that to shareholders. So a number of deals are scheduled to close in 2022. That will be part of our plan, and we'll be looking forward to taking those actions in the outer part of the year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: Hi. For you, Jane, and I'm going to re-queue after my two questions, I got so many. But thank you for the new presentation. But the biggest question that I and, I think, many investors have, is when all is said and done, who is Citigroup? What's the most simple statement you can give on who and what Citigroup represents? JaneFraser: All right. I love that question. So I would say that our vision for Citi is to be the preeminent bank for institutions with cross-border needs. We'll be a leader in -- global leader in wealth, a major player in consumer payments and lending in the home market. And that is future Citi and our vision for it. It's simplified, more focused. It's much better connected. It's certainly simpler to operate, characterized by culture of excellence and accountability. And I think as I hope we've shown today, one that should be easier for everybody to understand and fully aligned with our shareholders' interest. MikeMayo: And along those lines, are you freeing up what, about $11 billion of capital now? And intentions -- Mark, I always hear you say you're going to invest in the business, you're going to do supply for growth and then you're going to buy back stock. But in terms of a stock price that's this low, I mean, the stock price relative to the financial index is one of the all-time lows. Wouldn't you move buybacks up in the priority order? Or what else can you do or say to show that shareholders matter? Jane, I mean, you've done so much on the E side. You certainly have done a lot on the S side. But the G in ESG, when it relates to shareholders, shareholders have been left back for so long. Just seeing what else you might be able to do or say as it relates to recognizing shareholders and their desire to have a stock price that does better? JaneFraser: Our shareholders are an enormous priority for us. And Mike, I know we need to make the bank more shareholder-aligned and friendly, and we are doing so. So let me give you four examples. Our strategy will generate and we will return excess capital to shareholders. And as you say, given where the stock is trading, it makes buybacks highly attractive. Second, we're taking the structure and strategic decisions to put the bank in the best position to drive shareholder value. And you can see we're executing and we are delivering with urgency, and we're very driven to get the valuation in a far higher place than it is today. Third, we're changing many elements of the financial reporting that's easier for our shareholders to understand the bank, and we're going to be as transparent as possible, so you can measure our progress and results. And I think the structure that Mark laid out and I gave a high level on, it will make that job much easier.  And then finally, and a topic I know you've been quite vocal around, we are also making changes to compensation. So more of our senior business leaders will be on the PSUs for this coming year. We've moved to 100% deferred stock versus a mix of stock and cash in the geographies that we're permitted to do so. And we're increasing the importance of returns in determining performance evaluations. There is a myriad and rounds of different actions that we're taking because our shareholders matter to us. And we want to get our valuation up to one that we think has -- realizes its full potential Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. GlennSchorr: I'm going to turn on just for the sake of your answer. I personally love the management teams are buried in the stock that they asked investors to invest in. To be a leader in all those areas that you want to be in [indiscernible] question, you spend a lot to keep up. And so my question is, how do you balance doing all that and both in profitability gap with spending enough and feeding your franchises to the leaders and yet to be extensive front, it seems like so hard of just what the [indiscernible] you thought. MarkMason: I have to apologize. You broke up through much of that question. Would you mind just repeating the tail end of it. There's a lot of static on the line here. Say a little bit more. We're getting a lot of static, should we come back? GlennSchorr: Sure thing. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. BetsyGraseck: So a couple of questions. One, just thinking through the walk from where you are today in CET1 until end of the year when you mentioned you'd be ending the year at 12%. You have some businesses that are exiting, which should reduce RWAs, I would think. But then you've got the buybacks as well coming through. And at the same time, I would expect that you'd probably want to grow your RWAs? I know your RWAs were down 5% Q2 and maybe that was part of the reason why [SACR] was a little light. So could you help me understand just how we should think about that trajectory and the drivers of that CET1 change, because it will have some impact on how we're thinking about the rev growth in the markets business. MarkMason: Yes. Good question. So we are looking at, obviously, how we continue to invest in the franchise, particularly where there are areas of growth. At the same time, ensure that we're delivering buybacks or share -- return to shareholders. As I look at the CET1 ratio, we're ending the year at about 12.2%. As you know, SACR kicks in -- or has kicked in on January 1. We're ending therefore, on January 1 at roughly around where our target is. And over the course of the year, we'll be able to absorb growth in the businesses where there is a need to do that while continuing to identify offsets to both SACR but also low-returning assets that we may have and ridding ourselves of those and generating income as well as the capital from the divestitures that we will be able to close throughout the course of the year. And so as we look at that plan, the start of the year, which is close to our target, towards the end of 2022 we will have to build that back up to about 12% in order to absorb the GCIB headwind, assuming there's no relief provided to that, which then kicks in at the beginning of 2023. And so through the course of the year, we'll utilize through RWA, we'll free up capital and return capital to shareholders. We'll generate more earnings. But at the end of the year, we'll need to kind of end on the higher end or towards that 12%. BetsyGraseck: Do you have a sense as to how much the benefit to like GCIB or SCB should be from all the divestitures you're doing? I was actually thinking when I saw the Mexico news this week that maybe that was one of the reasons why you decided to put -- to exit the Mexico consumer business is potentially the pickup that you get since you mentioned it makes you a simpler company and that should feed into CB, I would think. . MarkMason: It's not a major driver as to the decision, as Jane has kind of framed out. But it is -- but it does factor into the points that you've raised. So from a GCIB point of view, there's, I don't know, $31 billion or so of deposits that are tied to our Mexico consumer business. That would drive about 10 basis points or so, or 10 points I should say, on the GCIB score. The total for the divestitures that were -- that we've earmarked, it's about $85 billion in deposits. And so you can do the math that we'd get some benefit from that. You're right, and I don't have numbers that I would share at this point, but -- and in part because the Fed has to run their analysis. But you're right, from a CCAR point of view, when you think about the stress capital buffer, there's an impact to PPNR, but more importantly, to stress losses that will play through as well. As you know, that impact as well as the deposit impact won't really come into play until we've closed on these transactions. But it certainly is a factor to how we think about the longer-term capital planning. And it certainly is something that I'm going to talk more about at Investor Day on March 2. BetsyGraseck: Okay. And the low-returning assets that you were talking about exiting, is that like that's basically something like rates and the fixed income business? And should we expect some impact there? Or again, I'm just trying to tie together the 5% decline in RWAs in the comment that fixed income business was a little light this quarter. . MarkMason: Yes. Yes. There's -- I'm not looking to be specific on where the low-returning assets we're getting out, but we're certainly looking at our markets franchise to see where those low-returning assets exist, as well as to see where their client relationships that are single product and don't necessarily link across the franchise. And so this is something that Jane and I, along with Paco are keenly focused on. We realized that while we've seen growth in markets and in FIC, it has come with growth in the balance sheet, and we want to make sure that we're optimizing the use of the capital. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. ErikaNajarian: My first question is for Mark, please. And by the way, thank you so much for this new way of disclosing financials, I think this will be very helpful, and the NII sensitivity as well. I know we're going to get a lot more detail in March. But as we think about the expense base that would be remaining post the exits you've identified, could you help us get a sense of how much more growth would there be left in the remediation-related expenses, how aggressive do you plan to be in terms of investment spend in 2022? And do you think you've identified enough inefficient expenses within the franchise to help fund some of those -- both initiatives? MarkMason: Yes, great question. I'm not going to give guidance on 2022, but let me try and frame out how we're thinking about it because I think it is important. Both Jane and I recognize that we've got -- a lot of static we're getting, excuse me. So in terms of the expenses, we obviously have a large expense base. We've seen growth play out this year. But I think there's some real opportunities over time to attack the expense base, and that's exactly what we intend to do. So if you think about the divestitures, I'll stop here for a second. There's some $6.8 billion of expenses tied to divestitures. As those divestitures get closed out, some of that will naturally go away. The balance of that, which tends to be referred to as stranded cost, we are already putting in place a team to focus on attacking and driving out that stranded cost. The second point that I'll bring up around this is the transformation. The transformation has driven 3 percentage points of growth this year. I do expect that there's more growth associated with that, particularly since we're still doing more hiring. There's more tech spend that will be required. But the transformation over time will deliver efficiencies, will reduce the manual touch points, will drive straight-through processing and therefore, will allow for us to bring our expenses down. And the final piece that I'll mention is the strategy. And so Jane mentioned in our strategy, a focus on core businesses. And that's going to allow for us to look at the organizational structure and identify more simplification opportunities in the way we manage and run the firm. We do about $300 million to $400 million of productivity savings a quarter. That's not enough. We think there's more opportunity for efficiencies than that. And it's those opportunities that we're going to chase down in order to fund some of this investment spend that we expect in the next couple of years. More on that at Investor Day. ErikaNajarian: Thank you for framing that. Jane, this next question is for you. When you responded to Mike's question about your vision of Citi, you led with your vision of Citi as the world's corporate bank, if I could rephrase. How has your vision of Citi -- what does it include in terms of your funding base? There's a lot of conversation, particularly in the beginning of a rising rate environment about the natural gap that you have to your largest U.S. peers with regard to your naturally higher rate deposits, right? And so how do you envision your funding base evolving over time? And do you have any interest in significantly building out your U.S. retail deposit franchise? JaneFraser: So Erika, we've got a pretty diverse funding base. When we look at it from the institutional side, we've got the #1 TTS franchise globally. And that has material funding from our -- for our -- from our cash management and dominant position in cash management there. Our wealth franchise, both from the ultra high net worth down to the affluent clients is also a source of material and very attractive deposits and funding for us. Obviously, we are making the exits on the international consumer banking front. And we've been focused in the retail bank in the U.S. in driving digital deposit growth and continuing to make sure that, that business generates a stable, low-cost funding for the firm here in the U.S. And we'll expect to continue growing that going forward. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: It was sooner than I expected. Just a follow-up on the compensation changes. Yes, that's good news that people are paying in stock instead of just cash and stock. But you had the new bonus arrangement. I did not think that was finalized. But as part of the new bonus arrangement based on the next 3-year financial targets, is that still all cash? Or is that cash and stock? Or is that stock? JaneFraser: I assume you're referring to the transformation award. Is that correct, Mike? MikeMayo: Yes. JaneFraser: Yes. So that one, it's -- while it's paid in cash for the first 2 pieces, the last 50% is pegged to our 3-year stock performance. And we felt that, that was the appropriate balance here. As we said, transformation is our highest priority. We need to successfully address the concerns raised, and that's 100% in our shareholders' interest. One of the pieces that's important in that is that we need to have collective accountability to succeed in addressing these concerns. The shift in our culture -- and this award is one that is therefore dependent upon shared success versus individual incentives here. So it's an important part of delivering. And of course, if we fail to deliver, the outcomes of the transformation and they're not successful in the execution, there will be no award. MikeMayo: And when will we -- I guess we'll find out about those targets at Investor Day, so answering that question. As it relates to PSUs, how much was given in stock cash before? And how many people will this apply to versus where it was before? JaneFraser: The PSUs are given to the executive management team, and now we're extending that to the broader operating team, which includes the leaders of our major businesses. And you'll see that information delivered in the proxy when we issue that in March. So you'll get all of that information at roughly at the same time. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ken Usdin with Jefferies. KenUsdin: Mark, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the card business in aggregate, definitely starting to see a little bit of that balance. But I wonder if you could touch on, number one, like just how you're expecting that balance trajectory to go; number two, spend versus lend and how much you're seeing in that? And then three, just the losses are obviously just amazingly low, and how you would anticipate card normalization? MarkMason: Yes, sure. So -- as I've mentioned before, I mean when you look at what's going on with cards across the board, we are seeing increases in spend volume. So branded card spend volume is up 24%. Retail services spend volume is up 16%. So very healthy spend volume. People are using our cards, which is a good thing. In terms of the liquidity that's still out there in the market, even though savings rates have started to normalize, there's still a significant amount of liquidity that's out there in the market. And that's showing up in payment rates in both branded cards and retail services and, frankly, in some of the international card businesses as well. And that has not subsided. And so we did start to see growth in branded cards loans. Average loans are up 3%, branded cards. The end-of-period loans were up 5%. What matters a lot when you come out of a crisis like this is how you reinvest. And so we've spent a lot of time focused on targeting new customers and driving new account acquisitions. Our new account acquisitions are up 43% in branded cards. And we've been also driving that just generally across the board in retail services as well. So getting a good -- a very good response in terms of new accounts coming on board. We've also been focused on how we drive installment lending activity, just kind of to broaden the lending that we're doing with this customer base, and we've seen significant growth in our Flex Loan and Flex Pay products as we've targeted customers who have historically been transactors to really move them onto that product. So very good growth there. In fact, in 2021, we've not only gotten the growth just in aggregate. But if I look at kind of installment lending, we've got 90% of the total installment sales are in digital sales, which is another kind of low-cost acquisition approach that we've taken. So good underlying indicators there. But again, it's not until payment rates start to subside we would expect, hope that, that would start to show up towards the back half of 2022. In terms of the losses, which was the other part of your question, very low loss levels. You heard me mention the delinquency rates earlier. When I look at -- well, the loss rates earlier, when I look at delinquency trends, there's really nothing to focus on there. They remain quite low. And we don't see any signs or any areas of concern, I would say. But I would imagine those 2 would start to normalize as payment rates start to come down. KenUsdin: Great, Mark. And then just a follow-up. You mentioned the record -- or the strongest quarter in advisory in a while. I was just wondering if you could just comment broadly on investment banking pipelines across the product groups. MarkMason: Yes. The investment banking pipeline looks very strong. We ended the year with significant growth in advisory, up 146% year-over-year, well above the wallet. We've grown share there. ECM was up about 16%, again above the wallet. And really that, reflecting some of the fees coming from SPAC activity. So very good growth. EMEA and North America are both up year-over-year due to continued momentum in M&A. So we feel very good about it. We think the pipeline still looks very strong. We think the investments that we've made and bringing on bankers in some of the sectors we needed to beef up, sectors such as health care, technology, sponsors group, those investments are certainly starting to pay off. So we feel good about it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Glenn Schorr with Evercore. GlennSchorr: So I think we have a good long-term process in motion and measured in more than 1 year. But what do you think of the sort of -- it feels like returns have to go down before they go up. I know you have the overall goal to close the gap to peers. But between the capital that gets freed up, the GCIB buffer and the denominator, the capital markets partially normalizing some stranded expenses on sole franchises and then continuing to execute on these transformations, is it okay and is it normal? I think it's partially in our models that we go down first and then rise up? MarkMason: Yes. So thank you, Glenn. So look, if you look at 2021 with a 13.4% RoTCE and reserve releases that get close to $9 billion, I'd have to say yes, right? Because those reserve releases drive a considerable amount of that. Now it's important to compare that to 2020, where we had the opposite effect because we were building meaningful reserves. But as I -- as we look at the forward look, which we'll take you through in more detail, as Jane mentioned we're focused on core parts of the franchise that show the opportunity for growth and the promise for higher returns. And we'll -- that's where our energies are going to be focused, and we think that's what's going to help to drive improved returns over time. GlennSchorr: Fair enough, the reserve at least have a big impact. Okay, and then in terms of that growth, I think a couple of questions danced around this, so it will be short. But given your answer to what Citi is and wants to be in terms of premier franchise and all those industries or business lines, I should say, how do you balance the -- doing what's right for stockholders in the near term, drive stock return versus making sure you invest for the future? Because each one of those is super competitive. Each one of them has competitors as early as today or as recent as today, spending a ton of money to compete in those spaces. How do you balance that -- invest for the long term, be great versus improve the stock short term? MarkMason: Yes. So let me start and then Jane feel free to add in if you'd like. So the first thing that I think's important to remember is the focus that we're trying to put on these core franchises that drive returns over time. So we're prioritizing how we're going to allocate our resources and our investments in part through the divestiture activity. The second thing I'd say is that we are investing in the franchise for the long term, right, as opposed to trying to hit some short-term metric. And so that does involve us putting that money to work where there is client demand and where it leverages the competitive advantages that we have developed. And so that is the way we approach this with, again, an eye towards ensuring that we're clear and transparent with our investors. And that if there's excess, that we're returning that to our shareholders, so that is not just sitting on the sidelines and not generating returns that they would expect of us. JaneFraser: I'd also just jump in when you look at the different businesses that we are investing in, as Mark said, they're high returning ones. So our services businesses are much capital lighter, high return. Wealth management, the same. I think the opportunities that we've been seeing to continually increase share in investment banking, another high returning business. So that will certainly be helping us over time on that mix that you're talking about. And not everything needs an enormous investment. If I look at wealth, for example, you put the different pieces together that we've already got, and we're putting them into a single integrated business and proposition, it's not things that we're starting from scratch. So a lot of this is incremental. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. VivekJuneja: Jane, Mark, a quick one firstly. Now that you're exiting Mexico, Singapore and Hong Kong were not part of the exits when you announced the exit from the 13 markets in the consumer business. Are you going to stay on with the consumer business in those markets, or meaning a traditional consumer business as you've had for years? Or is that going to change? JaneFraser: No, we find the franchises we have in Singapore and Hong Kong, just given the nature of them, are really naturally tight to the wealth franchise that we are building and investing in there of our existing very strong platform, as you say. So we expect to continue to provide the range of different services and capabilities that we have because they are so complementary and help support our wealth business in 2 of the most major wealth hubs in the world. VivekJuneja: Okay, great. And a follow-up question, if I may have. The NII change, Mark, that you made, what deposit beta are you assuming there? And how much of the change is coming from U.S. net interest income versus the rest of the currencies? MarkMason: Yes. So we haven't shared our deposit betas. But as you would imagine, the betas tend to be higher on the institutional side than on the retail side. And so that piece -- and I'm sorry, the second part of your question was what? Vivek? VivekJuneja: The second part was how much of the change in net interest income from the interest rate sensitivity change, Mark, that you're making? How much is it U.S. net interest income versus the rest of the currencies? MarkMason: The increase is roughly -- roughly skewed towards the international. So I'd say of a $3 billion increase, I'd say, about 2/3, 1/3 international. VivekJuneja: Okay. And that's because that's where you were assuming that runoff? MarkMason: Sorry? VivekJuneja: That's where you were assuming more of the balance sheet runoff. MarkMason: Yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Charles Peabody with Portales. CharlesPeabody: Yes. A question regarding the regulatory and political risk to share buybacks. And I asked that because earlier this week in the Powell renomination hearings, you listened to the last 2 minutes of that testimony. Sherrod Brown went on a rail against buybacks in the banking industry. And then last year, I think President Biden had 2 speeches in which he spoke out against buybacks. So I'm trying to understand, is there -- I mean a transaction tax isn't going to stop you guys from doing buybacks. But are there other things being discussed out there other than just moral suasion to discourage buybacks? JaneFraser: We're going to do the right thing for our shareholders. And right now, particularly given where the stock is trading, buybacks are a very, very important and probably top of the stack for us action that we take. So no, we're very clear in terms of the importance of giving our shareholders back our excess capital. CharlesPeabody: No, I understand that you want to. I'm just trying to understand what the risk to your desires are from the regulatory or political side? JaneFraser: I don't believe there is one. We're extremely well capitalized. I think we've heard it consistently from Washington, the confidence in the capitalization of the banks both coming into and coming out of the pandemic, and we're not overly concerned on that front. MarkMason: We'll obviously adhere to regulatory guidelines as they exist or however they evolve, but that's exactly right. CharlesPeabody: All right. And then as a follow-up, just on that subject. Assuming these regulators are just getting into their seat, they're probably not going to be able to do anything this year on buybacks, but I'm assuming that they'll try and do something on buying backs next year. So you want to do as much buyback short term as you can, and you've talked about getting back to like a $3 billion pace here in the first quarter. How sustainable is that $3 billion pace? MarkMason: Yes. So look, I mean, it's -- first of all, with the SCB framework, we take decisions on the capital actions on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Obviously, there's another CCAR run that will all go through, that will determine at least part of the capital stack. And then obviously, there's the GCIB that's coming into play. So we factor all of those things in. In our case, as we develop the capital plan, we also will take a look at the divestitures. In some instances, the divestitures will generate TCE for us to return to shareholders. There may be other impacts from divestitures that are temporary in nature that need to be factored in. But it's part of an entire annual capital planning process that we go through that factors all of those things in. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gerard Cassidy with RBC. GerardCassidy: Can you guys share with us, when you think about the strategy refresh that is underway, are we 75% complete, 80% complete? Mark, you alluded to maybe some of the markets businesses that may not have the return as you want. It could be some area. But where are you there? And by the Investor Day, can we assume that will be completed? JaneFraser: In terms of the time line for this one, this particular exercise is drawing to a close in terms of what I call the big step back as a new CEO. So we said this is the last major structural decision that we're taking in Mexico, and we're now focused on pulling together everything from Investor Day. And that's where the new reporting structure, I think, that we've announced today, is also a very important foundation for that. So I'm confident that we've made the right big structural decisions and that we're looking forward to Investor Day, laying out the vision, the strategies and the plan for going forward. MarkMason: And let me be clear, Gerard, just in case I wasn't. I'm not suggesting we're exiting parts of our Markets business. That is not what I'm suggesting at all. What I'm suggesting is that as we would always do, we're constantly looking for opportunities to optimize the way we use our balance sheet, capital, RWA, et cetera, and where we identify the need to rid ourselves of low-returning and assets that we have, we do that, right? And so with rule changes like SACR and the like, either pricing will adjust or we'll have to take a hard look at some of those assets to see if it still makes sense. And that's more of what I meant than ever suggesting we were exiting part of the Markets business. GerardCassidy: No, they're very clear. And just as a quick follow-up. Obviously, some of the businesses you're committed to in the TSS and the investment banking area you guys clearly are players there, you have economies of scale. When you look at the other businesses that you're committed to stay in, where is the heavy lifting going to come from where you really kind of step it up to get those economies of scale similar to the ones that are quite obvious? JaneFraser: Yes, you're right. We have a number of businesses that are already extremely scaled in both markets. If we look at TTS, we are moving $4 trillion of volume daily there. So those are ones where the investments are much more around digitization, around data. And in terms of where are we looking at getting more to -- of increasing our scale, commercial bank is obviously one where we have commercial banking presence in 30 different markets around the world. And they're very focused on the same target market I talked about in the vision, which are those mid-market companies with global needs or multi-market needs. And then the other areas in terms of wealth, where we've already begun, as you can see from our earlier remarks, building out our frontline scale on the back of the platforms and other investments that we're making. MarkMason: And to your point, Jane, Commercial Bank this year, a huge opportunity to leverage more of the TTS offering that we have. We're already seeing diversification in the commercial bank in terms of CMO and other markets products, and the revenue this year was up 12% year-over-year, and similar strength in acquisition of new clients in wealth, but those are 2 key areas. I agree. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your next question is from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. EbrahimPoonawala: Just quick couple of follow-ups. Mark, on the capital return, I just want to make sure we hear you correctly. When we think about the $3 billion piece you're going to get back to in 1Q, moving forward, is there more upside risk to that $3 billion? Or could that be actually lower? I just want to make sure we have that right in terms of expectations. MarkMason: Yes. I'm not giving expectations for the quarter-by-quarter capital buyback decisions, n part because, as I mentioned, with the new SCB rule, we're able to look at it on a quarterly basis. So I'm not giving guidance beyond that. We'll talk more about the capital plan on March 2 broadly, right? EbrahimPoonawala: And just, I guess, going back, Jane, on U.S., I think the question is, is there something more meaningful that we should expect at the Investor Day? And it's fine if you want to hold it till then. Because if I recall correctly, you were a partner with Google. That didn't play out. The big question that investors have is, is there a better definition to the U.S. retail franchise? And I'm just wondering, will we get that at the March Investor Day or there's nothing radical that you have in store, at least in the near term as far as U.S. retail is concerned? JaneFraser: You'll be certainly hearing directly from Anand, who is responsible for that business on Investor Day. And he'll lay out all of our U.S. personal banking strategy of what we're looking at, both from our top 2 cards franchise and what we're doing in personal lending, as well as what we're doing in wealth. And then obviously, the retail bank and the supporting role it is playing for those 2 core drivers of growth for us in the States. So yes. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jim Mitchell with Seaport Research. JimMitchell: Mark, maybe on just the expenses, I appreciate all the moving parts with the divestitures and you're not going to give us a full year expense guidance number. But can you help on the jumping off point in the first quarter we had? Compensation was up about $1 billion quarter-over-quarter. How much of that was just sort of the comp changes? Or is that a good run rate to think about? So if you could just help us, just the jumping off point for first quarter, it would be helpful. MarkMason: Yes. You know what? I'm not going to be able to give you kind of more guidance on that. I mean what I would say is, again, you've got a couple of things that played through 2021 that will be important factors in 2022. One, the hiring that we've done, we're going to get a full year impact of that, at least for part of that in 2022. So that's going to play out. Some of the -- if you think about the mix for the transformation spend, which is a mix of both hires, third-party spend as well as technology, that mix will start to shift over time away from third party for sure and towards the others. And so we're going to have some of that dynamic start to play out in 2022. In terms of the comps, specifically in the fourth quarter, we obviously tie -- the comp performance for the full year is tied to revenues. And so as we would expect to see some forward growth based on the drivers I mentioned earlier, we would expect to see comp related to that play out over the course of 2022. But I'd rather not get into the specifics here, given that we're going to give you a better sense for it in early March. JimMitchell: Okay. Just maybe as a follow-up on that, just so I understand the sequential drivers, so you're saying it's mostly incentive comp? Or was that more new hires or both, just on 3Q to 4Q change? MarkMason: Yes. In 3Q to 4Q, you've got both hires as well as incentive comp. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. MattO'Connor: I just wanted to follow up. You had said the sale of Mexico wouldn't be an easy transaction. And was just hoping you could elaborate on that. And then just related, you talked about the capital is allocated to the business being freed up. But any kind of initial thoughts on whether the transaction -- the exit of the business will generate a gain or loss as we think about the combined or total capital impact? JaneFraser: Why don't I kick that off and Mark jump in. I just said it won't be a simple transaction because we separate the bank into the institutional business from the businesses that we're exiting, and that's something that we kicked off yesterday, that process. And then we'll be looking to go to the market in the spring and be active with buyers, potential buyers in a few months' time. So it's more just the complexity of separating the bank. We've got good plans behind this. And as I said in my remarks, these are terrific, these are at scale. These are great franchises. And there was obviously a lot of speculation in the press, which really is too early to comment on. But we do think this is a jewel for someone. It's just not for us. MarkMason: Yes, I agree. And I think it's premature to speculate on the structure of the deal and things of that sort. You're right, we do have about $4 billion of TCE allocated to the business. The other layer of complexity is around the CTA, and you've heard us spend some time on that when we talked about the Australia sale. And I introduced it as a complexity because there's an accounting treatment associated with the CTA that happens at signing, that is separate from the capital implication that happens at closing. So with a CTA, the capital impact flows through AOCI, but it's neutral once the deal is closed. And Mexico, the consumer business would have a DTA of a little bit less than $3 billion or so. And so that's another factor that's involved with the transaction. JaneFraser: CTA, not a DTA. MarkMason: Did I say DTA? I'm sorry, CTA, currency translation adjustment. Thank you. CTA. Thank you very much, Jane. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. StevenChubak: Well, actually, even before asking my question, I just wanted to echo some of the earlier remarks, the new presentation, the additional detail, it's really helpful. So I appreciate the new disclosure. Mark, I was going to ask -- well, I guess technically one question, but it's really a 3-parter. You might need to grab a pen and paper. But I wanted to just unpack some of the comments you made on the NII sensitivity and reporting differences versus peers. You noted a more than 3x increase in NII, assuming a static balance sheet, but there's still a lot of investors that just question your rate sensitivity profile given the fairly modest NII growth that we saw in the last cycle. And the first question, I just wanted to start by asking, given your heavier institutional deposit gearing, wouldn't it be reasonable for us to expect that your deposit runoff would actually be greater than peers? Two, does the NII guidance contemplate liability sensitivity in the markets business? And could you help us size that potential drag? And then just lastly, it's more of a catch all. Any idiosyncratic factors that you could speak to that would support a better NII outcome or higher rate benefit versus what we saw in the last cycle? MarkMason: Yes, sure. So look, we provided the sensitivity because we think comparability is important here. And you can see the magnitude of that difference is pretty sizable. There's still going to be a difference between us and peers, but that difference narrows when you put it on a comparable basis. We do have a skew towards institutional clients, and they do carry a higher beta associated with them. But we also have a skew towards international currencies and we make good spreads there as well.  In terms of the impact through markets, the impact -- I think the market's impact can come in any number of ways. I think rate moves and other uncertainty and volatility in the market can drive broader markets revenues, which we would potentially see depending on how investors have to reposition their books. In terms of the last part of your question, I don't think there's anything else that I would point to. I mean, obviously, with the excess liquidity that we've seen and been carrying in the market, we've been putting that to work in investments. We've increased our investment portfolio by some $70 billion. We expanded the duration to about 2.85, and we still have significant dry powder to -- with the -- work with either client demand or in an increasing rate environment, which we expect. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Jeff Harte with Piper Sandler. JeffHarte: I'm sorry, I thought I've taken myself out of the queue. My questions have been answered and you all must be getting tired. So I'm done. Operator : Your final question is from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. MikeMayo: I have one more question. What's the hardest part of the cultural change? JaneFraser: Probably it's been breaking down some of the silos. And that -- the point on the principles we laid out, Mike, have connected is really a key piece of it. We've -- we rolled out some new leadership principles last year, and it's very much around how do we get the firm very well connected and really realize the full synergies. So breaking some of those old habits, I would say, the new structure is certainly helping as are the different initiatives we're taking. MikeMayo: And how long do you think that will take? Because you're breaking down a culture that's been ingrained for quite some time. JaneFraser: Yes. I would say I'm really happy with the progress. We've been -- one of the first things I did was lay the front 2 on our culture out when I took over, and we've got a terrific team of people been working at this for a year. So I'm very happy with the progress we make. I think everyone is clear. We want the culture to be one of accountability, of excellence and acting with urgency and part of that is well underway. But it will take a little bit longer. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jen Landis : Thank you all for joining today's call. Please feel free to reach out to IR with any follow-up questions. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes Citi's fourth quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s First Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen. And I\u2019d like to start by reiterating my appreciation to those of you who participated in our Investor Day last month. We greatly value the opportunity to walk you through our refreshed strategy and our plans for the next few years. Given how much time we spent on our strategy that day, today, we will be focusing on the quarter. Nonetheless, as we committed, we will keep you updated on our progress and you can see the latest report card on Slide 2. Today is also the first time we are reporting quarterly results under our new segmentation, which will help you track our efforts. I have got to say it feels like an understatement to say that a lot has happened since Investor Day. So I am going to talk about the macro environment first. And then after I talk about the quarter, I will discuss how we are handling Russia and Mark is also going to go through it in more detail. We have been on the front foot since the potential for war first emerged and we intend to remain so. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and the sanctions it triggered unleashed an enormous supply shock on the world, further fueling inflation and placing global growth under considerable pressure. Back recently from seeing clients in Europe and the Middle East, it is security, energy, food, defense, cyber or operational resilience that has risen to the top of their strategic dialogue. The macro outlook for the rest of the year can only be described as complex and uncertain. And while my job is to prepare for all outcomes, our view is that strong nominal income growth and continuing momentum in the labor market will help support near-term growth in the U.S. economy in the face of inflationary pressures. But we expect material regional differences in the impact with economic growth in the individual consumer and businesses in Europe hit hardest. With central banks responding to inflation, we are entering a period of higher rates and a flatter U.S. yield curve. Energy and commodities are at the center of the storm globally, but we don\u2019t believe we are at the start of a new long super cycle and we do expect prices to fall to more normal levels. So, with that as a backdrop, I think the firm performed reasonably well this quarter. Earlier today, we reported net income of $4.3 billion, EPS of $2.02, and an RoTCE of 10.5%. These numbers include impacts related to the divestitures, so the underlying business performance was stronger to the tune of about 150 basis points of RoTCE. And let\u2019s turn to the performance of our five main reporting units. Well, given our emphasis on services, I am particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions, fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions buoyed by higher rates led to year-over-year revenue growth of 18%. Security Services also performed well despite the impact of markets with revenues up 6%. In our Markets business, our traders navigated a volatile environment quite well, aided by our mix with notable performance amongst corporate clients and strong gains in FX and commodities. This led to revenues almost equal to the very active first quarter of 2021. As you might expect, Investment Banking is a different story. While our performance on the advisory side was respectable, I think we can perform a bit better in equity and debt capital markets going forward, even if the wallet remains smaller. Our pipelines are healthy and loan demand is on the rise. Having said that, we don\u2019t expect robust activity in the capital markets to resume in the industry, until the geopolitical situation and client sentiment improve. In U.S. Personal Banking, we continue to see signs of how healthy and resilient the consumer is through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We see good engagement through key drivers such as card loans and spend volume growth. So, we like where this business is headed. Geopolitics dampened performance in Global Wealth Management this quarter. While revenues improved in the U.S., our clients in Asia pulled back on new investments and something we saw in our Markets franchise as well. As you know, we are hiring bankers and enhancing our client offerings such as Citi Alliance, which we launched last month as a unique platform to support independent advisers. As a result of these efforts, we continue to add clients in both the private bank and in Citi Gold. Turning to capital, we returned $4 billion to our shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends during the first quarter. We now have about 6% fewer common shares outstanding than we did a year ago. At the same time, a sharp increase in interest rates negatively impacted our capital through OCI and largely caused our common equity Tier 1 capital ratio to come in at 11.4% this quarter. I want to be upfront with you about the fact that the macro and geopolitical environment, which I spoke about, combined with the impacts of our divestitures, create both headwinds and tailwinds for our capital ratios this year. Now, whilst this will impact the level of our stock buybacks this year, we have a path to our year-end target of 12% and Mark is going to walk you through these details. And let me be clear, we remain committed to continuing to return excess capital to our shareholders. As you heard at Investor Day, we are focused on our transformation and we are making the investments in our infrastructure, risk and controls and also in our talent and our culture to modernize our bank and to make Citi a winning firm. I recognize that these investments impact our expenses and our returns in the short run. But I firmly believe that success here will not only lead to satisfying our regulatory obligations, but also to improving our competitiveness and our returns in the medium term. So far this year, we have announced new agreements to sell a further 7 consumer businesses in Asia and EMEA, the most recent of which were India and Bahrain. We are beginning the sales process in Mexico and there is significant interest in this iconic franchise. As you have heard me say, this is not an uncomplicated transaction, given we will be separating our operations in order to retain our institutional presence. We will take the time necessary to do this the right way and decide which transaction is in the best interest of our shareholders. And we will keep you posted on any developments concerning the three remaining markets : China, Poland and of course, Russia. We started to carefully reduce our operations in and our exposures to Russia in January and we benefited from being on the front foot here. We have been managing down our financial exposures both in level and composition and they are at a reasonable level, especially given the additional reserves we took during the quarter. We have also increased reserves for the second and third order impact of the war beyond Russia and Ukraine. And our intention to sell significant portions of our local business in Russia remains. We are in continuous communication with the U.S. government and we continue to do our part to enforce the sanctions regime. But I have run out of words to describe the tragic consequences of the war in Ukraine. I remain incredibly proud of how our people have risen to the occasion from every corner of our firm. Our people in Ukraine have kept our bank operating in the country, where they can help NGOs deliver aid on the ground and help society function as best as possible. And many of our colleagues have opened their homes to refugees and we will continue to help in anyway we can. So with all that is going on in the world, we remain laser focused on the execution of our strategy and our transformation. I expect macro environment to remain unpredictable to say the least in the backdrop of the war, which is equally tragic and unnecessary and a persistent pandemic. And I can speak to the last one personally, having just recovered from a brief encounter with COVID, as much as I would like to, I can\u2019t blame Paco for it. Now, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark and then we will be delighted to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Jane and good morning everyone. I\u2019m going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, then spend a little more time on expenses in Russia and end with the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the first quarter, we reported net income of $4.3 billion and an EPS of $2.02, with an RoTCE of 10.5% on $19.2 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are Asia consumer divestiture-related impacts that are detailed in the appendix of the presentation. In the quarter, total revenues decreased 2% as strength in net interest income driven by Services and PBWM was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue across businesses. That said, we continue to see strong performance in the key business drivers we shared on Investor Day, which I will walk you through in detail shortly. Total expenses of $13.2 billion increased 15% or 10% excluding the Asia divestiture-related impacts I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $755 million as net credit losses of $872 million were partially offset by a net ACL release. Embedded in the net ACL release is a Russia-related build of approximately $1.9 billion. This includes $1 billion related to exposure to Russia and about $900 million to account for the broader impact on the macro environment. This was more than offset by a release related to a COVID-19 uncertainty reserve, primarily in U.S. Personal Banking, given the continued resilience of the underlying portfolio, specifically in the U.S. As of today, we have about $17.9 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.35%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, we incurred some divestiture-related costs this quarter. These costs largely related to a goodwill write-down that we incurred in legacy franchises as part of our resegmentation and divestitures. It is important to note the goodwill impact is capital neutral. Excluding the divestiture-related costs, expenses increased by approximately 10%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two-thirds related to the risks, controls, data and finance programs and approximately 30% of that is related to technology investments. About 2% of the increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers. In addition, we are investing in technology across services, wealth and cards. 1% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses largely in markets and cards and approximately 4% and was driven by inflation and other risk and control investments partially offset by productivity savings. Across all of these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 12% for the quarter. On Slide 6, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. As Jane mentioned, as of the end of the quarter, our remaining exposure to Russia stood at about $7.8 billion, down from $9.8 billion at year end. And importantly, the mix of the remaining exposure has changed and shifted in a positive way. We have reduced our direct Russia country risk exposure from $5.4 billion to about $3.7 billion, which consist of loans, AFS, derivatives and off balance sheet exposure. The remaining exposure, which previously totaled $4.4 billion, now totals $4.1 billion and consists of deposits and cash with the Central Bank, reverse repos and cross-border exposure. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $700 million, down from about $1 billion at year end. And the currency translation adjustment or CTA related to our net investment stands at $1 billion. And as I mentioned previously, we took credit reserves of about $1.9 billion, with about $1 billion for direct exposure to Russia and another approximately $900 million for broader impacts given the macro environment. So, we feel we have reserved prudently at this point. In the normal course of our planning and risk management, we run a range of stress scenarios and we have taken the same approach with our exposure to Russia. And as a result of the actions that we have taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios, our potential risk of loss is now estimated at approximately $2.5 billion to $3 billion, down meaningfully from what I described at our Investor Day. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $50 million on a sequential basis as interest income from loans as well as higher deposit spreads were partially offset by day count. Excluding day count, net interest income increased by approximately $290 million. Sequentially, net interest margin increased by 7 basis points as lower average deposits in services and higher interest income from loans were partially offset by balance sheet growth in Markets. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $370 million, driven by cards, deposits volumes and spreads as well as income from the investment portfolio, partially offset by lower net interest income in Markets and we grew average loans by approximately 3% in both ICG and PBWM. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about 23% or $551 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. From a capital perspective, we ended the quarter with a CET1 capital ratio of approximately 11.4% under both standardized and advanced approaches, with standardized remaining the binding ratio, down from 12.2% at year end. During the quarter, we adopted SACR and absorbed a significant impact from the sharp move in interest rates. We will go into more detail shortly on the drivers of capital in the quarter. However, it is important to note that despite these impacts, we continue to expect to manage to a CET1 ratio of 12% by the end of the year due to the expected GCIB surcharge increase to 3.5% at the beginning of 2023. We expect the combination of net income generation, DTA utilization and capital generated by the closing of several of the consumer exits in Asia to be sufficient to reach the 12% CET1 ratio by the end of the year. As we said at Investor Day, we are committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders. And as we see a pull to par in the investment portfolio, reversing that $4 billion interest rate driven impact, we would expect to be able to deploy that capital over time. And as you know, under the SCB framework and given the uncertain macro environment, we assess on a quarter-by-quarter basis the right level of buybacks and we will continue to do so throughout the year. For the second quarter, we expect only a modest amount of buybacks and we will evaluate that level throughout the quarter taking into account market conditions. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 capital ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. As I just mentioned, our CET1 capital ratio ended the year at 12.2% as we have built capital to absorb the impact of SACR on our RWA. Post SACR adoption, our ratio stood at 11.8% as of January 1, 2022. Given the sizable impact of some of the drivers, I wanted to spend a minute to walk through the puts and takes this quarter and how we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of about 11.4%. First, we generated net income, which added 35 basis points. Second, over $4 billion of dividends and buybacks drove a reduction of about 36 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 35 basis point reduction. Fourth, the increase in disallowed DTA, largely driven by the reduction in CET1 due to the interest rate impact I just mentioned, drove another 15 basis point reduction. Finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of other factors, including a reduction in RWA. With all of that said, as I just mentioned, we have a path to a 12% CET1 capital ratio by year end and remain committed to returning excess capital to shareholders. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues decreased 2%, largely driven by Investment Banking partially offset by an increase in services revenue. And Markets declined slightly against a strong quarter last year. Expenses increased 13% driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was nearly $1 billion largely driven by a $1.5 billion build related to our exposures in Russia as well as the broader impact on the macro environment. And outside of Russia, we continue to see strong credit performance across our portfolio as clients\u2019 balance sheets remain healthy. This resulted in net income of $2.6 billion, down approximately 51% largely driven by the higher expenses and an ACL build versus a release in the prior year. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by trade finance. Average deposits grew 2% as we continue to see good momentum and deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions and ICG delivered an RoTCE of 11.2%. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you each quarter. In Services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and a deepening with our existing clients and we expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 18%, driven by growth in net interest income as well as strong fee growth with both commercial and large corporate clients. And we continue to see strong underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 54%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees, and on a combined basis, drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 6% as net interest income grew 17%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, and fee revenues grew 2% due to higher assets under custody. Overall markets revenues were down 2% versus a strong quarter last year. In the quarter, activity levels benefited from client repositioning and strong risk management in light of Fed actions and overall geopolitical uncertainty. Fixed Income Markets revenues were down 1%. We saw strong client engagement, particularly with our corporate clients in FX and commodities, with our rates business also benefiting from higher volatility. Spread products were negatively impacted by less client activity. Equity Markets revenues were down 4% compared to a very strong prior year period. In the quarter, we saw strong equity derivatives performance and grew prime finance balances. Banking revenues, excluding gains or losses on loan hedges, were down 32% as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted activity in debt and equity capital markets. Investment Banking revenues were down 43%, driven by the contraction in capital markets activity, partially offset by growth in M&A. Corporate Lending revenues were down 6%, largely driven by lower average loans. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues declined 1% as net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenue. Expenses were up 14%, driven by transformation investments, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $376 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. We had a net release of over $1 billion of ACL related to COVID-19 uncertainty reserves. I would note that even after this release, we maintained over $9.8 billion in credit reserves against our U.S. cards portfolios or approximately 7.6% of total loans. This resulted in a net income decline of 23% and an RoTCE of just over 23%. Adjusting for the ACL release, RoTCE would have been approximately 13%. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Credit cards revenues declined 1% on higher average payment rates and higher acquisition and rewards costs as we continue to see attractive investment opportunities and strong customer engagement. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts up 24%, card spend volumes also up 24% and average loans up 7%. Retail services revenues were flat as higher net interest income was offset by higher partner payments, driven by improved credit performance. And we are seeing positive underlying drivers with spend up 14% and average loans up 1%. While payment rates remain elevated, we believe we have finally begun to see some normalization. As a result, interest earning balances in branded cards were relatively flat on a sequential basis, while Retail Services grew interest-earning balances by 3% sequentially despite seasonally lower card spending volumes. Retail banking revenues declined 6%, largely driven by lower mortgage originations. Wealth revenues declined 1%, driven by less client activity and investments, partially offset by higher deposits. Investment revenues declined as geopolitical tensions impacted the capital markets, which resulted in clients pulling back their trading activity, particularly in Asia. However, underlying drivers remain strong, with average deposits up 14%, average loans up 5%, client assets up 4% and client advisers up 6%. On Slide 14, we show results for the legacy franchises. Revenues declined 14%, driven by lower revenue across the exit markets, largely driven by the Korea wind down as well as the muted investment activity in Asia. Expenses were up 31%, largely driven by the goodwill impairment I mentioned earlier, but again, this is neutral to capital. Cost of credit was $160 million in the quarter, driven by net credit losses, and as a result, net income declined significantly. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased significantly, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses are down largely on lower compensation expenses. And to briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook, at this point, we still expect to see low single-digit revenue growth and mid-single-digit expense growth, both excluding divestiture-related impacts this year. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, there, how are you? Okay. So when I first looked at the reserve release, even including the $1.9 million Russian reserve, we\u2019re like, wait, what economic scenario they are writing to, because everybody else added provisions. But now that you\u2019ve given us some of the color, start to understand it. So it feels to me, and correct me if I\u2019m wrong, you just were slower to release the COVID reserves, and it sounds like you still have a lot in the coffers with that 7.6% that you mentioned. So I just want to see if you can give a little more color between what you took reserves score? What you released reserves for? And if you tweaked your economic scenarios at all to get to the current reserve, if that\u2019s not too much to ask? Jane Fraser : Glenn, [why don\u2019t] [ph] I kick off and I\u2019ll pass it to Mark. So you are absolutely right. We had taken a rather conservative approach to releasing our COVID-related reserves in the U.S. Personal Banking business last year compared to some. We were comfortable that this quarter, that was the appropriate thing to do given the state of COVID and the U.S. economy. And with \u2013 as you can see from the numbers, with a 2.35% ACL coverage ratio and with the ratio that we have in cards, 7.6% in particular, I\u2019m very comfortable that we have a prudent and appropriate reserve level. But let me hand it over to Mark for the down and the dirty. Mark Mason : Yes. Good morning, Glenn, I think you captured it right in the sense we obviously did a build, a meaningful build related to Russia, the majority of the release was, in fact, tied to the COVID-19 management adjustment that Jane referenced. As we thought about these scenarios, as you know, we run a base scenario. We did tweak that a bit in bringing the GDP assumptions down from what they would have been in the fourth quarter, and that obviously also impacted kind of the outer years in our assumption. And the other piece is, when we look at the downside scenario, so our analysis for CECL is a combination of a base scenario and a downside scenario. Under the downside scenario, we did increase the severity of the downside to account for again a bit of the current environment that we\u2019re all managing through. So those puts and takes kind of netted out to what you see that we\u2019ve reported, which is a net release, but largely driven by those two drivers. Jane Fraser : And I\u2019d just add in, as Mark talked about in his prepared remarks, we took an additional reserve of $900 million for the second and third order impacts of the war and the impacts on supply chains and other pieces that are \u2013 as we look forward, we were concerned about for the global economy. It\u2019s a huge source of uncertainty as to what that will be. Mark Mason : Yes. That\u2019s part of the $1.9 billion, obviously. I would point out that when you look through at the underlying performance of the portfolio, they are still holding up quite nicely when you look at the performance of our consumer customers, whether you\u2019re looking at the NCL rate and where that\u2019s trending or you look at the 90-day delinquency and where that\u2019s trending still very strong. Even when you look on the corporate side, if you adjust for the Russia-related build and those drove a bit of the NAL increase, but still very strong performance there, too. Operator : Your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Erika Najarian : I just wanted to ask you a question, Jane and Mark on CET1. And wanted to make sure we get your investors get the message correctly. So from the 11.4, you said that net income capital release from divestitures and DTA utilization are going to be the drivers to build a 12% CET1 by year-end 2021. Obviously, AOCI is a wildcard, unpredictable. Perhaps give us a sense of should we then think about the buyback as just a fallout in terms of that equation, right? Is the first question. Number two, what is the desire to increase the dividend even nominally in this stress test year? And third, how does the DTA impact that was negative in the first quarter turned to a positive impact? And Mark, nice job on the RWA. I think that everybody was scared if that was going to be a big negative number this quarter. Mark Mason : Thank you. You got a lot there, that we\u2019ve got to unpack. So I\u2019ll try to capture it all and you\u2019ll point to whatever I may miss. But let\u2019s start with the beginning of your question, just kind of the 12% and how we build back up to the 12%. So we ended the quarter at an estimated 11.4 to get to the 12%, that would be somewhere between $7 billion and $8 billion of capital that will be required. Jane mentioned, I mentioned there are a number of puts and takes that play through that. You pointed out a few of them. So you all have estimates for our net income between the second and fourth quarter. So you can forecast that what that would be. There is probably another $1.6 billion or-so of a benefit from the DTA. So what I mean by that, there is the $800 million that I\u2019ve referenced in the past of utilization of the DTA. And the balance would be the elimination of the amount that we tripped above the threshold this quarter. So there are two components that carry forwards that impact the DTA. And then there is the timing difference, which has equated to about 10% of our capital. So this quarter, we actually tripped that timing difference portion of the disallowed DTA, in part because of how the OCI reduction play through. So as that bleeds back in over time, we would expect to have capital buildup, which increases that threshold and therefore, be able to back off the increase that we saw in the quarter related to the DTA. The third component would be the capital from exits. So you didn\u2019t mention that one. As you know, there are a number of exits that we\u2019re looking to close at the end of the year \u2013 by the end of the year, they\u2019ll contribute about $4 billion of capital to that equation. And then there is the bleeding back in of the OCI impact, which will give or take, give us another $1 billion. So those are the pluses. Those are the things that kind of play in on the on the capital generation side. And then on the offsets, you\u2019ve got preferred dividends, you\u2019ve got common dividends, whatever growth we play out or put to work from an RWA point of view, and that leaves the balance for share repurchases. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, we would expect in the second quarter, a modest level of buybacks in light of all of those puts and takes. The good news is that the headwinds that we\u2019ve talked about, all things being equal, so assuming no further rate changes, many of those headwinds bleed back in over time, allowing for us to do what we\u2019ve committed to, which is returning capital to shareholders over time. In terms of dividends, we always look at that as part of the CCAR submission and part of our broader capital planning, but I\u2019ll \u2013 we will see how the results come out from CCAR, but I would lean in on a point we\u2019ve had to make a number of times now, which is given where we\u2019re trading, it makes a lot of sense to be doing buybacks. And so we will likely continue to lean that way as opposed to doing a lot to change the dividend. But stay tuned as the capital planning continues to evolve. Operator : And your next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Could you talk some about Treasury and Trade Solutions, both at the first quarter level? I guess, security services did better, what you are seeing is a combination of rates and more corporate demand and the complexity around the global situation? And then just more generally, the joint calling efforts you guys are doing with lending and payments, so specific to the general. Jane Fraser : Well, maybe I\u2019ll kick off with a couple of pieces and then hand it over to Mark. I think what we\u2019ve seen, frankly, Mike, across the board this quarter has been the value of our global network that we talked about, be it in Markets, we had a lot of strong corporate activity and FX, that we saw tremendous activity for TTS, great with our commercial banking clients, and we saw a lot of linkages across. And obviously, it was a strong quarter for us in trade because again, with the global network, the ability to provide clients with end-to-end solutions in this interesting world that we\u2019re living in is something they really rely upon us. So you saw trade loans up 16%. You saw really many of the drivers that we laid out for you at Investor Day performing particularly strongly. But Mark, why don\u2019t I pass to you? Mark Mason : Yes. I\u2019d make a couple of comments. So one, I\u2019d point out that, again, we had a strong quarter in TTS. The revenues were up 18% versus the prior quarter up \u2013 that was year-over-year versus the prior quarter up 8%. And yes, some of that was due to rates playing through. So, net interest income was up 18%, but would look at the non-interest revenue that was up 19%. So to your point, Jane, we\u2019re seeing good fee revenue growth play through as well. Security Services had a good quarter. It was up 66% revenue year-over-year and part of that was through fee revenue growth as well. So as you said, good, strong engagement with clients and helping them think through some of the uncertainty that\u2019s out here, particularly as it relates to supply chains, helping them work through with their partners through the trade lending growth that we\u2019re seeing and making good headway with the commercial client offering as well. So I would say a very good quarter, a very strong quarter for TTS, and we expect that momentum to continue. Jane Fraser : And to your question about sort of joint calling effort, we\u2019re quite making sure that we\u2019re forensically managing the synergies that we talked about cross calling efforts. And I think Paco and I are both pleased with how those are going. And this quarter was an example of that. Operator : And your next question comes from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. I was hoping to follow-up on the Russian slide here, update on Russian Slide 6. I guess first question, why don\u2019t you take just a bigger kind of stab at reserving for maybe the severe stress scenario? I\u2019m not really an expert on what\u2019s going on. But from what I read, it feels kind of pretty severe and it seems like broadly speaking, kind of other corporations, not necessarily banks, but just corporations are taking kind of more material losses versus a $1 billion on $10 billion? And then just a related question, if you could elaborate on what the broader impact is? I guess I\u2019m a little surprised that the reserve for that was as big as the direct Russian reserve were roughly the same? Mark Mason : Sure. Why don\u2019t I take that? So the first thing I\u2019d say is that we\u2019re not at 10, right? So we ended the year last year, 2021 at $9.8 billion. We ended the quarter at $7.8 billion of exposure. So we brought the exposure down by $2 billion inside of the last 3 months. I\u2019d also point out that a number of things were important components of that. So if you look at Slide 6, you\u2019ll see that the loans, and these are both ICG and consumer loans, largely ICG, largely corporate loans have come down by $600 million. And that\u2019s really been a reduction in our risk exposure, right? So borrowers paying down, us limiting the extension of new credit, etcetera. The AFS securities have come down $600 million. And that is really a reduction mostly driven by sales. So we\u2019ve gotten out of those securities. Yes, there are some mark-to-market losses, but they are not material. That flows through OCI, not material. You can see that the off-balance sheet unfunded commitments have trended down as well. Deposits and cash equivalents have gone up because we\u2019ve actually seen the repayment of those loans come back, and we\u2019ve been \u2013 we\u2019ve had to put that cash with the Central Bank just given some of the restrictions that are there. We\u2019ve been actively working down the reverse repo assets, which are really secured with sovereign bond exposure. And we\u2019ve been bringing down the third-party cross-border exposure. So a lot of hard work has gone into bringing that exposure down to 7.8%. And if you think about the $1 billion that I referenced is kind of a net of $6.8 billion, right? So the second part of your question was, how do we think about reserves and what are those different components. Well, we look at the reserves in terms of the actual name-specific loan exposure we have, how we\u2019re rating those entities in this environment. And then we actually run that through our models and we come up with an appropriate reserve tied to that rating. So that $1 billion is related to the direct exposure that we have to these Russian clients and entities, the broader impact takes into consideration the spillover effect that might impact other names or other industries outside of Russia due to things like commodity pricing and what have you. And then there is a third component that is tied to the global uncertainty that gets created from a dynamic like this. So we built the reserves considering those multiple components. The last point I\u2019d make is that, when you look at some of the names, there are a significant number of names that are large multinational names that have this exposure in the country and they provide parental support for some of the exposure that\u2019s here as well. So we really try to take a detailed comprehensive look at this and build the reserves in a way that we think are prudent recognizing that there are other scenarios that could play out that we want to be prepared for and have a view on as well. Operator : And our next question \u2013 thank you. Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Mark Mason : Hi. Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, you did a good job in describing the CET1 ratio walk for us. What\u2019s new that none of us have experienced yet on an ongoing basis. Is the SACR, the 49 basis points that reduced your CET1 ratio? Can you share with us how does that work on an ongoing basis? Is that a number that\u2019s going to stay constant or does that change every quarter based upon increase or lower risk in this area? Mark Mason : It\u2019s an increase in our risk-weighted assets that\u2019s really tied largely to the derivative exposures that we have. What I would say is, obviously, how one manages their exposures and balance sheet and engagement with clients will impact that. But importantly, it\u2019s a market dynamic that needs to play out as well. So, as more RWA and capital is required for these types of positions, there has to \u2013 it\u2019s going to impact returns, and it ultimately will impact pricing as the market starts to incorporate this now higher requirement. And so it will continue to evolve. The thing I would point you to is that as we think about managing our businesses and in particular markets. You would have heard us mention at Investor Day that we are looking \u2013 continually looking for opportunities to optimize the balance sheet, optimize RWA, right. And so we talked about targeting a revenue to RWA for our markets business, and we are actively working at that now. And that\u2019s going to be important as we continue to manage not only the balance sheet requirements that we have, but our intent to try and return more capital to shareholders and improve our returns. Operator : Your next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning Jane and Mark. Mark Mason : Good morning. Ebrahim Poonawala : Just sticking with capital, two-part question. One, if it continued to move higher, Mark, is there anything you can do to hedge the AOCI? And secondly, if you can walk us through around Banamex, if you do strike a deal at some point this year, what are the implications on capital at deal announcement versus deal close? I would appreciate that. Mark Mason : Sure. So look, I mean there \u2013 what we have built in \u2013 what we have got built into the forecast and the walk back to 12% is the forward curve as of the end of the quarter. So, that\u2019s what we have built in. As we think about that, that was a pretty sudden move through the quarter of 160 basis points on the 2-year in the quarter. That\u2019s now in the expectation. We have built in an assumption around more rate moves that could happen just as a bit of cushion as I think about the outlook and as I think about the walk. We do have hedges in place as it relates to some of the positions that we have and as it relates to OCI, and we will continue to manage that to ensure we reduce the risk from rate increases, which, by the way, we have been actively doing over the past couple of years. If you look at kind of how the balance sheet has evolved, we have been moving from out of AFS and into held to maturity over the past couple of years, reducing that risk of a negative impact to OCI. And if you look at the DVO 1, we have cut that down from as high as $60 million to about $30 million or so. So, we have been actively managing with an eye towards how do we reduce that sensitivity if you will. Why don\u2019t I let Jane kind of touch on the Mexico piece. Jane Fraser : Yes. So, as I said, it\u2019s quite a complex separation and transaction as we are going to be separating our market-leading and sizable ICG franchise in Mexico from the consumer and the small business that we will be selling. It will take a bit of time as we work through this. It\u2019s a fantastic franchise. And as we are starting some very preliminary conversations with the buyers, it\u2019s attracting a lot of attention. Because it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity here, and we have a range of options, I am sure, ahead from IPO sale, etcetera. But this is going to take time. We want to do it properly. And by time, I mean a few quarters. So, I think we are not anticipating at this very early stage, whether that would be this year or early next year. But Mark, why did I pass to you in terms of how we look at the CTA impact of that one? Mark Mason : Yes. So look, I mean as you said, Jane, what\u2019s going to be important is that we make the right decision for the people, for the business and equally important for our shareholders, and we are going to absolutely make sure we do that. In terms of the way this plays out is I think you are aware and I have mentioned before that we have got roughly $2.8 billion, $2.9 billion currency translation adjustment related to our consumer Mexico franchise. And so when we sign the deal, we will have that flow through the P&L ultimately gets offset at closing. And so again, you would have another timing difference between the accounting impact and the ultimate economic impact, but that\u2019s kind of the component that would play through it signing whenever that were to occur. Operator : And your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : A couple of questions. One, a little bit ticky-picky, but on your NIM sensitivity that you have given the 10-Q, 10-K, it would be helpful to understand how much of that NIM sensitivity is coming from the non-legacy businesses? How much of that NIM sensitivity is going to be retained after you sell out the businesses that you have identified? Mark Mason : Yes. I don\u2019t have that breakout, Betsy. I mean I \u2013 we will have to kind of get back to you. I don\u2019t have that breakout. Operator : Your next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Mark, Jane, a quick question, probably more for Mark. The RWA increased from the higher volatility that you would have seen in your trading assets in the first quarter? What was the offset to that? Mark Mason : So, look, in the first quarter, the major driver that we have seen is really on the credit risk side from an RWA point of view, and that was really tied to SACR. That\u2019s the biggest driver of the fourth quarter, the first quarter RWA increase that we have seen. So, the RWA from a market risk point of view was mostly flat due to reductions in trading book securitizations, that was kind of \u2013 those are the kind of the main drivers there. Jane Fraser : And what I would say is, and you certainly heard this loud and clear from Paco at Investor Day, a lot of the strategy here is also making sure that we are optimizing our capital. We are very mindful around the returns that we are generating and how we allocate and deploy capital. And this is a quarter that Andy and Paco is running the businesses have been very mindful around that. So, that also helped. Mark Mason : Yes. So, like I said, securitizations would be an offset as would some of the equity derivatives. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good morning. So, it was encouraging certainly to hear you guys reaffirm the \u201822 guidance for low-single digit revenue growth, mid-single digit expense growth. But just given the positive surprise on revenues in the quarter, the number of rate hikes getting baked into the forward curve has increased since your last update. I wanted to get some perspective on just why you didn\u2019t revise the revenue forecast higher? And just given the pace and timing of investments, as we look ahead to 2023 and beyond, how should we think about the timing for when you guys can get back to positive operating leverage? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, on the \u2013 let me kind of take that. So, on the revenue side, as you would have heard us describe, there have been puts and takes that have played through the quarter, and there is still a fair amount of uncertainty that\u2019s out there. And so while there have been increases as it relates to rates, and we have seen and expect to see some benefit play through for that, there has also been an impact on banking revenues as we see the uncertainty creating a dynamic where corporate clients are pausing, particularly as it relates to equity capital markets and debt capital markets. And so as I mentioned, there are offsets that play out. And so we felt comfortable kind of maintaining the guidance on the revenue top line. In terms of the expenses, as I mentioned at Investor Day, the spend that we have going on in expenses is critically important. And we are still growing them as it relates to transformation and as it relates to business-led investments. On the business-led investment side, the good news is that we are starting to see some of the top line strength play out, not just driven by rates, but also driven by things like fees, which is what we forecasted. On the transformation side, we continue to make progress. And we have talked about how critically important that is to our operations going forward. We expect that, that will peak or arc, if you will, as we talked about at Investor Day, and that will occur in the near-term and will be an important offset, if you will, to the structural expense base that we have as the efficiencies from those spending \u2013 from that spending, excuse me, plays through. Jane Fraser : And just to chip in as well, we are committed to the investments on our transformation and on our growth. We think they are both critically important. We are equally committed to managing our expense base prudently and forensically. And I think the piece there, if there is any comfort from our numbers is we are getting on with it. We are not hanging around here. You have seen us do that with the divestitures. We are doing the same on our transformation and on our investment side, getting very focused on making sure we deliver the results you would expect from them. You will see something similar when we start divesting and closing the different transactions, and we will talk to you about what we are doing on getting those \u2013 any stranded expenses out and getting focused on that. So, you can expect us to see us going pretty aggressively after different elements of our cost base as the timing is appropriate. Operator : And your next question comes from Ken Uston with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken please check your mute button. Next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good morning Mark and Jane. Maybe just a question on \u2013 just following up with the last question, do you have a specific update for NII growth this year, given the forward curve is substantially higher than 100 basis points? And how you are thinking about NII overall? And then as a subset of that, how do we think about your deposit base or mostly your more institutional deposit base acting in an aggressive QT environment? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes, sure. Look, I am not giving kind of guidance kind of broken out, if you will, for the revenues. We are standing by the full year guidance that we have talked about. Obviously, with rates moving the way that they have, we would expect that we would see some improvement on the NII line, but I haven\u2019t given specific guidance broken out for the two lines. In terms of the deposit base we have, as you know, we have got a mix of consumer and corporate client deposits. We skew a bit more heavily towards the corporate client deposit base. That comes with \u2013 generally comes with a higher beta. And so they are likely to be more reactive to and reactive sooner to the increase in interest rates. And quantitative tightening will certainly have a longer term impact on the level of deposits that\u2019s out there. But with that said, our plans both in the near-term and as we have played out the Investor Day forecast, don\u2019t hinge upon significant growth in deposits. We would expect some growth, but growth consistent with kind of pre-pandemic levels, but that\u2019s not outsized growth, and we believe our strategy, which is broader than just going after deposits, but really is around solutions for corporate clients and the full spectrum of financial services for the consumers that we focus on will allow for us to capture an appropriate level consistent with how the economy evolves. Operator : And your next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Actually, Chubac and Jim asked my question. I think it might be helpful to consider, Mark for next quarter to break out the NII guide, given the \u2013 obviously, the uncertainty that we all have on forecasting trading and investment banking? Thanks so much. Mark Mason : Thanks, Erika. Operator : Your next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi. I just wanted to ask about how you are thinking about the U.S. card business. This is an area where it feels like in some areas, you have been lagging a bit and in other areas accelerating. And I just wanted to get a sense as to how you are thinking about the trajectory this year in particular, since it\u2019s one of the better margin businesses that you have got, and it also obviously keys into the reserve ratio a bit? Thanks. Jane Fraser : Yes. I am surprised you thought we were lagging because we don\u2019t \u2013 we certainly don\u2019t see that. I have been really pleased with how the cards franchise has been performing on multiple different drivers on client acquisition, on the spend, on some of the new propositions that we have been bringing in. You heard from Anand about the growth on proprietary cards. The installment lending growth, 75% up, albeit from a small base this quarter. So, there are multiple different dimensions. So, I think it\u2019s \u2013 we are very pleased to see the business actually picking up. And as I said, Betsy in my prepared remarks, I like where the business is headed. I think part of it is I am more positive around the U.S. economy and the U.S. consumer than really any other geographies around the world. And that helps with so much momentum in the labor market. We are seeing still quite a bit of excess liquidity sitting there in the back pocket of our consumers and very healthy balance sheet. I think we have peaked in the payment rates. So, we are just starting to see the first signs of that coming down. And I think that\u2019s good because it\u2019s a return to be \u2013 it should be the return this year to a more healthy behavior. The spend has obviously been quite remarkable. It\u2019s up in the mid-20%. Also great to see the experience side and that services side coming back in again. And that\u2019s we have been seeing it in travel. We have been seeing it in apparel. People like getting dressed up to go to dinner again in a restaurant. Those different things, it\u2019s nice to see things coming back to normality. So, I am pretty positive both from cyclically where this is headed, the recovery from COVID, where it\u2019s headed. And I am also pretty happy with the strategy that Anand laid out and the progress we are making against it. So, I think some good things ahead here. Mark Mason : Yes. And the only thing I would add is a couple of numbers, right. So, the sales are up 24% year-over-year, exceeding pre-pandemic levels across the categories. Acquisitions are up 23% year-over-year. Again, bringing on new card customers into our family, if you will. Revenues are down 2%, but you really have to look through the investments that we are making in acquisitions and the rewards costs associated with those that impact that revenue being down 2%. If you adjust for the acquisition costs, actually, our revenues would be up 1% year-over-year. So, I agree completely with you, Jane, which is we are very pleased with the progress here. We are seeing similar momentum start to play through on the retail services side as well. The sequential performance on average interest earning balances is a good signal for how things will play out. And we continue to feel good about the growth we forecasted towards the back half of the year. Operator : And our next question comes from Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Your line is open. Andrew Lim : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So, I get the impression that maybe keep you are surprised by your NII guidance because in the past, you have officially given it as based on a runoff balance sheet or is it appears based on a static balance sheet. And I think you mentioned a few quarters ago that if it was on the same basis, static balance sheet that your NII uplift will be about $2.5 billion to $3 billion for 100 basis point parallel shift. Is that something you are still sticking to? And then within the shape of that, how much was that is due to the short-term increasing by 100 basis points? I think you are much more sensitive to the short-term going up. Is that something that you can disclose a rough figure on? Mark Mason : Sure. And good morning and I would like to separate kind of NII guidance from the IRE sensitivity and disclosure that we have. And so you are absolutely right, and I am not moving \u2013 we are not moving off of our IRE disclosure at all. The analysis is such that with a parallel shift in rates of about 100 basis points that we see somewhere around $2.5 billion to $3 billion of an increase kind of play through. And as you know, as I have said before, that\u2019s cross currencies, with about two-thirds of that being to non-U.S. currencies and the other third obviously being U.S. So, that is still our view from an ROE point of view. We are not \u2013 we haven\u2019t changed that view. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi, a follow-up. I guess this is not new, but the expenses are just so high, and we haven\u2019t heard the 4% inflation number from others and, maybe others are able to offset that a little bit more. And the 1% due to volume-related when Jane, you mentioned you don\u2019t expect this level of capital markets to be sustained. So, I guess I am just \u2013 I am grappling about something that\u2019s been around for a while. I get it. You have the right order, you have the transformation, you have business sales. You said you underinvested in the past and everything else. But I mean, you have 1,200 basis points between your expense and revenue growth and just seems so high. But you are also guiding for what I think is like 300 basis points of that spread for the full year. So, does that mean this is as bad as it gets, and that spread should be narrowed? And just some of those other inflation, volume expenses, expenses generally because it\u2019s frustrating for investors. Mark Mason : Yes. So, why don\u2019t I take that and kind of try and talk through it. So, the first thing I would say is that the 10% growth that we have in the quarter is consistent with the guidance. I just want to be clear that at Investor Day, that\u2019s what we talked about. We would love for the number to be different, but we understand and we know that this is what\u2019s required to get the franchise to where it needs to be. And so we are taking those hard decisions. We are spending the money where we need to spend it. We are being diligent about that to make sure that we are not being wasteful in that effort. But we don\u2019t want to create or go through the things that we have gone through in the past in the way of under-investing. And so we are going to avoid that. The second thing is, and you acknowledge that kind of in your reference to transformation and business-led investments. On the structural investments spend, I should say, about half of that is from inflation, so not the full 4%. A portion of it is also from non-consent order risk and control spend that we are making, things like the financial crime unit, things like cyber spend, things like the work we are doing around our wholesale credit operations, important things. And there are some productivity savings that play through that. And then the final piece on the volume related is their transactional costs that are associated with the activity that we do on the trading side, their spend that we make in order to drive that activity. And the mix matters. And so while revenues kind of play out in one way for the quarter, the mix of the market\u2019s activity impacts the level of volume-related expenses that\u2019s generated through those transactions. So, those are a couple of things. Again, we are consistent with guidance. We believe we are on track for the guidance we gave for the full year of mid-single digits. And we are looking forward to generating the efficiencies that come out of this spend and put a dent in our structural expense base over time. Jane Fraser : Yes. And let me jump in as well, Mike, because this is something Mark and I have \u2013 we are very, very aware of. We are managing it in excruciating detail on multiple dimensions. We are taking the lessons that we have got \u2013 we have got to take some of the short-term pain here in order to get us into the position we need to be in the medium-term and the long-term. And from be it the stranded costs and the divestitures, we know we will have opportunities there. We talked about Investor Day also being in a position to simplify the management structure and take out some of the structural expenses there. So, this is going to be an area of continued focus from Mark and I, that we make sure that not only are we managing the arc and ensuring there is one, but also that we generate the benefits from our shareholders from all of this. And it\u2019s something I feel exceedingly high accountability for as does the management team. We get it. Operator : And there are no more further questions, I will turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jen Landis : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Enjoy the day. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes Citi\u2019s first quarter earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s Second Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen. And thank you everyone for joining us today. When we last spoke we said the macro and geopolitical outlook was complex and uncertain. So, in one sense, little has changed. However, the headwinds have certainly crystallized. And it's against that backdrop that I'm proud of the results our team delivered this quarter as we execute on our strategy and transformation. There are mounting costs to the series of supply shocks we've experienced. And now we need to pay attention to an additional S in ESG, and that is security. In addition to energy and cyber security, food security has also come into sharper focus, threatening to spread the humanitarian cost of the war well beyond Europe. Resiliency is the new priority for governments and corporates alike. And all of this is adding to inflationary pressures, which are in turn being met with a more hawkish response from the Fed and other central banks, all contributing to sharply lower U.S. consumer confidence. Higher rates and QT will keep volatility high. That said, wealth sentiment has shifted. Little of the data I see tells me the U.S. is on the cusp of a recession. Consumer spending remains well above pre-COVID levels with household savings providing a cushion for future stress. And as any employer will tell you, the job market remains very tight. Similarly, our corporate clients see robust demand and healthy balance sheet with revenue softness attributed to supply chain constraints so far. So, while a recession could indeed take place over the next two years in the U.S., it's highly unlikely to be a sharper downturn as others in recent memory. I'm just back from Europe, where it's a different story. We expect a very difficult winter is coming, and that's due to disruptions in the energy supply. There is also increasing concern about second order effects on industrial production and how that will affect economic activity across the continent. And the mood is, of course, further darkened by the belief that the war in Ukraine will not end anytime soon. In Asia, a rebound in China also faces some constraints given the potential for future lockdowns, the amount of leverage in the Chinese economy and stress in their property sector. Given this uncertain environment, I'm quite pleased with our overall performance. We reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 and an RoTCE of 11.2%. We grew revenues at 11% year-over-year whilst remaining on track to meet our expense guidance for the year. Services continued to show excellent momentum with revenues up 28% year-over-year. While some of that growth is a result of the rate environment, we had double-digit fee growth, consistent with the strategy we presented to you in March. TTS in particular fired on all cylinders as clients took advantage of our global network, leading to the best quarter this business has had in a decade. The market volatility that we saw in the first quarter continued into the second, driving corporate clients in particular to be more active in risk management, contributing to revenue growth of 25% in markets. The volatility we saw in foreign exchange rates, commodities and equity derivatives favored our mix, and we were more efficient in our capital usage. And while this level of activity is related to where we are in the current cycle rather than a new baseline in markets, I believe we are helping our clients navigate this environment quite well. And it shows how our emphasis on our corporate clients globally given their consistent trading needs is a differentiating one for us in market. On the flip side, that same environment continues to put a great deal of pressure on the Investment Banking wallet with our revenues down 46%. However, we are seeing an increase of lending as our clients have been less inclined to obtain financing through the debt markets given the recent swings. In U.S. Personal Banking, the positive drivers we saw in our two credit card businesses over the last few quarters converted into solid revenue growth this quarter, most notably, 10% growth in branded cards. And you can see how resilient the consumer is in the U.S. through the elevated payment rates and the low level of credit losses. They have, however, shifted their spend far more to travel and entertainment, which are now outpacing 2019 levels. While volatility can be an opportunity for our trading desks, lower asset prices are a headwind for wealth management. Asia again was hit harder than other regions, leading to flat year-over-year wealth management revenues overall. That said, we continue to execute our wealth strategy across a number of fronts, including building our base of client advisers, expanding our Private Bank\u2019s physical footprint to reach 20 countries with the additions of Germany and France, and increasing referrals from our branch network in the U.S. So, the underlying strategic drivers for the long-term growth of this business continue to advance. Overall, while we did have a slight build in reserves given the increasing possibility of a recession, we are operating from a position of strength. Our capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserve levels are strong, and our diversified business mix also positions us well for the choppy waters on the horizon. Well, while the world has changed since we presented our Investor Day to you in March, our strategy has not. We have continued to execute it with discipline and with urgency. The quarterly report card on Slide 3 should help you hold us accountable for our progress. We are laser-focused on the long-term goals we set out in March, and I see this quarter's performance as validating that we are indeed on the right path. Simplifying the firm is a high priority, and we made good progress executing on our divestitures, such as closing the sale of Australia during the quarter. We're well into the sales process in Mexico, working through the regulatory and legal dynamics that can be expected in a transaction of this nature. In terms of Russia, we continue to shrink the size of our business and take steps to reduce our financial exposure. Given the complex environment, we are considering the full range of possibilities to exit our Consumer & Commercial Banking businesses, including portfolio sales. As divestitures such as Australia progress, we are beginning to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our model. And this discipline is critical to ensuring we have the resources to invest in the businesses where we want to gain or maintain a competitive advantage and to ensure the success of our transformation. To that point, we were particularly pleased that our AML consent order was lifted by the OCC in April. We are committed to ensuring our technology, controls and processes are up to the standards our regulators expect of us and we expect of ourselves. Let me end on capital. We increased our CET1 ratio to 11.9% this quarter whilst returning $1.3 billion in capital, including a rather modest level of buybacks. Our tangible book value per share now exceeds $80. Despite the strength of our balance sheet and reserves, our stress capital buffer is set to increase to 4% in the fourth quarter as a result of this year's stress test scenario. So, over the near term, we plan to build to a CET1 ratio of approximately 13%, including our 100 basis-point management buffer. Over the medium term, our CET1 target remains at 11.5% to 12%. We are prioritizing our dividend and are pausing our share repurchases as we build capital. We have a management buffer, which we can use to help ensure a smooth path to our required levels, and Mark will walk you through our approach in a few minutes. We will generate significant capital given our earnings power and the completion of pending divestitures. We know how important buybacks are to shareholder value creation, in particular when we are trading at these levels, and are committed to restarting them as soon as it is prudent to do so. We will make every effort to optimize our capital, especially in businesses such as Markets. So we balance the needs of our clients, our investors and our regulators. Overall, in a challenging macro and geopolitical environment, our team delivered solid results, and the bank is in a very strong position to weather uncertain times whilst playing to our strengths. I'm confident about the path ahead, and I'm pleased with our early progress. Now, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we'd be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; then spend a little more time on expenses, capital and Russia; and then turn to the results of each segment and end with 2022 guidance. On slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. As Jane mentioned earlier, in the second quarter, we reported net income of $4.5 billion and EPS of $2.19 with an RoTCE of 11.2% or $19.6 billion of revenues. In the quarter, total revenues increased 11% with growth in both, net interest income as well as noninterest revenues. Net interest income grew 14% driven by higher rates as well as strong volumes across ICG and PBWM. Noninterest revenue grew 5% driven by fixed income and services, which more than offset lower noninterest revenue in Investment Banking and PBWM. Total expenses of $12.4 billion increased 8%, largely driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses. On a year-to-date basis, expenses were up 12%, but excluding divestiture-related impacts were up 9%, also driven by the factors I just mentioned. Cost of credit was $1.3 billion, driven by net credit losses of $850 million and an ACL build of approximately $400 million. At the end of the quarter, we had approximately $18.3 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44% and are well capitalized with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%. On slide 5, we show an expense walk for the second quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8%. 3% of the increase was driven by transformation investments with about two-thirds related to risk, controls, data and the finance programs. And approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. And as of today, we have over 9,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 2% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers as well as client advisers in wealth. And we continue to invest in the client experience as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 2% was due to higher revenue and volume-related expenses, largely in Markets and Cards. And approximately 1% was driven by compensation as well as other risk and control investments, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, which is up 14% for the quarter. Before we move on from expenses, we wanted to provide some tangible examples of what we are working on regarding our transformation and some of the benefits we expect to see over time. The transformation is designed to improve our governance and processes, enhance our policies and leverage technology to strengthen our controls. We've been actively investing in technology to improve automation and hiring people to stand up these efforts. To this end, we are enhancing our risk management processes and capabilities across a number of areas. For example, in Banking, we've gone live with a new platform and now begun to consolidate our 37 loan processing systems to one loan servicing platform. And we have continued to build out our infrastructure to enhance our stress testing capabilities across the firm, particularly useful in this market. Given the power and importance of data, we are redesigning our data governance and data organization, which will help us improve the timeliness and quality of our data. These foundational data-related changes will allow us to simplify and improve client onboarding and deepening, product development as well as enhance our data analytics for every function. And we are streamlining our financial planning process to allow for multiple scenarios with greater frequency, including more agile capital planning. And we signed with a major software provider to begin a multiyear process of modernizing and moving our 16 ledger platforms deployed across 121 instances to one cloud-based ledger. And while we are in the early stages of these initiatives, we expect the efficiencies from these investments to be key in helping us meet our Investor Day commitments. On slide 6, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $1.1 billion on a sequential basis driven by higher rates, day count, growth in loans as well as the impact of the European dividend season on our Markets business. On a year-over-year basis, net interest income increased by approximately $1.5 billion driven by higher interest rates as well as volumes across businesses. And we grew average loans by approximately 3% in ICG, mainly in trade finance, and 4% in PBWM. Legacy franchises loans declined, largely driven by the reclassification of loans to held for sale. And sequentially, the gross yield on our loans increased by 35 basis points, and the cost of our interest-bearing deposits increased by 20 basis points. On slide 7, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 22% or $531 billion are high-quality liquid assets, or HQLA, and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $964 billion. Our end-of-period deposits increased by 1%, largely driven by TTS and wealth. On a sequential basis, deposits decreased by 1%, including the impact of seasonality in wealth. From an RWA perspective, we saw both advanced and standardized RWA come down both year-over-year and sequentially as we continue to optimize RWA. We ended the quarter with a standardized CET1 ratio of approximately 11.9%, and standardized remains the binding requirement. And our tangible book value per share was $80.25, up 3%. On slide 8, we show a sequential CET1 ratio walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our goals over the next few quarters. First, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 34 basis points. Second, we returned $1.3 billion in the form of dividends and buybacks, which drove a reduction of about 10 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our investment portfolio drove a 12 basis-point reduction. Fourth, the decrease in disallowed DTA drove a 5 basis-point increase. And finally, the remainder was driven by a combination of our net RWA optimization efforts as well as the 12 basis-point benefit from the closing of the Australia sale. We ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 11.9%, 50 basis points higher than the first quarter and well above the regulatory requirement of 10.5%. We expect our regulatory requirement to increase to 11.5% in October of 2022 to account for the increase in our stress capital buffer from 3% to 4%. In January, our regulatory requirement will increase to 12% as a result of an increase in our G-SIB surcharge. A combination of our earnings generation, closing of divestitures and continued RWA optimization efforts will be important tools as we manage towards our CET1 requirement. And our management buffer, which was designed to temporarily address volatility, will allow us to build gradually while continuing to support our clients. Given all that, we do expect to build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which accounts for the increased regulatory requirement and assumes a 100 basis-point management buffer. However, consistent with what we said at Investor Day, our medium-term target remains at 11.5% to 12%. And while we are pausing buybacks for now, as I've said before, we remain committed to returning excess capital to our shareholders over time. On slide 9, we provide an update on our exposure to Russia. In 2Q, we reduced our exposure by $3.1 billion in local currency terms, which was more than offset by the ruble appreciation. As of today, the mix of our exposure has changed and is now reflecting a higher proportion of stronger credit names. Additionally, our net investment in our Russian entity is now approximately $1.2 billion, up from about $700 million due to the ruble appreciation. As a result of the actions that we've taken to reduce our risk, we now believe that under a range of severe stress scenarios our potential capital impact is estimated to be approximately $2 billion, down from the $2.5 billion to $3 billion last quarter. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues increased by 20%, largely driven by TTS, Markets, Securities Services as well as a gain on loan hedges, partially offset by a decrease in Investment Banking revenues. Expenses increased 10% driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was a benefit of $202 million with a net ACL release of $220 million and net credit losses of only $18 million. The release was largely driven by a reduction in Russia-related risk, partially offset by a build due to increased global macro uncertainty. This resulted in net income of approximately $4 billion, up 16%. We grew average loans by 3%, largely driven by TTS loans, which were up 17%. Average deposits grew 1% driven by the deepening of existing client relationships and new client acquisitions. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 16.6%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 33% driven by 42% growth in net interest income as well as 17% growth in NIR as we saw a strong growth with both mid and large corporate clients. And we continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate continued strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 17% and commercial card volumes up 61%. Again, these metrics are indicators of client activity and fees and on a combined basis drive approximately 50% of total TTS fee revenue. Securities Services revenues grew 16% as net interest income grew 41%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. And NIR grew 8%, largely reflecting elevated activity levels in issuer services. Overall Markets revenues were up 25%. The macro environment played to our strengths with the volatility leading to elevated corporate client activity. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 31% driven by FX, rates and commodities due to active engagement with our corporate clients as we help them manage risk associated with volatile markets. Equity markets revenues were up 8% driven by strong equity derivative performance, partially offset by less client activity in cash and a net decrease in prime balances as lower asset valuations more than offset new client balance. Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 28% driven by Investment Banking as heightened geopolitical uncertainty and the overall macro backdrop impacted client activity, partially offset by higher revenue in corporate lending. So, we feel very good about the progress we are making here as we continue to deepen existing client relationships as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking & Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in noninterest revenue, largely driven by partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 12% driven by transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit of $1.4 billion was up as we added reserves given the increase in overall uncertainty in the macro environment compared to a net ACL release last year. And NCLs were down 19% as we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 4% driven by strong growth in branded cards as well as growth across retail services and wealth. Average deposits grew 6% driven by growth across retail and wealth. We continue to maintain a strong reserve-to-loan ratio of 7.5% in our U.S. Cards business. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 6.8%. While a low return, this was driven by the ACL build and an increase in expenses in the quarter. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded Cards revenues were up 10% driven by higher interest on higher loan balances. We are seeing encouraging underlying drivers with new accounts and card spend volumes both up 18% and average loans up 11%. Retail Services revenues were up 7%, also driven by higher interest on higher loan balances, partially offset by higher partner payments. So, despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making have driven growth in interest-earning balances of 3% in Branded Cards and 2% in Retail Services, and we believe we will continue to grow these balances in the second half of the year. Retail Banking revenues were up 6%, primarily driven by deposit spreads and volumes. Wealth revenues were flat as investment fee headwinds offset NII growth driven by deposits and loan volumes. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. We're starting to see the leading indicators pick up with average deposits up 7% and client advisers up 8%. And we are seeing strong new client acquisitions, having added 800 Private Bank clients and over 50,000 Citigold clients since last year. On slide 14, we show results for legacy franchises. Revenues declined 15%, largely driven by the closing of the Australia consumer sale, the Korea wind-down and muted investment activity in Asia. And as we mentioned, this quarter, we closed the sale of the Australia consumer business, which was a benefit of up to $1.5 billion of capital. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, and expenses were down. On slide 16, we briefly touch on the full year 2022 outlook. At this point, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range. Relative to Investor Day, the rate curve is certainly giving us a tailwind from an NII perspective, and Markets revenues are up for the first half of the year. However, as we mentioned earlier, we are seeing much lower levels of Investment Banking activity, and this will likely continue for the remainder of the year. In terms of expenses, we still expect to grow expenses by 7% to 8%, excluding the impact of divestitures. While we are seeing some impact from inflation, we believe the efficiencies that we're executing against and the impact of foreign exchange translation should offset these headwinds. And with that said, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Mark, I was hoping that maybe you could unpack the guidance for 2022 a little bit more. It seems like you've got more good guys than bad guys maintain the guidance. But maybe within that, could you give us a little bit more color on what you're expecting on net interest income, where the trends seem strong? And then maybe what you're assuming for markets in the back half of the year? Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Thank you, John. Good morning to you. As you said, we have seen the benefit certainly in the quarter here of the pickup in rates. And certainly, all indicators are that the rate increases will likely continue through the balance of the year. And as you've heard me say before, I do expect that we will see continued growth in loans, particularly on the card side. And we saw some of that start to play in sooner than expected because I had talked about it being in the back half of the year. We saw some of that even here in the second quarter. So, we do continue to think we'll get some lift there. We also expect to see continued momentum on the services side, both in TTS and life with Securities Services as well. And that growth is more than just rates, but certainly a portion of that does come from rates as well. Where the pressure is going to come is in the noninterest revenue, and we saw that certainly in the quarter here on the Investment Banking side. We saw that obviously in some of the wealth businesses, particularly in Asia. And that's where some of the offset is that we'd expect against that NII momentum. Now, the reality, I think, is that we'll have to see how this plays out as it relates to markets. All the uncertainty that's out there in the environment thus far has played to our favor given our focus on corporate clients and what have you. But I'd tell you that as I look at the full year, based on what we know now and with the uncertainty that's out there, I continue to feel comfortable with that guidance probably to the higher end of that low-single-digit growth that I've talked about. John McDonald : Okay. And then, maybe as a follow-up, just remind us where you are on net interest income sensitivity. You've updated the way I think you look at it relative to peers and relative to rates. Just remind us where you are on that and what kind of deposit pricing assumptions are embedded in that. Mark Mason : Sure. So, important to kind of just level set, John, great question. We got to think there are a couple of drivers that kind of come into play when we think about the sensitivity. So, one is obviously the mix. And so, in our case, we've got about two-thirds of our deposits are wholesale, about a third are consumer. We've got obviously 70% of ours are in U.S.-denominated and the rest are kind of non-U.S. And that mix is important when you think about betas, when you think about sensitivity and how they play out, particularly in a rising rate environment at the pace that we've seen, and that pace varies for both the U.S. versus the non-U.S. currencies. And so, that's all going to be a factor in kind of how we think about it. You're right. In our disclosure, we forecast our IRE disclosure based on a runoff balance sheet assumption. And what I've been describing the past couple of quarters an approach -- is an approach that's more consistent with peers, which assumes a static balance sheet. And under that analysis, if we were to look at an assumption for 100 basis points parallel shift in rates, cross-currencies, we think that would generate roughly a $2.5 billion increase in NII. Now, for us, that's going to skew towards non-U.S. dollars. About 80% of that would be non-U.S. dollar, about 20% U.S. dollar. And that shift is in part because we've seen already a significant increase in the U.S. We've seen some increase in non-U.S. but nowhere near the magnitude that we've seen in the U.S. So, I'll stop there. Hopefully, that addresses your question. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore ISI. Glenn Schorr : Mark, I wonder if you could just elaborate on the headwinds in noninterest revenue within PBWM and Retail Services. It sounds to me like you extended a contract for a partner or something like that. And then, maybe bigger picture, in Cards, you just mentioned rising card loans. We all want rising loans. But in the backdrop and the economic outlook we're facing, how do you decipher what's good rise in card loans versus a little concerning rise in card loans? Mark Mason : Sure. Let me take the first -- take them in that order. So, on the Retail Services side, it has nothing to do with kind of an extension of a contract or anything like that. What I'm describing is that it is a partner business that we have there in Retail Services. And what that means is that there's a sharing of the profits associated with the business that we generate. And so, what happens is in this rising rate environment, we've seen -- and the activity from a volume point of view, we've seen an increase in the net interest income that we've generated. And what that means is that there's more, fortunately, more profits to share with our partners. The sharing of those profits play through the noninterest revenue line. So, it comes out of -- comes out as a fee of the contra revenue as we share those with clients. So, that's the driver of the swing that you see happening there or the pressure that we have in PBWM as it relates to Retail Services. In terms of the Cards growth, the Cards growth, we feel very good about it. There certainly is an environmental dynamic that's playing out as it relates to consumers and corporates. But what I would say is that you've also heard us describing more marketing spend, more advertising spend, more acquisitions, 18% growth in acquisitions. We've been targeting growing our customer base there while staying within our risk appetite. The parameters that we've set have been very disciplined about. And that started to pay off. And that is part of what I described in terms of the loan growth that is materializing. There's nothing that we see of significance as we grow these loans that would suggest, one, that they're outside of the focus that we've had to date because they're not, nor that there's any material risk in terms of outsized losses. If you look at our loss rates, our loss rates are -- for Branded Cards, 1.5%; Retail Services, 2.6%. Those are 50% of what we would normally -- what we used to describe as a normal loss rate, NCL rate, through a cycle. And so, we feel very good about the loans that we're growing. There's obviously risk, but we also feel very good about the reserves that we have. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : My first question is actually a follow-up to John's question, Mark. I think that it's always been more challenging to forecast net interest income for Citigroup. And the net interest income and net interest margin certainly surprised to the upside. So, I guess, let me reask the question. Appreciate the $2.5 billion for each 100 basis-point in parallel shift. But as we think about the U.S. forward curve, how should we think about the trajectory of net interest income from that 10.58 from here. And clearly, as we think about a deposit base that's two-thirds wholesale, how should we think about both deposit flow, deposit growth and deposit beta as we think about the second half of the year? In other words, does the rate of change quarter-over-quarter accelerate, flatten out or decelerate? Mark Mason : There's a lot there. But I mean, I think what I'd say is a couple of things. One is, we've obviously seen a rapid increase in rates. And that -- the speed at which rates increases matters a lot as it relates to the betas. And so -- particularly on the wholesale corporate side. And so, we have seen betas increase there. They're probably at about to slightly a little bit better than we would have expected. But we would expect that momentum to continue in the back half of the year given the forecast for continued rate increases. The other thing that I'd point out, just giving you a point around the ability to forecast from a Citi point of view, if you look at the first half of the year, we did about -- I think it was $1.8 billion or so over the prior year, ex Markets. So NII, ex Markets, 1.8 billion year-over-year first half. To give you a bit more guidance on how we're thinking about it in light of the rate curve and in light of our mix, I'd tell you that I expect about another $1.8 billion or so in the back half. So, that's probably year-over-year, 8ish percent or so on a full year basis based on, again, our mix, our assumption around betas and our current assumptions around how the curve would likely play out. Let me pause there and see if Jane wants to add anything to that. Jane Fraser : Yes. I'd also add in our institutional deposits account for about 65% of Citi's deposit base, but 55% of them are operational deposits. And the TTS deposits have increased by $134 billion since pre-COVID, but the operational deposits increased by $141 billion and the non-operating decreased. So, with Q2 on the horizon, we\u2019d certainly expect the amounts of deposits in the system to shrink. We anticipate this would primarily impact non-operating balances. And I think we feel very good about the stickiness the deposit base has got and particularly internationally, where these are operating accounts that are extremely sticky, frankly, in all environments. Mark Mason : Good point. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And just my follow-up question is that was really an impressive capital build this quarter, particularly since it's been an issue with investors since -- especially since the SCB came out. I think a piece that we may be missing as we think about the continued build to 13% is sort of what the CET1 benefit is from slide 19. So similar to the sort of the -- I guess, it was 12 basis points that -- accreted from the Australia sale. Is there any way you could give us a range on -- as the deals close for the Philippines, Thailand, Bahrain, Malaysia in the second half of the year, how that could boost your CET1 and get you closer to that 13% bogey? Mark Mason : Yes. I guess, let me kind of answer it in a more fulsome way, if you don't mind, and then I'll certainly make sure that I give you a sense for the contribution of what we expect from divestitures to the capital impact. So, again, there are a couple of drivers that are going to be important to us building to ultimately the 13% for as long as that is in place given the SCB. One is obviously the income generation. And we had a very strong quarter as it relates to income generation. I feel good about the back half of the year, as I've just given you some guidance on. The other is, don't forget, we've had 160 basis points on the two-year since the beginning of the year to the end of the first quarter in terms of rate increases, another 60 in the second quarter. And there's going to be -- there were AOCI impacts from that, 34 in the first quarter, and as we point out here, another 12 in the second. There's a pull to par that we expect to start to play out and continue to play out in the balance of the year. That's going to be an important factor. The third, as you've heard us mention is we've been working very hard to optimize our RWA, and we'll continue to do that. We paused the buybacks. That's a factor. And then, as you mentioned, the divestitures to close to $1.5 billion or so in Australia. I've talked about in the past about $4 billion for the year in terms of capital impact. I'm at about $3.5 billion with Australia is what I'm currently expecting. And so a little bit less than what I talked about before, in part because of some of the movement in terms of the timing of some of these closings, still feel good about it. Just it's a difficult market that we're managing through. So that $3.5 billion total should give you a sense for how that translates into a CET1 impact that we're expecting, at least through the balance of this year. And obviously, there'll be more to come as we continue to close out and -- sign and close out some of the remaining deals. Jane Fraser : Yes. I mean, I rather suspect that at the end of all of this, we're going to have an overabundance of capital. And I really feel good that Citi is already very well positioned for any environment. And as Mark said, we have a confluence of various factors going on at the moment, some of which are temporary that are causing this rapid buildup of capital for the industry. But, I think, we're extremely well positioned for what lies ahead in terms of strong capital ratios, total liquidity resources. Portfolio credit quality is extremely high, well reserved. And so, we are very much looking forward to resuming share buybacks, as I said, once we've achieved this build, particularly given where we're trading. And I want you to hear loud and clear that commitment. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : I'm trying to figure out if you're lucky or smart, and the reason I say that is at your Investor Day, I mean, right upfront you said you have 5 core interconnected businesses led by services, led by TTS. And then, a few months later, you have your best quarter in a decade. And it just seems so coincidental that you highlight that as a growth area and then just a couple of quarters later, boom, here we are. So, how much of that TTS growth is simply because of one-off factors? How much of it is due to a higher baseline because of, say, interest rates? And how much of that is due to market share gains? And just remind us what TTS and Securities Services is again, because I think you got everyone's attention with this quarter. Jane Fraser : So, why don't I kick off and then I'll pass it to Mark. And it's a danger here of how long you have, Mike, because there's a lot to talk about. So, I would encourage you to sit at the beach this weekend and have an excellent read of the supplement because we've provided you with a lot of good facts and proof points and information, both around the services businesses and the others about the early progress on the strategy. TTS was able to fire, as I said, on all cylinders this quarter. About two-thirds of the performance was driven by business actions and one-third was by rates. And as Mark said, very active management of the deposit base, beta discipline across all the regions. And the NIR growth that you saw was driven by cards, by payments, by receivables and by trade. When you look in the strategic drivers we laid out at Investor Day this quarter, cross-border transaction value, up 17% year-over-year; clearing volume, up 2% in U.S. dollar; commercial comp spend, up 62% as that business recovered; average trade loan balances, up 14%; average deposit balances, up 2%. So, that two-thirds that was not rates-related has a very broad and substantive set of drivers behind it that, as Mark said, puts us into a very strong position for continued momentum here. This level of year-over-year growth is very pleasing, but we would expect to see it revert to the medium-term guidance we gave you at Investor Day over time. But this was across the board, all elements firing. And I will give a shout-out to Shahmir, the Head of TTS, as well as to our Securities Services team. But he has really instituted a culture of intensity, of tremendous focus, of discipline in how he is running the business as well. And I think that is also a contributing factor to the confidence that you're hearing from us about this. Mark, do you want to explain what TTS and Securities Services is? Mark Mason : Again, as you've heard us describe, the TTS franchise is core to our business. It provides obviously a network to the large multinational clients in over 90 countries. We manage the full swath of their working capital and cash management needs. We also provide trade financing for them and the vendors and partners. And this is essentially, in many ways, what differentiates our franchise from others. And not only is it in and of itself a core growing, high-returning business but is one of the businesses that is well-connected to the rest of the franchise when you think about the Markets business that we have and the FX that we manage on behalf of clients. And so, -- and this is a particularly relevant time for us to be engaged with those partners as they manage through supply chain issues. And we're there to again help them work through those things and provide them alternatives to their production and operations and similar-type services we provide to our investor client base from a Securities Services point of view. Look, the strategy here did not start with Investor Day. That is -- we obviously spent time with you talking about that. But, this has been a part of the franchise that we've been investing in on an ongoing basis. And it's important that we continue to do that, investments in technology, investments in onboarding of new clients and the services we provide and enhanced digital capabilities and the operations. So, all of those things, and some of that what you see here is those investments starting to pay off. Jane Fraser : And the same is exactly true in Securities Services. So, I think, the answer to your question is no, we're just being very-disciplined. Mark Mason : Yes. Well said. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Ken Usdin : Just a follow-up on the RWA. When you talk about the premium of the $3.5 billion and -- can you help us just discern between what is a numerator impact and what's the RWA impact of the sales that have been announced? And just as a related -- just how far are you through the RWA optimization efforts [Technical Difficulty]? Mark Mason : Thank you. The $3.5 billion I referenced is all capital. So, all numerator impact is what I'm describing. It's both, the -- any premium that we get or impact, gain from sale as well as the RWA that we have allocated as part of that business. And so, that all kind of flows through from a numerator point of view. In the case of Australia, for example, that would include both, the RWA that we had attributed to that business as well as the CTA impact coming back into capital. So remember, we took a hit when we signed the deal associated with the CTA. I kept communicating that that would neutralize at -- when the deal was closed. In fact, it did and that contributes to the roughly $1.5 billion there. In terms of RWA optimization efforts, it's a continuous effort. We are constantly working through the balance sheet to make sure that it's allocated to clients who generate the highest prospect for growth and leverage the breadth of the franchise, and we're going to continue to do that. And I think we -- the team did a very good job in ICG and particularly in Markets this quarter in making sure that we made progress against the revenue to RWA metric that they've been using, which is a proxy for returns. They worked very closely with clients to manage the recycling of trading inventory in an optimal way to optimize collateral positions that -- and postings that we have to increase initial margins on derivative trading where that makes sense. And so, they've been actively working the balance sheet, and we're going to continue to do that. We want to be there to serve our clients, but we want to make sure that we are generating an appropriate return for the use of capital. Jane Fraser : And it's part of the shift that we've been instituting Paco and Andy in Markets and across ICG and across the firm in our commitment to our shareholders to be more returns-focused and to be managing the business differently that way. This is a very obvious example of that because it's multidimensional. Operator : Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : I guess just around capital, Mark, just a two-part question. One, are we -- am I hearing you right that you're not going to leave the door open for buybacks until you get to 13%? Appreciating what Jane said about some of the transitory impact from AOCI. Why not be a bit more opportunistic? And just tied to that, what's the risk that some of these deals get pushed out? I see slide 19 where you've extended the time line for a few deals. Given just the macro backdrop, like is that a real risk, or do you feel pretty good about the updated time lines? Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Sure. So look, I mean, we are obviously going to take it quarter by quarter as it relates to buybacks and from a capital point of view. Again, without going through all of the things that reflect the environment that we're in, you can see the uncertainty that's out there. Obviously, the capital requirements with this SCB for the industry are higher. That's unfortunate. We feel as though the right amount of capital was in the industry already. We've got to manage to that. It's the right requirement. We're going to do that. But we'll -- SCB gives us the opportunity to take those decisions quarter-by-quarter. We're pausing for now. And next year, there'll be another DFAST process, and there'll be an SCB that comes out of that. And frankly, we should have the strength of higher PPNR that we've been generating to help contribute to what that outcome looks like. So, we'll take that quarter-by-quarter. In terms of risk-related to divestitures, again, we did highlight we're being very, very transparent with you all and with the world. And we do see some delays that we highlighted from our original schedule that's in the back of the presentation there. But, we feel very good about getting to closure there, and it's not an if, it's a when. And we feel like we're on track with the schedule that we've highlighted for you. Operator : Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : One more capital question. So, on slide 8, you do give the medium-term outlook here for what you see as your long-term goals for capital, the 11.5% to 12%. And so implicit within that is an expectation that your reg mins would fall to somewhere 200 basis points or so. And I get that the exits will be part of that. Is there a sense you can tell us, as you get more simplified, what the SCB benefit would be? I thought it was something like 25 basis points, but I must be off there. Mark Mason : Yes. Look, I mean, the 11.5 to 12 is consistent with what we talked about at Investor Day. And the medium term, as you know, Betsy, for us is three to five years. We've got a couple of things that we're working through, not the least of which are the divestitures. They will certainly contribute to that, but so will some of the other things that I've mentioned, including utilization of the DTA, the AOCI pullback and things of that sort. The divestitures certainly will help from an SCB point of view, but I think the stronger performance that we're seeing will aid in that as well. And importantly, the mix change that we expect to come from executing on our strategy, a mix towards more sustainable, predictable earnings, earnings that are coming from some of the areas of growth that we demonstrated this quarter like TTS and Securities Services, et cetera, et cetera. So there's time there. There's obviously a management buffer component of that that I think is certainly an important factor in consideration as we evolve our mix. And then, there's the G-SIB score. With not only a reduction in the divestitures that will impact peak-to-trough losses, there's also deposits that will go away with those and balance sheet evolution that will contribute to the reduction in G-SIB score as well. Jane Fraser : Yes. Let me just underline a couple of points. When we built our strategy, it wasn't only to generate greater returns, but it was to lower our capital requirements over time, as Mark said. And you can see how we're executing that both in terms of the shift in mix and the divestitures. Obviously, we don't control the regulatory capital framework. But we're not managing for short-term shifts in SCB. As you know, the banks experienced considerable variability in the SCB each year. It's very much depending on the scenario chosen. So, that's why we continue with our commitment and confidence around the medium term. Operator : Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : So, I had a follow-up question for Mark on NII. As the Fed continues down the path of balance sheet normalization, I just wanted to clarify whether that $1.8 billion increase in NII you cited for the back half assumes stable deposits or some Q2-related attrition. And within ICG specifically, are there any insights you can share on what drove the increase in Markets NII and how that should traject just given the historical liability sensitivity within the Markets business? Mark Mason : On the first point, when I think about the back half of the year in quantitative tightening, I do expect that we will see some continued deposit growth, as I mentioned earlier. The pressure from quantitative tightening, I think, will certainly play out over time. But again, our focus is on growing the operating deposits that we have with clients. And we think we've got good traction and ability to continue momentum with those operating deposits. And again, they put us in a position to really broaden the relationship with both, those multinational clients as well as with some of our commercial clients where we've been getting good growth in and momentum from. So yes, likely to be an impact across the industry, but we believe we can get some continued momentum, particularly on the operating deposits that we have with clients. In terms of Markets NII, I mean, you've got the European dividend that plays out in the second quarter. So that obviously is a factor there. And again, I'd point you to when we talk about Markets, I really like to talk about total revenues because the nature of the security and the trading and the activity that we do there can have an impact on NII and NIR. And what really matters is the total revenues that we're driving and generating out of that franchise. And as you can see, we did 25% growth in Markets revenue year-over-year. So, a very good quarter for the Markets team for sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O\u2019Connor: Can you elaborate on your comment about why the Russia exposure is kind of less of a risk or it's a better mix than it was a few months ago? And then maybe related to that, quantify how much of the $8.4 billion is to subsidiaries of MNCs, which does seem like it would be much, much lower risk. Thank you. Mark Mason : Sure. So, look, what we've been doing very actively since the beginning of the year and certainly in the quarter as well, has been working -- we've been working to bring down our exposure in Russia and specifically with the clients that we serve there. And so that direct exposure on -- in a local currency dials, we brought down by some $900 million or so in the quarter. We brought down and reduced the cash and deposits that we have by another $1.7 billion or so and then continued to bring down third-party related exposure by another $400 million. And that's been through working with clients to pay those exposures and loans down, and in some instances, giving them incentives to do so and incentives to move their deposits out as well. So, very active engagement from the team as it relates to that. What's happened with that is the mix of the exposure that we have or that remains has skewed towards the higher-quality names and towards the global subsidiaries that we have in the country. And so, with that mix shift to better quality names and the reduction in exposure, that's allowed for us to take down the reserves that we had related to the direct exposure in the quarter. And so, that has been, I think, good -- very good progress in terms of that reduction. It gets overshadowed a bit with the ruble impact, but we've made good progress and we're going to continue to actively do that. Approximately -- Jane, do you want to jump in on that? Jane Fraser : Yes, yes -- no, I was going to jump in, in terms of just sort of overall -- let's be very clear. We are systematically crunching down the size of our franchise. And as Mark says, the severe stress loss scenario is probably the best indicator of that, which is now around about the $2 billion and materially reduced them. And we completely change the nature of our exposure. Particularly when you think about today, most of our clients are multinationals. Many of the exposures there have parent guarantees against them, which is very helpful. What are we doing with them? Many of them that -- we're helping them with their exits from the countries. And that obviously, as you can all appreciate, takes some time. So for those that are able to exit swiftly, it's -- that's another factor that can help us reduce down our exposure presence and indeed our operations. There are also others though that it is harder. I think we've all seen how difficult it is to disconnect the Russian economy from the West in a couple of key sectors, in particular food and in particular energy. And as you can imagine, given the nature of our bank, we've been in the middle of some of those flows that are essential for the West and the multinationals that are supporting it. And so, you get a -- you have a bit of a blended story here in terms of -- yes, we're helping those that can exit, but we're also still playing the role that we have to and have been asked to in maintaining some of those flows. We anticipate that they will continue to reduce over time as the energy and food security issues get addressed. But it's a complex environment. And bottom line, you can hear us, we're pleased with how this has been managed by our teams. Operator : Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, can you share with us -- both of you addressed in your opening remarks about the impact the market conditions had on Investment Banking, and your peers have seen it as well. If the market conditions remain this way in the second half of the year and into 2023, just for Investment Banking, not Markets, your trading business, do you guys -- when do you guys have to take a sharper pencil to the expenses in that division, or do you just let it run? Jane Fraser : Maybe I kick off and then pass it over to Mark. Look, strategic advice is central to the vision to being the preeminent banking partner for multinational firms. We are continuing to strategically invest in talent and in the platform. You can expect us to continue doing so with a particular focus on the tech, health care and financial services sectors because those are ones where it is a decade-long shift that we're going to see in their importance. And I've -- we've brought in some very strong bankers there. It always takes a few years to build share, build out the client relationships and to see the full fruits of those investments. We're also focused on the broader opportunity by leveraging investments in Commercial Banking, I'm sure Mark will talk about that as well, and in Markets and the connectivity there. So, I think, you're going to see us take a strategic look at this and a long-term look, rather than just a shooting from the hip on the expenses side because we're building the firm for the long term here. We'll certainly be incredibly disciplined around expenses. You've seen that with us this quarter. We've talked about what we'll do on expenses across the board and the firm as we become simpler in tackling stranded costs, our organization structure, et cetera. But we're very serious about the investments that we're making into some of the core talent in these areas. And you shouldn't be expecting us to make any significant material shifts, right or left on this one. We're deadly serious. Mark? Mark Mason : Jane, I think that's well said. The only thing I'd add is that the business is capital-light and is high-returning through the cycle, and so we see a lot of value there. We want to be prepared to ramp up when activity starts again. And as you said, it's quite strategic for us. Since you kind of wound me up on the Commercial Banking activity, I have to jump at it. We had, as you know, Jane, a very strong quarter in Commercial Banking. When I look at the revenue momentum there just kind of leveraging the breadth of the franchise, we're probably up 25% to 30% in revenues in that part of the business. And I know that's part of our -- as you know, that's part of our core growth strategy that we talked about at Investor Day. So, good momentum in that part of the franchise as well. Jane Fraser : And obviously, having benefits for our Investment Banking colleagues as well. Mark Mason : Those synergies, yes. Jane Fraser : Important synergies, yes. Operator : Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Vivek Juneja : Jane, a question for you on Mexico. Given the comments of the Mexican President, would that limit the price that a buyer would be willing to pay? And what's your sort of minimum price that you're willing to accept? And if -- what's plan B if the prices being bid don't meet that hurdle? Jane Fraser : Oh, Vivek, I'm not going to answer your question. But I'll give you a few comments on Mexico nonetheless. So, we're pleased with the interest in our Mexican franchise based on the discussions with the buyers. And it's -- the franchise is performing well. It's more than maintaining its value. It's contributing nicely to our financial results. But it's still very early in this process. So, when we have news for you, we will obviously convey that to you swiftly. But, it's early days. And as you'd expect, with the transaction of this nature, we need to work through a variety of regulatory and legal proceedings. We're actively doing so. We're working hard on separating our market-leading institutional franchise, which is a key part of our global network, taking the time necessary to do that the right way. And we have a variety of different options that we can always look at. But it's far too early in the process here to speculate. But, so far, so good. Operator : Our next question will come from Andrew Lim with Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale. Andrew Lim : I guess, I'd like to have a better view from you on your outlook on recession. It is difficult to reconcile how investors feel about recession, which is obviously quite negative and seemingly a lot more negative than it was about a quarter ago. But when we look at you and some of your peers, the delta on the recession outlook seems only a little bit worse than it was one quarter ago. So, I was just wondering how you think about recession because some of the investors that we talk to, they look at the savings ratio, it's better pre-pandemic levels. They look at mortgage affordability, and it's really quite dire. And the perception that you have is obviously perhaps inconsistent with the way you were looking at recession. So perhaps you can give us a bit of color as to how you're thinking about things. Jane Fraser : Yes. I'll kick it off, pass it to Mark. Look, as we've talked about, the current macro environment is kind of shaped by the three Rs : Russia, rates and recession. It depends where in the world you are as to which one is prevailing. In the U.S., we're more concerned about rates and imminent recession. The consumer and the corporate are healthy. The labor market is exceedingly tight. We are increasingly concerned about the possibility of a recession next year. But I think what you're hearing from us quite loud and clear is that we think the economy is quite well positioned to withstand it. Europe, different story. Fragility of their energy supply to any further shocks makes it more vulnerable, and it's kind of at the center of the storm. So, we do believe that the continent is heading into a recession under the most likely scenario and could be as early as this fall. In Asia, concerns are largely focused around China and its COVID -- Zero COVID policy. The economy is bouncing back, but you could have another wave that could be more problematic there. So, you put all these different factors. So, it's a little bit -- depends on where in the world that you are. When I think about Citi, look, we're prepared for a variety of scenarios. We are absolutely ready. We run stress tests all the time given the unique set of risks facing the global economy right now. We have a set of playbooks honed over many years that can get instituted as necessary. And what matters for a bank heading into recession? Capital, liquidity, credit quality and reserves. And we feel very good about all four of them. Very strong capital ratios, as you've seen, ending 2Q. Total liquidity resources just shy of $1 trillion. Over 80% of our corporate exposures are investment-grade. Our consumer clients are heavily prime. And let's just talk a little bit about the ICG NCL this quarter. When you look at the numbers, it was $18 million only. The health of the corporate is entering into the choppy waters is extremely strong. And we have -- we've got a very well reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 2.44. So, we have a lot of flexibility here. We have a severe recession. I think you'll see certain actions taken, another one is being slower. But as a bank, we're ready for a whole variety of different scenarios. Mark? Mark Mason : Yes. Jane, just to your point on reserves, just in the quarter, you saw we took a reserve build. That reserve build was in part driven by our view on the potential for some downside in light of everything that we're seeing and the concerns around recession. So we did take a bit of a build from a CECL point of view on reserves. And as Jane mentioned, we feel very good about our reserve levels and the $18 billion that we have associated with our franchise. Jane Fraser : Yes. I think the consumer -- it's just an unusual situation to be entering into this choppy environment when you have a consumer with strong health and such a tight labor market. And I think that's where you hear so many of us, not so much concerned about an imminent recession in the States. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Mike Mayo : Can you hear me? Jane Fraser : Yes, we can, Mike. Hello again. Mike Mayo : Hi, before I have my beach reading. Thank you for that. Look, to regain investor credibility, you've mentioned meeting various proof points. And can you remind us which proof points you've met, which proof points we should hold you accountable to looking ahead in the next quarter and year? Jane Fraser : Okay. I think you hold us accountable for all the different proof points we laid out. We went through a very thoughtful process to come up with the different KPIs for the strategy. And those are transparently put into the materials. We're trying to make it as shareholder and investor-friendly as possible in that respect. And as you can see this quarter, the drivers exceeded expectations in some places. There were headwinds in others. We laid them out very clearly. You saw -- we talked about services, so I don't need to cover that one again. In Markets, we talked about optimizing RWA, driving the business for stronger capital productivity, also driving more of the Alpha trade solution business. You see that Personal Banking returning to IEB and revenue growth on customer acquisition, purchase sales being important metrics. Investment Banking, it's progress on key hires and -- that we've been making. That's obviously been a tough market to do so, but I mean, pleased with the talent that we've brought in and delighted with the talent that we have. Wealth was more challenged with lockdowns in Asia understandably slowing some progress on client acquisitions and some of the key strategy drivers there. But synergies, more disciplined, tighter processes reinforced by additional metrics on the scorecard, you'll be hearing us talking more and more about the delivery of those synergies. So, it's not really any different from exactly what we laid out on Investor Day, right? We've laid out a strategy. We have a lot of conviction around. We've laid out the different metrics to hold us accountable to, and it should provide you a sense of progress along the way. And we've also talked about what we're doing to get this cultural change of accountability, of urgency, of intensity and excellence. And we'll give you as many different indicators of where that's working well and where it's not as we go along. Mark Mason : If I can just add one thing to that, Jane. And Mike, I think you got to keep in mind that this is a very strong quarter for us. We feel very good about it, but it's just a quarter. Jane Fraser : Yes. Mark Mason : Right? And we talked about at Investor Day a long-term strategy, and we gave you a sense for medium-term targets. And those things are going to be things that you hold us accountable between now and then, right? And so, this is one quarter. We feel great about it. We're certainly glad that you're recognizing it, but there's a lot more wood to chop. We're making a lot of investments in the franchise that we know are going to pay dividends in the future. And we look forward to kind of talking through continued progress in these KPIs. It won't always be a straight line, but we remain confident that we're going to get there. Jane Fraser : Yes. And we fully recognize the magnitude of what we have to do, and we're determined to get this done. Operator : Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan. Jane Fraser : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Jane. Don't worry. I won't trip you up on another one you can't answer, hopefully. Jane Fraser : I didn't say, can't. I said won't. There's a big difference. Vivek Juneja : Won't. Okay. Yes. Okay, good. Hopefully, this one you will. Mark, your 8% NII growth for full year, is there something in the second quarter that was unusually high that we should not carry forward? I'm just trying to reconcile that with the guide that you've given, because if we just take that forward, it would be above the 8%. So, trying to reconcile what's the difference. Mark Mason : Look, I mean, each of the quarters obviously have different dynamics, different rate moves, different volume levels of volume growth and what have you. And so, there's certainly different volume levels between quarter one and quarter two. And I described kind of how rates would move between the quarters as well. And so, to simplify it and because there is appropriate interest in how we think about it on an ex Markets basis, I just gave you the annualization of the half and what it would mean for the full year. So, nothing that I would point out beyond what you would notice, which is differences in rates and volumes across the businesses. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jen Landis : Thank you all for joining today's call. Please, if you have any follow-up questions, reach out to IR. Have a great day. Thank you.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello. And welcome to Citi\u2019s Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call with the Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. You \u2013 also as a reminder, this call is being recorded today. [Operator Instructions] Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, Operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen, and thanks everyone for joining us today. Well, we are certainly still living through interesting times, and overall, I am pleased with how our Bank is navigating through them. As you will hear from me shortly, we continue to focus intensely on executing our strategy and our transformation as we outlined at Investor Day, whilst supporting our clients in this complex environment. So before I get into the quarter, let me highlight some observations about what we see going on around the world, given our unique vantage point. The global macro outlook that we shared with you over the last couple of quarters has been borne out. There is accumulating evidence of slowing global growth and we now expect to experience rolling country level recessions starting this quarter. The severity and timing of these recessions depend, where in the world you are, although, persistently high inflation is driving a global softening of consumer demand for goods. In the Eurozone and the U.K., the supply shocks are most severe. Growth prospects have deteriorated sharply and headline inflation is running at nearly 10%. All eyes are on this winter\u2019s weather forecast and the energy supply. The U.S. economy, however, remains relatively resilient. So while we are seeing signs of economic slowing consumers and corporates remain healthy, as our very low net credit losses demonstrate. Supply chain constraints are easing, the labor market remains strong, so it is all a question of what it takes to truly tame persistently high core inflation. Now, history would suggest that that will be quite a lot and for some time. Therefore, we could well see a mild recession in the second half of 2023. We believe the U.S. economy is well positioned to withstand it, all else being equal in the geopolitical arena that is. Finally, in Asia, we continue to be concerned with China\u2019s COVID lockdowns, which took a bigger bite out of economic activity than anticipated, exacerbated by a lack of intensified macro stimulus. It is geopolitical risks and rates that dominate discussions with our corporate clients worldwide, and I\u2019d say, we are more focused on market liquidity generally, and counterparty risk than our credit risk in the near-term. Nonetheless, we are planning conservatively and we are prepared for all environments. Against this backdrop, today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63 and an RoTCE of 8.2%. We grew revenues by 6%, including a gain on sale of our consumer business in the Philippines. While we had excellent performance in some areas, our results could have been better in a few others. Services delivered another very strong quarter. TTS saw revenues up 40% year-over-year, with growth in each business and in fees. Key drivers of our strategy such as wallet share, trade loan originations and cross border transactions are all trending strongly in the right direction and are ahead of our plan. Securities Services was up 15%, despite asset under custody being impacted by the declines in equity markets. We have onboarded over a $1 trillion in AUC and AUA since the beginning of the year and we are seeing good momentum in issuer services in particular. Market on the other hand came in lower, with revenues down 7%. In Fixed Income, we matched last year\u2019s particularly good showing through our longstanding strength in FX, offsetting a weaker quarter in spread products. In Equities, reduced activity in derivatives, which is a core part of our platform led to lower revenues, compared to last year\u2019s exceptional performance and we continued to optimize RWA end markets consistent with our strategy. Banking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment across the industry, with geopolitics and fears of recession significantly reducing deal flows and the appetite for M&A. We continue to invest in building out our teams for long-term growth opportunities including healthcare, technology and energy, and I am really pleased with the high-caliber bankers who are attracted to both our platform and our culture. The environment to Wealth Management continued to be less than ideal. Our revenues were down only slightly and meaningfully up outside of Asia. Our strategy to capture the synergies of our businesses such as the Wealth referral initiatives between Commercial Banking, Retail Banking and Investment Banking is progressing well. We also continued to steadily attract new clients and increase the ranks of our client advisers as you will see in our KPIs. Nonetheless, we are slowing the pace of some of the investments in this business, given the environment. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory. Card sales, A&R, interest-earning balances and customer acquisition all saw a good growth and we continued to increase digital uptake. Retail Services joined Branded Cards in having double-digit revenue growth this quarter. Retail Banking also grew contributing to a 10% overall revenue increase to the business. As you can see in the presentation, our cost of credit reflects the quality of our loan portfolio in both ICG and PBWM. There were effectively no credit losses in ICG and U.S. Consumer NCLs remain well below the pre-COVID levels. Consumer loan growth, together with the worsening of our macroeconomic assumptions drove a modest ACL build this quarter. While, our expenses are elevated as we continue to invest in our businesses and in our transformation, we are managing them closely and we remain on track to meet the full year guidance. As you know, the transformation is a multiyear effort and we are committed to meeting the expectations of our regulators, given the paramount importance of safety and soundness. We continue to be in constructive dialogs with them and are updating our execution plans as appropriate. Stepping back, I am generally pleased with the advances we are making and the key drivers of the strategy we laid out for you in March and these are laid out on page three. We are seeing good momentum in realizing client synergies and in attracting talent to grow the franchise. In terms of simplification, we continue to make progress on the divestitures of our international consumer businesses and the elimination of their associated stranded costs. We closed the sale of the Philippines during the third quarter and are on track to close Bahrain, Malaysia and Thailand during the fourth quarter. We also announced the wind down of our consumer franchise in the U.K. to focus fully on the Wealth franchise there. I would also note we are ahead of our plan in our Korean consumer wind down. We continue to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia. To be clear, our intention is to wind down our presence in that country. In August, we announced the wind down of our consumer and local Commercial Banking businesses. While we have been supporting our multinational clients in Russia, we are now informing them that we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer by the end of the first quarter of next year. At that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory obligations. Turning to Capital, we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through common dividends during the quarter, while buybacks continue to be on hold. We will keep evaluating that decision on a quarterly basis, as due to increasing regulatory requirements we build our CET1 ratio to 13% or so by mid next year and that includes a management buffer of 100 basis points. We ended the quarter at a CET1 ratio of 12.2%, as we actively managed our RWA usage throughout our lines of business. Lastly, our tangible book value per share increased to $80.34. So, the bottomline is that while the environment is a challenging one and we expect it will remain so, we continue to focus relentlessly on executing the strategy we presented to you at our Investor Day and on making steady progress. Now I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark and then we would be delighted as always to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thank you, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I am going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses, credit and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment and end with full year 2022 guidance. On slide four, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of $3.5 billion and EPS of $1.63, with an RoTCE of 8.2% on $18.5 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $520 million, largely driven by a gain on the sale of the Philippines consumer business. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, EPS and RoTCE would have been $1.50 and 7.5%, respectively. In the quarter, total revenues increased 6% on a reported basis excluding divestiture-related impacts revenues were down 1% as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenues. Net interest income grew 18% driven by the impact of higher interest rates across the firm and strong loan growth in PBWM. Non-interest revenues were down 12% on a reported basis and 28% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely reflecting declines in Investment Banking, Markets and Investment Revenues in Wealth. Total expenses of $12.7 billion increased 8% and 7% excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely driven by transformation, inflation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.4 billion, driven by net credit losses of approximately $900 million and an ACL build of approximately $500 million, primarily driven by loan growth in PBWM. At the end of the quarter, we had $18.7 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.5%. On slide five, we show net interest income, loans and deposits. In the third quarter, total net interest income increased by approximately $600 million on a sequential basis and approximately $1.9 billion on a year-over-year basis across the firm, driven by higher interest rates, management of deposit re-pricing and loan growth in PBWM. Average loans were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and lower balances in Legacy Franchises. Excluding FX, loans were largely flat and average deposits were down by approximately 2%, largely driven by declines in Legacy Franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation, partially offset by the issuance of institutional CDs as we continue to diversify the funding profile of the Bank. Excluding FX deposits were up roughly 1%, and sequentially, our net interest margin increased by 7 basis points. On slide six, we show an expense walk for the third quarter with the key underlying drivers. As I mentioned earlier, expenses increased by 8% and 7% excluding the impact of divestitures, 2% of the increase was driven by transformation investments, with about two-thirds related to the risk, controls, data and finance programs, and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. As of today, we have over 10,000 people dedicated to the transformation. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, as we continue to hire commercial and investment bankers, as well as client advisers in Wealth and we continue to invest in the client experience, as well as front-office onboarding and platforms. 1% was due to higher volume-related expenses across both PBWM and ICG. And approximately 3% was driven by other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Across all these buckets, we continue to invest in technology, including systems and hiring people, resulting in our technology related spend up approximately 16% for the quarter. On slide seven, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Over the last several years, we have been disciplined with our loan growth and consistent with our risk appetite framework. This framework includes credit risk limits that consider concentrations including country, industry, credit rating, and in the case of consumer, FICO scores, and importantly, these limits apply across the firm in aggregate and we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentrations under a range of stress scenarios. As a result, we feel very good about our asset quality and reserve levels. As I mentioned earlier, our reserve-to-funded loan ratio is approximately 2.5%, and within that PBWM and U.S. Cards is 3.7% and 7.5%, respectively, both right around day one CECL levels. In PBWM, the majority of our card portfolios skew towards higher FICO customers and while we have started to see signs of normalization in both portfolios, NCL rates continue to be less than half of pre-COVID levels. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% as investment grade and non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 40 basis points of total loans. So, we are well reserved for a variety of scenarios and we continuously evaluate our scenarios to reflect the evolving macro environment. On slide eight, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintained a very strong balance sheet, of our $2.4 trillion of assets, about 23% or $557 billion are high quality liquid assets or HQLA and we maintained total liquidity resources of approximately $967 billion. The combination of earnings generation, capital from exits and RWA optimization drove our CET1 ratio up by about 25 basis points to approximately 12.2% on a standardized basis, which remains our binding constraint and our tangible book value per share was $80.34, up 2% from a year ago. On slide nine, we show a sequential $0.2 billion [ph] of net income to common, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 8 basis points. Third, the interest rate impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 5-basis-point reduction. Fourth, changes in the DTA drove a 3-basis-point reduction. And finally, the remaining 14-basis-point increase was largely driven by net RWA optimization. In light of our increasing regulatory capital requirement, we ended the quarter with a 12.2% CET1 ratio, 25 basis points higher than last quarter. Importantly 12.2% is above our current regulatory requirement of 11.5% as of October 1st and above 12%, which will be our regulatory requirement as of January 1st of next year. As we said last quarter, we continue to gradually build to a CET1 target of approximately 13% by midyear 2023, which includes the current 4% SCB and 100-basis-point management buffer. On slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group. Revenues were down 5%, as strong growth in services was more than offset by lower revenues across markets and banking. Expenses increased 10%, driven by transformation, business-led investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity and foreign exchange translation. Foster credit was driven by a reserve build of $86 million. While deterioration in certain macro variables did lead to a build, it was mostly offset by the release of a COVID-19 related uncertainty reserve and a release related to direct exposures in Russia. This resulted in a net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 30%. Average loans were up 1% driven by 9% growth in TTS loans, partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation. Average deposits were down 2%, also largely driven by foreign exchange translation. And ICG delivered an RoTCE of 9%. On slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out in Investor Day, which we will show you each quarter. In services, we continue to see a very strong new client pipeline and deepening with our existing clients and expect that momentum to continue. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 40%, driven by 61% growth in net interest income, as well as 8% growth in NIR across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 2%, cross-border flows up 10%, commercial card volumes up roughly 50% and average loans up 19%. So while the rate environment drove about 40% of the growth this quarter business actions, drove the remaining 60%. This includes continuing to manage deposit re-pricing and deepening with existing clients and significant new client wins across all client segments. Through the first half of the year, based on the industry data that we see, we estimate that we gained over 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments, including wins with financial institutions, which are up almost 50%. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client\u2019s primary operating Bank. In addition, weak products in the U.S. and Asia, which allows clients to connect their liquidity and funding to their operating flows seven days a week. In Securities Services, revenues grew 15%, as net interest income grew 73%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies, partly offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We continue to be pleased with the execution in Security Services as we onboarded approximately $1 trillion of assets under custody and administration so far this year from significant client wins and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. And we estimate that we have gained about 60 basis points of share in Security Services through the first half of this year, including in our home market. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and our two of our higher returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 7%, largely driven by spread products, equities and RWA actions as we continue to focus on returns. Fixed Income Markets revenues were up 1% as strength in rates and FX was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products and through the first half of the year, we gained approximately 40 basis points of share. Equity Markets revenues were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter last year. The actions we took to optimize RWA in markets are in line with the strategy we discussed at Investor Day and we are making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets so far this year. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 49%, driven by Investment Banking, as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continue to impact client activity. Also embedded in the results is an impact of approximately $110 million related to marks on loan commitments and losses on loan sales. So, overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress we are making as we continue to deepen existing client relationships, as well as acquire new clients. Now turning to slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6% as net interest income grow was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment fee revenue in Wealth and higher partner payments in Retail Services. Expenses were up 13%, driven by transformation, other risk and control initiatives business led investments and volume driven expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.1 billion, which included a reserve build primarily driven by card volume growth. NCLs were 13% higher year-over-year from near historically low levels, reflecting normalization particularly in Retail Services. Overall, we continue to see strong credit performance across portfolios. Average loans grew 5%, driven by strong growth across branded cards, Retail Services and Retail Banking. Average deposits grew 1%, driven by growth across Retail and Wealth, partially offset by foreign exchange translation, and PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 9.7%. On slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product, as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 10%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 10%, card spend volumes up 14% and average loans up 12%. Retail Services revenues were up 12%, also driven by higher net interest income, partially offset by higher partner payments. So despite payment rates remaining elevated, the investments we have been making contributed to growth in interest earning balances of 9% in branded cards and 7% in Retail Services, and we expect to continue to grow these balances in the fourth quarter. Retail Banking revenues were up 2%, primarily driven by interest rates and deposit growth. Wealth revenues were down 2%, as investment fee headwinds and particularly in Asia more than offset net interest income growth. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 4%. Client advisers were up 5% and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business, with new clients in ultra-high net worth and wealth work of 7% and 27%, respectively, for the quarter. And we are also leveraging our Retail network, which has driven almost 50,000 Wealth referrals so far this year. While the environment continues to remain challenging, we are seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues increased 66%, primarily driven by the Philippines gain on sale in the quarter and the absence of the Australia loss on sale in the prior year period. Excluding these items, revenues were down about 12%, largely due to the loss of revenues from the Australia and Philippines closing, as well as the impact of the Korea wind down. Expenses increased 6%, driven by divestiture impacts in Asia and Mexico. Loans and deposits decreased as a result of the reclassification of signed exits to other assets and other liabilities, the closing of the Philippine sale and the impact of the Korea wind down. On slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio, partially offset by the mark-to-market on certain derivative transactions and expenses were down. On slide 16, I will briefly touch on our full year 2022 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues to be up in the low single-digit range, excluding divestiture related impacts. And within that, we continue to see a shift with higher net interest income offset by lower non-interest revenue. So, for the fourth quarter, we expect net interest income excluding markets to be up in the range of $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-over-year. Clearly, where we land within that range will be a function of a number of factors, including rates, loans and deposit volumes, deposit betas and currency impacts. Regarding full year expenses, we continue to expect expenses to grow by 7% to 8%, excluding divestiture related impacts. In terms of cost of credit, it will be a function of the evolution of the macro environment, normalization that we continue to expect in the cards businesses and loan growth. And keep in mind that loan growth tends to be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third given typical holiday spending. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to end with a few key points. We continue to execute on the strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. We are seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we are confident we can achieve our medium-term targets in a variety of scenarios. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hello. Thanks very much. So definitely a good performance at TTS, rates help a ton, but I see loan growth and fees and I heard your comments about growth across all client segments. I wonder if we could pull back \u2013 Jane pull back in a drop and talk about those two in separate pieces. One is 61% year-on-year NII, how do betas factor in and go forward over the next year in terms of higher rates and how that factors through? And then two, what specifically is growing within TTS across those client segments to drive that high single-digit growth? Mark Mason : Sure. Good morning, Glenn. Why don\u2019t I take that and kind of take it in two pieces, the two pieces that you laid out. So, as you know, Glenn, when we think about our business just in aggregate, there\u2019s obviously a split between the Institutional and the Consumer side. Our TTS business, which is on the Institutional side and these corporate clients, they tend to have higher betas in general than, obviously, the Retail Banking side. What we have seen is that the betas have been increasing. They are still running lower than what we had expected, but again, they have been increasing. And with continued expected rate increases, I would expect that those betas will continue to rise in the coming quarters. We have been actively managing beta -- deposit pricing and re-pricing with our clients on an ongoing basis. You know that this is more than just a deposit taking business. This is a business where we are looking to manage the operating accounts of our clients and bring the breadth of what we offer in our franchise to them. And so those -- that\u2019s the type of conversation we have been having with them and we will continue to do that with an eye towards growing the volume of deposits with both the existing, as well as with new clients. And so we, again, expect to see betas to rise \u2013 betas rise, but also expect to see continued contribution to the NII. The other aspect of your question is what else has been driving the activity? I mentioned a couple of those things, so it\u2019s not just deepening with existing clients, but it\u2019s also onboarding new clients. We have seen cross-border transaction value up about 10%. The commercial card spend is up meaningfully, trade originations are up 27% and so a lot of active engagement with our clients. We have been winning new mandates. We have seen an uptick in client wins up about 20% and we have been gaining share across those client segments. And so, hopefully, that gives you a little bit of example -- of examples of where the benefits or momentum is coming from on the NIR side. The NIR growth of 8% is driven really by the cards, the payments and receivables, as well as trade. Jane Fraser : And I\u2019d just jump in and say, I think, there\u2019s a bit of a miss at the moment that the global environment is detrimental to activity. We see quite the opposite. Volatility is something in which we are very active in helping our multinational clients around the world manage, the local footprint we have and the global network we have is a tremendous asset right now. So we are seeing a lot of positive momentum, which may not always be intuitive to everyone, but I think it\u2019s what makes the network, the crown jewel of Citi. Glenn Schorr : No doubt. I appreciate all that. A quick one on markets, not quite as good as the years, but that comes and goes. I know that\u2019s a function of last year was really strong, it\u2019s a function of mix in any given quarter. What I really want to focus on is your comments on RWA optimization, what specifically are you doing? I know it\u2019s in the Banking book, but I did see you taking down your capital, call it, redemption facility line. But in markets, what are you pulling back on RWA, just which pieces of that business find that interesting? Mark Mason : Sure. So, Glenn, you will remember at Investor Day, we talked not only about RWA optimization broadly, but specifically as it relates to markets. And we talked about the idea of increasing our revenue to RWA ratio for markets to about 5.5% over the course of that Investor Day period. So we have been actively working across the markets business, in equities, in fixed income and spread products, and looking for opportunities where there are low returning uses of RWA to either increase the returns on that or to actually kind of exit it. And that includes a host of different structures. It includes working with clients to post additional collateral in some instances and other types of structures like that, that improved the RWA, including hedging, and like I said, posting collateral and taking a look at margin that we have and ensuring that we are, in fact, getting the most for that use of RWA. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John McDaniel -- McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. John McDonald : Yeah. Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Mark, I wanted to just clarify what, I think the expense guide is for fourth quarter, it seems like the guidance for the full year implies a fourth quarter step-up to maybe 12.8% and change from 12, 7.5% this quarter. Is that the right read, a little bit of a step-up in the fourth quarter and is that just a pull-through of investments and what would be driving that? Mark Mason : Yeah. So, again, the guidance on full year expenses hasn\u2019t changed. It\u2019s the 7% to 8% ex-fee impact of divestitures that would imply a bit of an uptick there. It is on the heels of the continued investments that we are making and that\u2019s flowing through, as well as how we -- how revenues kind of play out and the associated compensation activity that goes along with that. So, nothing extraordinary and consistent with the guidance given. John McDonald : Okay. And I know it\u2019s too early to give formal guidance for next year, but if we look at the Investor Day slides, it seems to imply that expenses go up for a few years until you get to the medium-term. Is that implies at $51 million or so next year as a starting point. I mean is it fair when I read the Investor Day slides and think about your investments that directionally expenses probably do go up next year? Mark Mason : John, I\u2019d say, as you know, right, we will give guidance for 2023 next quarter. But I think if you think back to the Investor Day and you think about some of the things that we just commented on with regard to our Services business, we would expect to see continued tailwinds as it relates to net interest income. We would expect to get to the heart of your question that we will continue to invest in the franchise that in the transformation, excuse me, that would obviously peak and then we would start to see the benefits start to play out from that in that medium-term period. And so, yes, you can probably expect some type of a tick up, but I will give you more details on that when we talk about the 2023 outlook in the next quarter. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Erika Najarian : Yeah. Just wanted \u2013 thank you. Yeah. Just wanted to take a step back, your 11% to 12% medium-term RoTCE target had contemplated an 11.5% to 12% CET1 versus the 13% that you are targeting to by midyear next year? Also that you laid out on that same slide that you are targeting 2% fed funds over the medium-term, which seems kind of cute right now. I guess I am wondering, your confidence and like you said you are confident you could hit medium-term targets even with this creep in capital, is it really that shift in the rate environment that\u2019s helping you get there despite the higher denominator? Mark Mason : So thank you for the question. Look, I think, there are a couple of things to kind of think back on that still hold true, which is the strategy that we have built, I think, is a resilient strategy and it really spoke to topline momentum that we expected, not just through rate increases, but also through share gains and also through the business led investments that we -- that we are making and better leveraging the synergies and linkages across the franchise. All of those things still hold true to the topline. You are right, the fed funds assumption has changed. Back in March, I think, we all were looking at a fed funds rate at the end of the year that was closer to 1.5% or so, and so now here we are with the hikes that we have seen and looking at something certainly north of 4%, 4.5%. And so that\u2019s changed meaningfully, but there are a number of other drivers that contribute to achieving that return, including, it\u2019s the medium term, so call it, three years to five years, I think, is how we characterized it and starting to see some of the benefits from the transformation investments that we are making. To your point on capital, we are building to the 13%. Remember, that is a byproduct of a 4% SCB for this particular CCAR cycle and the strategy that we described includes a mix in our shift of revenues and earnings over time, a mix towards more stable PPNR and more fee revenues that will contribute to, I think, a balance sheet and a mix that is certain -- that generates fewer losses -- stress losses than our balance sheet might today. So the contribution of those things, we think will drive that return target that we have set and we still remain confident about that. Now, with that said, there are unknowns that are out there. I just spoke to many of the nobles and so what happens with further capital requirements and the current regulatory regime and what like \u2013 and what have you, it\u2019s hard to predict, but we will manage to that as we learn and know more about it. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my follow-up question is, given Citi\u2019s valuation on book, I think, your current and prospective shareholders are waiting for buybacks to potentially return. I guess a two-part question here. Number one, especially if you think you could stabilize your PPNR in the stress test, why 100-basis-point management buffer versus one of your peers at 50-basis-point that reported today? And secondarily, as we think about impact the timing, as I recall, there\u2019s a currency translation adjustment that could be negative upfront at announcement to CET1, but you get that all back during close. So I guess the real big question here is, how should we think about, what are the mile markers for the return of buyback activity at Citi? Mark Mason : Okay. Thank you, Erika. There\u2019s a lot bit unpack if I forget anything just please remind me. But it started at the beginning, which is, I know where we trade in terms of book value and I\u2019d love to be in a position where we were buying back given that valuation. With that said, we are going to take it quarter-by-quarter, as I think you have heard us say and evaluate what buyback decisions and capital actions make the most sense in light of the environment that we are managing through. We are clearly managing through an uncertain environment. We do -- as I just said and as you kind of mentioned as well, we do see our business mix shifting over time on the heels of our strategy. I do think that over time, that will contribute, as I said, to the capital requirements that we have, but that\u2019s over the medium-term. And we do still see a fair amount of volatility in the stress capital buffer. And part of the reason that we have the management buffer is to deal not only with that uncertainty in the SCB, but also in interest rates and we are seeing volatility in both frankly. And so we will continue to evaluate the management buffer as well to see what makes sense as we move towards that medium-term. In terms of the Mexico transaction, you are right in terms of we have mentioned before the CTA component to that. That is a timing difference. We have factored that in to the path to our 13% by middle of next year and factor that into achieving the longer term targets that we set for ourselves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Can you hear me? Jane Fraser : Yes. We can, Mike. Mike Mayo : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Good morning. Mike Mayo : Look, I look at the global network as a curse and a blessing. I guess the curse part is simply the complexity and the expenses, and Mark, you said expenses should go up higher next year. You are not going to tell us for a few more months, but I am just wondering when you think you can grow revenues faster than expenses. Again, it\u2019s not new news, the revenue and expenses, you guided it and you are within that range. It\u2019s just as we waited, we have to wait a year or three years or how long for that complexity to get more simplified so revenues can catch up to that expense growth? And then on the blessing side, Mark, you mentioned, you said gain share in those client segments. I thought that was a little vague. I mean, you talked about trade. You talked about other activity connecting multinational corporations in the period of volatility. So if you could put a little more meat on the bone as far as when you talk about market share and those tailwinds on the revenues, while you have the headwinds on the expenses from the global network. Jane Fraser : Hey, Mike. It\u2019s Jane. I am jumping in, because I do want to talk a bit about your point on the global network here. I have to tell you, I am hard pressed to find a negative to the global network. We start off with the vision for the Bank that we laid out in March. It is to be the preeminent banking partner for clients with cross-border needs. Who are those clients? It is 5,000 multinationals on their subsidiaries, it\u2019s institutional investors and the ultra high net worth clients with a heavy tilt to family offices. And we serve them on FX, on liquidity management, on their payroll, on their supply chain, as well as strategic advice financing, et cetera. That\u2019s $4 trillion in daily volume, 80% of that credit portfolio is investment grade. So when we are looking at it, it\u2019s the multinational to take a higher risk country, it\u2019s the client base we are serving there of the global multinationals much more than the local players. And so this is not a -- this is a relatively simple high returning, very well growing as we are seeing at the moment capability that is exceedingly hard to replicate. So let me pass over to Mark in terms of what are some of the examples of different areas of the drivers of growth? Mark Mason : Yeah. Jane Fraser : This is -- as I said at the beginning, this is a crown jewel. It\u2019s not a source of complexity for the Bank. Mark Mason : Yeah. So, Mike, I\u2019d say a couple of things. One, what I said was that, we continue to gain share, and I referenced specifically about 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients and we obviously or not obviously, we are also winning mandates and gaining share with other client segments as well, you know that the Commercial Banking client segment is one that we are focused on given the strength of our platform and its applicability to those sized clients as well. I mentioned that our wins are up and specifically, they are up 20%, the mandates that we are winning across all client segments and that specifically with FIs, they are up almost 50%. So hopefully, that gives you some sense of where the revenue growth is coming from. The takeaway there is it\u2019s both existing, as well as new clients as we kind of continue to build out the platform and build out our capabilities to reach them. So the second part of your question was around expenses and expenses growing and when will we have topline growth that exceeds the expense growth. And I\u2019d remind you that, the work we are doing on the transformation, as well as the business led investments are multiyear almost by definition and important in order to derive savings in our structural cost base over time. And at Investor Day, I think I pointed to, by the time we got to that medium-term period, we would see our operating efficiency go down to less than 60%. I think we have been very deliberate about trying to give you guidance and update you on guidance for the full year, and along the way and we will be consistent in that discipline and I can certainly give you more color on 2023, as I mentioned earlier to John, the next -- in the next quarter. Mike Mayo : And just one clarification, when you say you have gained 60 basis points of share with large corporate clients, what do you mean by share, share of what? Mark Mason : A wallet, 60 basis points, not 50 basis points, 60 basis points. So market share with them. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess, one, just Mark, I wanted to clarify your NII guide for $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion is just total NII, right? It\u2019s not ex-markets or anything? Mark Mason : It is ex-markets. Ebrahim Poonawala : It is ex-markets. Any perspective or view on where you see markets heading in fourth quarter, just given what\u2019s happened with the rate backdrop? Mark Mason : I don\u2019t \u2013 I -- very intentionally don\u2019t forecast markets NII in a rising rate environment. You would normally see the markets NII come down. It tends to be liability sensitive. But we tend to focus on, as you probably heard me say a number of times, total revenues for this business. And I guess what I\u2019d highlight is that in periods of uncertainty and lots of market volatility, our businesses tend to perform well and so we will see how the fourth quarter plays out. There\u2019s obviously some seasonality to it that has taken place historically and so we have to kind of factor all those things in, but we will have to see how it further evolves. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hey, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Just two things, one, just another question on the expense side, I just wanted to follow up with regard to, Mark, I think, the stranded costs that you had talked about at the Barclays Conference and I am wondering if I got the message right there, which is when you exit the consumer businesses, there\u2019s 25% that is generally managed through a TSA. So it\u2019s a service agreement and that expense will come off over time and then there\u2019s another 25%, which is likely not to come off. Is that fair or is there a different message that I am missing on that? Mark Mason : Yeah. That\u2019s not fair. But I appreciate the answer clarity. So I bucket into three buckets. So one is, when we do these transactions, both Jane and I have deep experience in this. We tend to see about half of the costs go away to the buyer. So when we do the transaction, when we do the sale. As you pointed out, about 25% is often in place as part of a transition service agreement and so there\u2019s revenues that we get paid to offset that expense until things have totally transitioned and then that goes away. And then the third bucket is what I call potentially stranded cost and what Jane calls not stranded call, right? And that is, I say, potentially, because their regional expenses that get allocated to countries, for example, they are global expenses that get allocated to the region and to the countries, for example, and what we have to do. And what we are doing is we are attacking what would otherwise be stranded cost and we are attacking that by telling each of the functions in the business and here\u2019s your portion of that 25% and come back and tell me how you are going to rethink your org structure, simplify your processes in order to drive that cost out of the company, right? And so that\u2019s what we have been doing, remember the expense base here is probably $7 billion. So you can break down kind of the population that we are talking about. We have already stood up a team work with each of the businesses and each of the functions around getting in front of that cost so that we can drive that down over the near-term period of time. Jane Fraser : And as this got, I just can\u2019t help myself but jump in here. I think as Mark \u2013 so I am spotting at Mark here. Mark and I are both pretty maniacally focused around this. But I\u2019d say, at the moment, we have had a couple of the divestitures closed, we have another three next quarter and this continues on. We already started on Australia and the Philippines, and getting those expenses down, as Mark said. There is going to be and we will not be shy in capturing as an opportunity to simplify our organization further next year when we have more of the divestitures closed and streamlining more of our regional management structures, more of the expenses at the global level. So there is more to come on that and we will be looking to do that. As I indicated at Investor Day that will be an important part once more of the divestitures are closed starting in 2023 going into 2024. Betsy Graseck : Right. So you were, Mark\u2019s potentially stranded costs, and Jane, you are no stranded cost, the no stranded cost is in the guide medium-term? Mark Mason : In terms of the\u2026 Jane Fraser : Yeah. Mark Mason : \u2026 time to get it out, is that, yeah. Jane Fraser : Yes. And I think\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Jane Fraser : \u2026 that\u2019s why -- as Mark talks about expenses, you have got to look at the various different dynamics that are going on. So, yes, we have got investments into the transformation at the moment. Many of those translate into better efficiency, as well as a safer, stronger firm, the divestitures translate into lower cost, but also we eliminate the stranded costs and we simplify the organization. You have got a number of different factors that we will make completely transparent to you at play in our expense base from a more structural dimension in the quarters ahead. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O'Connor: Hi. Can you guys talk about the pace of addressing some of the regulatory issues out there? On the one hand, you got out of the AML consent order earlier this year, which I think was a very big positive. But on the other hand, there was an article last month, suggesting regulators want you to go faster and I think we all know regulators always want things to go faster on these issues, but I did want to ask the question? Thank you. Jane Fraser : Yeah. We all want things to go faster, both our clients, our shareholders, the management team, regulators, the Board all. So I think we are fully aligned there. Maybe if I take a step back on this one. Transformation is our number one priority. It will be a multiyear journey and prioritizing safety and soundness is a very important global bank is a non-negotiable for all of us. Where are we? I think we were delighted to see the AML consent order get closed with the OCC. We continue to work on the regulatory orders we have. I have to say we have constant and constructive engagement with our regulators that personally, I find them to be very helpful and essential to our success. We have got a lot to get done. As you can see from the hiring numbers, we have been investing heavily in the talent and the resources that we need. As we have also said, this is not only going to benefit our safety and soundness, but also in terms of our client excellence in delivery, and ultimately, for our shareholders as well. I think the foundation that we need for this is largely in place, and so Mark and I, and frankly, the whole management team, we are very focused on continuing to execute on the various plans we submitted and the overall transformation of Citi from a strategic and another dimension. We obviously can\u2019t give more details than that, because this is confidential supervisory information, but I hope that gives you a good feel. Matt O'Connor: And I guess when you say the foundation is largely in place, like, what are some of the things that are missing or is it just a matter of, say, executing on\u2026 Jane Fraser : And then\u2026 Matt O'Connor: \u2026 the divestiture. Jane Fraser : Yeah. It\u2019s timing. So some of the areas, for example, where we are making technology investments, those ones where we have had fragmented technology platforms, we are migrating them into a single platform or into an industry standard where we have from \u2013 where we have not been on one that we -- that is what we want for the future and the scale and pace for the future. Those things take some time to put in place. But you can see from the investments we have made, both headcount and the shift from consulting to much more of our own people. You will see the technology increase in that shift as well. So some of that is just a natural progression you would expect over time. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : Hey. Good afternoon. Maybe just on deposits and behavior, you guys clearly have a different mix by geography and by business. Deposits ex-currency were up 1%. Your peers were down close to 3%. So is -- how do we think about deposit behavior going forward given your mix of geography and business, is it just the overseas rate hikes have been behind the curve versus the U.S., but we will start to see more deposit outflows over there or do you think your deposits can hold up a little better? Mark Mason : It\u2019s a great question and so why don\u2019t I take that? So a couple of things and you started to allude to it. The first is that when you think about our business, you have got about between ICG and our PBWM business of 65%, 35% split in terms of the deposits. You also have a U.S. dollar denominated versus non-U.S. dollar denominated split that is pretty meaningful as well. And then to your point, we have got different currencies and different rate hikes by different Central Banks around the world and that then is juxtaposed against different beta behavior from customers and so on the whole -- on the ICG side, we tend to see higher betas, and obviously, with rates increasing at a more rapid pace, we expect those to get closer to our expectations in the near-term. We are starting to see many more hikes around the globe outside of the U.S. and so, again, we expect to see betas, which move at a or operate at a much lower pace level outside of the U.S. but start to tick up. And so, over time, I think, we will see continued tailwinds from an NII as the differences between U.S. and non-U.S. activity play out and so that should play to our -- has played to our benefit, I think, and should continue to play to our benefit. If you think about what I have talked about before in terms of our IRE, our interest rate exposure and the cash flow approach that we are moving towards taking, in some ways, it captures exactly that point. And so this is, if you see 100-basis-point move in the curve cross currencies, we are looking at as much as a $2.2 billion increase. When you look at that increase, it skews more heavily towards the non-U.S. dollar than the U.S. dollar and that is in part because of the different moves in rate curves by currency, as well as the different betas by client type in U.S. versus non-U.S. Jim Mitchell : Right. Right. Okay. That\u2019s really helpful. And then maybe just -- a second question just on the impact in the fourth quarter. You have your best closing on three divestitures. How do we think about the P&L and capital impact of that in the fourth quarter? Mark Mason : I think I talked about the idea of the divestitures contributing close to $3 billion for the full year, $3.1 or so billion in terms of the capital impact for the full year 2022. The combination of Australia and the Philippines gets us to about $ 2.1 billion or so. And so the balance of the divestitures that we have scoped out for the fourth quarter should close that gap. Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain, the signing of China, et cetera, should close that gap to getting us to that $3.1 billion. With most of that again\u2026 Operator : Thank you. Our next\u2026 Mark Mason : \u2026 skewing towards the first three, Thailand, Malaysia, Bahrain. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hello. Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Jane, you talked about your global footprint and the strength that gives you as an organization and so maybe this question is very appropriate for Citigroup, which is the following. You guys have a real good window into the global financial markets and there\u2019s been some disruption out there, we all know about what\u2019s going on in the U.K. Pension Funds. You had the Swiss National Bank come into the New York Fed this week for $6.3 billion of currency swaps. We know there\u2019s a large broker having challenges over there. So can you guys give us a flavor, what are you seeing from a stress standpoint. What are the liquidity metrics that you are watching to see if some other stresses pop up how the global financial markets will handle that? Jane Fraser : Yeah. It\u2019s a very good question. It\u2019s one we spend a lot of time on and I think, as Mark alluded, we are constantly doing different stress tests on the market, on clients, on different areas. And as I said at the -- just in the opening remarks, we are more focused on the liquidity in the market at the moment and the impact on some counter parties much more than we are on our credit, which \u2013 our credit risk and that could change over time, depending particularly what happens from a tail risk on the geopolitics here. What are we seeing going on? I think a lot of the focus is in Europe. Right now which is sort of at the center of the storm and we are seeing some areas where there could be energy supply constraints are impacting some clients. So we are watching industrial production moved to the U.S., for example, which are the places where the cost of production is lower, a potential buffer for the slow -- some of the slowdown in U.S. manufacturing and the like because the demand for goods softened, for example. We are seeing areas where clients on the collateral front where there\u2019s a situation of intense volatility that hits a surprise drop as we saw in gilt is having an impact on liquidity, and therefore, margining, which is what happens and has been happening with the U.K. Pension Funds with the derivatives. So a lot of the areas we look at is, what\u2019s the collateral behind different institutions as we have done with the commodity players earlier on in the year, we have been looking at some of the LDIs at the moment and as we see different stresses, we are jumping on it. I think the Central Banks are also ready to jump in as needed and certainly attuned to the importance of agility in these situations as well. As our large global institutions like ourselves as to how do we help support the market the benefit for our Bank is because we are in a strong position on all of our capital, on liquidity, on balance sheet and the credit portfolio, as you can see, is extraordinary at the moment, zero losses in ICG this quarter. Again, we are in a position to be able to jump in and play an important role, but it\u2019s a bit of whack-a-mole, I would say. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And then, Mark, just as a follow-up. You touched on your Investment Banking numbers and your markets numbers, and yes, Investment Banking for everybody has been a struggle, obviously, this year. Your advisory numbers actually were better than your peers on a year-over-year basis in terms of growth, but DCM was quite a bit weaker. Can you kind of give us a little more color there and also how do the pipelines look going into the fourth quarter? Mark Mason : Yeah. Sure. So, look, as we have all seen, the wallets have been under meaningful pressure year-over-year down more than 50%. We did show some strong performance in parts of the business. We have been hiring, frankly, as Jane has mentioned before and filling in gaps that we have across the portfolio in healthcare, tech, energy, et cetera, and feel good about that and are seeing benefits from having made those hires. DCM is really more of a function of low deal volume pretty much across the Board and there really isn\u2019t a whole lot more to it than that. But as you know, Investment Banking is part of the strategy that we discussed at Investor Day and a key part of that and we will continue to invest in it and ensure we are getting the productivity out of it that the investment warrants, but really not a whole lot more in DCM beyond the low deal volume across the Board. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Vivek Juneja : Thanks. Thanks for taking my questions. Couple of questions for you. Firstly, Mark, I just want to clarify, you said, NII ex markets to be up $1.5 billion to $1.8 billion year-on-year in the fourth quarter. You were up $1.9 billion year-on-year in the third quarter. Given that there have been more rate hikes during the quarter and even later in the quarter, any color on what\u2019s driving that slightly lower NII accretion rather than actually being up at a faster pace? Mark Mason : Yeah. Again, the important factors here include volume, what we see in both the loan volume, the deposit volume, and obviously, betas and how betas play out and we talked about the idea that with the higher frequency and level of rate increases, that\u2019s going to put pressure on the beta in terms of seeing it increase across the Board. And then the third factor is rates and what happens with the rates and the timing for which that happens, right? When that happens matters in the quarter in terms of whether you see that benefit in it or in subsequent quarters. And so those are the factors that drive that range that I have given you and it\u2019s across both the PBWM portfolio, as well as how it plays out in TTS and given the world we are managing through quantitative tightening and the like. And I think the other factor is obviously FX and how that plays out. So those are the main drivers, Vivek, and the range reflects any variety of ways that they could play out in the quarter. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Completely different question for both of you. Security Services, you talked about $1 trillion in new business wins seems to be doing really well. Any color if you can remind us on what client segments you are seeing this in and I remember you are saying on the call that it\u2019s domestic also, but any granular \u2013 any more color into where you are growing and where you are seeing all this at least? Jane Fraser : We are seeing this in a number of different areas that the one that is most material was the win we had with BlackRock in a particularly sizable percentage of business there here in the states and in particularly important and accurate and attractive part of the security services business as well. But we have been winning some sizable business across the Board. And part of -- a part of this, I think, comes from the fact that we are able to link the pre and post trade together to drive a lot of efficiencies for our clients and bring some insights that some of the other players are not able to do in helping them manage and get competitive advantage in their businesses. So we are an attractive one from that. Mark, anything else to add? Mark Mason : Yeah. The one thing I will add. I mean we are very pleased with the growth here and the win mandates that we have been seeing across the Board, but particularly in the U.S., as Jane highlights. And some of it is a rate benefit, but a good portion of it is, again, those new mandates, those new additional assets that we are bringing in. The final point that I\u2019d make on it is that and I\u2019d reiterate it, I guess, is that this is not only one of our businesses that\u2019s growing quite rapidly, but it\u2019s also a high returning business for us as well. And so consistent with the strategy that we talked about at Investor Day and one that reflects linkages across the franchise and so we feel very good about that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Good afternoon. Just two quick ones. Mark, you talked about the capital impact of the legacy exits, is there a way you can dimension how much in the fourth quarter from revenues and NII perspective comes out from the legacy? Mark Mason : I do not have that in front of me, Ken. I can -- I guess if we -- I have got a page in here that reflects, the page 22 reflects some of the size of the exit markets, but I do not have that in front of me. I\u2019d have to circle back with you can. Ken Usdin : Okay. I would assume that\u2019s been a part of the prior question about NII trajectory, right? There\u2019s a negative impact embedded in that in the fourth quarter as well, right, that\u2019s just part of the moving forward? Mark Mason : Yeah. That is reflected in the NII guidance, but the major drivers are largely what I referenced. But, yes, it would be reflected in. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. As a follow-up, why is Citi still banking in Russia when only every other major American company or most of them are out of Russia. Jane Fraser : Hey. And Mike, as I mentioned in my earlier remarks, we are now informing our multinational clients who are operating in Russia. So these are the U.S., European and Asian core multinationals or the franchise that we are ending nearly all of the institutional banking services. We offer them by the end of the first quarter of 2023. The cost of which I would add is not material. And so at that point, our only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill our remaining legal and regulatory operations there. It\u2019s been very important for those multinationals that we helped support them as they look at exiting the country and their payroll and other elements as they do so. So they have been able to wind down or exit and a few of those who have remained, but we will be, as I said at the very beginning, our intention here is to wind down our operation in the country. Mike Mayo : And then just if you could remind us, you mentioned more dispositions in the fourth quarter. So after 2022, what\u2019s left as far as the dispositions that you had mentioned and how are you tracking with your plan? Mark Mason : Yeah. We are -- I mean, we are -- we feel very good about how we track with the plan. Obviously, Mexico is left. We have got Vietnam, India, Taiwan, and there\u2019s one I miss Indonesia, I think is\u2026 Jane Fraser : Yeah. Mark Mason : \u2026 what I am missing. So those are the ones that are left and then China, right? So those are the ones that are left in the balance of 20 or beyond 2022. Jane Fraser : And I think those ones, again, a couple of them have been rather than ones that use and you have a legal day one, legal day two on. It\u2019s all close in one go on both, which is why a couple of them are later than we had originally thought. But they are going well and the work around them and around the stranded costs that relate to them, as we talked earlier, is also going nicely. So we are pleased with the pace and we are acting on these with urgency, Mike, as you would expect. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions at this time. I will now turn the call back over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jen Landis : Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to the IR team. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. This concludes Citi\u2019s third quarter 2022 earnings call. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to Citi\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Review with the Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen and Happy New Year to, everyone, joining us today. We are very much off and running as we start 2023. Today, I will share our perspective on the macro environment before recapping our performance in the fourth quarter. And then I will take a few minutes to reflect on our progress in 2022 and our strategic priorities for the coming year. The global macro environment played out largely as we anticipated during the second half of last year. As we enter 2023, environments have had better than we all expected for the time being at least, despite the aggressive tightening by Central Bank. In Europe, a warmer December reduced the stress on energy supplies and inflation is beginning to ease off its peak. That said, we still expect softening of economic conditions across the Eurozone this year given some of the structural challenges it is grappling with. In Asia, while the public health impact in China are unfortunately likely to be severe, the abrupt end of COVID Zero should begin to drive growth and improve sentiment generally. And here at home, the labor market remains strong and holiday spending was better than expected, in part because consumers have been dipping into their savings. The Fed remains resolute in tackling core inflation however and therefore, we continue to see the U.S. entering into a mild recession in the second half of the year. Now turning to how we performed. For the fourth quarter, we reported net income of $2.5 billion and EPS of $1.16. Our full year revenue growth of 3% ex-divestitures was in line with the guidance we gave you at Investor Day as was the case with our expenses. We delivered an ROTCE of nearly 9% and a CET1 ratio of 13%. This quarter, our businesses performed similarly to how they did throughout the year and we are quite pleased with some and less happy with the performance of others. Services continues to deliver cracking revenue growth. Our markets businesses are navigating the environment very well and we are seeing good momentum in U.S. Personal Banking. On the flipside, investment banking felt the pain of a drastically smaller wallet in \u201922, and the environment for wealth remained a challenging one. Unpacking that a bit, services delivered another excellent quarter and we have gained significant share in both Treasury and Trade Solutions and security services. TTS, the business most emblematic of the power of our global network had revenues up 36% year-over-year as we execute on the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. Thanks to strong business drivers, coupled with higher rates, TTS is performing ahead of our expectations. Likewise, Securities Services was up a strong 22%. We ended the year having onboarded $1.2 trillion of new assets under administration and custody. Markets had the best fourth quarter in recent memory, with revenues up 18% from 2021. We have the number one FICC franchise on the street during the first three quarters of the year and fixed income was up 31% in the final quarter. Equities was down as the mix of client activity, again, did not play to our strength in derivatives. With the wallet down significantly, our investment banking revenues were off by about 60% this quarter. While the pipeline looks more promising and client sentiment is improving, it would be hard to precisely predict when the tide will turn in \u201823. Wealth Management\u2019s performance was disappointing. Revenues were down 6% in the quarter, with the macro environment creating headwinds in investment fees and AUM globally, but most acutely in Asia. However, we have been steadily improving the business as demonstrated by continued momentum in client acquisitions across the spectrum and net new investment flows. Similarly, we continue to build our client advisor base albeit at a slower pace given this environment. We would expect to see these investments pay off as the markets recover. In U.S. Personal Banking, both cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth for the second straight quarter as purchase sales and revolving balances continued to grow strongly. Whilst in retail banking, we clearly have some more work to do. As you know, we have been actively managing our balance sheet and risk. Our cost of credit increased in line with our guidance. We built reserves in Personal Banking this quarter on the back of volume growth as well as in anticipation of a mild recession. And in the U.S., net credit losses in cards continue to normalize as we had expected, still well below pre-COVID levels. Corporate credit remains healthy and our low overall cost of credit was similar to last quarter, reflecting the quality of our corporate loan portfolio. In terms of capital, we increased the CET1 ratio by about 70 basis points to 13% during the fourth quarter. And finally, our tangible book value per share increased to $81.65 and we returned $1 billion to our shareholders through our common dividend. Now, let me step back and discuss what we accomplished in 2022. One of our major goals last year was to put in place a strategic plan designed to create long-term value for our shareholders and to get that plan swiftly off the ground. I am pleased with the significant progress we have already made. We simplified the bank, closing sales of our consumer businesses in 5 markets, including 3 in the fourth quarter. And we have made rapid progress winding down our consumer business in Korea as well as our franchise in Russia. We continue to invest in our transformation to address our consent orders and to modernize our bank. We are streamlining our processes and making them more automated whilst improving the quality and accessibility of our data. This will make us a better bank. We brought in very strong talent, met our representation goals and strengthened our culture by increasing accountability and shareholder alignment. To that end, I am pleased we delivered against our financial guidance for the year. We also released our first plan to reach net zero emissions by 2050, expanded our impact investing and announced the findings from an external law firm, which reviewed our racial equity efforts in the U.S. Finally, I\u2019m very proud of how our people handled the macro and geopolitical shocks, which define 2022 and supported our clients and our communities with excellent and compassion throughout. Before I hand over to Mark, let\u2019s turn to the next few years and in particular, the path to achieving our medium-term return targets that we laid out on Page 5. At Investor Day, we talked about the path coming in three phases, with Phase 1 characterized by both disciplined execution and investment. 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1, laying the foundation for driving long-term shareholder value. We are focused on changing our business mix to drive revenues and returns with the expectation that our businesses will close out \u201823 competitively stronger. Services entered \u201823 with strategic momentum and a pipeline of major new innovation and market-leading product capabilities. Markets should continue to benefit from our active corporate client base with the franchise further advancing on the back of investments and the businesses focused on capital productivity. Banking and Wealth are well positioned for when the cycle turns. Thanks o the investments we have made in top talent and technology as well as the synergies realized across the franchise. As you saw, we felt this was the right time to make a change in well and we started a search to identify the next leader of this business. I asked Jim O\u2019Donnell to take on a new role focused on senior clients across the firm. This will leverage his deep expertise and relationships and when combined with the new GoG\u2019s additional role as North America Head, it\u2019s designed to help us capture more of what is a significant business opportunity in our home market. U.S. Personal Banking will continue to benefit from the recovery and borrowing, taking full advantage of our market leading digital platforms and new products, particularly in the card space. We will make further progress on our international consumer exits, enabling us to simplify the firm and reduce our cost base. And we will, of course, focus on our clients, deepening relationship and bringing on new clients in line with our strategy. We will continue making disciplined investments in our franchise, including the investments in our transformation and controls. However, we will pace some of our business investments to reflect the operating environment. Looking further out, we will begin to bend the curve of our expenses to deliver against our medium-term targets. We will do so through a combination of our divestitures, realizing the financial benefits of our transformation and further simplification and Mark will cover this in more detail shortly. We fully recognize this suppresses our returns in the near-term, but we are deliberately taking the tough strategic actions and the investments necessary to reach our medium-term return targets and to create long-term shareholder value. We are carrying not just our momentum, but our determination into 2023. Despite the macro headwinds, we are very much on track to reach the medium-term return targets we shared with you on Investor Day. We intentionally designed a strategy that can deliver for our shareholders in different environments. We are running the bank differently with a relentless focus on execution and we will continue to transparently share our proof points with you along the way. With that, I\u2019d like to turn it over to Mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today\u2019s call. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I will also discuss our progress against our medium-term KPI targets and end with our guidance for 2023. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported net income of approximately $2.5 billion and an EPS of $1.16 and an ROTCE of 5.8% on $18 billion of revenue. Embedded in these results are pre-tax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $192 million, largely driven by gains on divestitures. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.10 with an ROTCE of approximately 5.5%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 6% or 5% excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across services, market and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in investment banking, wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exit. Our results include expenses of $13 billion, a decrease of 4% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs from both the fourth quarter of this year and last year, expenses increased by 5%, largely driven by investments in our transformation, business-led investments and higher volume-related expenses partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reduction from the exit. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses, particularly in retail services and an ACL build of $645 million, largely related to growth in cards and some deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. And on a full year basis, we delivered $14.8 billion of net income and an ROTCE [Technical Difficulty]. Now turning to the full year revenue walk on Slide 7. In 2022, we reported revenue of approximately $75 billion, up 3%, excluding the impact of divestitures and in line with our guidance of low single-digit growth. Treasury and Trade Solution revenues were up 32%, driven by continued benefit from rates as well as business actions such as managing deposit repricing, deepening with existing clients and winning new clients across all segments. Higher wins have accelerated due to the investments that we have been making in market leading product capabilities. These products include the first 24/7 U.S. dollar clearing capability in the industry, the 7-day cash suite product that we launched earlier this year, and instant payment, which is live in 33 markets, reaching over 60 countries. So while the rate environment drove about half of the growth this year, business action and investments drove the remaining half. In Security Services, revenues grew 15% as net interest income grew 59%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 1% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuation. For the full year, we onboarded approximately $1.2 trillion of assets under custody and administration from significant client wins and we continue to feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. In markets, we grew revenue 7%, mainly driven by strength in rates and FX as we continue to serve our corporate and investor clients while optimizing capital. This was partially offset by the pressures in equity markets, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives. On the flipside, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 39%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. In cards, we grew revenues 8% as we continue to see benefits from the investments that we made in 2022 along with the rebound in consumer borrowing levels. And in wealth, revenues were down 2%, largely driven by market valuations in China lockdown. Excluding Asia, revenues were up 3%. Corporate Other also benefited from higher NII in part as the shorter duration of our investment portfolio allowed us to benefit from higher short-term rates. And as you can see on the slide, in legacy franchises, excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues decreased by about $1.3 billion as we closed 5 of the exit markets and continue to wind down Russia and Korea consumer. Going forward, we would expect legacy franchises to continue to be an offset to overall revenue growth as we close and wind down the remaining exit market. On Slide 8, we show an expense walk for the full year with the key underlying drivers. In 2022, excluding divestiture-related impacts, expenses were up roughly 8% in line with our guidance. Transformation grew 2%, with about two-thirds of the increase related to risk, control, data and finance program and approximately 25% of the investments in those programs are related to technology. About 1% of the expense increase was driven by business-led investments, which include improving and adding scalability to our TTS and Security Services platform, enhancing client experiences across all businesses and developing new product capabilities. We also continue to invest in front office talent, albeit at a more measured pace, given the environment. And volume-related expenses were up 1%, largely driven by market and cards. The remainder of the growth was driven by structural expenses, which include an increase to risk and control investments to support the front office as well as macro impacts like inflation. These expenses were partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exit market. Across the firm, technology-related expenses increased by 13% this year. On Slide 9, we show our 2022 results versus the medium-term KPI targets that we laid out at Investor Day, which we will continue to show you as we make progress along the way. Macro factors and market conditions, including those driven by monetary tightening at levels we didn\u2019t anticipate at Investor Day, impacted some KPIs positively and others negatively. However, we were able to offset some of the impacts as we executed against our strategy. In TTS, we continue to see healthy underlying drivers that indicate consistently strong activity from both new and existing clients as we rollout new product offerings and invest in the client experience, which is a key part of our strategy. Client wins are up approximately 20% across all segments. And these again include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client\u2019s primary operating bank. For the third quarter year-to-date, we estimate that we gained about 70 basis points of share and maintained our number one position with large institutional clients. In addition, we have onboarded over 8,700 suppliers this year, helping our clients manage their supply chain to address the evolving global landscape. And in Security Services, we onboarded new client assets, which offset some of the decline in market valuation. And we estimate that we have gained about 50 basis points of share in Security Services through the third quarter of this year, including in our home market. In markets, we strengthened our leadership position in fixed income by gaining share while making progress towards our revenue to RWA card. In cards, loan growth exceeded our expectations in both branded cards and retail services. Card spend volumes were up 14%, end-of-period loans up 13% and most importantly, interest-earning balances up 14%. That said, in areas like investment banking, we lost share this year, but maintained our market position. And in wealth, while we have brought on new advisors and new client assets, given the impact of market valuation, this didn\u2019t translate into growth in client assets or top line growth at this point. So in summary, we made good progress against our medium-term KPI targets despite the significant changes in the macroeconomic backdrop since Investor Day. This highlights that our diversified business model is adaptable to many environments and we have the right strategy to achieve our return targets over the medium-term. Now turning back to the fourth quarter on Slide 10, we show net interest income, deposits and loans. In the fourth quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $710 million on a sequential basis, largely driven by services, cards and markets. Average loans were down as growth in cards was more than offset by declines in ICG and legacy franchise. Excluding foreign exchange translation, loans were flat. And average deposits were down by approximately 1%, largely driven by declines in legacy franchises and the impact of foreign exchange translation. Excluding foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 2%. Sequentially, average deposits were up driven by growth in ICG and PBWM and our net interest margin increased by 8 basis points. On Slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit mix. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $19 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio, is approximately 2.6%. And within that, PBWM and U.S. card is 3.8% and 7.6% respectively, both just above Day 1 CECL level. And we feel very good about the high quality nature of our portfolio. In PBWM, 45% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that, branded cards makes up 66% and retail services makes up 34%. Additionally, just over 80% of our total card exposure is to prime customers. And NCL rates continue to be well below pre-COVID levels. In our ICT portfolio, of our total exposure, over 80% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low and are in line with pre-pandemic levels at about 39 basis points of total loans. That said we continuously analyze our portfolios and concentration under a range of scenarios. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels. On Slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong balance sheet. Of our $2.4 trillion balance sheet, about a quarter or just under $600 billion consists of H3LA and we maintained [Technical Difficulty]. And our tangible book value per share was $81.65, up 3% from a year ago. On Slide 13, we show a sequential CET1 wall to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter and our targets over the next few quarters. Walking from the end of the third quarter, first, we generated $2.3 billion of net income to common, which added 19 basis points. Second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividend, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points. Third, the impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove an 8 basis point increase. And finally, the remaining 56 basis point increase was largely driven by the closing of exits, RWA optimization and market moves towards the end of the quarter. We ended the quarter with a 13% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 70 basis points higher than the last quarter. As you can see, we hit our 13% CET1 target, which includes 100 basis point internal management book. That will allow us to absorb any temporary impacts related to the Mexico consumer exit at signing while continuing to have ample capacity to serve our clients. And as it relates to buybacks this quarter, we will remain on pause and continue to make that decision quarter-by-quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased by 3% this quarter, with TTS up 36% on continued strength in NII; Security Services revenues up 22%; Markets revenue, up 18% on strength in fixed income, partially offset by a decline in equity; and Investment Banking revenues down 58%, which is in the range of the overall decline in industry volume. Expenses increased 6%, driven by transformation, business-led investments, specifically in services and volume-related expenses partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was $56 million, driven by net credit losses of $104 million, partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $1.9 billion, down 18%, driven by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. ICG delivered a 7.9% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down slightly, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation and our continued capital optimization efforts. Excluding FX, loans were up 1%. Average deposits were roughly flat. Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation, deposits were up 3%, and sequentially, deposits were up 4%. As for the full year, ICT grew revenues by 3% to $41 billion and delivered approximately $10.7 billion of net income, with an ROTCE of 11.1%. Now turning to Slide 15, we show the results of our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 5% as net interest income growth was partially offset by a decline in non-interest revenue driven by lower investment product revenue in wealth and higher partner payments in retail services. Expenses were up 7%, driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.7 billion, which included a reserve build driven by card volume growth and a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions. NCLs were up, reflecting ongoing normalization particularly in retail services. Average loans increased 6%, while average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 1.4%, driven by the ACL build this quarter and higher expenses. For the full year, PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 10.2% on $24.2 billion in revenue. On Slide 16, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues decreased 6%, primarily driven by the closing of five exit markets as well as the impact of the wind down. Expenses decreased 38%, largely driven by the absence of divestiture-related impact last year related to Korea. On Slide 17, we show results for Corporate/Other for the fourth quarter. Revenues increased largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses were down driven by lower consulting expenses. On Slide 19, we summarize our guidance for 2023. As Jane mentioned earlier, 2023 is a continuation of Phase 1. We will continue to execute and invest, laying the foundation for the future with an eye towards driving long-term shareholder value. With that as a backdrop, we expect revenue to be in the range of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding any potential 2023 divestiture-related impacts, expenses to be roughly $54 billion, also excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact. Net credit losses in cards are expected to continue to normalize. And as we said earlier, we met our 13% CET1 target, and we will continue to evaluate the target as we go through the next DFAST cycle and close additional exit and announce others. On Slide 20, on the right side of the page, we show our revenue for 2021 and 2022 and our expectations for 2023, excluding the impact of divestitures. In 2023, we expect the revenue growth I just mentioned to be driven by NII and NIR. In TTS, we expect revenues to grow but at a slower pace, driven by interest rates and business actions. And for Security Services, we expect a bit of a tailwind from increased market valuation and onboarding of additional client assets. We also assumed somewhat of a normalization in wealth as lockdowns in China and market valuations start to rebound. And we expect investment banking to begin to rebound as the macroeconomic backdrop becomes more conducive to client activity. As for market, we expect it to be relatively flat given the level of activity we saw in 2022. Now turning to the NII guidance for 2023, we expect both ICG and PBWM to contribute to NII growth as we grow volumes, particularly in cards, and we continue to get the benefit of U.S. and non-U.S. rate hikes in our services business. As a reminder, the guidance for revenue includes the reduction of revenue from the exit and legacy franchises that we closed in 2022, and we expect to close this year in 2023. Turning to Slide 21. In 2023, the increase in expenses that I just mentioned reflects a number of decisions that we\u2019ve made to further our transformation and execute on our strategy. And the main drivers are, first, transformation as we continue to invest in data, risk and control and technology to enhance our infrastructure and ultimately make our company more efficient. Second, business-led investments as we execute against our strategy. Third, volume-related expenses in line with our revenue expectations. And fourth, elevated levels of inflation mainly impacting compensation expense, partially offset by productivity savings and expense benefits from the exit. And we are investing in technology across the firm with total technology-related expenses increasing by 5%. While we recognize this is a significant increase in expenses. These are investments that we have to make and I am certain that these investments will make us a better, more efficient company in the future. And finally, let\u2019s talk a little bit about the medium-term targets. At Investor Day, we said the medium term was 3 to 5 years. That time frame represented 2024 to 2026. So while a lot has changed in the macro environment since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are on a path to the 11% to 12% ROTCE target in the medium term. We continue to expect top line revenue growth, material expense reduction and capital levels largely consistent with our medium-term CET1 target range to contribute to the achievement of our 11% to 12% ROTCE target. So let me walk you through where we stand today. From a revenue perspective, rates have moved much higher and at a faster pace across the globe, which accelerated NII growth. And that, coupled with the execution of our strategy, has allowed certain businesses to accelerate. At the same time, other businesses such as wealth and investment banking have slowed. Despite this, consistent with Investor Day, we expect a 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exit. From an expense perspective, as we showed at Investor Day, expenses will need to normalize over the medium term. And we now expect to bend the curve on expenses towards the end of 2024. The three main drivers of the necessary expense reduction will be benefits from the exit, which will be included in legacy franchise the benefits from our investments in transformation and control and the simplification of the organizational structure. First, let me remind you, at this point, the ongoing expenses in legacy franchises are approximately $7 billion. Of the $7 billion, roughly $4 billion is transferred to the buyer upon closing or through a transition services agreement that typically lasts about a year. The remaining $3 billion relates to potentially stranded costs and wind down, which takes time to eliminate. Second, as our investment in transformation and control initiatives mature, we expect to realize efficiency as those programs transition from manually intensive processes, the technology-enabled one. And finally, we remain focused on simplifying the organization, and we expect to generate further opportunities for expense reduction in the future. From a credit perspective, we still expect net credit losses to continue to normalize and any future ACL build or releases will be a function of macro assumption and volume. So to wrap up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted, we remain on our path to achieve the 11% to 12% ROTCE in the medium term. And Jane, the rest of the firm and I, are prepared to continue to show proof points along the way and demonstrate our progress. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Thanks so much, and definitely appreciate all these outlooks. They are very helpful. So my question on the outlook is if you take a look at the current medium-sized return on tangible and getting to your target, I heard many comments about the path to getting there is on track. Is it the expense spend at the end of \u201824, that is the material step up from here to there, if you will, and/or is credit like a really big determinant in the process? So I\u2019m trying to bridge the gap just in numbers from today\u2019s return on tangible targets. Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes, sure. Good morning, Glenn, thanks for the question. So we did give you some guidance here we gave it to you both on the top line and the middle line for \u201823. And then importantly, when we talk about the medium term, it\u2019s both the continued revenue growth, the 4% to 5% CAGR that I referenced, but it\u2019s also bringing the expenses down from this \u201823 forecast. And I mentioned in the prepared remarks, the drivers of what\u2019s going to bring these expenses down. The combination of the exit of the businesses and the expenses going away associated with that with the benefits that we start to generate from the transformation spend and then org simplification that this type of strategic restructuring, if you will, in exiting all these countries will create an opportunity for. And so it\u2019s a combination of revenue growth, expense bending of that curve and coming down. The cost of credit is kind of as we\u2019ve been talking about for some time now, which is it normalizes over the next couple of years at levels that are consistent with what we\u2019ve seen kind of prior to this COVID cycle that we\u2019ve been managing through. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Thank you. Just one quick follow-up on poly, not my norm, but I normally try to respect this type of process. But Mark, we consider your super important part of this transformation. there has been news out there that you talking to one of my other companies, but would you be able to make any comments? You mentioned just some moment staying on \u2013 sorry to put you on the spot, but I think a lot of people care. Mark Mason : I appreciate that, Glenn, and Citi is an important firm. I\u2019m the CFO of this firm and this strategy is something that I\u2019m focused on with Jane, ensuring that we execute on right and in a way that creates shareholder value for our investors. And so we\u2019re committed to getting that done. Jane Fraser : Together. Mark Mason : Together. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. John McDonald : Hi, Mark. I wanted to dig into the revenue outlook for 2023. You\u2019ve got about the midpoint, it kind of implies about a 4% revenue growth this year, kind of consistent with what you talked about for that 4% to 5%. So for this year, the 2023 guide, it looks like the NII is guided to be up about 3.5%. And the markets you are assuming kind of flat. So what\u2019s enabling you to get to the 4%? Where are the drivers that are above 4%? Is it some of those fee businesses? And just a little more color there would be helpful? Mark Mason : Sure. So let me make a comment first on the NII. Just keep in mind with that number that I\u2019ve given on the page is both the growth that occurs in some of our important services businesses, and that really comes from both the annualization of rate increases that we saw in the back half of the year, but also expected continue increases, particularly outside of the U.S. And given the makeup of our franchise, we will \u2013 that will contribute to the NII growth. And then keep in mind that we\u2019re growing over the legacy franchise reductions in NII that we would see in 2023. So underneath that is some real momentum in the NII, notwithstanding a slower pace, the fact that it would be a slower pace than what we saw in 2022. From an NIR point of view, I did mention that we do expect to see some normalization in market valuation. And that would play out both in banking, normalizing certainly relative to what we saw this year with while it\u2019s down 50% to 60% as well as some normalization in wealth and those would hit the NIR line, as you point out. John McDonald : Okay. And then \u2013 sorry, if this is clear already. But just in terms of the idea of the cost curve bending at the end of 2024. Is that going to mean that for the early part of 2024, expenses kind of rise above 2023 and then they kind of peak out plateau towards the back half of \u201824. Is that how we should envision it? Mark Mason : I\u2019m not going to kind of get into \u201824 guidance. We will kind of get through \u201823, and I\u2019m confident about our ability to get to that roughly 54 number that I put out for \u201823. I\u2019m equally confident that we will bend this curve, and we will bring it down to the levels that it needs to be in order for us to get to the ROTCE target, but I\u2019m not going to kind of get into, John, the specifics of 24 except to say that by the end of \u201824, we will see that curve bending. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Erika Najarian : My first question is \u2013 again, thank you for all the clarification on the slide. Great job, Jane and Mark, obviously. But as we think about what it means to bend the curve, I think, your investors are appreciative that you are accelerating the investments relative to your transformation. As we think about when Citi can hit that medium-term ROTCE, how should we think about what\u2019s bending the curve really means? And I\u2019m not looking for guidance necessarily, but as we think about going past that hump, what\u2019s the better way of measuring \u2013 should we \u2013 is it an efficiency ratio? I think you mentioned something like is it the 60% to 63% efficiency ratio against that 4% to 5% revenue CAGR that you think you\u2019ll be able to hit by 2025? Can we think of it that way? Mark Mason : Yes. So at Investor Day, we did talk about it, and we remain consistent and committed to that. We talked about getting to an efficiency ratio that\u2019s less than 60% in the medium-term period. And so that certainly will be part of the metric that we deliver on as we bring our costs down. I think the other thing I\u2019d mention just you mentioned the how, and I think there are a couple of important aspects that the exits are obvious in terms of those costs going away, at least a portion of it is. The portion that\u2019s tied to stranded cost, Jane has been very, very clear with our entire management team of the importance of rethinking the organization and ensuring that the potentially stranded costs go away, and that means rethinking the way we do business and the way we operate different parts of our operations. I think the third piece is that technology, right? And so right now, a lot of what we\u2019re doing is manual. And as we continue to invest in technology and technology is up pretty significantly this year, 14% or so, we expect it to be up 5% next year. That technology build-out, if you will, will allow for us to reduce a lot of that manual activity, and that will bring down the operational cost for running the firm. And so those are a couple of examples, I hope, of the how. But I think importantly, you will start to see it in an improved operating efficiency over that period of time and getting to the target that we talked about at Investor Day. Jane Fraser : And I would say you can get some confidence around the past on many of these by the urgency with which we\u2019re executing the divestitures, for example, on getting those transactions closed. And we\u2019ve also tried to provide you as much clarity as possible about the timing of when these will be closing and the speed of the wind-downs that we\u2019re executing. So that will help. As Mark said, it\u2019s three big structural drivers of what will be in that curve. Erika Najarian : Thank you. And Mark, I\u2019m sorry, for misspeaking. I was looking at the wrong borrowing efficiency. I have like 15 slides open in the computer. Mark Mason : That\u2019s okay, Erika Najarian : The second question and maybe this to you Jane, I think that your investors have appreciated your sense of urgency with regards to the divestitures. I think the elephant in the room continues to be I think investors sort of expected an announcement on Banamex right now. And I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re still considering just selling Banamex or are you thinking about different options on the table, such as an IPO? Jane Fraser : So we\u2019re in active dialogue at the moment. So I\u2019m obviously not going to comment in great detail here. We do continue to pursue a dual path as you\u2019d expect, because both are very viable options here. And when we are in a position to give you clarity but we will do so. I think we\u2019ve been fairly clear about the timing. We are also separating out the two franchises, our institutional franchise from the consumer franchise that we\u2019re selling because we see the institutional franchise is a very important part of the global network. As you can imagine, in today\u2019s environment, Mexico is key for many of our corporate clients around the world for their supply chains. And we play a very important role there. That is a lot of work in that separation. I\u2019m extremely pleased with the progress that we\u2019re making in that underlying work. But we are pursuing the dual tracks and when we have something to announce, we will be delighted to do so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Hi. I\u2019m still trying to get over at this revenue and expense guidance. So you\u2019re implying you\u2019ll have at a minimum flat operating leverage or positive operating leverage for 2023? Am I reading that correctly? So on the one hand you are not bending the cost curve until late 2024. On the other hand, you\u2019re guiding for positive operating leverage in 2023. Am I reading that correctly? Mark Mason : Mike, when you do the math, I don\u2019t think it will get to the positive operating leverage in 2023. But we are, as you see on the slide, targeting a range that does reflect growth in the top line. That growth will likely be a little bit less than the growth that 54 number would \u2013 roughly 54 number would suggest but we are on the right track. And we are getting there in a way that\u2019s consistent with the strategy that we talked about. And we do feel confident in our ability to deliver on the guidance that we\u2019ve put out here similar to delivering on the guidance we gave last year, recognizing there are a lot of things going on in the broader environment. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then a second follow-up \u2013 or a follow-up, and then I\u2019ll requeue for my other question. Your CET1 ratio is 13% now. And I think that\u2019s two quarters earlier than consensus had expected. You said it was up 70 basis points. So doesn\u2019t that allow you to repurchase stock now? Or I understand that if you go ahead and sell Banamex, that could have a temporary negative capital hit. So I\u2019m just thinking like don\u2019t sell Banamex, don\u2019t have that temporary capital hit, start buying back stock at a fraction of your tangible book value. So what\u2019s wrong with my logic or what part of that can you comment on? Jane Fraser : I\u2019m going to jump in on the, don\u2019t sell Banamex, Mike. As you could imagine, so we are selling the consumer franchise. It does not fit with the strategy that we laid out in Investor Day. It\u2019s an emerging market consumer franchise, and we are clearly focused around the multinational clients and in institutions and high net worth individuals with cross-border needs as we laid out very clearly and businesses that have strong connectivity across the \u2013 between each other. So we are \u2013 we don\u2019t see Banamex having strategic fit in the consumer franchises in that perspective. And when we run all the math, it is in the shareholders\u2019 interest that we sell that franchise and deploy that capital to our shareholders or into some of the investments at higher returns. What you\u2019re suggesting is a very short-term move. And I think as you can see from the actions we\u2019re taking, we\u2019re very focused on our medium and long-term and not taking the short-term path that we would regret in the medium and long-term. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess just one question as a follow-up on capital. As we think about post the second half of the year, let\u2019s say, you\u2019ve taken the hit from Banamex. But coming out of this test-test, any sense, Mark, if there is any reason why Citi would have an outsized negative impact from the Basel end game reforms. Just give us a sense, I\u2019m just wondering hopefully, we don\u2019t get another disappointment as we get our hopes it for buybacks in the back half and there is something idiosyncratic about the business mix that could come back to hurt the bank? Would love any perspective there? Mark Mason : Yes. So look, as we pointed out, we\u2019ve built a significant amount of capital over the course of the year. We are ahead of the target we set for the middle of the year, middle of the year. We do have some exits that will have a temporary impact on that CET1 ratio. And we do obviously have a DFAST that\u2019s in front of us that we will have to see what the outcome is of that work. I think, look, the Basel end game and final views and decisions on that are still outstanding. And I think we will have to take those into consideration when they become available. That is an industry dynamic that will play out however it plays out. And similar to SACR, we will get after it in a very significant way to make sure that we\u2019re able to handle whatever headwinds or tailwinds may come along with that. But it really is difficult at this point to opine on exactly what that means for the industry in light of the fact that there aren\u2019t final rules out just yet. Ebrahim Poonawala : Got it. And just back to your medium-term targets. I guess if we hit that bending the curve at the end of \u201824, it implies that this company should have an earnings power north of $10 by 25%, even at the lower end of the guidance. Am I missing anything there? Or like does that make sense? Mark Mason : The only thing I\u2019d point out is what we\u2019ve described \u2013 what I\u2019ve described, what Jane described is the medium term is \u201824 through 2026. And \u2013 we\u2019ve given you guidance for \u201823. We intend to get to those return targets in the medium term. I haven\u2019t given you specific guidance on any of those individual years, and we will kind of take that year by year. And so just factor in. I think what\u2019s important is you\u2019ve got a view on \u201823, and I think we\u2019ve given you additional clarity on how we intend to get to that medium term, and I think that\u2019s important. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I did want to ask a little bit about the strategy with Personal and Wealth Management. I know Jane, earlier you talked about the fact that \u2013 which you have announced looking for a new had to move that business forward. Could you just give us a sense as to where you think the opportunity sets are greatest within that franchise for growth because there is a bunch of different pieces, some on the advice channel, some of the more fee channels, some of the more balance sheet piece. And you already indicated U.S. as an opportunity to expand into. So I\u2019d just like to understand, from your perspective, which pieces are the most important to execute on. And that could help us understand how you\u2019re planning on shaping this business going forward? Thank you. Jane Fraser : Great question, Betsy. And Mark and I are both smiling here because I think the answer is all of the above. So if we break it down, where do we see the various elements of upside? There is an important recovery that\u2019s going to occur in Asia. And you can see from our results last year, and across the board with other competitors with an Asian bent, that was materially impacted by COVID in China and the lockdowns and a slower pulling out of COVID in that market compared broadly in Asia compared to the U.S. So we see some exciting growth opportunities there from the pure fundamentals in Asia across the board. Absolutely you are right in the U.S., we start from a smaller scale there. We\u2019ve been bringing the different parts of that business together. The wealth of work franchises, one that\u2019s had particularly pleasing growth in it. And we\u2019ve also been seeing some good growth as we pulled a comprehensive offering together for our customers. The biggest upside there is the investment product. And I think we\u2019ve got a strong balance sheet franchise as it were, particularly the deposits, some of the margin lending and the like mortgages, but this is really about the investment offering in the state. Then finally, I\u2019d say there is also tremendous opportunity in the synergies, and we\u2019ve been showing you this in terms of linkages between our commercial bank, our banking franchise, the referrals up from the U.S. Personal Banking. We\u2019ve had about 60,000 referrals this year in the U.S. alone. From that, market also provides important results and even TTS. So the client referrals, there are business synergies between them common platforms. So we really see an opportunity for these multidimensional growth drivers in wealth over and above the recovery in the investment space that everybody in the market should be able to benefit from. And we will continue investing in \u2013 appropriately in building out that front line as well. So, this is a very important part of our strategy. We are excited about it. It\u2019s the key pillar of the shift in business mix as we go forward as well, looking at the medium-term. And we are looking forward to the next phase of growth and focus here. Betsy Graseck : And would you say that the investment spend required to execute on those revenue opportunities is likely to accelerate from here, or you have already done that investment spend and the investment is more sideways as opposed to accelerating? Jane Fraser : I think look, in this current environment, as we have said \u2013 Mark and I have both said since the \u2013 really, the middle of last year, this is something that we are pacing, but we are continuing to invest behind you. And you can see that growth in our client advisors. And remember that net growth in client advisors, it includes the divestiture we made in Uruguay, for example. So, it\u2019s pretty strong. We don\u2019t have a huge amount that we need to invest because we have many pieces of the platform in place and it\u2019s more been a story of integrating them, and then making sure that we are putting the right digital and other investments behind it, but it\u2019s not such a large one in order to achieve the upside in the business. And we will pace that as appropriate with market conditions. Mark, anything to add? Mark Mason : Only thing I would add \u2013 Betsy, you know this is \u2013 in a normal part of the cycle, this is a high margin, high returning business. And we have seen that in the past. And so we want to be well positioned for as the market turns, having brought on client advisors, having brought in new clients through client acquisitions, which were up 24% in 2022. And so I think we are well positioned for that. But as Jane mentioned, given where we are, we want to be smart about how we deploy the dollars. And so we will replace that as necessary, but ensure that we are ready for when things turn. Jane Fraser : And I would just add, it was a couple of years ago that we put \u2013 we announced the strategy and started executing on it. So, we have the benefit of the historic investments that we are seeing the drivers playing out well. And as I say, well, we should be well positioned when the market turns here. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. I just want to follow-up on the comments about markets to be relatively flat in \u201823. Obviously, a very good 4Q. And I know I was concerned about some of the RWA management and FICC in the recent quarters. And I think going back not to be an issue as you think about leadership and revenue. But as you think about \u201823, like the wallets have been strong in recent years. And to your point, your leadership was strong this year. How confident are you in kind of that flat market? And maybe what\u2019s driving that view? Thank you. Mark Mason : It\u2019s a market business, right. And so you know very well kind of the volatility that can come with any markets business. With that said, we have got a very, very strong FICC franchise. We had a very good year, a very good year this year. I think we are well positioned with the client base, and we are well positioned to maintain our number one position as we go into 2023. Now, how that market and market wallet moves, I think is it was going to predicate on a number of things, including how the macro continues to evolve and how central bank activity continues to evolve and how currencies move and the like. But again, I feel like we are well positioned to hold our position, if not gain more share as that plays out. And so I think flat relative to a year that we have had up as significantly as it is, is a reasonable call based on what we know now. Jane Fraser : We have also seen some depression of areas of strength in this business as well. So, equity derivatives, for example, the real strength, this was an equity derivative year. So, there is some and the corporate world with the volatility that\u2019s out there from a macro geopolitical environment is another real strength of ours. And for better or for worse, we are expecting that strength to continue, certainly things so far. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning or good afternoon. Mark Mason : Good afternoon. Jim Mitchell : Mark, maybe just digging into NII a little bit, if you look at 4Q annualized, you have a decent step down. But when you take a look at your deposit franchise, your mix of business, versus your peers, where they are seeing probably lagging retail deposits in the U.S., pricing that\u2019s going to hurt second half NII. Look, you guys, you already have high betas, mostly institutional. You mentioned the benefit from non-U.S. rates and you are growing deposits. So, why sort of the \u2013 a similar trend in NII versus peers when you have a pretty different dynamic going on? Just trying to think that through because it doesn\u2019t look like the legacy drag is very big in your chart? Mark Mason : Similar dynamics you say in \u201823 or you are talking about fourth quarter. I am not sure I followed. Jim Mitchell : No, I am just trying to talk about versus peers, some have guided similarly to down from 4Q annualized run rates, but you have a very different dynamic in terms of deposit growth, benefits from non-U.S. rates and a much higher beta. Mark Mason : Yes. So, I think \u2013 I mean I think I would point to a couple of things on the NII side, just as it relates to us. One, importantly, that I mentioned in and you point out is when you think about our mix of deposits, we have got about 65% or so are in ICG and the balance, 35% in our PBWM business. We certainly skew to U.S. dollar, but we have got a 30% or so that is a non-U.S. dollar. And when I think about the potential or the forward curves and how rates will likely move next year, we will get the benefit of further rate increases on the non-U.S. side, right. And so if I think about our international presence, the betas tend to not be as high as they are here in the U.S. with our Corporate Clients segment. And so I think there are some re-pricing opportunities that we will continue to actively manage as we did here in the U.S. And so I do think it\u2019s that international footprint, the globality of our franchise that plays to our strength in 2023. The other thing that is apparent to us as we forecast this out is the continued growth from a volume point of view. And that volume growth, you have seen the momentum already pick up on the card side with significant growth in interest-earning balances. And we would expect that to continue, particularly as we see NCLs normalize and as we see payment rates start to temper. And so I think those things will be two major contributors. Mix is obviously a factor. As you point out, we will be growing over some of the drag or reduction from legacy, but is that active management of the client engagement that we have across both portfolios, that I think will be important factors to us delivering the growth that I talked about. Jim Mitchell : That\u2019s all fair. But I guess maybe I didn\u2019t phrase my question right, but I felt it ex-markets, I think your forecast for 2013 would be less than the 4Q run rate ex-markets and yet you just... Mark Mason : Sorry, finish your question. I am sorry. Jim Mitchell : Well, just you shared a bunch of reasons why you have sort of a differentiated franchise. So, I am just trying to get a sense of what\u2019s driving the decline from 4Q levels. Mark Mason : I think the thing you have got to pick up is really the legacy franchise and the NII. A large part of the legacy franchise revenues are NII revenues when you look at the mix of the products and the clients that we cover there. And so I think that\u2019s the important element here that we haven\u2019t quantified to a dollar amount, but that is explaining why it seems like muted growth relative to what you would have seen in the fourth quarter. Obviously, there is other factors, but that\u2019s important. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is now open. Unidentified Analyst : I am Mark Hernandez [ph]. Mark Mason : Good afternoon. Jane Fraser : Hi. Go ahead. Unidentified Analyst : Mark, can you share with us on your comments regarding and this is true for your peers as well. The normalization of credit losses going forward since the industry has experienced incredibly low levels of credit losses. So, when you look at branded cards or retail sales, or retail services, how do you see that progressing through \u201823? One of your peers pointed out that they think that by the end of \u201823 they may be at that normalization rate that they look to for their numbers. But I am just trying to see what the trajectory is for what you guys are thinking? Jane Fraser : Yes. Let me jump in and then I will hand it on to Mark. But I think we are expecting under the current trajectory to see the loss rates to reach the pre-COVID levels more at the year-end, early \u201824 level. If you think of branded cards, if I was to quantify sort of 20% of the way there now, CRS, we are about 40% of the way there now. Obviously, we have the benefit in CRS of sharing of the loss sharing with our partners that helps us. But I hope that gives you a sense around it. Probably the most important driver that we have been worried about it was very certain with what was happening with payment rates. And I think we have got much more clarity as they started that normalization path. So, that\u2019s driving a fair amount of more certainty around what the direction is happening there. Frankly, the big question more what\u2019s happening with spending than it is with the normalization right now. It\u2019s a bigger uncertainty. But Mark, any other observations? Mark Mason : The only thing I would add is that, Gerard, you could see just depending on how this plays out. You could see kind of NCL rates tick up above normal levels and then come back down to normal levels in the timeline that Jane described. Again, just depending on how the macro factors continue to play out. But again, we \u2013 as we sit here and talk about these NPL rates, it\u2019s important to point out as well that we are very well reserved across all of these portfolios. And so to some extent, if you put macro assumptions aside and volumes aside, the NPLs kind of get funded by the reserves that have been established. But the trend line is exactly as Jane described, just recognizing that you could see a tick up above normal levels and then it come back down. Jane Fraser : Also this is such an unusual market in the sense that you have got such strong labor market driven by frankly, supply shortage over as much as demand. And we have also got the consumers with still very high savings that they are dipping into, and we are seeing a bit more of the movements happening at the bottom end of all of this. But this is not going to be like a normal recession. It\u2019s why you are ticking here as that others will be about the manageability and the mildness of that likely if we do have one. Unidentified Analyst : And what kind of unemployment rates, are you guys assuming going into that kind of trajectory? Is it \u2013 we get the 5% unemployment by first quarter \u201824? Mark Mason : I think a couple of things. So one, our base case scenario, if you think about what we just talked about includes kind of a mild recession in it, just and as we forecasted it, the downside would be something a bit more severe than that. I would say we are reserved for approximately a 5% unemployment rate, just kind of overall when you look at \u2013 when you average across the different scenarios that we have. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Ken Usdin : Hi. Thanks. Just two quick questions here. First one, just on card, the card NIM has been kind of flattish. And I know that obviously, it has to do with just how you internally allocate the funding towards it. But can you just kind of talk us through what\u2019s happening either with rewards or either incremental rates on some of the new relationships? And should we see the card NIM expand from here? Mark Mason : Yes. I am not going to get into Ken, kind of guidance on NIM. What I will say is that we have seen good traction in the early part of the year as it relates to acquisitions on the card side. We have made very good traction. And Jane, you may want to comment on kind of the relationships that we have with some of the partners and with American. And we have also launched a number of new products that I think is helping to fuel the growth that we have seen on the heels of those investments and some of the increase that we have seen in spend rates as well as some of the average interest-earning balance and loan growth that we have seen. But I really don\u2019t want to get into the NIM guidance at the card level or the aggregate at this point. Jane Fraser : Yes. I mean we have a fabulous cards franchise. And when we look at strong track record in the digital, the other innovations that are driving growth, driving the profitability, driving the returns both in our proprietary products as well as our partners, and we are really seeing all of those drivers performing very, very strongly at the moment. From custom cash, it was 28% of new accounts acquisition. So, an important new product refresh that\u2019s driving things 80% of customers engaging digitally. Innovations like America is just a fantastic partner of us, really taking that to the next level. And you can see that with the growth in spend in the category. So, I think there is a lot of reasons to be pretty excited about the growth in the return and the margins and the other trajectories here, and as I say, a prime portfolio, which is always a good thing. Ken Usdin : Great. Thanks. And my second question was, there was an article about changing management up in the wealth management business this week. And I just wonder if you can talk about that, but also just about the progress that you are making inside the wealth management relative to your \u2013 the KPIs and the goals that you have discussed at Analyst Day. Thanks. Jane Fraser : Well, sure. I mean 2 years ago, I asked MacDonald to put the wealth business together from the various components that we had around the firm. And now as we move to the next phase, but as we have said, strategically important business. I thought it was the right time to change the leadership also because Jim is going to play an important role moving forward, supporting Paco with the ICG strategy that we laid out at Investor Day. He has got a lot of relationships with investors, family offices, private equity, sovereign wealth funds. And he is going to be helping drive those along with other investors to make sure we bring the firm\u2019s full capabilities to these clients. So, I felt the time was right to make the move. And we will be, as indicated, strictly moving to go out and have a look for our next leader of that business. And in the meantime, business as usual as we grow and follow the strategy that we have, and we are looking forward to the market turning, as I am sure everyone is and feel that we are well positioned to do so. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Sheng Wang : Hi. Good afternoon. This is actually Sheng Wang filling in for Steven. Just on the topic of credit, one of your peers noted this morning that they would expect to see an incremental $6 billion or so of reserves if they assume 6% unemployment under CECL. Can you \u2013 just wondering if you could provide some similar sensitivity to reserve levels and how should we think about the provision trajectory versus the 4Q base based on your macro outlook and potential growth math headwinds? Mark Mason : Yes. Thank you. I will go ahead and I will take that. I am not going to kind of do sensitivity scenarios with you here on the fly. What I will say is that as we build these reserves, we are building them against three scenarios. That base scenario that I mentioned, the downside scenario and upside scenario, and we weight those scenarios. And the base that we used this quarter built in a mild recession. And in that baseline, unemployment was, call it, 4.4% or so in terms of the unemployment assumption. We also had a downside scenario. Unemployment in the downside scenario got to a 6.9% or so. And then we had an upside scenario. The weighted average across the quarters was about the 5.1% that I mentioned. And those were factors that went into the reserve that we established in the in the quarter. And largely, when you think about the weightings we have put on those scenarios, the weighting skew towards that base and that downside. The reserve we built this quarter was largely in the consumer business, PBWM and specifically around cards. And that really had to do the change quarter-over-quarter with the change in HPI. But what I would say is that it also reflects, as I have mentioned earlier, a cards portfolio that remains of a very good quality and with loss rates that are well below what they would be in a normal cycle. And it does pick up the fact that there is volume growth that we saw in the quarter there. So, I am not going to kind of run scenarios for you, but hopefully, that gives you some perspective as to what\u2019s underneath the models that we have used to establish these reserves. And obviously, we do that on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Jane Fraser : I would also just jump in one of the areas that sometimes gets mis-put about the firm, is on the corporate credit side. When we look at our corporate client portfolio don\u2019t equate where we take credit risk with the global footprint. When I look internationally, 90% of our international exposure with multinational firms and their subsidiaries, and these are \u2013 this is investment grade. So, I think that\u2019s another area where as we look at the quality of the corporate loan portfolio, as you saw with Russia and others, we will be conservative in the reserving we take. But I think important to understand the nature of where we take that corporate credit risk. Sheng Wang : That\u2019s really helpful. Thanks. And then as a follow-up, it seems like a part of your revenue targets for 2023 depends on some improvement in the environment. For example, stabilizing equity markets, IB rebound? And Jane, you also noted that the medium-term targets are designed to be achievable in different environments. So, if the revenue backdrop continues to be challenged like we saw in 2022, can you just talk about some of the levers you might be able to pull that might provide an offset? Mark Mason : Well, it kind of depends on what the drivers are of a different environment, right. Because you could have \u2013 I don\u2019t anticipate this, but you could have continued pressure in investment banking, but you could also have continued volatility in rates or currencies and that could mean more upside than flat for the markets business. So, there are a lot of puts and takes that one can scenario out. I think what\u2019s really important is that we have a diversified portfolio of businesses that have strategic connectivity to them. And so what that allows for is that as the environment shifts in some way that we may not have predicted that we were often able to still drive significant performance as we did this year. And so without calling exactly how it vary from what\u2019s here, that\u2019s what gives us the confidence to \u2013 around the guidance and really to remain steadfast on the strategy that we have talked about and really push execution, and that\u2019s exactly what we are doing. Jane Fraser : And an important part of \u201823, it\u2019s not just the impact of the cycle, but also you will see the impact of the different investments that we have been making. And you have certainly seen that. For example, in services this year, and we have been very transparent around the 70 basis points increase. We have seen in wallet share in the 12 months leading up to the third quarter. So, you have not only got drivers here in terms of what\u2019s happening in the market, but you have also got the strategic drivers, also kicking in more and more together, as Mark referred to the synergies. Mark Mason : It\u2019s a great point, Jane, because it may not always show up in the top line, which is why we put those KPIs out there. There are often indicators of some of the upside that\u2019s on the come as the market evolves. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is now open. Jane Fraser : Hello. Hey Mike. Mike Mayo : Yes. So, one question and one follow-up. So, you have a \u2013 your slide says you have a CET1 target of 13% by midyear, but you are already there. And I guess if we go back to the Banamex thing, I guess is that kind of assuming potential capital impact from divestitures or why would you have a target six months out when you have already met it? Mark Mason : Yes. Mike, I have to tell you that I am surprised that you are asking about Mexico, just given our history together, but I understand it. And what I would say is that a couple of things. One, we clearly see where we trade, right. And we are not happy about where we trade. And we think our strategy warrants us trading better than where we trade today. So, if we could buy back, right, we could do buybacks as soon as we are able to do buybacks, we will, right. I mean that is part of the way we deliver value for our shareholders. The second thing I would say is we did get to the 13% sooner. And that was, again, in accordance with executing against our strategy. And our parts of our business, particularly the markets business has done a really good job at delivering against the metric we put out of revenue to RWA. And we have been able to get there without damaging the franchise, which is what you see in the continued strength and performance in that business, particularly in fixed income. What\u2019s ahead of us, as you rightfully pointed out, is that we have got a number of exits that have to take place, puts and takes across many of them, but Mexico in particular, will have a temporary impact on our CET1 ratio. And so we want to be mindful of that as we manage over the next two quarters, so that we can absorb that. And we also want to make sure that we are positioned to continue to serve our clients over the next couple of quarters and always, but certainly over the next couple of quarters, while we manage the headwind, temporary headwind from that exit. So, hopefully that gives you a better sense for it, but we are actively managing this. And we have not lost focus on the importance of returning capital to shareholders. Jane Fraser : Yes. I want to reiterate that as well. I mean it\u2019s very important to us. And as Mark says, we know where we trade. We have made a number of moves to align ourselves to our shareholders\u2019 interest in compensation and management interest, all these various dimensions. And we just want to make sure that we hit what we say we are going to do and continue delivering against what we say we are going to be delivering. And with the CPA impact essentially in Mexico, we want to make sure that we are taking that into account. Mike Mayo : Alright. That\u2019s very clear. And then lastly, your NII guide, excluding markets related is higher for 2023, but I think that implies a little step down from the fourth quarter level, not as much as JPMorgan was guiding down 10% from the fourth quarter level. I was thinking there might be some delayed benefits from being outside the U.S. What are some of the ins and outs there? Mark Mason : Yes. You got a couple of points here. So, one is we won\u2019t see NII momentum as we have seen in 2022, just as betas start to increase on the ICG side and get to terminal levels, that\u2019s obviously going to slow or put pressure on the pricing as we go into \u201823. But some of the other important drivers of the growth will be the annualization of the rate hikes that happened late in the year. And so that will be a plus in 2023. You will also see, as I mentioned earlier, some of the rate increases that we anticipate outside of the U.S. and given our mix, that will benefit us in 2023. And then there will be a volume will contribute to that NII growth, particularly as we continue to see good momentum, which we anticipate on the card side, the offset will be that the legacy franchise, right. And so as those exits occur as the wind downs continue, as I mentioned earlier, that revenue mix does skew towards NII. And so we will have to grow over that and we will grow over that to kind of get to the target that we have set. So, those are the puts and takes. Operator : Thank you. There are no further questions. I will now turn the call over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jen Landis : Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This does conclude the Citi fourth quarter 2022 earnings review call. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. [Operator Instructions] Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I\u2019d like to remind you that today\u2019s presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management\u2019s current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our SEC filings. With that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen, and hello to everyone joining us today. Well, 2023 is shaping up to be another interesting year. Given the tumultuous events of the last few weeks, I am going to share some observations and then we will turn to what was a good quarter. First, our banking system as a whole is very strong. While a small handful of institutions still have challenges to overcome, the U.S. financial system remains unmatched globally. And I feel confident saying that as someone who has worked in many different systems around the world. The U.S. system comprises a healthy mix of community banks, regional banks and larger global banks, including Citi. We all have important but different roles to play, serving different clients with different needs and on different scale. I would also point to the rapid response by state, federal and international regulators that help reinforce confidence in the system at a very critical juncture. I am pleased that Citi has been a source of stability for the financial system and a source of strength for our clients. That\u2019s not an accident. We are in a position to play this role, because our strategy is delivering a simpler, more focused bank. We benefit from a diversified earnings base and resilient business model. This is reinforced by our robust balance sheet management, liquidity position and strong risk management frameworks. We are disciplined in how we run the firm from client selection to capital planning. And it\u2019s also thanks to our people. And I want to express my pride in our colleagues around the world who worked tirelessly last month to serve clients as they turn to Citi as a port in the storm. Recent events have shown that prudent asset and liability management is absolutely paramount. While Mark is going to walk you through our approach and our focus on interest rate risk, liquidity and capital, I do want to mention a few things myself. In terms of assets, our loans are high quality and short duration. We have highly liquid investment securities and a significant amount of cash. We have over $1 trillion worth of available liquidity resources, including $584 billion of HQLA and an LCR of 120%. And we maintain a diverse set of funding sources, including over $1.3 trillion of deposits across corporates, consumers, industries and regions, many of which are operational in nature. Indeed, the cornerstone is our institutional deposit base, which comprises about 60% of our deposits. Most of these deposits are particularly sticky because they sit in operating accounts that are fully integrated into how our multinational clients run their businesses around the world from their payrolls, their supply chains, their cash and liquidity management. 80% of these deposits are with clients who use all three of our integrated services : payments and collections, liquidity management and working capital solutions. The data that we aggregate from these deposits and their related flows is fundamental to how our clients manage their efficiency, risk and compliance. And this greatly increases our deposit stickiness. It\u2019s also why nearly 80% of these deposits are from client relationships that are 15 years old or more. Finally, we operate a strong risk framework that looks at both assets and liability concentrations across client segments, industry and region. And we are confident in the size and nature of our exposures, given our very rigorous stress testing. We also diligently manage counterparty risk, which is critical given the interconnectedness of financial institutions. We are in a strong position to navigate whatever environment we face, which is particularly relevant given the degree of uncertainty today. The Fed continues to use rate policy to battle inflation, which has been more than stubborn in services even as we see signs of cooling in labor and manufacturing. We expect the recent event to be disinflationary and credit to contract. We believe it\u2019s now more likely that the U.S. will enter into a shallow recession later this year. That could be exacerbated in depth and duration in a more severe credit crunch. But right now, the biggest unknown is the impact on terminal short-term U.S. interest rates and of course, how the debt ceiling plays out. In Europe, the ECB is on a similar but more difficult quest to payment inflation. They have asked some help from lower-than-expected energy prices and the outlook continues to be a bit brighter. However, the war in Ukraine sadly shows no sign of ending, and Europe places more structural challenges, such as the need for increased defense spending, higher energy costs and fiscal burdens that will make efforts to dampen inflation and stimulate growth more difficult. In Asia, the reopening of China is adding to the momentum in the region, although the Chinese consumer has been slower to rebound than expected. I saw many green shoots firsthand talking to our clients and our bankers in my various trips to India, Japan and Hong Kong this year. We have to keep a close eye on geopolitics as the U.S.-China relationship becomes increasingly strained and is fragmenting economic blocks. And we see this translate into a shift in flows and heightened cross-border volume across TTS and our global network. Now turning to how we performed this quarter. We reported net income of $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19. We had good revenue growth of 6% ex divestitures, and both revenue and expenses were in line with our guidance. Our ROTCE of nearly 11% benefited from the closing of the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam and would have been over 9% without those gains. Let me highlight our operating performance in each of our 5 core businesses. In Services, TTS has continued to go from strength to strength with revenues up 31%. Non-interest revenue was up 11% quarter-on-quarter on the back of increased cross-border activity and good performance in commercial cards due to the rebound of corporate travel. Securities Services wasn\u2019t too shabby either, up 23% as we executed on new mandates, onboarded new AUC and benefited from higher rates. Within market, our fixed income revenues were up 4% from a year ago. We benefited from excellent performance in rates and continued engagement from our corporate clients. The first quarter of 2022 was no slouch, as you may recall, but this quarter was our third best in a decade. Equities was much weaker, however, down markedly in both derivatives and cash, although it still had revenues north of $1 billion. Banking was down again, but there were signs of the beginning of a pickup, including increased activity in the investment-grade market. In U.S. Personal Banking, our cards businesses gained momentum as all drivers continued to normalize to pre-COVID levels and beyond. Branded Cards and Retail Services saw revenues up 18% and 24%. Retail Banking saw some growth as we continue to see good momentum in mortgages and installment lending and also experienced a significant increase in digital deposits. We did see a notable softening in consumer spending growth over the course of the quarter. Travel and entertainment continued to grow in March, but essentials were flat, and almost all other spend categories were down. Savings rates are below historic averages. And while the upper quintile of household income, still have roughly $1 trillion in excess savings, the savings of the lower quintiles have been significantly drawn down. So we\u2019re keeping a diligent eye on the lower FICO bands as economic growth and services spend slow. Finally, while revenues were down again, we remain confident about the prospects of our Wealth business. Despite the challenging headwinds, growth in Citigold accounts, client acquisition and client advisers were all solid, and we expect these drivers to flow through to revenues later this year and beyond. We also saw the early signs of a long-awaited Asian recovery. We built credit reserves this quarter on the back of growth in revolving balances in cards and poorer macro outlook. NCLs continued to normalize in consumer while the health of our corporate base was evident in another quarter of very low NPLs. Finally, we continue to generate capital through our earnings. With our CET1 ratio now at 13.4%, we have room to absorb the temporary upfront impact should we sign a deal for Mexico. As you know, we continue to pursue a dual-pass year and we are committed to increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders over time. As you can see from Slide 3, in addition to good operating performance from our businesses and despite everything else going on in the industry, we got a lot done this quarter as we implement the strategy we shared with you at Investor Day. We closed the sales of our consumer businesses in India and Vietnam. Indonesia and Taiwan are next on the list to close later in the year. Our Asian consumer sales will then be complete, and we are intensifying our efforts to eliminate stranded costs and simplify our organizational structure. We made some significant leadership announcements. I\u2019m delighted that Andy Sieg will join City at my table as the new Head of Wealth Management. Andy is a widely respected leader in this space and comes to us after running an $18 billion business with $2.8 trillion in client balances. He is the latest and the most visible example of the excellent talent we have attracted over the last couple of years. With Karen Peetz retiring, we named Anand Selva as our Chief Operating Officer and asked him to take on running our enterprise-wide Transformation program, in addition to his current responsibilities. Anand has been at Citi for over 3 decades and has a strong track record of delivering results. In terms of our Transformation, we are completely focused on executing our plans to address the consent orders and improve our risk and control environment. Mark will walk you through specific examples of how we\u2019re modernizing our infrastructure, simplifying processes and improving data quality. Importantly, these efforts are improving the client experience and helping us deliver Citi\u2019s core capabilities to them. To wrap up, it\u2019s 1 year after our Investor Day, and I\u2019m proud of the progress we\u2019ve made and our relentless focus on delivering. Our strategy is clear. Our business model is resilient and diversified. Our balance sheet is strong. We\u2019re making good progress on execution. Amidst considerable turmoil, we are delivering on our guidance and our commitments. Our team is determined to continue delivering with excellence. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane and good morning everyone. I am going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise; and spend a little more time on expenses, our balance sheet and capital; then I will turn to the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $4.6 billion and an EPS of $2.19 and an ROTCE of nearly 11% on $21.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are pretax divestiture-related impacts of approximately $950 million, largely driven by the gain on sale of the India Consumer business. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.86, with an ROTCE of over 9%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 12% on a reported basis and increased 6%, excluding divestiture-related impacts, as strength across Services, Fixed Income and U.S. Personal Banking was partially offset by declines in Investment Banking, Equity Markets and Wealth as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exit and wind down. Our results include expenses of $13.3 billion, an increase of 1% versus the prior year. Excluding divestiture-related costs in the prior year, expenses increased 5%, largely driven by the transformation, other risk and control investments and inflation, partially offset by productivity savings and the expense reductions from the exit and wind downs. Cost of credit was approximately $2 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in car net credit losses and ACL and other provision build of approximately $700 million, largely related to a deterioration in macroeconomic assumptions and growth in card revolving balance. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 5, we show an expense walk for the first quarter with the key underlying drivers. Transformation investments drove 1% of the growth, largely in the data, finance and risk and control programs. And 4% of the increase is driven by structural, largely in the form of compensation and benefits, including the full year impact of the people we hired last year as well as those we hired in the first quarter. Embedded in the structural bucket are a few key items. First, other risk and control investments that are enterprise-wide and in the businesses, which make up about 2% of the total expense increase. Second, the impact of additional front and back-office hires. Third, inflation and severance costs. All of this was partially offset by productivity savings as well as the benefit from foreign exchange translation and the expense reduction from the exits. And across the firm, technology-related expenses grew 12%. We recognize these investments have driven a significant increase in expenses, but they are crucial to modernize the firm, address the consent orders and position Citi for success in the years to come. Now turning to Slide 6, I\u2019d like to spend a few minutes giving you some tangible examples of what we\u2019re investing in and the benefits we\u2019ll see over time. In many cases, these investments will simplify our processes and platforms. For example, we are retiring and consolidating 20 cash equities platforms to 1 single modern platform, eliminating costs over time. And we have consolidated 11 platforms to 1 global sanction-screening platform, reducing false alerts, improving the client experience and eliminating costs. We\u2019re also modernizing our infrastructure and the security of our data and information by enhancing cybersecurity through the use of AI and improving the security of our infrastructure and devices, leading to fewer operating losses. And we are leveraging industry-leading cloud-based solutions to modernize and streamline the connectivity between our front-office systems and the general ledger, eliminating manual processes and operating costs over time. We\u2019re driving the strategy by investing in the client experience, both in terms of our technology interface and innovative new products. We launched our cloud-based instant payments platform for e-commerce clients in TTS. We\u2019re also deploying CitiDirect Commercial Banking, our mobile and digital interface for commercial clients, so they too can open accounts and access all products and services across ICG in the same way our large corporate clients do. And finally, we\u2019re investing in data to create advanced decision-making, client-targeting and risk management capabilities, which has allowed us to enhance our returns through greater RWA efficiency. And we expect many of these investments to generate efficiencies that will allow us to self-fund future investments over time. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, deposits and loans, where I\u2019ll speak to sequential variant. In the first quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $80 million, largely driven by interest-earning balances in cards. Average loans were up slightly as growth in PBWM was largely offset by a decline in ICG. Average deposits were also up slightly, driven by growth in both PBWM and ICG, and our net interest margin increased 2 basis points. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We\u2019re well reserved for the current environment with nearly $20 billion of reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio, was approximately 2.7%. And within that U.S. cards is 8.1%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in U.S. cards. And of that exposure, nearly 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And NCL rates, while reflecting some typical seasonality this quarter, are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth and predominantly mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiary. And corporate non-accrual loans remain low at about 40 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 9, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We\u2019ve added a few additional metrics to the page to provide additional transparency into how we manage the balance sheet. We maintain a very strong $2.5 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. First, the majority of our deposits, $819 billion are institutional and span 90 countries. And the majority of these institutional deposits tend to be interest rate sensitive. So when rates go up, we reprice the deposits accordingly, but that reprice takes into account the overall client relationship as well as the level of rates. But despite this interest rate sensitivity, these deposits tend to be stable as they are tied to the operational services that we provide. And these institutional deposits are complemented by $437 billion of U.S. retail consumer and global wealth deposits, as you can see on the bottom right side of the page. These deposits are well diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail and Wealth at Work as well as across regions and products, with 75% of U.S. Citigold clients and approximately 50% of ultra-high net worth clients having been with Citi for more than 10 years. Our wealth deposits tend to also be interest rate sensitive, but this usually results in our customers moving to higher-yielding deposits and investment products. Now turning to the asset side. At a high level, you can think of our deposits being largely deployed in 3 asset buckets : loans, investment securities and cash, which complement the interest rate sensitivity and liquidity value of our liability. And this deployment is also linked to our strategy. We use our resources to lend and transact with our clients in ways that deepen the relationship and drive returns for our shareholders while maintaining strong liquidity and capital. Our $652 billion loan portfolio is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.3 years as the majority of these loans are variable rate. About 35% of our balance sheet is in cash and investment securities, which contribute to our $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And at the end of the quarter, we had an LCR of 120%, which means we have roughly $100 billion of HQLA in excess of the amount required by the rule to cover stressed outflows. And you can see the details of this on Page 27 in the appendix. But just as important as the quantum of liquidity is the composition and duration of that liquidity and our $513 billion investment portfolio consists largely of highly liquid U.S. Treasury, agency and other sovereign bonds and is split evenly between available for sale and held to maturity, where we\u2019ve maintained a short duration of less than 3 years, so we could benefit from higher interest rates. And we actively and prudently manage our assets and liabilities by considering a range of possible stress scenarios and how they might impact interest rate risks, liquidity and capital. So in summary, our assets and liabilities are aligned across interest rate sensitivity, liquidity value and duration and reflect a diversified business model and execution of our strategy. On Slide 10, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. Walking from the end of the fourth quarter, first, we generated $4.3 billion of net income to common, which added 38 basis points; second, we returned $1 billion in the form of common dividends, which drove a reduction of about 9 basis points; third, impact on AOCI through our AFS investment portfolio drove a 7 basis point increase; and finally, the remaining 4 basis point increase was largely driven by the RWA benefit from closing our consumer exits. We ended the quarter with a 13.4% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 40 basis points higher than last quarter, and this includes a 100 basis point internal management book. And as it relates to buybacks, we did not buy back any stock this quarter, and we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. On Slide 11, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the first quarter. Revenues were up 1% this quarter, largely driven by Services and Fixed Income, mostly offset by Investment Banking and Equities. Expenses increased 4%, driven by transformation, other risk and control investments and volume-related expenses, partially offset by FX translation and productivity savings. Cost of credit was a $72 million benefit as an ACL release more than offset net credit losses. This resulted in net income of approximately $3.3 billion, up 23% driven by the lower cost of credit and higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses. ICG delivered a 13.8% ROTCE for the quarter. And average loans were down 2%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 3% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. And sequentially, average deposits were up 1%. And on an end-of-period basis, ICG deposits were down 3% sequentially, driven by seasonality as our clients tend to make tax payments in the first quarter. On Slide 12, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, revenues were up 31%, driven by 41% growth in net interest income and 13% in NIR with growth across all client segments. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with U.S. dollar clearing volumes up 6%, reflecting continued Swift share gains; cross-border flows up 10%, outpacing global GDP growth; and commercial card volumes up roughly 40%, led by spend in travel. So while the rate environment drove about 60% of the growth this quarter, business actions drove the remaining 40% as we continue to deepen relationships with existing clients and win new clients. In fact, client wins are up approximately 50% across all segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client\u2019s primary operating bank. In Securities Services, revenues grew 23% as net interest income grew 94%, driven by higher interest rates across currency, partially offset by a 6% decrease in non-interest revenue due to the impact of market valuations. We are pleased with the execution in Securities Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration from significant client wins, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy and are two of our higher-returning businesses with strong linkages across the firm. Markets revenues were down 4% as growth in fixed Income was more than offset by Equities. Fixed Income revenues were up 4% relative to a very strong quarter last year as strength in our rates franchise was partially offset by a decline in FX and commodities. Equities revenues were down 25%, also relative to a strong quarter last year, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in cash and equity derivatives. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target. And finally, Banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges, were down 21%, driven by Investment Banking as heightened macro uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity. Having said that, we do see revenue growth sequentially, largely driven by the investment-grade market opening up. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, we feel good about the progress that we\u2019re making in ICG. Now turning to Slide 13, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 9%, driven by net interest income growth of 10%, partially offset by a 1% decline in non-interest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in Wealth. Expenses were also up 9%, predominantly driven by investments in transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $500 million, largely driven by a deterioration in macroeconomic assumption and growth in card revolving balance. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 3%, largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 5.5%, largely driven by higher credit costs. On Slide 14, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 18%, driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 17%; card spend volumes, up 9%; and average loans, up 15%. Retail services revenues were up 24%, also driven by higher net interest income. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline. And that, combined with the investments that we\u2019ve been making, contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 18% in branded cards and 11% in Retail Services. Retail Banking revenues were up 3%, primarily driven by higher mortgage revenue and strong growth in personal installment lending, partially offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business. In fact, consistent with the strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive over 13,000 Wealth referrals in the first quarter. Wealth revenues were down 9%, driven by continued investment fee headwind and higher deposit costs, particularly in the Private Bank. However, we did see notable improvement in revenues in Asia, which were up approximately 20% on a sequential basis. Client Advisers were up 3%, and we are seeing net new investment inflows and strong new client acquisitions across our Wealth business with new clients in the Private Bank and Wealth at Work up 62% and 81%, respectively. While the environment continues to remain challenging for Wealth, we\u2019re seeing strong underlying business drivers as we execute against our strategy. On Slide 15, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues grew 48%, driven by a gain on sale of our Consumer business in India, partially offset by the wind downs and closed consumer exit. Expenses decreased 24%, largely driven by the absence of a goodwill impairment we had in the prior year as well as the impact of the wind-downs and closed consumer exits. On Slide 16, we show results for Corporate/Other for the first quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses increased, driven by transformation and other risk and control investments, partially offset by a reduction in consulting fees. Before we move to Q&A, I\u2019d like to end with a few key points. Despite recent events and the economic uncertainty that remains, our full year outlook for revenue and expenses remains unchanged. We have a very strong balance sheet with a diversified set of assets and funding sources and ample capital and liquidity. This positions us well to serve clients and navigate any number of scenarios. We\u2019re seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our businesses and continue to execute on our strategy. The financial path will not be linear, but we are confident that we can achieve our medium-term targets. And finally, I\u2019m incredibly proud of how our firm and our employees have continued to help our clients navigate the recent environment and support the health of the overall banking system. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is open. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. Simple one. I appreciate the many, many moving parts, but your first quarter NII and revenue production was great. And if you just annualize it, you\u2019re handily ahead of your full year guide. So I\u2019m just curious on how you\u2019re thinking about maintaining the guide but running ahead of schedule. Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks, Glenn. Good morning. I appreciate the question. Look, we did have a very solid first quarter. But as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, there are a number of things that are still out there in the global macro environment that are uncertain and unclear, including, frankly, as we contemplate the direction of rates and what\u2019s required to tame inflation, let alone the uncertainty that we\u2019ve seen in parts of the sector here through the quarter. And so when I think about that and I think about, frankly, how betas have evolved and the likelihood of a recession in the back half of the year, which we had built into our outlook, I remain comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve set here. And as \u2013 and when you think about where that comes from, the strength in TTS, the strength in Securities Services, both benefiting from the rate hikes we saw last year, but also deepening relationships with new and existing clients, the card momentum, which is really about seeing more revolving activity as payment rates start to slow and the recovery in Investment Banking and Wealth is not as swift as we would like. And so we have to see how that plays out, too. So when I put those things together, there are certainly some puts and takes that speaks to the diversification of our business model, but it leaves me in a place where I\u2019m comfortable with the guidance that we\u2019ve set. And if that changes, we will certainly update you, but that\u2019s where we are. Glenn Schorr : Well, I appreciate that. Maybe if I could follow-up on your comments and the previous ones on TTS and Securities Services. I tried to learn from all my mistakes, I make a lot of them. But in \u201808, we thought housing prices couldn\u2019t go down much, and then they went down a lot, and we all adapt. The same thing in March, thought deposits couldn\u2019t leave a bank so quickly, but they did. So Mark Slide 25 and 26 people should look at because they are great, and they show the stability of your deposit franchise. But I\u2019m curious if history can change at all, meaning right now, those are cash and operating deposits that clients keep with you and they need you, and you\u2019re fully integrated. But do you have client concentrations we should know about? Or how \u2013 are you thinking about any big changes that can happen in terms of client behavior relative to the past in terms of what they keep at any given bank? I know that\u2019s a tough one. Jane Fraser : Yes. Glenn, I\u2019ll kick it off and pass it over to Mark. I feel very comfortable about how very well diversified our deposit bases across different countries, industries, clients and currencies. And it\u2019s extremely strong in that respect. And as you say, the majority of the institutional deposits are integrated into the operating accounts all around the world to enable the clients to run their day-to-day operations, the payroll, the working capital, the supplier financing, etcetera. And I think what\u2019s changed in the more digital world is, frankly, these have become even stickier because the amount of data, the extent of integration into the technology platforms and systems of the clients and the value that we extract and present back to the clients from the combination of our FX, trade, cash, etcetera, flows is incredibly important for their \u2013 and driving their efficiency, their risk management and their financial performance as well. So both the extent of that diversification and the increasing stickiness versus history is something that we\u2019re certainly not complacent about, but I think is why you see some of the pages we put into the deck as well, including in the back, on just the consistency of this space. Mark, what would you add? Mark Mason : I think that\u2019s exactly right, Jane. And Glenn, I\u2019m glad you pointed out, Pages 25 and 26, which clearly lay out that diversification, but also the scale and stability of those deposits over an extended period of time. The only thing I\u2019d add additional to that would be, obviously, we\u2019re in an environment where there is quantitative tightening that\u2019s occurring. That\u2019s going to have a broad industry impact as we\u2019ve started to see already. But we\u2019re also in an environment where rates are increasing. We will see how that plays out through the balance of the year. That has an impact on betas, but we shouldn\u2019t mistake price sensitivity or interest rate sensitivity with the stickiness of the deposits. And so we\u2019ve obviously talked about betas increasing, particularly in our TTS portfolio, more so in the U.S. It obviously will continue to increase outside of the U.S., but we will work the relationship that we have with those clients and the breadth of services that we bring to influence and impact pricing. And more importantly, because of the operating nature of them, we do see them as very stable. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi, Jane, I challenged you a couple of earnings calls ago about the complexity created by being in so many countries. You said, TTS was your crown jewel. And here, it\u2019s up almost one-third year-over-year. So, so far, so good under since your Investor Day. Can you talk about some of the fee growth? I mean we kind of understand the NII growth, but the fee growth is double digits also. So I guess that\u2019s money in motion. And I think you described this as the world\u2019s largest wholesale global payment system. What\u2019s happening to give you double-digit top line growth there? Jane Fraser : Thank you, Mike, and a great question. And I think one of the numbers I\u2019m almost more happy about than the stellar revenue growth was the fee growth quarter-over-quarter here. Because, obviously, we\u2019ve been benefiting in TTS from the rate environment, but we\u2019ve also been benefiting from the drivers behind the franchise. And the fee revenues are coming from multiple different products and different offerings that we have here. And we\u2019re typically looking and have consistently looked at growing our fee revenue as a percentage of the underlying growth in TTS. It got masked a bit when the rates environment was growing so much, but the different areas there around the world are making a big difference to just the strength of our earnings and the quality of our earnings in these areas. Mike Mayo : Okay. And then as it relates to rates, generally, like what is it, like over 90% of your rate sensitivity is outside the U.S. And so shouldn\u2019t you be benefiting more than you originally thought, given some of these rate hikes? And I guess, Mark, are you just sandbagging a little bit? I get the uncertainties in IB backlog pushout. And no, I mean, we want you to have a reasonable bar to jump over. And I\u2019m just wondering if you set the bar high enough for yourself for this year. Mark Mason : Yes. So again, I think that there is certainly more opportunity in terms of how rates move and capturing NII. As you pointed out, outside of the U.S., we articulate our interest rate exposure for a parallel shift. And that mix at the end of last year was the 90-10 that you mentioned for non-U.S. As I sit here in March, it probably is going to skew a little bit less non-U.S. and a little bit more towards the U.S., and you\u2019ll see that in the Q. With that said, I mentioned earlier, there is still a bit of uncertainty in terms of how rates continue to evolve here in the U.S. We will see how betas evolve. We reached terminal betas in the U.S. with our clients kind of at the end of last year. And so we will see kind of what happens in terms of pricing through the balance of 2023. And betas are not quite at terminal levels outside of the U.S. And so we will see the pacing of that, again, in light of how the interest rate curve may be evolving and frankly, in light of how we\u2019ve seen the broader sector turmoil play out. That could, in fact, play to our benefit. But we are also, again, an environment where there is quantitative tightening that is still at play. And then the final point I\u2019d make, Mike, that often people forget is that in that NII is legacy NII. And so as we continue with our wind downs, our divestitures, etcetera, that\u2019s going to be a headwind that we will have to deal with. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Betsy Graseck : I know during the prepared remarks, you talked a bit about Andy Sieg coming on Board. And I just wanted to understand how to think about the outlook for what you\u2019re doing with Wealth, not only in the U.S. but the non-U.S. locations, and also try to understand how much capital you think you could apply to that business relative to what you have today? Thanks. Jane Fraser : Betsy, so we\u2019re obviously delighted that Andy is joining as our new Global Head of Wealth around my table. He\u2019s a tremendous leader with a great track record driving growth. He got deep product and digital expertise, proven people leader, and we will certainly be taking full advantage of his expertise and experience in the U.S. We\u2019re not shifting our strategy in Wealth. Its mandate is consistent with the strategy we laid out at Investment Day. And that\u2019s the day we see a lot of potential of growth in Asia as we fill in the coverage across the full wealth spectrum there. We will be scaling up in the U.S. by building out the investment offering and cross-selling into our existing and new clients across the country. We see tremendous potential of growth in our Private Bank and the family office franchise or really around the world. And there is a lot of synergies to be realized as we point out in the different KPIs and drivers, between the other four core businesses in terms of referrals and other business that we\u2019re able to generate across the franchise. So the core of the strategy will not be changing with him coming on Board. Mark, what else would you add in? Mark Mason : One thing I\u2019d add is that, look, we are, I think, well positioned for as the market recovers, and it plays towards Wealth. When you look at kind of the client advisers, as you know, we\u2019ve been investing in bringing on new client advisers. We\u2019ve been increasing the number of new clients that we\u2019ve been onboarding as well. We\u2019ve invested in some of the investment products that we have. And so I feel like we are positioning ourselves for when this turns. And as it relates to your question regarding capital, this, in a normal cycle, is a very healthy returning business. And as the market turns and as we recover, we would look to deploy capital appropriate with the growth and return prospects that we see in front of us. It\u2019s also not as much of a capital-intensive business as other businesses. And so I think you\u2019ve got to keep both of those things in mind. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is open. Erika Najarian : Hi, good morning. And I think it\u2019s remarkable that your first two questions were essentially saying that your revenues are too conservative. So that\u2019s very notable for us. My first question is a follow-up to Betsy. I think everybody was certainly impressed, Jane, at the Andy Sieg hire. And clearly, he was running a much larger business that what Citi has today. And this is sort of a tricky question. Clearly, you\u2019re still working through some of the transformation. There is still a consent order. But given your strength as a global player, could Citi participate in perhaps inorganic opportunities that could be out there, having a result perhaps of the liquidity crisis that we saw that could potentially enhance your Wealth Management footprint more quickly? Jane Fraser : We see plenty of potential for organic growth potential. And I think that\u2019s really where we\u2019re going to be focusing, Erika, because I look at the Private Bank and the family office. There is so much wealth creation, supplemented by our commercial banking relationship with a lot of the enterprises and the owners of those enterprises who are really generating the new industry champions in country after country, and we\u2019re extremely well positioned to capture that. I don\u2019t see an inorganic play that would actually help us on it. We also benefit because we don\u2019t have our own proprietary products and a sales force pushing those proprietary products were open architecture. And therefore, we\u2019re a very desirable partner for many of our key partners on the institutional side of the business to be able to provide very interesting value propositions, investment opportunities and the like to our clients around the world. And finally, we can see certainly areas in interesting digital plays, different partnerships, areas like that, that are of interest. So I\u2019ll never say never in the longer run. I\u2019m sure if something very attractive comes up, we will be very interested in looking at it. But it\u2019s not something right now that I think makes sense, given where we\u2019re focused. And no consent to actually almost independent of the consent orders. I think where \u2013 what we\u2019re looking at doing right now is getting this organic play right, and then we will see from there. Mark Mason : I think it\u2019s pretty telling that we had 13,000 referrals from our retail bank. Jane Fraser : Yes. Mark Mason : To the wealth space, right or to our wealth business. And so a lot of embedded opportunity and it really speaks to the integrated model that we\u2019ve been talking about. Jane Fraser : And I think the other bit I\u2019d also just point to is I think one of the things we do benefit from is that we aren\u2019t constrained by being dominated by a brokerage model in a particular way of doing Wealth. So part of the mandate for Andy and the ones that we\u2019ve been working on to date is really looking at what is modern Wealth Management and making sure that we are really well positioned that way, because I do think that will be more of the way of the future. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Maybe just a question on capital. I appreciate the fact that the potential sale of the Mexico franchise would be a negative impact, but you\u2019re sitting at a pretty comfortable cushion now above your target. Obviously, expected future retained earnings growth should be more than an offset. So how do we think about \u2013 how are you thinking about the timing of restarting buybacks with your stock as cheap as it is? Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks, Jim. Good morning. Look, we \u2013 as you point out, we grew capital pretty sizably this quarter, up to 13.4% from a CET1 ratio point of view and up significantly from a year ago, some 200 basis points or so. And a good portion of that, a significant portion of that was really net income earnings generation, which is important. Look, the way we think about it is at 13.4%, we certainly have well above what\u2019s required from a reg point of view, and it includes our internal management buffer of about 100 basis points. But as we\u2019ve said in the past, there is certainly the Mexico transaction, and that would be a temporary drag, if you will, to CET1 at signing, the difference between signing and closing, if it were a sale to take place. And then there are a couple of other factors that are out there as well. So think about the Basel III end game that\u2019s out there and the capital requirements that could come out of that; think about the CCAR DFAST that is current \u2013 has been submitted and currently under review and what that might mean for stress capital buffers and; also think about just where we are in the broader economy and broader global macro environment that we\u2019re playing in and needing to see how that kind of evolves. And so when I think about all those factors, we\u2019re in a place where we will continue to take it quarter-by-quarter. But I\u2019d end by saying our bias is kind of where yours is, which is given where we\u2019re trading, all things being equal, we\u2019d like to be buying back shares. But we have to be responsible about that and the timing of that. Jane Fraser : I think we will have more clarity fairly soon around a number of the factors. So we will be able to give you better clarity on timing before too long. Jim Mitchell : Yes, all fair. And then maybe as a follow-up, just you mentioned increased macro assumptions embedded in reserves. Where are you now on the macro assumptions in the reserve book? Mark Mason : So in terms of the reserve \u2013 again remember, we have a couple of different scenarios that we run when we calculate the CECL reserves. Our current reserves are based on those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects a 5.1%-or-so unemployment rate on a weighted basis over eight quarters. So that\u2019s relatively flat versus last quarter. The other point worth mentioning is that in this particular calculation for the quarter, we did skew a little bit more towards the downside in terms of the probability weighting than last quarter, again, in light of the macro environment and the combination of that as well as well as some normalization in the portfolio, including an increase in revolver activity contributed to the increase in reserves we saw. But to answer your question, unemployment at about 5.5 for be weighted \u2013 sorry, 5.1 for the weighted basis over the eight quarters. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Good morning. Steven Chubak : I wanted to start off with a question just on the IB trading outlook. On the trading side, just given some of the recent macro shocks, have you seen any evidence of that volatility? And are you still confident that you can sustain that mid-single-digit growth target? And just on the investment banking side, I wanted to see if there is any evidence of green shoots. It\u2019s been a challenging backdrop, as you noted, Mark, but I was hoping you could offer some color just across some of the different product lines across M&A, ECM, DCM. Mark Mason : Why don\u2019t I start and then, Jane, feel free to jump in. Look, we had a \u2013 we saw a better performance in the quarter in markets then when I talked at the conference earlier in the quarter. And really, that played through in our Fixed Income business, which was up about 4% year-over-year, driven largely by strength in rates. And we saw rate volatility in the back end of the quarter, and we were well positioned to take advantage of that and serve clients, and that aided getting us to the down four in aggregate across markets. What we talked about for the full year is kind of relatively flat performance. And I still think that based on what we see today and subject to how the macro continues to evolve, that we will be able to deliver on that. But as you know, volatility, in many instances, plays to the favor of markets businesses. And so there is a bit of an unknown as to how that evolves, but I feel confident in the guidance that we\u2019ve given thus far on that. Jane, did you want... Jane Fraser : Yes. I\u2019d jump in before you turn to banking as well. I think one of the differences with our franchise compared to some others is that we are the go-to bank for corporate. And that provides a highly attractive, but pretty steady flow of activity. This is obviously in the volatile markets we\u2019ve been seeing is, from our perspective, very good volatility because we\u2019re able to support our clients in rates, FX, commodity hedging. And it makes our risk flows much more diversified than our competitors, particularly in volatile markets like this. We\u2019re not taking positions. This is really attractive client flow business right at the heart of the global network. The other piece that I think is important in the mix here, too, is just the partnership with TTS cross-border payments. These are the elements that cornerstone of the FX franchise. So there is some pieces here of the volatility that one doesn\u2019t usually think of this as being client, so client heavy, but that\u2019s what\u2019s differentiating on the Citi franchise. Mark, back to you. Mark Mason : Thanks. I think that\u2019s exactly right in terms of the corporate client base there. Look, in Investment Banking, obviously, the wallets down \u2013 were down meaningfully last year. We saw some performance \u2013 good performance in debt capital markets this quarter, up 66% versus the prior quarter, particularly as we saw activity in investment-grade names, which is an area of strength for us for sure. And I think there was a bit of momentum behind a bit more clarity on the direction of rates. And so we will see how that continues to evolve and play out. The other thing I would add is that we continue to have very good dialogue with clients as they manage through the environment and try to anticipate what the balance of the year looks like. And at some point, it\u2019s clear that clients are going to need to get back into the markets. But that trajectory is going to largely depend on the geopolitical and macro environment and how we all manage and navigate that uncertainty. So, very engaged, healthy pipeline, but subject to how the environment continues to evolve. Steven Chubak : That\u2019s great. And for my follow-up, just on PWM fee income trends. I am not going to ask you about the broader wealth strategy, but we are big fans of Andy here, so congrats on the hire. The one thing I did want to get a better sense of is how much of the sequential improvement that we saw in fees is a function of just partner payments being higher as credit continues to normalize. And how we should be thinking about the trajectory and fees within PBWM over the remainder of this year? Mark Mason : I think there are a couple of things to kind of keep in mind in terms of PBWM fees. And I think part of it is that PBWM is a combination of both the cards business as well as the wealth business. And a good amount of the pressure that we have seen in fees, and that is still subject to how the environment evolves, is in the wealth space, because we continue to see fee pressure on investment activity and revenues there. And we will have to see how the market valuations move on some of the assets that we manage on behalf of clients and what momentum it drives in terms of more investment activity. So, I think that\u2019s a big part of the drag in fees, the upside that we have seen in fees and in banking and cards, again, I think will be subject to how activity and volume evolves across our cards business. We do expect revolving levels to continue, but purchase sales, while they are up year-over-year, when we look at kind of the latter months of the quarter. They have been under \u2013 the growth has been slowing and it\u2019s been quite concentrated in travel and entertainment. So, we will have to see how some of that volume activity evolves, and that will be a factor to keep in mind. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala from Bank of America. Your line is open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey. Good afternoon. Just a couple of quick questions. One, in terms of the Banamex sale, I think Jane, you mentioned that maybe we might hear something relatively soon and you still are pursuing the dual-track process. One, if you do decide to go the IPO route, does that change the accounting dynamics, Mark, with regards to taking that hit early on if \u2013 given just the time it might take to go through the an IPO? And the outlook for the Mexican economy, the banks continues to be robust. Does that \u2013 is that impacting or influencing how you are thinking about the value that you should get from this transaction? Jane Fraser : So, we are in a very active dialogue right now in Mexico. So, neither, Mark or I are going to comment in a lot of detail there. As you say, we are continuing to pursue a dual path, both the sale and an IPO. So, we will have an exit strategy either way. And we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. So, we have got enormous body of work going on in Mexico to separate out the institutional business. I am pleased with the progress they are making. I think we are seeing \u2013 when we look at the performance of our Mexican franchise, a lot of the really strong performance is happening in our ICG business where Mexico is such a beneficiary of the supply chain dynamics that are happening around the world. And its location is obviously very beneficial given the proximity to the U.S. as well. So, we are seeing a lot of the dynamic and the big benefits here coming in the institutional franchise that we are keeping within Citi as a core part of business. So, the current Mexican economy doesn\u2019t really have so much of an impact on our current decision-making. The principle is we will take the path that is in the best interest of our shareholders. Mark Mason : Yes. And just to put some numbers to that. For the quarter, Mexico was up 16% revenue year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter up 5%, cards growth, deposit growth, so performing well, I would say. And in terms of the latter part of your question, Jane is exactly right. Everything we are doing is positioning us for both a private sale and/or an IPO, and we will choose the path that\u2019s best for shareholders. And IPO would take longer. It would likely take longer as we would want a set of full audited financials, etcetera. I would say that in terms of what the implications would be from an accounting point of view, CTA accounting is different for an IPO, so we would not recognize that CTA through the P&L. In an IPO, we wouldn\u2019t have at signing that impact that is different from that closing. And so that would not be an issue. The impact would be a matter of how much we IPO-ed at that time. So, love see a lot of moving pieces there. We would need to figure out if we ended up down that path. But hopefully, that gives you some sense of the scenarios there. But I would end with just one final point that Jane has made already, which is that the outcome that we choose will be the best outcome for our shareholders, our clients and employees. Jane Fraser : And that will be an exit. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Matt O\u2019Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hello. You guys have talked about bending the curve on cost, I think in the latter part of 2024. And I wanted to see if that\u2019s still the case. And I guess maybe just some clarification on what bending the curve means. Is that slowing expense growth absolutely dropped? Any kind of clarity on that and cost in general kind of medium-term would be helpful. Thank you. Mark Mason : Thanks Matt. To answer your question very directly, yes, it is still the case. We are going to bend the curve, as I have mentioned in \u2013 towards the end of 2024. It does mean an absolute dollar reduction in expenses. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then I mean I think in the past, you have kind of insinuated that, that\u2019s like the start of, hopefully, a more material drop in costs beyond, obviously, if it\u2019s far away, but just any additional color there, too. Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Look, again, look, the expense base is a key area of focus for us, right. We recognize that expenses have been growing. They have been growing because we have been investing in the franchise, both transformation-wise, as well as business-led growth to support the competitive advantages that we have in many of our franchises. But we are managing that very actively and very deliberately. And that means that we are looking to ensure that we are spending the money in the right way and the right places and that we are going to yield the benefits that we expect from that over time. And that was all factored into the targets that we set at our Investor Day for the medium-term. And what that requires is that we start bending the curve in \u201824, as I have stated, and that we end in that medium-term at a place where we have an operating efficiency of about 60%, and we are positioned to have returns that are in that 11% to 12% RoTCE point of view. There are a couple of factors that are going to contribute to lowering that expense base. One, the divestitures that we have been talking about, right. The second is both the benefits from the transformation and other investments that I have just referenced. And the third is further organizational and management simplification efforts that we have underway that are enabled by the idea that we are exiting 14 consumer countries. And so those three factors, if you will, become very important and to ensure that we get to that lower cost structure and that we are able to deliver on the broader commitments that we are making with regards to returns. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hey Jane. Hey Mark. Mark Mason : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : A couple of questions. Jane, maybe starting with you first, or Mark, both of you can answer it. In view of what the \u2013 the disruptions we have seen in the banking system in the month of March with what went on with the regional banks here in the U.S. and obviously, the large investment bank over in Switzerland, do you guys see changes coming, or what changes do you see coming in terms of regulatory, whether it\u2019s more capital, more liquidity? And it may not be directed at a company like yours because you are a global SIFI already, and it might be more regional orientated in the United States. And then as part of this question, Jane, can you guys give us some color on the deposit you and your peers made into First Republic? What was the thinking behind that as well? Jane Fraser : Yes, sure. Thank you for the question, Gerard. Well, I would say that we hope that there will be a thoughtful and targeted approach to any changes in the regulatory and capital framework, and that they address the root causes of what actually happened here. And what happened is a combination of macro impacts from the sharp rapid rate increases and some idiosyncratic situation, namely a lack of proper asset and liability management at a small handful of banks. We don\u2019t see these issues as pervasive throughout the broader banking industry. But the events certainly highlight the importance of prudent asset and liability management. We still believe that there is plenty of capital amongst the large banks. And if capital requirements were to increase for the large banks by the regulators, it would exacerbate any credit tightening that might go on. And related to that, what continues to keep me most awake at night is the quantity and quality of activity in the shadow [ph] banking industry. It does not benefit from the same regulatory frameworks and protections for participants. And I amongst others fear that more activity getting driven into it, if the banking capital requirements increase, will be through the detriment of system, strength and stability. So, we hope that this approach will be thoughtful and targeted to where the issues actually were. As I said in my opening comments, we thought that the regulators, both at the local and the national and the international level, were very \u2013 were swift and effective in making sure that they tackle the issues that were in front, and we were absolutely delighted that the large banks acted as a source of strength. And let\u2019s just step back for a minute. In the face of tremendous market uncertainty, 11 of the largest U.S. banks were able to come together to inject $30 billion of deposits into First Republic in little over one day. And that speaks volumes for our capital and balance sheet positions. And I think the responsibility of large institutions and recognizing that we also play an important role here in helping stabilize situations like this. And we thought it was very important to help buy some time and also demonstrate our confidence in the overall U.S. banking system. So, I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor. Gerard Cassidy : No, very insightful. Very good. Thank you. And then as a follow-up question, I noticed in your card, I think it was Slide 8, you gave us the prime \u2013 80% of the portfolio is prime, which is FICO score is greater than 680. I don\u2019t know if you would agree with this statement, but we are hearing that there were some FICO score inflation. As a result of the pandemic, a lot of consumers saw the FICO scores go up. And I have seen numbers as high as 70 points that may be in the high side. But can you guys \u2013 do you agree with that? And if you do, would you then expect the 700 FICO score customer at some point to behave like a 650 score customer? Jane Fraser : I think the short answer is no, but let me let Mark answer that one. Mark Mason : Yes. I think what\u2019s really important here, Gerard, is kind of what we are seeing in the way of the performance of the portfolio. So, again, I have heard that sentiment regarding FICO store inflation. We feel very confident in how we have assessed our customers and what it means to have 80% of our customers prime and greater than 680. And I think importantly, what we are seeing is we are seeing payment rates start to slow. We are seeing average interest-earning balances start to increase. We are seeing NCL rates increase, but particularly driven by the lower FICO score customers across the portfolio, which is where you would expect to start to see that drag occur. And the NCL rates that we are seeing are still well below what we would see in a normal cycle, right. And they are in line with what we have been forecasting for performance. So, there are no surprises that we are seeing in terms of how that curve is evolving. We would expect that it will get back to those normal levels towards the beginning of next year. It will likely play through those normal levels a bit before tapering. But my point here is that we understand our customers, the portfolio and how it reacts to the environment enough to forecast that out. And so far, that\u2019s been performing in line with that forecast and those estimates. And importantly, we continue to stress it to make sure we are not missing anything. And importantly, we carry a sizable reserve, as you know, as part of that $20 billion. Jane Fraser : I would also add that we then just rely on FICO scores for assessing the credit of our customers and our portfolio. There is a tremendous amount of data that we draw upon that goes well, well beyond that. And that\u2019s also, as you can imagine, something that gives a lot more confidence. It\u2019s not just prior history and it\u2019s a wealth of data that is used. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is open. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Thanks for taking my questions Mark and Jane. Mark Mason : Good morning. Vivek Juneja : Mark, I want to go to your revenue. I hear you, you are keeping the revenue guidance unchanged. What is in your revenue assumption? I just want to unpeel that a little bit. What\u2019s in your revenue assumptions for rates, U.S. and internationally? And what is going on with deposit betas, particularly following the inflows you have seen recently in the U.S. with the crisis? Mark Mason : Yes. So, I guess a couple of things. One, in terms of the rates that we have assumed, in the balance of the year, we have kind of assumed that rates would kind of probably \u2013 rates would flatten out after this quarter, after the second quarter and then trend down a bit towards the end of the year, down a bit to something like 450 or so, 450 or so. So, we may have one rate increase and then flat and then down to about 450. That could change. But candidly, if it changes a little bit here or there, it\u2019s unlikely to have a meaningful impact in 2023. That\u2019s likely to have more of an impact in 2024. So, we can debate that curve, but that\u2019s kind of what we have thus far in our outlook. The second point I would make is around \u2013 and that\u2019s U.S. rates. We are assuming \u2013 I don\u2019t have specifics in front of me in terms of the rate curves around the globe, but we are assuming kind of continued rate increases there, not of significant magnitude, but some assumptions there depending on where we are talking about. The beta assumptions that we have built in are for betas to continue to increase outside of the U.S. But again, they run lower than the U.S. in general, for our multinational clients. We expect that we will see in the PBWM retail banking or with PBWM client segment space that clients are likely to move towards either higher-yielding deposit products or investment products. And so we have factored those things into how we think about the outlook. And could that change or evolve? Absolutely, but that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s behind what we have assumed here. Vivek Juneja : And just as a clarification, with the inflows you have seen recently in deposits with the crisis systems in the U.S., obviously, any other betas, the tempering a little bit, how much those are going up? Are you \u2013 is that slowing down or not any change so far? Mark Mason : So, a couple of things I have mentioned. So, one, we did see inflows in the quarter associated with some of the sector turmoil. If you \u2013 we have looked at kind of deposit levels from, call it, March 7th, March 8th, through close to the end of March. And we certainly did see an uptick, call it, probably a little bit under $30 billion or so of inflows in that period of time with a good portion of that in our CCB, our commercial middle market client base. It\u2019s too soon to tell kind of how betas evolve, but we do think that a good portion of those deposits will likely be sticky. I think what\u2019s important here is that part of our strategy here is, in fact growing operating deposits with our large multinational clients and our middle market clients. And so we are going to continue to be focused on that. What\u2019s a little bit unclear is how the rate environment continues to evolve and what that means for how betas actually evolve, right. And we will have to kind of wait and see. It\u2019s too soon to tell as it relates to that. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is open. Ken Usdin : Thanks. Hey Mark. Just a follow-up on the credit. So, you mentioned, obviously, that you moved your part of your CECL adjustment a little bit towards the \u2013 in your weightings. And you had previously talked about getting towards \u201cnormalized\u201d card losses, I think you had said by around the end of the year. So, can you just \u2013 given the changes that we are seeing ahead of us and definitely saw some normalization happen this quarter, can you just \u2013 are you still online for that getting to that 3 to 3.5 and 5, 5.5 in the respective card businesses by around year-end this year? Mark Mason : Yes. Year-end, early next year, yes. We are still kind of on track on trend for that. Again, I would expect that they pick up a little bit after that before they start tapering down. But to answer your question, Ken, is yes, that\u2019s still the timeline, fourth quarter, early 2024, reaching those normalized levels. Ken Usdin : Okay. Cool. And then one more just follow-up, end-of-period deposits down 3%, you mentioned the taxes. Are the taxes \u2013 fell across the business. When I look at the deposits page, there are a lot of ins and there are a lot of outs on an end-of-period basis. And just trying to get a sense of like what areas might have been impacted by that tax seasonality and where there was just some of the other pieces that you have already talked through in terms of inflows, outflows and everything else in between? Mark Mason : Yes, it\u2019s a good question. So, again, in the \u2013 when you look at our deposits on an average basis, you see on Page 26 that they tick-up a little bit. If you look at it on an end-of-period basis, they are down about 3%. And essentially, intra-quarter, particularly in March, as I mentioned earlier, we did see a sizable increase in flows. With that said, if you remember in the fourth quarter, we saw a nice run-up in deposits. And then we have the seasonality point that I referenced in prepared \u2013 in my prepared remarks, excuse me, where we have both operational payments from our large TTS clients as well as tax payments and with our TTS clients, also with wealth clients, to some extent, kind of playing through the end-of-period deposits. And again, that for the most part is normal operating payments that we would expect to see at this time of year. Jane Fraser : There are no surprises in what happened. Mark Mason : Yes. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo Securities. Your line is open. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just one clarification on that last answer. You said you had inter-quarter flow. Did you gain more deposits in the month of March? And was that in the U.S.? Mark Mason : Yes, we did. Yes. That\u2019s what I was talking about, Mike, in terms of those flows. They did come largely in the U.S. in the month of March, following March and through kind of the end of March. They were overshadowed by these normal payments that I referenced. And we did \u2013 and we still see good activity kind of even as we came through March and in the early parts of April. Jane Fraser : And that was both in the institutional business that we saw the inflows as well as in the PBWM. Mike Mayo : And if you define deposits this way, I mean, if I am oversimplifying correct me, but look, you have 5,000 multinationals. You really target for payments, capital markets and banking. Those companies have a lot of deposits, a lot of services. That\u2019s the stickiest. That\u2019s where you said 80% of your clients in TTS have been with you for over 15 years. What are the deposits for those 5,000 multinationals? And I know I am asking the slice and dice in a little bit different way, but even just a general sense. Because the reason I am asking this is because I think there is a disconnect between selling percent of uninsured deposits as a measure of stickiness. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s valid. And you showed higher deposits, even though you have a big percentage of uninsured deposits or maybe that doesn\u2019t matter as much as some front pages of newspapers are suggesting. So, if you could address that. Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks Mike. Look, I will tell you to turn to Page 26 in the earnings presentation, right. And we have broken down the deposits for each of the businesses that we have. And at the bottom, you see the TTS deposits. And this is where the 5,000 or so large multinational client deposits reside. And you can see the stability as well as the steady growth in those deposits over time. And to your point, these are largely operational deposits that these clients have with us. And we shouldn\u2019t mistake rate sensitivity or betas with stickiness, right. And because these deposits tend to be quite sticky with us, as you can see here. Now, they are price-sensitive in the sense that as rates go up, we often have to re-price those. But remember, the relationships we have with these clients are broader than just deposit relationships. And that\u2019s what gives us the opportunity to adjust pricing accordingly with our deposits, both in the U.S. and outside of the U.S. And so the other page in your own time you can look at is the page prior to that, which again speaks to the diversification of the portfolio, but it also speaks to the length of time that many of these clients have been with us and they have grown with us. And so nearly 80% of our deposits are from clients that have greater than 15-year relationship with us, and that says a lot. And that \u2013 and so anyway, those are the two points I would make. Hopefully, that addresses your question around the stickiness. Jane Fraser : Yes. I often say it takes the root canal to extract us from the operations of our clients just because of exactly what we are talking about here. And that\u2019s also we see it even with the mid-market clients that are a growing portion here as well because we are helping them expand internationally, and that stickiness comes through. And the LCR of 120% is a very high-quality LCR ratio. Operator : Thank you. And there are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to Jen Landis for closing remarks. Jen Landis : Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, please reach out to IR. Thank you. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

Today's call will be hosted by Jen Landis, Head of Citi Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining us. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I will turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen. And good morning to everyone. While this quarter wasn't as eventful as the first quarter, it was not without its moments. The global economy continues to be remarkably resilient, although the macro backdrop differs across key markets. And while the bulk of the tightening is behind us, central banks are responding vigorously to inflation and have made it clear the cycle of hikes isn't over. In the US the tight labor market keeps pushing the timing of this elusive recession later into this year or 2024 with the robust demand for services providing a backstop for the economy. The Eurozone has also exceeded expectations. However, most countries there are facing pressure from labor and energy costs, challenging the region's longer-term competitiveness. China is the biggest disappointment as growth decelerated after an initial post reopening pop. I was there last month and let's just say few on the ground expect China to be as strong a driver of global growth this year as some had hoped. So bottom line, globally we continue to see the same quite challenging macroeconomic conditions that we [Technical Difficulty] benefits of our diversified business model and strong balance sheet. We remain laser focused on executing our strategy and simplifying and modernizing our bank. Despite the turbulence and macro backdrop of the first half, we're on track with the plan we laid out at Investor Day and we remain committed to our strategy and our medium-term ROTCE target. Today we reported net income of $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33. Our revenues ex divestitures are relatively flat to last year and we remain on track to meet our revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year. We're also on track to meet the expense guidance for the year. And consistent with the plan we shared with you at our Investor Day, we are pursuing cost saving opportunities to help offset the significant investments in our transformation. In services, TTS continues to deliver with revenues up a healthy 15%. This was driven by both net interest income and noninterest revenue as we win fee generating mandates with new clients and deepen our relationships with existing large corporate and commercial clients. We're proud of our number one ranking for large institutional clients, and this week we announced our latest innovation CitiDirect Commercial Banking, a digital platform to help our growing commercial clients tap into our global network. Security services revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher interest rates across currencies. We're really pleased with execution in this business as we continue to bring in new assets under custody and administration, which are up by approximately $2.4 trillion in the last year. We've gained 100 basis points in share year-over-year as a result of the investments we've been making. Markets revenues were down 13% compared to an exceptionally strong second quarter last year. From early April, clients stood on the sidelines as the debt ceiling played out and we continued to experience very low levels of volatility throughout the quarter. Despite this, our corporate client flows remained strong and we\u2019ve achieved our medium-term revenue to RWA target again this quarter. In banking, the momentum in investment grade debt has spread into other DCM products, but the long-awaited rebound in investment banking has yet to materialize and it was a disappointing quarter in terms of both the wallet and our own performance with investment banking revenues down 24%. We continue to right size the business to the environment whilst making investments in selected areas, such as technology and healthcare. In the US, taken together, our cards businesses had double-digit revenue growth, aided by customer engagement and the continued normalization in payment rates. In branded cards, spend is still strong in travel and entertainment, and acquisitions remain pretty healthy. This is a great franchise and we have launched a raft of new innovations from transforming our [thank you] (ph) rewards platform to our enhanced value proposition for the premium card with our long-term partner American Airlines. Credit normalization is happening faster in retail services given the profile of the portfolio. And overall, I'd say we're seeing a more cautious consumer, but not necessarily a recessionary one. Wealth revenues were down 5% as the business continues to be negatively impacted by the deposit mix shift, particularly in the private bank and by lower investment revenues. However, we have seen activity pick up a bit in Asia for two quarters with growing net new assets. Referrals from the US retail banks are increasing and globally, new client acquisition in the private bank and wealth at work has grown significantly on the back of our investments in our network of client advisors and bankers. Turning to expenses. They were elevated this quarter as we expected. This includes the additional repositioning actions we took to right size certain businesses and functions in light of the current environment. Year-to-date, severance is about $450 million, including $200 million in the quarter. Separate to repositioning, we remain committed to bending our expense curve by the end of 2024 through three significant efforts; first, we continue to make investments in our transformation and other risk and control initiatives, which are necessary to modernize our infrastructure, automate our controls, as well as to improve the client experience. As we said before, we will start to see the momentarily benefits of these investments over the medium term. Second, as part of our simplification efforts, we expect to close the sales of our remaining two Asia consumer franchises by year-end, and we plan to restart the exit process in Poland. As you can see on the slide, we made excellent progress this quarter and the consumer businesses were winding down, aided by material asset sales, and we are now attacking stranded costs and closing out the TSAs in the markets that we have already exited. You saw our determination to execute when we decided to IPO Banamex after exploring a sale. We should complete the process of separating the two businesses fully next year in preparation for the IPO. And I'm pleased with the progress on the ground. We are about to begin acceptance testing on the new systems for the retained businesses. All this means that by year-end, considering how far the divestitures and wind-downs have progressed, legacy franchises will have materially reduced its exposures and primarily be down to Mexico, Poland, Korea and the elimination of the remaining stranded costs. As such, as we move through the second half of the year, we will be in a position to focus on the third leg of bringing down our expense base through a leaner organizational model. Together, these three efforts are why we have confidence in saying that we will start to bend the curve on an absolute basis by the end of 2024 and continue to bring down expenses over the medium term. Let me end with capital. Well, you won't be shocked to hear that we were disappointed with the increase to our stress capital buffer. We have engaged in active dialogue with the Fed to better understand the differences between our model and theirs in terms of noninterest revenue. And the industry awaits further clarity on capital requirements and importantly, their implementation timing from the holistic review the regulators have undertaken and the expected Basel III Endgame NPR. There is still uncertainty as to what the final rules will be, and we, like the rest of the industry, will need to work through the implications. The exit of 14 international consumer markets, coupled with the results of our transformation investments and change in business mix will help reduce our capital ratios. In addition, we have other levers to pull over time, such as capital allocation, DTA utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. We are committed to returning capital to our shareholders as you saw with our decisions to repurchase $1 billion in common stock and increase the dividend. We ended the second quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.3%. That's 100 basis points above our upcoming requirement after returning a total of $2 billion in capital. And we grew our tangible book value per share to $85.34. Given the environment, we will continue to look at our level of capital return on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Overall, we're pleased with the progress we've made, but there remains a lot to do. We will continue to update you on the progress we are making every quarter. And with that I'd like to turn it over to Mark and then we would both be [Technical Difficulty] Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane. And good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter unless I indicate otherwise and spend a little more time on expenses and capital. Then I will turn to the results of each segment. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the second quarter we reported net income of approximately $2.9 billion and an EPS of $1.33 and an ROTCE of 6.4% on $19.4 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are after tax divestiture related impacts of approximately $92 million. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.37 with an ROTCE of 6.6%. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 1%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture related impacts as strength across services, US Personal Banking and revenue from the investment portfolio was more than offset by declines in markets, investment banking and wealth, as well as the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind downs. Our results include expenses of $13.6 billion, up 9%, both on a reported basis and excluding divestiture related costs. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, primarily driven by the continued normalization in cards net credit losses and ACL builds, largely related to growth in card balances. Our effective tax rate this quarter was 27%, primarily driven by the geographic mix of our pretax earnings in the quarter. Excluding current quarter divestiture related impacts our effective tax rate was 26%. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loans ratio of approximately 2.7% and through the first half of 2023 we reported an ROTCE of 8.7%. On Slide 5, we show the quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year expense variance for the second quarter. Expenses were up 9%, driven by a number of factors, including investment in risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, volume growth and macro factors, including inflation, as well as severance. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the exits and wind downs. Severance in the quarter was approximately $200 million and $450 million year-to-date, as we took further actions across investment banking, markets and the functions. We're investing in the execution of our transformation and continue to see a shift in our investments from third-party consulting to technology and full-time employees. And as we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span across the following themes : platform and process simplification; security and infrastructure modernization; client experience enhancements; and data improvements. And across these themes, technology spend was $3 billion in the quarter, up 13%, primarily driven by change the bank spend. Despite the higher expense base sequentially, we remain in line with our full-year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. On Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income increased by approximately $550 million, largely driven by dividends. The increase in net interest income ex markets was largely driven by higher rates and cards growth, partially offset by the mix shift that we've seen to higher rate deposit products within PBWM. Average loans were flat as growth in PBWM was offset by the wind-down markets and a decline in ICG as we continue to optimize the loan portfolio, including a further reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by TTS, as we saw some non-operational outflow, as expected in light of quantitative tightening. However, underlying this we did see strong growth in operating accounts as we continue to win new clients and deepen with existing ones, and our net interest margin increased 7 basis points. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loans ratio is approximately 2.7%, and within that US cards is 7.9%. In PBWM, 44% of our lending exposures are in US cards, and of that exposure 80% is to customers with FICOs of 680 or higher. And NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels and are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 56% of our PBWM lending exposure is largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. And corporate non-accrual loans remained low at about 44 basis points of total loans. As you can see on the page, we breakout our commercial real-estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totaled $66 billion, of which 90% is investment grade. So, while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in-part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well diversified business model, we leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $818 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $427 billion of US retail consumer and global wealth deposits as you can see on the bottom-right side of the page. We have approximately $584 billion of HQLA and approximately $661 billion of loans and we maintain total liquidity resources of just under $1 trillion. Our LCR was relatively stable at 119%. And our net stable funding ratio was greater than 100%. We ended the quarter with the 13.3% CET1 ratio and our tangible book value per share was $85.34, up 6% from a year ago . On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the first-quarter. First, we generated $2.6 billion of net income to common, which added 22 basis-points. Second, we returned $2 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 18 basis-points. And finally, the remaining 14 basis-point decrease was primarily driven by RWA growth as we continue to grow card balances partially offset by optimizing RWA in markets and corporate lending. We ended the quarter with the 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, which includes a 100 basis point internal management buffer. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to be 12.3% in October of 2023, which incorporates the increase in our stress capital buffer from 4% to the preliminary SCB of 4.3% we announced a couple of weeks ago. And we will continue our dialog with the Fed to better understand the differences between modeled results and ours, specifically in non-interest revenue. That said, our strategy is designed to further diversify our business mix to have a more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue stream as well as reduce risk and simplify our firm by exiting 14 international consumer markets. The strategy and the simplification, coupled with the benefits of our transformation investments will allow us to improve RWA and capital over time. The continued optimization of our balance sheet should not only help FCB but reduce RWA. This will offset some of the anticipated headwinds and capital requirements and RWA. And we will continue to reassess how and where we deploy capital and we will continue to reassess the appropriate level of our management buffer overtime. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the second quarter. Revenues were down 9% this quarter, as growth in services was more than offset by markets and banking. Expenses increased 13%, primarily driven by continued investment in TTS and Risk and Controls, as well as approximately $120 million of severance in investment banking and markets, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $58 million as net credit losses were partially offset by an ACL release. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.2 billion, down 45%, primarily driven by lower revenues and higher expenses. ICG delivered an ROTCE of 9.2% for the quarter and 11.4% through the first half of 2023. Average loans were down 6%, reflecting discipline around our strategy and returns. Average deposits were up 1% as we continue to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing ones. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions revenues were up 15%, driven by 18% growth in net interest income and 8% in noninterest revenue. It's also worth noting that TTS revenues were up 20% on an XFX basis. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with US dollar clearing volumes up 6%, both in the quarter and through the first half, cross-border flows up 11%, outpacing global GDP growth, again, both in the quarter and through the first half and commercial card volume up roughly 15% led by spend in travel. In fact, similar to the last few quarters client wins are up approximately 41% across all client segments. These include marquee transactions where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. In Security Services, revenues were also up 15%, driven by higher net interest income across currency. We are pleased with the progress in security services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 11% or $2.4 trillion, and we feel very good about the pipeline of new deals in security services. As a reminder, the services businesses are central to our strategy in our two of our higher returning businesses with strong synergies across the firm. Markets revenues were down 13%, driven by both fixed income and equities relative to an exceptional quarter last year coupled with low volatility this quarter. Fixed income revenues were down 13% as strength in our rates franchise was more than offset by a decline in currencies and commodities. Equities revenues were down 10%, primarily reflecting a decline in equity derivatives. But consistent with our strategy, we continue to grow prime balances driven by client wins. Corporate client flows remain strong and stable, and we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA part. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were down 22%, driven by investment banking as heightened macro uncertainty continue to impact client activity, as well as lower revenues in corporate lending. While we continue to have a strong pipeline and are seeing green shoots of activity, we recognize there's more work to do in ECM and M&A. That said, we believe the investments that we've made in health care and technology coverage will benefit us over time. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging and there is more work to be done, we're making progress against our strategy in ICG. Now turning to Slide 12. We show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 6%, driven by net interest income growth of 7%, partially offset by a 6% decline in noninterest revenue, driven by lower investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments. Cost of credit was $1.6 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios and a reserve build of approximately $335 million, primarily driven by card balance growth. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting our wealth clients putting cash to work in fixed income investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an ROTCE of 5.5%, both for this quarter and through the first half of 2023, largely reflecting the challenging environment for wealth and higher credit costs. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. Branded cards revenues were up 8%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 6%, card spend volumes up 4% and average loans up 14%. Retail services revenues were up 27%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments. For both card portfolios, we continue to see payment rates decline and that combined with the investments that we've been making contributed to growth in interest-earning balances of 17% in branded cards and 12% in Retail Services. Retail banking revenues decreased 9%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. In fact, consistent with our strategy, we continue to leverage our retail network to drive 25,000 wealth referrals year-to-date through May, up 18% year-over-year. Wealth revenues were down 5%, driven by continued investment fee headwinds and higher deposit costs, particularly in the private bank. However, Wealth at Work revenues were up over 30%, driven by strong lending results primarily in mortgages. Client advisers were down 1%, reflecting the repacing of strategic hiring. And new client acquisitions were up nearly 40% in the Private Bank and approximately 60% in Wealth at Work in the second quarter. While there's clearly more work to do in wealth, we are seeing good momentum in the underlying drivers. On Slide 14, we show results for legacy franchise. Revenues were down 1% as the benefit of higher rates and volumes in Mexico was more than offset by the reductions from closed consumer exit and wind downs. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 22% and 10% ex-FX. Expenses decreased 2%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind downs. Excluding divestiture related impacts, expenses decreased 8%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate Other for the second quarter. Revenues increased, largely driven by higher net revenue from the investment portfolio. Expenses also increased driven by inflation and severance. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our third quarter and full year 2023 outlook. We are maintaining our full year revenue guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture related impacts, although the mix has shifted somewhat. We are increasing our net interest income guidance from $45 billion to slightly above $46 billion for the full year, excluding markets, offset by lower noninterest revenue, largely driven by investment banking and wealth. We're also maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessments. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in the remainder of the year with both portfolios reaching normalized levels by year-end. And we now expect the full year tax rate to be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture related impacts. As it relates to the third quarter, we expect continued momentum with clients, including fees and benefits from US and non-US rates on NII. We also anticipate a sequential increase in expenses, driven by continued investments in transformation and risk and controls. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize in line with expectations. And our effective tax rate for the quarter should be approximately 25%, excluding discrete items and divestiture-related impacts. And as it relates to buybacks, we will continue to make that decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We continue to execute on the strategy to simplify our firm, improve our revenue mix and bring both expenses and capital down over time. We're seeing solid momentum in the underlying drivers of the majority of our business. And as we said at Investor Day, the financial path will not be linear, but we remain focused on achieving our medium term ROTCE target. And with that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So I'm very curious on the whole revenue to RWA topic, especially with some of the changes coming in. So maybe you could give a little more color on -- let's say for instance, the further reduction in the subscription credit facility. I think I read somewhere that was like an $80 billion book down to $20 billion. You can correct that if that's wrong. But just usually those things are big important clients that have relationship lending things attached to them. So I'm curious on how you balance the capital benefit -- the clear capital benefit versus the client impact and how you think about that? Are there other blocks of business that are in motion right now? Thanks. Mark Mason : Thanks, Glenn, and good morning. Thanks for the question. Look, a couple of points on that. One is, we've been very focused on the revenue to RWA metric in our markets business in the ICG more broadly as well. And we've made considerable progress on that. And that's important because how we use the balance sheet and ensuring that we're optimizing the use of the balance sheet contributes to how we improve returns over time. You're right to point out the subscription facility, credit facility lending that we do. We brought that down pretty significantly. The numbers you highlight are a lot higher than the portfolio. But what's important here is that, as we look at that, we look at a couple of things. So one, the nature of the relationship and whether clients are taking advantage of the breadth of what we have to offer; two, the profitability and returns associated with the product to the extent that it is in a broader relationship, and where that -- those returns are low, subpar and the prospect for doing more has proven to be fruitless, we take it down. And that's what we've done with a large part of that book just as we juxtapose it against other opportunities to use balance sheet where clients are taking advantage of the broader franchise and therefore are generating higher returns. And we're going to continue to do that. We've done that to drive the revenue to RWA metric. We've done it selectively on pieces of the portfolio like SCF. We've also looked at our broader corporate lending portfolio and where those promises for higher relationship returns aren't manifesting themselves. We've not renewed those loans. And as we think about pending regulatory changes proactively making these efforts becomes critically important. When I look back on the activity that we've done over the past couple of years, we've reduced RWA by approximately $120 billion over the last two years. And about 75% of that is predominantly driven by balance sheet optimization and looking at client activity that has low margin business. And so, this is important for us to do what we keep doing. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that, Mark. Maybe just a quick follow-up. On NII, I had asked this last quarter too. And your first half annualized ex market is running about $1.5 billion ahead of the guide. Is that just unpredictable nature of all the moving parts trying to be conservative or anything else in the back half that you're thinking about? Mark Mason : Thanks, Glenn. We did take guidance up to above -- slightly above $46 billion from the $45 billion. I guess there are a couple of things in FX markets, of course. There are a couple of things to think about in terms of headwinds and tailwinds that play through there. One is, you've heard me mention before that we've reached terminal betas in the US; two, deposit volumes and the ship mix as we see consumers kind of move into [Technical Difficulty] products; and three, really the wind downs and the exits and the reduction that they will [Technical Difficulty] kind of three headwinds as we think about the forecast and the balance of the year. There are obviously some potential tailwinds that play to the other side, including rate movements from in non-US dollar, as well as card volume growth. And as we look at those headwinds and tailwinds, our current read is to take it up, but $46 billion or slightly above that feels like the right level in the context of total revenues at $78 million to $79 billion. Operator : And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global Securities. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Maybe just getting on the expense side. You're keeping Mexico till 2025 now at the earliest. So that will be on the books longer. How do we think about that bend the curve discussion? And maybe specifically, you can help us think about bending the curve for the non-legacy businesses? Do we start to see -- is the fourth quarter just a slowing or quarterly decline? Is it a year-over-year kind of a discussion? I just want to make sure I understand the whole bend the curve notion and how to think about that. Mark Mason : Thank you. Let me take that. I'd say a couple of things. So one, I'd reiterate the expense guidance that we've given for the full year. So that's the roughly $54 billion ex divestitures or the impact of divestitures, ex any impact from FDIC special assessment. Two, as we think about bending the curve, I look into 2024 and we're looking to bring the absolute expense dollars down from Q3 to Q4. So that bending of the curve will occur. It will occur despite having Mexico still part of the franchise. And we obviously still having Mexico impacts the magnitude of the bend, but it will bend Q3 to Q4. And then beyond that and through the medium term, we will see the curve continue to bend. Again, Mexico impacts the magnitude of the band, but we're very, very focused on bringing our costs down and bending that curve. And you've heard us reference the aspects or the elements of our business that help contribute to that, not the least of which are the exits, one of which is Mexico, and you referenced the timing there, but also the benefits from the investments that we've been making in transformation and risk and controls and shifting from manual processes to technology enabled ones. And then the final one is around simplifying our organization. And you heard in Jane's prepared remarks, as we continue to make progress on these exits it opens up the opportunity for us to lean more heavily into that simplification. So we are focused on not only the guidance, but the bending of the curve as you point out, and looking forward to delivering that and taking actions to ensure we do. Jim Mitchell : So just as a follow-up, is the way to think about sort of 2025 and beyond as you get through a lot of the automation on the sort of the non-legacy businesses and start to get much more efficient there. Can we -- is there an absolute expense decline story in the core business? Or is that more of a -- you need the top line growth to get the improved returns? Mark Mason : Again, it's going to be a combination of continuing to bend the curve and bring our expenses down. Obviously, we've given you guidance on operating efficiency of less than 60%, which will be some of that top line growth, but it's the combination of the two. Operator : And our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hi, Betsy Betsy Graseck : I just wanted to confirm on the CET1. You have 100 basis point buffer on top of regulatory minimums. So that would suggest that the 13.3% that you got this quarter is in line with where you're planning on holding it going forward. Is that fair? Mark Mason : Yes. So you're right, we hit 13.3% this quarter, down a tad bit from the 13.4% last quarter. Effective October 1, the 4.3% SCB comes into play. And so, that would equate to assuming the 100 basis point management buffer at 12.3% regulatory requirement and a 13.3% kind of target that we would manage to. I'd highlight a couple of things that I'm sure are obvious to you, Betsy. One is, this is the stress capital buffer for the 12 month period starting October 1. And two is, the strategy that we've described and talked about and have started to execute against is intentionally designed to help morph the business towards a more steady, predictable, consistent stream of revenues, fee revenue growth, as well as bring our expenses down over time, and exit these markets, and those things should contribute to reducing our stress capital buffer over time and improving our returns. But the answer to your question very directly is, yes, the 13.3% would reflect where we'd be targeting as of October 1 for now. Betsy Graseck : And since you mentioned you're evaluating buybacks quarter-by-quarter. I guess the question here is, how should I think about that relative to we get Basel endgame coming out soon because clearly, when you're at 13.3% against the new rate cap SEB, you it signals a bigger opportunity for buybacks over the coming quarters. So how should I think about that? Jane Fraser : I think consistent with what we've been talking about. There's a lot of uncertainty out there about the new capital requirements, both in terms of the nature of them and the timing of implementation. I think the industry is expecting to get more clarity about that with the comment period that will be coming up. Plus it's a fairly uncertain macroeconomic environment at the moment. So both Mark and I feel it's prudent to continue making that assessment until some of this uncertainty is clarified as to what precisely will do. You should take confidence that we're at the levels, including the management buffer that we expect to be for the rest of the year. We've proven a good case of being able to build capital. That's for sure over the last two years. And you take comfort as well. We increased the dividend. We had $2 billion of capital returned last quarter. So our intentions are clear to return capital where we can, but also to be prudent in how we do so, given environment and current regulatory uncertainty. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. One negative question, one positive question. So on the negative side, you talked about bending the cost curve, but I think second quarter year-over-year it's bending the wrong way. And six quarters from now, you're saying it should bend the other way. So what are we not seeing in the financials that gives you such confidence? Because it seems based on this quarter's results, a little bit more of a trustee story. And on the positive side, TPS continued double digit growth, you continue to invest more in that business. How are you monetizing greater money motion among your multinational and other clients? Thanks. Jane Fraser : Thanks, Mike. I'll kick it off and then send it back to Mark. In terms of the expense side, I think we've been very transparent about the arc of our investment spend related to both the transformation and beyond. We'll continue to give you that transparency Mike. Now last year, we hit our expense guidance. This year, we're on track for the guidance of roughly the $54 billion ex FDIC and divestitures and looking forward, we continue to guide what are the three levers that will drive the reduction in the expense curve starting at the end of 2024. It's from the exits and I think you've got a clear sense around the progress that we have been making on the divestitures. And therefore, we're pivoting, as we talked about, to focus now on really tackling the stranded expenses as we close off the final couple of sales there in Asia in the next few months. We'll realize the benefits [indiscernible] investments in transformation and controls over the medium term. We'll also have the benefit of the remediation work getting done and expenses going away from that. And then the third one will be simplifying the organization, as we talked about. So we'll continue to walk you step-by-step. What are the different actions we're taking, what are we doing? And hopefully, we are building up that track record of doing what we will say we are going to do every quarter. Mark, anything to add? Mark Mason : The only thing I\u2019ll add on the expense side, and then you may want to touch on the TTS. But the only add on the expense side is the -- we are taking repositioning charges, Mike. I mean, we're not sitting still as we go through this uncertain period of time where wallets across certain parts of the industry are under significant pressure. And in taking those repositioning charges, there are going to be expense reductions that ultimately play out over the next 12-month period. So that's the other factor in addition to what Jane mentioned in the way of exits and benefits from the transformation that will play into the cost base over the next 12 months. Jane Fraser : And then on TTS, I think we all share your enthusiasm for this business in terms of the growth potential that we've been realizing and expect to continue, albeit converging now to the medium-term guidance over the next few quarters where we see it's a high to medium single-digit growth going forward. It's a very high-returning business and some of the indicators of how we're monetizing those relationships. We're seeing it both in terms of new client wins, they were up 41% this quarter. We have a sustained win loss ratio of 80% on the new deals across different client segments. We're also seeing growth that's starting to really kick in from our commercial bank and the expansion of clients in the middle market around the world as we grow out that franchise. And we've got some very good fee growth, which as Mark points out, and I point out all the time, we're very focused around the cross-border, up 11% US dollar clearing up 6%, commercial cards up 15%, et cetera. And we continue to invest in the business as well, so to make sure that, that 80% win ratio continues. So first bank to launch 24/7 $365 clearing -- US dollar clearing. We've got the instant payments platform we just launched for e-commerce clients. We have payments express that is now live in the US, on track for five markets by the year-end. So it's a story of innovation. It's a story of investment. It's got great returns. It's a good growth story. And it just -- it keeps ongoing. And I don't want to diminish security services in there either. It's another business that's similarly continuing to see significant client wins up 65% versus last year as well. And a lot of our strategy there has been focused on gaining share with the asset managers in North America. Couple of years ago, we're down at 2.6% share. We're up about 4.3%. Our target is about 5.5% there in 2025 in that key growth area. I know there's a lot to like here too. Operator : And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UPS -- UBS. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good morning or good afternoon. So I apologize having to ask the expense question again, but I think it's just very important because there's really potential long-only investment thesis on Citi, right? One is the buyback given your tangible book values at $85 and the stock at $46 and the other is the bending the curve on expenses. So let me just ask Jim's question another way. In looking back to 2017, and I'm just looking at 2017 because I can break out legacy and core that way. And fast forward to 2022, you produced revenues ex legacy franchises about $61 billion in 2017 and about $67 billion in 2022. The associated expenses, again, without legacy franchises was about $34.5 billion in 2017 versus $43.5 billion in 2022, so you're surpassing the revenue uplift during that period by $3 billion. I guess the question is, you have so much certainty about the timing of this expense and I'm wondering how much of this $9 billion can go away? We understand that there's a lot of opportunity for reinvestment in the core business. But I think all of us are struggling to really understand that magnitude. And I think that the investor base in the market fully understands the legacy franchise story and how the exits will take time. But I think they're most interested in the core business and how much of that can come out. Mark Mason : Yes, sure. Look, no need to apologize for asking the question again. It's an important -- it's an important topic. I'd say a couple of things. So one is that, we can certainly look back in time, but I would highlight that we're here because we needed to have invested more in our franchise. And so undoubtedly there's going to be an increase in our expense base that reflects the underinvestment from the past and ensuring up safety and soundness and actually moving towards a more automated operational -- more modernized operations and infrastructure. So there's certainly going to be that. With that said, with those investments come efficiencies. So with the move from manual to automation over time, those types of investments will yield benefits in our cost structure. And that's part of what is going to bend the curve over that medium-term period. The other thing that I'd highlight is, obviously, with the legacy franchises, there's $7 billion of expense associated with those, and that will come down. But that -- but because of the Mexico transaction, we're going to be stuck with that a little bit longer given the IPO process. It doesn't put a big dent in our ability to bring stranded cost down and by the way, it does come with top line revenues and historically has been accretive to our profitability and returns. And so I highlight -- I'm not going to give you kind of new guidance on where our expenses will end up. But what I will point you to is not only the $54 billion this year, roughly $54 billion this year, not only the bending of the curve in the third and fourth quarter or the third to the fourth quarter next year. But we've given guidance on top line growth revenue of 5%, call it, CAGR through that medium-term period, and we've given you kind of operating efficiency targets that we've said as well, and we intend to deliver on those things that reflect the bending of that curve through all of those drivers that we've mentioned. So I hope that helps, Erika. I appreciate the focus on both capital and expenses. We are equally focused on it and know just how important it is to achieving those targets. We're not only kind of doing the things that we've highlighted in that strategy articulation, but we're also being responsive to the current environment that we're in. We think that aids in our ability to deliver the targets and the bending of the curve, and we know there's an additional opportunity that Jane has referenced to the simplification of the organization as we make -- what I would argue is considerable progress on the exits towards the end of this year. And all of those things will be important to ensuring we get to that lower cost base, which we will do. Jane Fraser : And it's a laser micro focus from us to make sure that we have the plans in place and the execution to be able to achieve it. This is something that's -- we're extremely hands-on around and making sure that, that is going to get done on each of the different drivers that Mark talked about. Operator : And our next question -- go ahead. Erika Najarian : All right. And just a follow-up on that. I guess, you guys have been pretty clear on the timing, and you guys have been pretty clear on why the curve will bend. I guess I'm wondering -- is it just a timing issue that you're not giving us the sort of the dollar numbers that could go away from the transformation? Is it just a timing issue? Or are you still at a point where you don't know how much of that you would need to reinvest to arrive at that 5% revenue CAGR? Mark Mason : Sorry, your question was around expenses or the revenue? Erika Najarian : Expenses. So we get loud and clear why the curve will bend. We get loud and clear when the curve will bend, right? Mark Mason : Yes. Erika Najarian : And there's clearly just expenses there that are catch-up expenses that are transformational expenses to everything that Jane talked about. And that message has been loud and clear. And I'm wondering if you haven't told us what could come out of those expenses because it's just a timing issue. It's July 14 versus 4Q 2024? Or have you not yet made decisions in terms of how you may allocate those expenses in terms of do you need some of those expenses that could come out to grow your revenue base to that 5% CAGR versus having it fall to the bottom line? Sorry, that's the question. Mark Mason : Got it. Jane, do you want to start or? Jane Fraser : Go ahead. Mark Mason : Yes. So I'd say a couple of things. So one, Erika, is obviously, with that revenue CAGR will be volume-related expenses that play out. But we're also focused, obviously, on the non-volume related expenses and not giving you a precise number because the magnitude of that band, right, is a factor, right? So obviously, Mexico, for example, as I mentioned earlier, impacts the magnitude of the bend, right? And we're going to and have, in fact, when you look at our expense base even for the quarter, we've spent money in Mexico to drive that top line 22% revenue growth, 10% ex-FX. And so, there are going to be nuances in the running of the business in a way that ensures we're maximizing shareholder value that impacts the magnitude of the bending of that expense curve. Investments that I got to continue to make in TTS in order to maintain that number one position in that competitive advantage that we have. And so, those things will impact that magnitude of the bend. We've been, I think, very transparent as we get into each year, giving you concrete numbers. What I'm telling you is the curve will bend. And as we get closer to 2024, we'll give you more direction on the magnitude for that year and beyond. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi. Good afternoon. I wanted to ask a question on capital. Just given the recent increase in your SCB, I was hoping to better understand why the 11.5% to 12% remains the appropriate long-term objective in your mind? And as we prepare for Basel III end game, think through the capital benefit from future asset sales, can you speak to whether that will translate into operational risk capital relief specifically as it's less clear whether those benefits will accrete even as those asset sales are consummated? Jane Fraser : I'll kick it off, Mark, and then pass it to you. So when we look -- we're confident we're going to meet 11% to 12% ROTC target over the medium term. The core drivers of how we get there remains unchanged. One, it's the revenues that we expect to grow by 4% to 5% CAGR as we continue to execute on the strategy. On expenses, it's the clear path to bend the curve by the end 2024, bringing those expenses down over the medium term. And third and importantly, it's continuing to optimize our balance sheet including improving RWA and capital efficiency. And as we referenced earlier in the prepared remarks, different drivers in that, that are helpful exiting 14 international consumer markets, changing our business mix. And I'd also note that the transformation has benefits not only for our efficiency, but it will also support RWA and capital optimization. That said, there's uncertainty around the future capital requirements in the industry and importantly, the timing of their implementation. We like everyone again to have to work through those implications once we know what they are. But as we said, keep in mind, we've got some other levers to pull over time, capital allocation, DTA allocation and utilization, our G-SIB score and our management buffer of 100 basis points. So that's where you hear the confidence for us -- from us around the path to executing and that remaining consistent. But Mark, why don't I hand over to you just around consumer market sales and operational RWA relief. Mark Mason : Sure. And again, I think that if you look at the transactions that we've closed to date, they've generated or freed up about $4.6 billion of capital the two that remain to be closed and the balance of the year will generate another $1.2 billion or so. That will be important to our capital base. I think that we obviously have to see the proposal as it comes out and the NPR. And we have to -- we'll have a window to respond to that. We're hopeful that the regulators hear our response and views on it as it comes out. There's clear -- there's clearly going to be a reference to increases in RWA and operational risk implications potentially as part of that. I do think that exiting without having seen the proposal, and without obviously knowing how those rules might evolve. I do believe that the exiting of these 14 markets does play towards not only reducing our SCB in stress scenarios or as it comes out of stress analysis and tests, but also should play through helping to reduce risk-weighted assets and potentially operational risk as well. But we have to see what the proposal looks like and go through that. And I think what's important here is that, whenever it comes out, whatever it looks like, as we dissect it and go through it, we'll figure out how to manage through it, right, whether that be through exiting certain products, seeking price adjustments as it relates to customers, clients and the markets or continuing to optimize RWAs as we have been doing very proactively, we'll figure out how to manage. Jane Fraser : And I feel [indiscernible] to jump in here as well because as the spring and the recent test results showed the large US banks are not only in a strong capital position, but we've been able to play an important stabilizing role for the system as a whole. It's a role that we take very seriously. And we certainly hope that as the details of the capital frameworks get unveiled, this is fully taken into consideration, including the impact on US competitiveness. And we need a level playing field with Europe, not a gold-plated one. And we share the concern that higher capital levels will undoubtedly increase the cost of capital for medium and smaller sized enterprises and consumers in particular, and will drive more activity to non-regulated and lesser capitalized players that isn't in the system's interest. And we hope that, that's fully taken into consideration here because we will take actions on businesses, and we will take pricing actions as well the entire industry. Steven Chubak : Thanks for that perspective, Jane, very well said. Just one quick follow-up for me. PBWM fee income trends, given the lower partner payments, I mean, clearly, the wealth fee trends were -- would suggest that they were quite subdued in the quarter. And I just wanted to understand your outlook over the near to medium term, what drove some of the weakness this quarter? Is it something that you expect will likely persist, especially given some of the market tailwinds that we've been seeing would have expected to see a little bit more resiliency in wealth fee income in particular? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, I think as we mentioned, wealth was down about 5%. It's really hard to talk about the rebound in wealth in the midst of such an uncertain environment and the one that we're in. It's hard to disconnect those macro factors like rates, inflation, the prospect of a recession from what we're seeing in wealth. And I think there are two dynamics that have played out. One has been the shift from our customers -- from customers more broadly into higher-yielding products from out of deposits. And the other has been the fee revenue from an investment management fee point of view, and as you might think about it, it is a higher rate environment. There are opportunities for clients to earn more. And not until there's greater certainty in the broader macro factors, well, I think we start to see some real momentum tick up there. Now with that said, a couple of things worth reiterating, which is, we're seeing very strong referral momentum from the retail banking business up through the wealth continuum, if you will. So we've had about 25,000 referrals May year-to-date from our retail branches into our broader wealth business, that's a good thing. We've seen the number of clients that we've on-boarded tick up pretty meaningfully, both in the private bank and more broadly across wealth. That's a good thing. Those are things that position us well for when greater certainty does play out and these clients start to put monies back to work in the broader investment platform and offering that we have. Operator : And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hi, good afternoon. Just one quick question, Mark, for you. On the consumer cards book, you gave some metrics. One, remind us what you reserved for in terms of unemployment rate, macro? And if we do -- and whether if we do [indiscernible] market does that necessarily in that we'll see big lacing up of credit reserves where you already are? Just some color around that would be helpful. Mark Mason : Sorry, just the last part of your question, I'm sorry, if we do see what? Ebrahim Poonawala : Yes. So one, like where are you in terms of your unemployment rate assumption? And if the unemployment outlook worsens, let's say, over the next six to 12 months, does that mean that you are already reserved? Or will we see another big pickup in provisioning as a result of that? Mark Mason : Got it. Thank you. Look, our current reserves, as you know, as we think about CESL, we've got three different scenarios. We've got a base case in upside, a downside. Our current reserves are based on the mix of those three macroeconomic scenarios. It reflects about a 5.1% unemployment rate on a weighted basis over the eight quarters, and it's roughly flat to what it was last quarter. What that means is, obviously, our downside scenario has unemployment that's much higher than that, closer to 7% or call it 6.8% or so. But that's kind of how we've thought about unemployment. As we think about the reserves each quarter, obviously, we take a look at the macroeconomic factors and how they're evolving. Our base case today assumes a mild recession and reserves in the future will consider how are weighting towards downside, upside and baseline may more subject to our outlook and volumes. Those are the two factors that influence whether we're increasing reserves or not. I would point out though that in addition to unemployment and because unemployment has been as stubborn as it has been, if you will, we also look at debt service coverage ratio as an important factor as we think about our consumers, as we think about their balance sheet, as we think about the risk that they may or may not be facing. So unemployment is an important factor. But we've flexed our thinking in light of the environment and in light of how behaviors have been shifting, and that's an important factor in how we think about our reserves as well. I feel very good about the level of our reserves. You heard us mention earlier, we've got $20 billion of reserves, we're well reserved across the portfolio, but those are all important elements to it. Ebrahim Poonawala : That's helpful. And just one very simplistic question. When you talk to some of your largest shareholders, those who are optimistic think you can hit your ROTCE target medium term by 2025. Is that a realistic expectation given, I appreciate Basel changes, you answered like 10 questions on expenses. But should we expect the groundwork through 2024 that we hit that medium-term target in 2025 or just your degree of confidence. Mark Mason : Yes. Again, the thing I'd point out and Jane, feel free to chime in here, is that what we talked about was getting to our medium-term returns, 11% to 12% and the medium term is 25% to 26%, right? So it's not just 25%, just to be clear. And we do continue to feel very confident around our ability to do that. You heard us mention the levers that we think will contribute to that. Obviously, capital is important and how that evolves and we continue to kind of work to optimize the balance sheet while serving our clients effectively and importantly, growing the strong businesses that we have that are high returning as well. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor from Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hi. [Technical Difficulty] credit card in the back half of the year. And just wondering, you've got the normalized loss rates on Slide 22. Are you still thinking you'll hit those, I think, exiting this year or early next year. And then, I think at one point you said they might go a little bit above that before they kind of come back to a normal level? And is that still the case? Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. The answer is, yes. We still expect for both portfolios to hit those normal levels sometime at the end of the year, the normal level, as you pointed out, on the page for both branded as well as for retail services. We would expect, again, subject to how and when this mild recession kind of plays out, we would expect that they would tick higher than that before getting back inside of that range. But again, all of this is tied into how we've calculated our reserves, the delinquencies that we're seeing, the mix of the portfolio, which again skews towards your higher FICO scores and the customer behaviors that we're seeing, which play through not only that cost of credit line, but also plays through the growth that we referenced earlier in the top line. But the short answer is yes, that's still our thinking. Jane Fraser : And as Mark said, I think we feel good about our positioning as a prime, but also a strong credit proposition that we have. We're seeing stronger demand for the credit-led products such as value cards, bulk on installment loans, as well as the service-led engagement for the more prime customers. And so, that's also going to be a valuable factor driving growth and profitability as well. Matt O'Connor: And then the follow-up, and this is not really Citi-specific, but for the card industry, a lot of the banks that are in card. Everyone is talking about kind of getting to normalized levels, just call it in the near term here next couple of quarters. And I guess, just thoughts on getting this normalized level of losses when unemployment is all-time low, wages are growing. Obviously, there's inflationary pressures, but it's just a little surprising, again, not to say specific, but it's a little surprising that we're getting to this normalized state when things seem like they're pretty good. Jane Fraser : Yes, I think well, also the normalized state back in 2019 is also pretty good. So you're not hearing any alarm bells ringing from Mark or myself at all here on the US consumer. I think we see the US consumer as resilient. We've talked about them being cautious but they're not recessionary. And we are seeing more pressure on the lower FICOs. We don't have a large number of that in our portfolio, but that is where we're seeing more of the normalization happening on the payment rates, for example, on other behaviors in there. So it's quite localized, but I don't think we should be overly concerned here about the health of the US consumer. And as Mark said, we're in a very unusual environment, higher inflation, these rate levels and a strong labor market. And under those conditions, it's the debt service ratio, as he said, that is, we think, is a more useful leading indicator that we keep a close eye on. Mark Mason : Just remember, it's a return to normal. Jane Fraser : Yes. Operator : And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Jane Fraser : Hi. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, can you share this in your financial supplement, obviously, you give us good details on your credit picture and we're talking about credit right now. The nonaccrual loans have been flat as a pancake for the last 12 months for you folks and the industry as well. And this is in light of the Fed funds rates, as we all know, have been up over 500 basis points. Can you guys share with us what's -- why we haven't seen more -- this is mostly corporate, of course, but everybody has been hanging in there very well in view of the fact that rates have gone up so much. What are your customers telling you or are you seeing that has enabled them to remain very healthy in light of a 500 basis point increase in interest rates? Mark Mason : Yes. I think I'd point to a couple of things. One is, remember, we focus on the large multinational largely investment grade quality names. And so, that's one important factor when you think about our ICG and corporate exposure there. The second thing I'd point out is, we have to remember that many of these companies had and still have very strong balance sheets and that they've managed that through the COVID and pandemic situation and that has positioned them well. I think the third thing is that and you've heard us mention how we're proactively managing the prospect of a recession. And I think when I talk to other CFOs, I know that when Jane talks to other CEOs, they too are looking at their expense line. They too are looking at the efficiency of their organizations and opportunity to increase that efficiency in light of a potential slowdown or recessionary environment. And then the final point is, I think a lot of firms have been that were proactive in the low rate environment, ensuring up that balance sheet strength. Now with that said, you've heard us also mention the prospect of a rebound in capital market activities, and that has to happen at some point. But sticking to your point around credit, I really think it's those factors that you see play through in not only our very low NAL, but also our very low credit losses, credit cost that you've seen in our business. Gerard Cassidy : And then as a follow-up, when you think about what we've seen with the Fed's tightening over the last 12 months, banks like your own have positioned the balance sheet accordingly and I know the Bank Analysts Association of Boston, Michael did a good job explaining how you guys manage the balance sheet. And how -- when you look at it going forward, do you think changes are coming because the Fed if they end -- the Fed funds rate increase as we get to a terminal rate, how are you guys positioned the balance sheet, do you think going forward? Mark Mason : Look, we're constantly actively managing the balance sheet in light of not only our client needs, but also how we see the broader macro environment evolving and changing. And as you know, and I know you've seen and we've talked about before, we share in our Qs, our view on our estimate for interest rate exposure and what happens with 100 basis points swing in rates in one direction or another across the curve across currencies. You've seen that shift over the last number of quarters to the last quarter where that estimate for IRE was about $1.7 billion or so, but heavily skewed towards non-US dollar rates and currencies. And I think as we think about the view on how rates will evolve, you'll see a continued shift there. I think that when we look to print this quarter, that number will probably come down a bit in terms of interest rate exposure and skew even more towards non-US dollar currencies in light of where rates are in those markets and the US dollar will likely be somewhat neutral in light of that curve currently looks like. But again, something we actively manage, first with an eye towards what client demand and needs are likely to be for use of our liquidity but also with a view for how the macro environment might evolve and what we're hearing from central banks around the world. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. I'm sorry, we have Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. I meant to follow up earlier on the bending of the cost curve, but if you were to put different initiatives in terms of how far along you are maybe like your exits might be in the eighth inning and your transformation might be in the sixth inning and you remediate fifth inning and the simplification in the first inning or second inning. Are those numbers correct? How would you put those numbers? And in terms of bending the cost curve, where are you further along and where are you just getting started? Mark Mason : Well, Mike, I love you, but I'm not going to play that game. What I will say is that, we clearly have work that we're doing as it relates to the exits, but we're making very good progress on that, not just on the closing of the exits but also on putting a dent in the stranded costs associated with those exits that we have closed. And so, as Jane mentioned in her prepared remarks, by the time we get to the end of the year, ex Mexico, we would have made a considerable amount of progress on there, and that creates an opportunity to do more around the simplification of the organization. And so that simplification is obviously in an earlier inning, call it, the exits in a later inning. I think that the transformation spend investments and those things. Look, we are squarely into execution, as you've heard us mention before. And as I've mentioned, the expense base around that is going to continue to morph from spend that we've made around third-party consultants and that helped in the crafting of the plan towards technology, towards people that are critically involved in the execution of it and then a downward trajectory towards the benefits we get from that technology and reduced operational expense. And so it's a multiyear journey. We've talked about that. We've got a number of years to continue to execute against it. But what's important is we know what we have to do, both in how we're investing that money and as it relates to being disciplined about our cost structure and bending the curve. And again, that's what we're going to do. Mike Mayo : And one more attempt, can you remind us how many people are working on the transformation remediation and how much that's costing you? Mark Mason : Yes. I mean, again, we've got -- I think the number I shared was somewhere around 13,000 people or so that are broadly working on the efforts here. We haven't gotten into specific costs. You know it's in the total number. But what I would say again is that, we're clear on what we've got to deliver and execute against and we're managing that cost very tightly. We're constantly looking at opportunities to deliver on those transformation deliverables, more efficiently, leveraging more technology, leveraging AI in some instances. And so, we're not just taking those execution plans as they were crafted and delivering against them. But we're looking for efficiencies and even the execution plans as they're constructed today. And that's important for us to keep doing. Operator : And our next question comes from Kenneth Usdin with Jefferies. Kenneth Usdin : Hi. I know this is going along here. Just a quick one, just, Mark, on the -- just wanted to get your sense on the sentiment around client activity in both the markets group and what the pipelines are looking like in investment banking and the feel for that? Thanks. Jane Fraser : Look, I'll jump in here. Corporates are pretty cautious. They've got another Fed hike in the offing, tensions, China and the West, OPEC and all general sense of more limited growth. But I think clients have been trying to understand and get their arms around both the macro and the market outlook for a while. I think they now seem to accept the current environment is the new normal and are beginning to position themselves globally. So globally, we're seeing less anxiety around funding as most large corps are biting the bullet and paying higher rates to take advantage of [indiscernible] balance sheet is getting reinforced. We certainly don't see a large cap credit prices on the horizon. And on the IB side, it remains -- the pipeline is robust. There's a lot of pent-up demand for M&A, but it's hard to predict when that pipeline will unlock. ECM had tangible momentum over Q1, and we're also seeing sponsor fringing signs of improvement, but both of those are from a very, very low base. And on the investor side, most of the investors stayed on the sidelines in Q2. The debt ceiling was a bigger topic than economic news was, and then it was a very low volume environment. We saw a bit of a pickup at the beginning of -- with the light bump in volatility in the last few days, but I wouldn't call that a trend yet. Operator : And our next question comes from Charles Peabody with [indiscernible]. Unidentified Participant : Yes. Good afternoon. A question about your markets related net interest income. And before I ask the question, I do appreciate that you run those businesses on a holistic basis and that NII is probably more of a residual outcome. But a couple of questions related to market-related NII. First is, you had a pretty nice jump up in the second quarter versus the first quarter. And I just wanted to understand, is that largely related to seasonal dividend issues? And then secondly, you have a positive NII outcome, where a lot of your money center in Brethren will have a negative NII outcome for markets and I was just wondering what the difference is? Is it the outsized [FIC] (ph) business relative to equities? Or is it the international? Or is it how you hedge? What's the difference on that? So those are the two questions. Mark Mason : Thanks for the question, and thanks for the acknowledgment that we do manage our markets revenues in total. So I appreciate that. What I would say in terms of the markets NII is, you've captured it right, which is, the dynamic that's playing out between first quarter and second quarter is in fact a dividend season. And again, given the globality of our franchise, the dividend is not just a dividend in any one region, but dividend in multiple regions playing out over the course of the first and second quarter. I can't speak to the peers at this particular stage. But what I would say is that, you know that our book SKUs more so than peers to corporates, and that's important. And we obviously have a very, very strong FIC business more broadly as well. So dividend season, major driver here in that increase. Unidentified Participant : Okay. And just as a follow-up, is there any sort of directional guidance you can give on markets related to NII? I mean does it mean to the extent second quarter was bolstered by dividend, it comes down in the third quarter, but then does it go back up in the fourth quarter? So would the second half be kind of equivalent to the first half? Mark Mason : Charles, I really appreciate the attempt there. But I'm not going to give any further guidance on the breakout of the NII. I will reiterate the ex-markets NII increase, by the way, to plus 46% but thanks for the question. I appreciate that. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Jane Fraser : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Thanks. Couple of questions. Number one, so capital, Jane and Mark, going back to that, should we expect that given what you've mentioned, given everything going on in the regulatory environment, ratio you're at currently, it should grow in anticipation of what may come or likely to come with all the regulatory stuff? Or are you going to try and keep that closer to the 13.3%? Jane Fraser : I think we're going to see exactly what the framework is that comes out and then the implementation time frame for it and then look at making adjustments to plan, also hoping that the comment period is taken seriously and the different considerations I talked about earlier are taken into effect. Then we'll work through water adjustments we make, pricing capital reallocation, et cetera, the playbook that you would expect the same one that we've done with [indiscernible] and we've done with a number of other pieces. And we would also hope to see our SCB in a different place for the same reasons we talked about earlier Vivek because there's a lot of volatility in that SCB dependent on the scenario that comes out every year. And I would say, given the shifts we're making in the business model, we'd expect to see that one come down. Mark Mason : The only thing I'd add is the -- again, the CET1 ratio of the 13.3% as of October 1 would be a 12.3% required level and 100 basis points of the management buffer. So that would be what we'd be held to as of October 1. As Jane mentioned, the NPR as it comes out, we'll take a look at that and see if there are implications on the CET1 stack, but more likely implications on the risk-weighted assets, right? And what's really important there aside from the very important points Jane made in terms of considering broader factors is the timing of the implementation of whatever that final rule includes and obviously, the more timing for implementation, the more of an ability it gets for the industry to think about how to absorb the implications there. Vivek Juneja : But I'm presuming you want to go sooner rather than later because the market is going to expect that rather than take a full three years or whatever the Fed might give you. Mark Mason : You know what, I'm really interested at this point in seeing the proposal, and then we'll have a chance to kind of to really react as an industry and as a firm. Vivek Juneja : Completely unrelated, if I may. Noninterest-bearing deposits, what are you seeing given you're very heavily corporate driven. When I look at your point-to-point because you don't give a full average balance sheet, it's only interest-bearing related. But the noninterest-bearing is only available on a peer end. If I look at that, there was a big drop in the US this quarter. Anything unusual? Is that accelerating? What are you seeing amongst your clients, people still waking up? And what have you factored into your NII guidance for that? Mark Mason : Well, again, I think the point I'd make here is that, we continue to see clients shift from kind of noninterest-bearing deposits and into both interest-bearing and CDs and other higher-yielding products in light of the rate environment that we're in. And I would expect us to continue to see those types of shifts subject to how rates continue to evolve. And again, on the corporate side, we've seen in the US clients have reached kind of those terminal -- that terminal level, terminal betas, I should say, outside of the US rate hikes, I think, are still in the future, as Jane alluded to, and the terminal betas have not quite yet been reached. But in terms of the noninterest bearing, we are seeing that dynamic play out. Operator : Thank you. This does conclude Citi's second quarter 2023 earnings review call.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference call is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jen Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter earnings call. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And I'm joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. Now let me pass it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jen, and good morning to everyone. I should touch briefly on the macro environment before reviewing the quarter and last month's organizational announcement. The global macro backdrop remains the story of desynchronization. In the U.S., recent data implies a soft landing, but history would suggest otherwise, and we are seeing some cracks in the lower FICO consumers. In the euro area and the U.K., the picture has turned distinctly more negative. The summer weakness in industrial economies is spreading fast and the weight of structurally higher labor and energy costs, suggest a more enduring competitiveness challenge for that region. China's economy may have reached a cyclical bottom supported by the government's modest stimulus efforts, but it still has to work through weak sentiment, youth unemployment, and the pain in its property market. All of these macro dynamics have clearly impacted client sentiment. September is always a busy month seeing clients, and I'm struck how consistently CEOs are less optimistic about 2024 in a few months ago. The shift in the rates question from how high to how long has catalyzed more client activity. However, corporates have stopped waiting for rates to come down and are beginning to access the debt capital markets around the globe. Our multinational clients are adapting their operations to the evolving geopolitical landscape and are building redundancy and resiliency. And this plays to our strengths and strategy, in particular our invaluable global network. And between our high quality asset portfolio, our strong reserve levels, our ample liquidity, and our diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we are truly a bank for all seasons. Turning to the quarter. Today, we reported net income of $3.5 billion, an EPS of $1.63, and an RoTCE of 7.7%. Our revenues were up 10%, ex-divestitures and each of our five core interconnected businesses posted revenue growth. We remain on-track to meet the revenue and expense guidance we set for the year. Let's start with our fastest-growing business, services. TTS was up 12% from a year-ago. That's the highest revenue quarter in over a decade and it continues to outpace the target we set at Investor Day. Half of that growth was business drivers, and the other half rates. And even with the impact of the long-expected Argentine devaluation, we again drove fee growth, which is the best sign of the potential of our globally leading franchise. We keep relentlessly innovating for our clients. Amongst other launches this quarter, we announced the creation of Citi Token Services, which will use distributed ledger and smart contract technologies to deliver a digital asset solution for our TTS clients. And this is the first for the industry as it allows us to seamlessly integrate a permission tokenized bank deposit network with traditional cash services such as 24/7 dollar clearing. Security Services had revenue growth of 16% with some good underlying fee growth. We took share again, and we have grown our AUC and AUA by over $2 trillion in the last year. This business has considerable momentum and a strong pipeline of clients who are benefiting from the cloud and data investments we're making. Markets was up 10% year-over-year, on the back of rates and currencies, having the best quarter in 10 years, and commodities, which also grew nicely. This was partially offset by equities, which was down slightly. Despite this, we continued to see good momentum in cash and we have grown our prime balances year-to-date. Banking had a good quarter with revenues up 17%, with activity playing to our mix. Now while corporate lending was essentially flat as we remain very disciplined about how we use our balance sheet, DCM was healthier. And the IPO market also showed some signs of life. This helped drive investment banking revenue up 34%, albeit off a low base and a small wallet. Sitting here today, it remains hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound, still I am proud of our role advising on some of the biggest deals globally so far this year. As you know, we are committed to growing our banking franchise. We brought together the management of the investment, corporate and commercial banks under one umbrella, and this structure will help us better drive important synergies between all three. We've been bringing in new talent in key sectors. And we've begun to provide more leverage finance for key clients in the right situation. U.S. Personal Banking was also up double digits at 13%. Cards revenues were strong in both our branded and retail services portfolios. The growth in spending is decelerating. And the consumer is more mindful what they spend on. Indeed, the affluent, who still have excess savings at their disposal, drove the growth in spending with a continued tilt to travel and entertainment. During the quarter, we introduced Simplified Banking, to improve the client experience for our retail banking clients. We believe that by peering offerings and simplifying our fee structure, we're going to incentivize our clients to deepen their relationships with us. And the early reaction from clients along those lines has been very positive. Wealth revenues have stabilized and were up slightly. Most notably investment revenues picked up across all geographies and the drivers of the franchise, such as referrals, client acquisition and net new inflows were all quite strong around the world. And we won important new mandates for Wealth at Work, an offering we had highlighted at Investor Day. Andy Sieg has now officially joined our firm. This is the time of massive global wealth creation and our franchise is uniquely positioned for it. Andy will ensure we are at the forefront of what's happening around the world. In terms of our balance sheet, our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base over the past five years. We grew loans during the quarter and our credit quality remains extremely strong, aided by our disciplined client selection. Our CET1 ratio grew to 13.5%, which is $14 billion above our regulatory minimum and still includes a 100 bps internal management buffer. During the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and stock buybacks. We continue to evaluate buybacks quarter-by-quarter. And I expect we will continue to do a modest level in the fourth quarter, subject to approval by our Board. And while the ultimate impact of potentially high capital requirements won't be known until the Basel III end game is finalized, we have been actively working through, mitigating actions. As you can see on Slide 3, we are relentless in executing our strategy. This quarter, we closed on the sale of our Taiwan consumer business, and that's the second largest of the Asia consumer divestitures. And earlier this week, we announced that we will sell our consumer wealth portfolio in China to HSBC. And this includes approximately $2.6 billion in assets under management and $1 billion of deposits. In the fourth quarter, we expect to close down the sale of our Indonesia consumer business. In terms of the International consumer businesses, we are exiting. In addition to the three wind-down market, we have restarted the sales process in Poland and we remain on-track to separate Mexico next year, followed by an IPO in 2025. Transformation remains our number one priority. We're deep into the large body of work of automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms, and upgrading our data architecture. We're committed to doing this the right way, knowing it will take time to meet our regulators' expectations and to deliver a modern, more efficient infrastructure. Last month, we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank. I said at the Investor Day, the organizational simplification would follow the divestitures. The changes will eliminate layers, duplication and complexity, allowing us to operate the bank more agilely and freeing our people up to focus on clients and execution. Elevating the five core businesses to my leadership team will enable me to drive greater accountability and sustainable results, so to bring it to life. The actions we've taken in the last few weeks will eliminate over 15% of the regional and functional roles at the top two layers of the company. It also take out 60 committees, which frees up over tens of thousands of people hours annually. We've identified approximately a 1,000 or 50% of our internal financial management reports that we won't need any longer. And we have taken out co-heads and dual reporting lines to enable faster decision-making. We're cascading these changes through the organization at pace. We announced the first two layers in September, and the next set of changes will be implemented by mid-November and we aim to bring the entire process to a close by early next year. When we speak in January, Mark and I will be in a position to update you on the financial and other metrics, sharing the impact of the simplification amongst other details. Now, while expenses is not the primary driver of the organizational changes, they will help us start bending expense curve in the fourth quarter of next year. And at the end of the work, we will have a simpler firm that can operate faster, better serve our clients, and unlock value for our shareholders. We've made tough decisions here, and I want to note how pleased I've been with how the leaders of the firm, especially the next generation have embraced these changes and are stepping up to implement them. They fully understand that we need to change how we run, Citi, in order to truly transform it once and for all. Before I close, I'd like to address our people in Israel. We are a significant bank in the country. And many of our people have lost friends and loved ones. Others are being called up to serve. Despite all they are dealing with, they are keeping our bank running in the country. And I'm frankly in all of their commitment to our clients and each other. More broadly, the price innocent civilians are paying as this crisis unfolds is absolutely devastating to witness. And with that, I would like to turn it over to Mark. And then we will be delighted as always to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the businesses. On Slide 4, we show financial results for the full firm. In the third quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.5 billion, EPS of $1.63, and an RoTCE of 7.7% on $20.1 billion of revenues. Embedded in these results are divestiture-related impacts of approximately $214 million after tax, primarily driven by the Taiwan consumer business sale. Excluding these items, EPS was $1.52, with an RoTCE of 7.2%. In the quarter, total revenues increased by 9% on a reported basis and 10% excluding divestiture-related impacts, driven by strength across services, cards and markets as well as modest growth in banking, partially offset by the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs. Our results include expenses of $13.5 billion, up 6% on a reported basis and $13.4 billion excluding divestiture-related costs, also up 6%. Cost of credit was approximately $1.8 billion, up 35%, primarily driven by the continued normalization in card net credit losses and volume growth. At the end of the quarter, we had over $20 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And year-to-date, we reported an RoTCE of 8.3%. On Slide 5, we show expense drivers for the third quarter as well as our key investment themes. Expenses were up 6% and our level of expenses continue to be driven by a number of factors, including investments in transformation, as well as risk and controls, business-led and enterprise-led investments, macro factors including inflation and FX, severance, which was approximately $190 million in the quarter, and roughly $640 million on a year-to-date basis. This included actions across banking, markets, wealth and the functions. And all of this was partially offset by productivity savings and expense reductions from the closed exits and wind-downs. And our technology spend across the firm was $3 billion in the quarter, up 8%, largely driven by investments in product development, platform enhancements, and improving the client experience. Also driving the increase is continued investment in technology for the transformation as we address the consent orders and modernize the firm. As we said last quarter, our transformation and technology investments span the following themes : platform and process simplification, security and infrastructure modernization, client experience enhancements, and data improvements. And we remain in line with our full year guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding divestiture-related impacts and the FDIC special assessment. On Slide 6, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I will speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income decreased by $72 million. Excluding markets, net interest income increased $332 million, primarily driven by growth in PBWM as we continue to see loan growth and higher loan spreads, a pickup in services driven by higher deposit spreads as a result of higher interest rates and active beta management, partially offset by reductions from closed exits and wind-downs. Average loans were up 1%, largely driven by growth in U.S. Personal Banking across Cards and retail banking as well as TTS. Average deposits were down 2%, largely driven by Services, as we saw non-operational deposit outflows as expected in light of quantitative tightening. And our net interest margin increased 1 basis point. On Slide 7, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. We are well reserved for the current environment, with over $20 billion of total reserves. Our reserves to funded loan ratio was nearly 2.7%, and within that U.S. cards is 7.8%. In PBWM, 45% of our loans are in U.S. cards, and of that exposure, 80% is to customers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And both Branded Cards and Retail Services NCL rates are still below pre-COVID levels, but are normalizing in line with our expectations. The remaining 55% of our PBWM loans are largely in wealth, predominantly in mortgages and margin lending. In our ICG portfolio, of our total exposure, approximately 85% is investment grade. Of the international exposure, approximately 90% is investment grade or exposure to multinational clients or their subsidiaries. Corporate non-accrual loans increased by $490 million, but remain low at 68 basis points of total corporate loans. And we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 1%. As you can see on the page, we break out our commercial real estate lending exposures across ICG and PBWM, which totals approximately $65 billion, of which 86% is investment grade, with a total reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.4%. To give you a sense of the macro scenario that underpin our over $20 billion of reserves, our current scenario weighted average unemployment rate is approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario, with an average unemployment rate of roughly 7%. So while the macro and geopolitical environment remains uncertain, we feel very good about our asset quality, exposures and reserve levels, and we continuously review and stress the portfolio under a range of scenarios. On Slide 8, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital and liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base across regions, industries, customers and account types, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. Our balance sheet reflects our strategy and well-diversified business model. We leverage our unique assets and capabilities to serve corporates, financial institutions, investors, and individuals with global needs. The majority of our deposits, $782 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries. These institutional deposits are complemented by $416 billion of U.S. Personal Banking and global wealth deposits. We have approximately $569 billion of HQLA and approximately $666 billion of loans and we maintained total liquidity resources of $937 billion. Our LCR was 117%. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 ratio based on standardized RWA, which is our binding constraint. Although not binding, our advanced RWA did increase this quarter, largely driven by business activity. And our tangible book value per share was $86.90, up 8% from a year ago. On Slide 9, we show a sequential CET1 walk to provide more details on the drivers this quarter. Starting from the end of the second quarter, first, we generated $3.2 billion of net income to common, which added 28 basis points; second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points; and finally, the remaining 2 basis points increase was primarily driven by lower DTA deductions and a net reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately a 120 basis points or $14 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3% as of October 1st. Before we move on, I'd like to spend a minute on capital. We continue to optimize our RWA and capital, which we expect to be a tailwind over-time. Contributing to this is the execution of our strategy, such as further diversifying our business mix and simplifying our business model, including exiting our 14 international consumer markets. Our investments in the transformation will continue to enhance our data analytics and stress testing capabilities, enabling continued capital optimization. And of course, in light of the evolving regulatory environment, we're also looking at other mitigating actions. But those will largely depend on how the final capital rules play-out. These actions could include exiting or restructuring certain products, divesting certain equity investments, and re-evaluating both how we deploy capital and our management buffer. We've consistently demonstrated our ability to manage our RWA and capital levels through various macro environment and the evolving regulatory landscape, and we'll continue to do so. On Slide 10, we show the results for our Institutional Clients Group for the third quarter. Revenues were up 12% this quarter, driven by double-digit growth across services, markets and banking. In the quarter, normal course foreign currency translation impacts drove a net revenue headwind in ICG. On an ex-FX basis, ICG revenues would have been up 15%. Additionally, there was an approximately $180 million negative impact from the currency devaluation in Argentina on our net investment in the country, mainly across TTS, markets and security services. Expenses increased 10%, primarily driven by continued investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $196 million, including $51 million of net credit loss. This resulted in net income of approximately $2.4 billion, up 12% driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans were down 4% as we were very deliberate about how we deployed resources across the businesses, including the reduction in subscription credit facilities. Average deposits were flat as new client acquisition and deepening of relationships with existing clients were offset by non-operational deposit outflows. ICG delivered an RoTCE of 10% for the quarter and 11% year-to-date. On Slide 11, we show revenue performance by business and the key drivers we laid out at Investor Day. In Treasury and Trade Solutions, we recorded our highest revenue quarter in the last decade. Revenues were up 12%, driven by 17% growth in net interest income. Non-interest revenues were up 1%, and on an ex-FX basis, non-interest revenues would have been up 8%. We continue to see healthy underlying drivers in TTS that indicate consistently strong client activity with cross-border flows up 16%, outpacing global GDP growth and year-to-date, cross-border flows were up 12%. U.S. dollar clearing volumes are up 6% both year-over-year in the quarter and year-to-date. And commercial card volumes were up 8% year-over-year, driven by growth in business-to-business payments and travel and entertainment spends. And year-to-date, commercial card volumes were up 20%. In fact, similar to the last few quarters, client wins are up approximately 40% across all client segments. These include marquee mandates, where we are serving as the client's primary operating bank. We continue to make good progress on our commercial client strategy, as year-to-date wins more than doubled, driven by expansion into new markets and growth in multiproduct mandates from clients with cross-border needs. In Securities Services, revenues were up 16%, driven by higher net interest income across currencies. Non-interest revenues were up 3%. We're very pleased with the progress we're seeing in Security Services as we continue to onboard assets under custody and administration which are up approximately 10% or $2.1 trillion. Markets revenues were up 10%, driven by fixed income. Fixed income revenues were up 14%, largely driven by strength in our rates and currency franchise. While volatility remains subdued versus a year ago, we did see overall volatility tick higher relative to the beginning of the quarter. Equities revenues were down 3%, driven by a decline in equity derivatives, partially offset by growth in cash and prime. And we continue to make solid progress on our revenue to RWA target. And finally, banking revenues, excluding gains and losses on loan hedges were up 17%, driven by investment banking, which increased 34% on a reported basis and 12% excluding marks. Here too, we saw a pickup in activity in the last couple of weeks of the quarter, particularly in DCM, but also in M&A as we closed a few deals earlier than expected. So overall, while the market environment remains challenging, and there's more work to be done, we're making solid progress against our strategy in these businesses. Now turning to Slide 12, we show the results for our Personal Banking and Wealth Management business. Revenues were up 10%, driven by net interest income growth of 9% and a 20% increase in non-interest revenue, primarily due to lower partner payments in retail services and higher investment product revenues in wealth. Expenses were up 5%, predominantly driven by risk and control investments and severance, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $1.5 billion, driven by higher net credit losses as we continue to see normalization in our card portfolios. Average loans increased 7% driven by cards, mortgages and installment lending. Average deposits decreased 2%, largely reflecting our clients putting cash to work in investments on our platform. And PBWM delivered an RoTCE of 8.8% and 6.6% on a year-to-date basis. On Slide 13, we show PBWM revenues by product as well as key business drivers and metrics. This quarter was our fifth consecutive quarter of double-digit growth in Personal Banking, driven by cards. Branded cards revenues were up 12%, primarily driven by higher net interest income. We continue to see strong underlying drivers with new account acquisitions up 5%, card spend volumes up 4%, and average loans up 12%. Retail services revenues were up 21%, driven by higher net interest income and lower partner payments on the heels of higher net credit losses. In the card portfolios, we continue to see the investments we've been making as well as lower payment rates contribute to growth in interest-earning balances of 15% in Branded Cards and 12% in retail services. Retail banking revenues decreased 3%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business, partially offset by higher deposit spreads. Wealth revenues were up 2%, driven by higher investment fees across all regions and segments. The benefit from relationships transferred from retail banking and higher lending revenue. We also saw strong net new inflows across all regions. And year-to-date, new client acquisitions were up almost 30% in the private bank and over 60% in wealth at work. Overall, we are pleased with the progress we are making across these businesses. On Slide 14, we show results for Legacy Franchises. Revenues were down 13%, largely driven by the difference in one-time gain on sale impacts in the Asia consumer businesses as well as the reductions from closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. It's worth noting that Mexico's revenues were up 32%, primarily driven by Mexican peso appreciation, higher interest rates, and volume growth. Ex-FX, Mexico revenues were up 16%. Expenses decreased 3%, primarily driven by closed consumer exits and wind-downs, partially offset by separation costs in Mexico and Mexican peso appreciation. And expenses in Mexico were up 27% and but ex-FX expenses were up 11%. On Slide 15, we show results for Corporate/Other. Revenues increased, largely driven by the absence of mark-to-market impacts on certain derivative transactions in the prior year. And expenses decreased, largely driven by lower consulting fees. On Slide 16, I'll briefly touch on our full year 2023 outlook. With one quarter remaining in the year, we continue to expect full year revenues of $78 billion to $79 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impacts. Having said that, based on what we've seen play out year-to-date in terms of U.S. and non-U.S. rates and lagging non-U.S. betas, we now expect net interest income to be slightly above $47.5 billion for the full year, excluding markets. And we are maintaining our expense guidance of roughly $54 billion, excluding 2023 divestiture-related impact and the FDIC special assessment. Net credit losses in cards should continue to normalize with both portfolios reaching pre-COVID levels by year-end. And as it relates to buybacks, we expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the fourth quarter. Before we move to Q&A, I'd like to end with a few points. We're executing on our strategy and delivering topline revenue growth of 5% year-to-date. We continue to invest for the long-term with discipline while remaining on track to deliver our expense guidance. We're focused on simplifying our organizational and management structure, which will further support our speed of execution. We're managing our capital in a disciplined way in light of regulatory headwinds, while continuing to optimize and return capital to shareholders. And we remain confident in our ability to achieve our RoTCE target of 11% to 12% in the medium term. And again, we look forward to hosting a more expansive fourth quarter earnings call, where we plan to share additional details related to the organizational simplification, including expected related severance and expense saves as well as our outlook for 2024. With that, Jane and I would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Jane, you spoke more about the restructuring that you commented on recently. The real question is, why is this restructuring different than the other five or 10 or 15 restructurings you've heard about since Citi's creation in its current form 25 years ago, I think, just like a week ago. So, I'd say, why is this different? We hear the talk about cascading downward and the simplification, reducing dual heads and the committees, but we've heard this so much that -- why is this time different? Jane Fraser : Yes. It's a very important question. Mike, thank you for asking it. As I've said, we view these as the most consequential changes we've made, not just to our organization model, but how we run the bank in almost two decades. And the first piece is simple, which is our org model was set up for a financial supermarket. That is simply not the bank we are today. So we're aligning the organizational model with that simpler business mix and strategy. But what's truly different is we're changing how we run the bank. And these are permanent changes that will be driven all the way down through the organization. So let me give you some examples to bring it to life. We talked about delayering the first two layers, three layers of the bank. That will continue through the organization through the spans and layers, particularly getting rid of aggregator roles. And let me give you an example. HR, we had HR in a region. You had the region head, you have the institutional client group head, you had the banking head. In addition, you had a North Asia head and a South Asia head. We're just going to have the North Asia head and the South Asia head. And all of those roles collapsed into those two. We're eliminating activities in the geographies that we just don't need anymore because we are no longer running local consumer franchises in them. So let's take the financial reporting -- sorry, the management reporting that Mark and I referred to in the opening remarks. We can reduce our management reports by about 50%. That's a 1,000 reports. What does that mean? Shadow P&Ls by country, quarterly outlooks, monthly performance updates, all the associated tracking and reconciliations that are there that are effectively for a shadow P&L rather than the one that matters to our shareholders. And so, that greatly declutters. It also means we can eliminate processes for our transformation, where we're looking at how do we automate those processes, automate those controls. If they're a duplicative process, we're getting rid of them, so you don't need to do that anymore, and it will accelerate the work on transformation. We're taking activities out of some of the businesses and centralizing them. A lot of the client activities that will go embedded into a business and we moved that up to centralized utilities that the whole firm can benefit from and that will get scaled economies. These strategy teams, marketing teams, many of the little cottage industries that build up over time, we can speed up decision-making with fewer committee layers. We'll take down the number of layers and drive that from places 13, we're looking to getting to eight and as many places as we possibly can. We're giving clarity of decision rights and changing decision rights from two or more people to just one, so much more single points of accountability. Again, more aligned with our shareholder interest because those points of accountability are more sitting in the products. And the types of metrics we're looking at to help us measure this, spans, layers, revenues, producers or non-producer, grade mixes, synergies that we're realizing voice of the client. But I'd say that our expectations and our execution of the business strategy is also at the heart of what we're trying to drive here. Our strength is our global network. I don't want our geographies focused on the full monty of management processes that are a duplication of what's happening in the product organization. I want them focused on delivering to our clients, engaging with our clients, and also managing their responsibilities of the legal entities. The same way for our banking organization, putting the investment bank, the corporate bank, and commercial bank together will really make it easier for us to realize the synergies across them. So the cross-sell or the movement of a commercial mid-market company up to a corporate lending company and a corporate banking company, much easier when they're all in the same organization or selling our banking product suite into that commercial bank customer and other examples. So it's really changing decision-making, freeing up people to focus on clients and transformation, much greater transparency, changing decision-making and rights, driving synergies. We put a huge amount of work all the way through the summer in design as to how do we want the organization to work. That is now getting driven down into the designing in detail and in depth all of these types of activities through being second layers and third layers at the moment into the fourth and then until we finish at the end of the first quarter. So it's very different. You'll get more flavor of it in the fourth quarter earnings call, but I hope that gives you a sense of why this is really different. This is how we're running the place. It's not just an org restructuring, both are necessary. Operator : And our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Glenn Schorr : So I'm curious, you mentioned that you're still marching towards the 11, 12, which is good because everyone was going to ask that. My question is a little bit different of -- with the denominator going up 25%, where is your -- in other words, a lot of things are working towards the transformation, but they threw a curveball in there with upping the denominator by 25%. So you seem to be a beneficiary of higher for longer for sure. And you also mentioned you're working on mitigation as we speak. So maybe you could talk about what are the offsets that we don't see that give you confidence still working towards that, because the topline stuff is working? Mark Mason : Yes. So let me -- good morning, Glenn. It's good to hear from you. Let me make a couple of comments on that, and then Jane, feel free to chime in if you'd like. The first thing is that when I talked about this at the last conference we attended, I mentioned that analysts were somewhere in the 16% and 19% range in terms of a capital increase, and we're likely to be inside of that range, assuming the Basel III proposal as it's structured as it's written. And obviously, that's not the final. There's a period of review that's going on now. What I'd say is a couple of things, Glenn. One, we haven't fully executed against the strategy that Jane has just described. And obviously, continuing to simplify the business, managing through the transformation, changing that business mix that we have to something that's more consistent and predictable and repeatable as it relates to PPNR. Those things matter and impact the SCB. We talked about the exiting of our business, the international consumer businesses. That will be a factor in what our balance sheet looks like and what stress losses might look like, as well as lowering the expense base, which we know is an important factor in that PPNR math as well. And so those things help, I think, to reduce the amount of capital that might be required as we get into that medium-term period. Importantly, as you point out, there are other elements of the proposal that are going to require that we take a hard look at as well and identify mitigating actions to the extent that they make it into the final. So think about the increase in operational risk and the fact that some of that's already included in SCB is something of a point of advocacy, but that's obviously a big headwind that we'll have to kind of work through; the FRTB and the enhancement of models. Now there's a global market shock as well, but again, another point of advocacy that we need to work through, the equity investments, and now that they go from 100% risk weighting to 400% risk weighting. I think we're going to take a hard look at whether those are worth keeping in light of the higher capital associated with them, that's going to challenge the returns, that's going to force us to look at those through a different strategic lens, and we're going to do that. And then that's not to even mention the credit component that impacts both corporates and consumers as it relates to unfunded commitments, for example. And so as we've done with CCAR and other types of reg changes, we're going to have to look at what it means for our product mix, the returns associated with those, whether there are opportunities to pull levers like pricing or whether we have to take other decisions around those. And so that's what I mean by the mitigating actions that we're dimensioning and putting on paper and working through. But again, we want to be thoughtful because the rule is not final yet, and there are more discussions to be had around those important elements that I mentioned already. Operator : And our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Erika Najarian : You've talked a lot about defense, as I like to call it, in terms of the transformation that Jane had outlined and bending the expense curve. What I'm wondering for Jane and Mark, if you could sort of address what I think is probably the most debated part of your target, which is that revenue CAGR of 5%. You put up a very nice quarter in terms of revenues, both in net interest income and fees. And maybe help us sort of look underneath the surface in terms of that momentum, and maybe break it down in terms of what's really going well? I think TTS continues to surprise to the upside. It's going to take -- are we going to be two years from now, and we were like, oh, well, TTS is continuing to doing well. So what are the businesses that really sort of strong secular momentum that you feel is being under recognized versus how you could position cyclically and hire for longer? And what is still to come as we think about that path to at least the numerator of that RoTCE target? Jane Fraser : I love this question, Erika, because I am really -- I have to say, I'm really excited about our strategy and the potential it has. And it is -- as you say, this is about the revenue potential of the firm and really how do we continue to unlock it. So there's a couple of unstoppable trends that we're going to be riding in the next -- I think it's decade long. The corporate client of today and indeed consumer has the build resiliency. The multinational client is on a long-term trend of building resiliency, be it because of green, be it because of geopolitics, be it because of regulatory, whatever the different reasons may be and there are multiple, they are having to build resiliency into supply chains, into their own operations, as they operate around the world, where the bank is absolutely there for them. And I think you've seen that in TTS, where we've had such strong drivers of growth in the last few years at the beginning of this trend. So that is an important one. Wherever the clients want to go, we are there. We have been there for decades. We understand the risk. We understand the client base. We understand the opportunities there at that -- that micro level and local levels that someone who's flying in with a suitcase can't possibly deliver. And it's connected globally. So this thing is just a thing of beauty. Linked into it is what I think of as a hidden gem amongst our crown jewels is Security Services. It equally in custody has this extraordinary global network, the connectivity everywhere. We have been investing behind this business. We've been growing our market share in North America in asset managers where we've been underweight with a number of material marquee wins. You can see the share gain that we're getting in this business, the pipeline of deals that we've already won as well as the new pipelines going forward. Very high return. We're investing both in terms of our cloud, our data, our client experience. And this is in a way, let's say, I do view this as a hidden gem with extremely attractive return profile, fee profile and other dimensions to it. We've quite a long way to run here. So a similar story to TTS, slightly different client base, competitively advantaged because you've got both the -- you've got the pre-trade and the post-trade, we connect the two huge efficiencies for clients that's going to matter. Next trend that's unstoppable, global wealth creation. And there is going to be massive global wealth creation. I can't tell you how excited Andy Sieg is now that he's in the building and knows the way to his desk. And all the floors as people are on, he's about to hit the road globally. We are so well positioned to deliver against that. And as you can see, we've not been happy with our performance the last couple of years, but this is going to be a very important driver for us. We'll see the recovery in banking wallet eventually, none of us are calling when, that will sustainably happen. That will be another driver. And I'd say cards continuing to go from strength to strength, particularly, I think, as we look forward, playing to our lending-led model there. And finally, the other one I do love, which is our commercial bank. We serve these entrepreneurs all over the world who are going to be the drivers of many industries going forward. And we're serving them, helping them to go international for the first step, tap them into global supply chains and the like. It's almost by definition the fastest growing of the mid-market companies are the ones that tap into what we can offer them. We built great relationships with them. And then our private bankers call on them. And then our investment bankers called on them. We have our capital market teams calling on them. And we help them grow and succeed. And that is going to be a big engine in the medium term of new client acquisition feeding us. So deeper client relationships, more growth in terms of new clients that fit with our proposition fairly uniquely and some great megatrends that we are going to be riding and pretty uniquely positioned on. And we'll keep investing to make sure that we're -- where areas we're behind, we get into the full front of and the areas we are crushing it in like our win rate is 82% in TTS, and we're going to make sure that we continue to do so and innovate that way. So, sorry to be so excited about this, but this is -- the 4% to 5% just feels very, very doable to Mark and I. Operator : And our next question comes from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Hi, good morning. Mark, maybe on the revenue discussion there, let's talk about NII a little bit. You guys have a very unique deposit base, a lot smaller footprint in low-cost consumer. Betas have been already been high. So it doesn't seem like there's as much beta catch-up risk for you. It's 50% non-U.S. roughly. How do you think about the trajectory of NII as we -- do you think it stabilizes next year before rate cuts? How do we think about the puts and takes on your NII into next year? Mark Mason : Yes. Thanks for the question. Look, I'm not going to give guidance for 2024. We'll do that obviously at the fourth quarter '23 earnings. But I think it's reasonable to expect that some of the trends that we've seen so far, we'll continue. So if you think about what's underneath this, we'll continue to benefit from higher rates across currencies. I think we'll continue to see benefits from card interest-earning balance growth. Recall that when you look at our U.S. dollar IRE position, it's relatively neutral at this point. And interest-earning balance growth is expected to be driven by continued card spend and lower payment rates. And so I think what's important to remember as it relates to our business is that it's global that we've got, while you're right in that on the U.S. dollar side, we've seen betas kind of reach -- particularly for our corporate clients reach terminal levels at the end of last year. On the non-U.S. dollar side, betas run lower, they lag and there's still upside there because it's a different rate curve and a different pace of increases. And so those will be some of the puts and takes to think about volumes, the rates, the speed of the curve moves and then how betas evolve, that will kind of factor in. And then the final thing to remember is that in our NII, we show it both with and without markets. On the ex-markets, we'll have the impact of the drag from the exits of the countries that kind of play out. So we just exited Taiwan, that's going to impact, obviously, the next quarter's NII. So just a couple of factors to think about. And obviously, I'll give you more detail on 2024 and at the fourth quarter earnings call. Operator : And our next question comes from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Ryan Kenny : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Ryan Kenny : On the capital markets side, I heard the comments around it being hard to predict when deal activity will sustainably rebound. Can you just give us an update or more color on how CEOs are thinking about bringing deals live across M&A, ECM and DCM? And does the market and rate volatility over the last few weeks have any significant impact on bringing deals to completion or on the pipeline? Jane Fraser : Well, I think a couple of pieces. I actually start with Q3 is the seventh quarter of the current IB downturn. So since 2000, downturns have tended not to last longer than seven quarters because that's often how long it takes for pricing expectations to fully adjust to new realities. And we're starting to see that, particularly in the debt capital markets, investment grade market, where the expectation of no longer how high, but how long for rates. We've seen clients get off the sidelines and just bite the bullet and get into the debt capital markets in a more meaningful way and no longer waiting on that. We still think that how a recovery and return to normal wallet plays out when you talk to CEOs is largely dependent on the macro environment. That's the main piece for them. ECM, we're seeing increased interest and activity on ECM. You obviously had several IPOs coming to market in September, big ones -- three big ones that we're involved in. But the market still was somewhat fragile. We're watching it closely. And quite a few questions in Q4, things may move to Q1. We just have to see how that unfolds. But there's a good pipeline. I mean there's a lot of pent-up demand here. In debt, we had a big pickup in DCM, we feel confident that the gradual recovery in DCM and the beginnings of that LevFin will continue. You're certainly going to see us more active in the LevFin space in the right situations for our key clients. And then in M&A, a healthy M&A sell-side pipeline. A lot of companies with their industries is transforming are really wanting to think big. I think we'll see that unlocking when sentiment improves further. Companies do accept the new pricing reality, which will be helped by a rebound in equity markets. That obviously from our end takes quite a few quarters to materialize into revenue just given the nature of the product. So, it's there, but I think just given where everything is geopolitically and particularly from the macro, no one is going to make that call as to when we're going to see that sustainable term in banking at this point. Operator : And our next question comes from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Steven Chubak : Hi, good morning. Mark Mason : Good morning. Steven Chubak : So, Mark, I recognize, and Jane, I do recognize you'll provide a more fulsome update on expense actions next quarter. But one of the things I was hoping was that you could frame the expense opportunity in the context of your headcount trends. And prior to COVID as well as the consent order, mind you, Citi was running with 200,000 direct staff. That number is closer to 240,000 today. It's an increase of 20% even with multiple divestitures that you've consummated. So how should we think about an appropriate target or an optimal level of headcount for Citi versus that pre-COVID baseline of 200,000? And whether the consent order would impact the timing or magnitude of such headcount actions? Mark Mason : Yes. So, look, I'm not going to give you headcount guidance. But what I will say is, Jane has talked before about the heads associated with the divestitures that are underway. And obviously, as we continue to progress in those divestitures have weighed a lot of progress already. We'll see those heads come down. It's also important to point out that as part of our effort, there's been in-sourcing. And so we've captured the extended workforce in the headcount that we have here. And then I think the final point is that as we continue to execute against the transformation work and as we implement the org simplification that we've just announced, undoubtedly, the technology investment, the automation that we're putting in place, the straight-through processing that occurs, the fewer reconciliations that are required, the streamlining from all of those layers that Jane mentioned will be eliminating. All of those things will also work to reduce headcount as well. And so while we're investing and hiring on the front end to capture the upside as markets turn, but also as we position ourselves to grow with clients, we're also going to realize efficiencies that come out of headcount reduction. One additional point is that you've heard me mention before that we've taken probably about $600 million or so, year-to-date, in repositioning charges. And with that will come roughly 7,000 or so headcount coming down associated with those repositioning charges. And so -- and we'll continue to do that, by the way. We haven't even begun to take repositioning charges associated with the org simplification that's underway. That will come in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of next year. And so we will see heads continue to evolve through this process. But keep in mind that there are puts and takes associated with that as we look at where we need to in-source versus use external parties. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our next question comes from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. Just maybe, Mark, following up on that. As we think about bending the curve through the end of next year, maybe if you can talk to around - as you think about the puts and takes between investments and expense saves. How much of that cost save or bending the curve is going to happen in legacy versus PBWM and ICG? Like just how do you break - how should we think about that as we think about bending the curve and where the savings are coming from? Mark Mason : Well, look, next year, we talked about expenses coming down from third quarter to fourth quarter. And as we think about that, you'll have some of the benefits of the costs going away from the exits that we would have announced. You'll have some of the benefit from further reduction in stranded costs, which we've been keenly focused on as we've exited each of these. And then I think as we get to the medium term, you will start to see some of the benefits from the transformation spend and investments that we would have made start to play out as well as efficiencies that we start to get in a lower structural cost base. But again, that's in that medium-term period. So all of those things will be drivers to getting to bending of the curve. I'm not - I haven't broken down. I'm not going to break down here on this call how much comes from each of the pieces but all are important factors to achieving that. Operator : And our next question comes from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hi. There were some quotes, I think in the media, Jane from you talking about some signs of pressure among the lower end of the consumer. And I appreciate the pie chart that you have in the deck so it's not a huge percent of the card portfolio. But could you elaborate on that? And then also just address the - you mentioned directionally how the payment rates recovery coming down. But if we look at the growth in spend versus the growth in loans, it is kind of a little disproportionate, I think spends up a couple of percent year-over-year and the loans are [lower FICO]. So as we think about being kind of later cycle, is that something that you're paying attention to as a potential sign of further weakness in the credit? Thank you. Jane Fraser : Yes. Look, I think most of the pressure in the lower FICO, we do have a lot of customers in lower FICO. So we're seeing it out in the market. We've got - we obviously have some in the retail services business. We also have to say have the benefit of that loss sharing agreement that really makes a difference there because we're having to reserve fully for that, but we get it back on the revenue line, as you know. But as we look at the off-us book, as we look at some of the pressures in the market as we look at spending, we can certainly see some of that pressure for the lower FICO, whereas when I think about the cards business, it's very much driven by the affluent customer. So the affluent is accounting for almost all the spending growth that we're seeing. And that's similar to the numbers that we saw from coming out of the Fed from the deposit side, the excess savings are sitting there, now primarily with households with over $150,000 of income. And it's down in the rest. So these are things we're keeping an eye on. I want to be very clear. I'm not that worried about it for Citi, given the prime nature of our card portfolio. And then the rest of our PBWM exposure is obviously is very affluent. But when I look out at the market, I talked to our corporate clients, that's where we tend to see them be more nervous about the softness in the consumer. And just I call it, they're much more mindful about where they're spending, right? So you're seeing them moving down within a category. They're certainly looking more on the bargain front. We've been hearing that from our retail partners. We've been hearing that across the board. And so growth of card loans is good. Our spend is up but less than loans, I think it's softening, but it's not worrying. Mark Mason : Yes. I think that's spot on. The only thing I'd add is that when you look at the payment rate, payment rates and branded cards, while they've started to come down, they're still above the pre-COVID level. And we obviously have invested in this business. So the other thing that's driving this is the new account acquisitions are obviously important drivers of that spend volume and ultimately, that loan growth. But again, there's nothing that we see outside of what we were expecting in terms of how this portfolio is normalizing. Operator : And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Good morning, Jane. Good morning, Mark. Mark Mason : Good morning. Jane Fraser : Hi, Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Jane, as you pointed out, you're very excited about the opportunities in TTS. You're winning some new mandates in the custody business. Can you feel on this, is it because the competition is struggling with other issues, what gives you - because it has always been well regarded in this area. So what gives you that added excitement that this is even getting better? Jane Fraser : Look, I think the added excitement is a lot of it is coming from the investments that we've been making, so that we're - if you look at it in terms of Payment Express, which is live in the U.S., it's - Thailand is on track for three more markets. That is really a very differentiating capability. The momentum we have in 24/7 clearing, that's been put in place. We had over $1 billion processed year-to-date, putting our commercial bank clients onto CitiDirect so they have seamless access to our whole PTS network globally had us talking about Citi token services, you can see us innovating with the Fed in new capabilities. So really across the board, it's that innovation in cutting-edge first in the market type of capabilities. But you're putting that on top of a network that's just unprecedented in terms of its presence, its local capabilities, it's payroll, cash management, liquidity management, it's collections, its receivables all sitting on one platform connected globally. And what that gives a client in terms of efficiency saves, insights on data what they can do in terms of risk management and how to really optimize their treasury capabilities. I mean, this thing is a thing of beauty, and it's very, very hard. It's very sticky to extract from this because it's embedded into how our clients do business. It's that critical and into their technology systems. So when you look at where the world is headed and what's going on in the world, volatility, these other elements, it's hard not to see opportunities. And its opportunities as well with our markets business linked in and one of our really differentiating factors that Andy Morten talks about all the time is his partnership with TTS. In fact, one of our major client bases are corporates, and they have a different profile, let's say, to an asset manager or a hedge fund, and we uniquely can serve them. So that's the piece. It's that combination and trends we see. Mark Mason : The only thing - I think that's spot on. The only thing I'd add is that the middle market commercial space is a huge opportunity for us, as you said earlier, leveraging that TTS platform. And then on the security services side, the reality is that we're finally seeing real traction in North America. Right? We've always had kind of strength in many of the other regions, but we're really winning some major mandates here in North America, which I think is enough to get really excited about. Jane Fraser : And I think that, to me, is what then drives a lot of the strategy and what we're trying to do in terms of get to that high quality of earnings, better earnings mix and other pieces that will help us get to that medium-term return target that we are so focused on. Operator : And our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Jane Fraser : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : I wanted to just clarify the reorganization a little bit. So Jane, I heard you say, to keeping North Asia, North Asia and South Asia heads. So did you just get rid of the Asia head and get rid of the product heads where product heads in each country, we're reporting to a regional product head. So - is that dotted line is no longer there? What's going on there? And when you get rid of all the monthly management reporting, what are you planning to replace that with from your management? Your MIS perspective? Jane Fraser : So let me take the second one first. I'm not planning on replacing it with anything. We don't need them. We're no longer running consumer franchises in the countries. Instead, we've got global businesses that are operating very consistently in the individual geographies. So we just don't need replace them. And it enables us just to have the legal entity financial management that we need. And then our internal reports get greatly simplified same as they get greatly simplified by taking out ICG and PBWM is another - eliminating that layer also eliminates a lot of different reports. So the wonderful answer is nothing, a simplicity. The first question was about, okay, help you understand what we've done. So on the geography front, we have done two main things already. One is we put - we've eliminated the regions and I've just put a single international head reporting to me. So that makes it much simpler for me. I have one international head, and then he will help us manage the geographies collectively. The second piece is we've really narrowed the mandate of geography to delivering to our clients and covering our clients in their countries and secondly, the legal entity management. And otherwise before, we had a huge amount of management on shadow P&Ls and different - a lot of very heavy committee structure. That was necessary because the business was still very local as a retail bank, a local credit card business, a local onshore wealth business. They've gone. It's just serving multinational, the subsidiaries are multinationals and in some markets, the investors and the wealth clients in some markets. And that's a much simpler business to manage. So we could get rid of the regional there, and we just jumped straight down to the clusters that we have today, but they too have less of a mandate than they had before, a much more focused one. And the bit that I'm excited about it is not just, yes, this makes it much simpler to manage but it also helps us really focus on the global network. Now our geographies and our banking organizations sitting together on the same management structure, collectively accountable for serving and delivering against our core client base. And they're in one team to do it, it just makes it much easier. Does that give you a feel what else, Mark? Mark Mason : The other thing, Vivek, that I think is important here is we really want to spend a little bit more investment and time on the client lens in terms of the financial reporting, right? Because as Jane talked about, we talked about the synergies across the franchise that we can capture the ability to leverage the offering we have for those different client segments. So looking at that P&L, looking at those returns, looking at that growth opportunity, through that client lens will be something where we want to enhance the metrics that we have already around that so that we can capture that upside. Jane Fraser : And around the other piece that I think is also just an important point. Globalization is changing it. We're seeing these lanes all changing, food, trade, financial flows, et cetera. By actually having a single international organization and then the different clusters, North and South Asia, Europe, U.K., LATAM, Middle East, Africa. The connection points between them are really changing at the moment. And so this makes us much more agile in our delivery of the global network because I think it's much more in line with how the world is operating today. Operator : And our next question comes from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : Hi, there. So I wanted to continue on the threat of normalization of credit losses? And you guys have - I guess your guidance is implying that branded cards and retail services get back to more normalized levels by year-end, which is a decent sized uptick over the levels you had in the third quarter. So I kind of want to know what's driving that view? But more importantly, I guess what does that imply going forward? And does it imply that we get to more - something more like above-trend losses? Because I would think we still have some seasoning to go in the late 2021 and 2022 vintages. And not only that, we're talking about this in an environment where we still have pretty extraordinary labor market. So if you could just give us a little bit more color on just your expectations on credit losses and whether there's maybe a little bit more risk than we're thinking in terms of losses trending to something that is a bit higher than what we normally - what are more normalized levels? Mark Mason : Yes. So let me start and that and Jane, if you want to chime in, that's fine. I think what I'd point you to is Page 24 in the deck that we have because it gives you a nice snapshot of how both the loss rates have been trending, but also how the delinquencies have been trending. And you can see that the delinquencies have been trending up, and that kind of gives us a good indication of where loss rates are likely to trend in the next quarter or so. And so at 2.72 unbranded cards and 4.53 on retail services, we can see that we're likely to end up at about that normalized rate by the end of the year, getting up to the 3% to 3.25%, 5% to 5.5% pre-COVID normalized NCL rates. Our expectation is that as we go into '24, to the point that you've made, depending on the macro environment, we're likely to see this tick up above those pre-COVID normalized rates. As we see a slowdown in the economy, again, subject to what the macro looks like before then kind of settling down at some point down the path. And so yes, we do see that tick up. This is, again, as advertised, so to speak, as we would have expected. And we have reserves, significant reserves for both of these portfolios to account for those loss expectations. So in branded cards, we sit with an ACL to loan reserve of 6.3% in retail services we have 11% and Jane mentioned earlier that the losses in retail services ultimately get shared with partners. And so while we would expect this to normalize and mature, so to speak, we feel very well reserved for what that might look like. Jane Fraser : And our portfolio [technical difficulty] old Citi. It's very different in terms of our consumer credit exposure. And I think what you're hearing from us is, this is - this should all be very manageable. We're not there's no alarm bells going off at Citi around this. We're being prudent. We're being conservative around pieces and responsible on it. But there's no alarm bell ringing. And I think there may be a bit of a disconnect from some of the questions out there versus how we're feeling. We're just not seeing the data that is overly concerning. It's manageable. This is all very manageable, and we're being prudent about it as you'd expect us to be. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Thanks for the follow-up. From your initial answer, Jane, I hear you with the restructuring, deconstructing city to global lines, delayering of management and decluttering reporting, and when you add it all together, we'll get some numbers in January. But as it relates to your return targets and efficiency targets for 2025 and 2026, consensus is about one-third below what you target. And frankly, I have not spoken to one investor who thinks you're going to get those targets and maybe you would want to revise those lower in some way or maybe to be determined? Or what's your degree of conviction of getting to those targets or at least getting above your cost of capital? Thank you. Jane Fraser : Yes. Look, we remain confident around our ability to hit these targets. We've got - you heard me talk earlier around the revenue growth and what are some of the tailwinds that we've got behind us as well as the core strategy and the drivers that we're in control of and that we've been investing behind to achieve. So our strategy is unchanged. We're confident it will drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5%. It's not the primary purpose, but the org simplification is the third driver of the expense reductions that we've talked about. And I would also say that, when you look at revenue expenses and the targets we've laid out at Investor Day, we've certainly had plenty of headwinds in macro regulatory geopolitics in the last couple of years, we have delivered. And we - on what we said we would do in the revenue and the expense guidance on the strategy. We've made adoptions along the way as we've needed to. But I think that's the piece that we're also really trying to drive into the firm as a culture. We will do what we say we will do, and we'll adapt accordingly to different areas. Mark talked about adapting to the capital requirements, depending what they are. We have other levers that we can pull, capital allocation, management buffer DTA. But my message to our investors is we're just building a proof point. This is a relentless execution. Look at that strategy scorecard page at the beginning of the deck there. We've achieved a lot and there is a lot going on, and we're getting a lot done. We don't pretend we're at the end of the road there with yet. But we're getting done what we said we do and building up those proof points so that you can see us achieve those return targets. Anything to add Mark? Mark Mason : As you said, building credibility and being transparent, right? Jane Fraser : Yes. Mark Mason : So we're going to keep delivering on the proof points, and we're going to be transparent about how and when and how we're going to achieve it so. Operator : And our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Mark, you mentioned in the credit section that the delinquencies are rising and as a percentage of loans, they're still very low. I was just curious on the corporate loans in North America, there was an uptick. Again, I know relative to the portfolio, it's not that big. But anything in particular you can share with us in that area? Mark Mason : On the corporate loans, we saw loss. I think losses were $51 million in the quarter. So a small amount. We did see an uptick, as you point out in the reserves. That was really driven by some country rating adjustments that were made. And then we did see an increase in the NALs, the nonaccrual loans. That was really one or two names and one in North America, one in EMEA. Both of them are current, but they drove the uptick that we saw in the quarter there.

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Hello and welcome to Citi's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. Today's call will be hosted by Jenn Landis, Head of Citi's Investor Relations. We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jennifer Landis : Thank you, operator. Good afternoon and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter 2023 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser, and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jenn, and a very Happy New Year to everyone, and I hope you all had a good break. At Citi, we're back at it. And given the notable items and our new financial reporting structure, we've got a lot to cover today, so I'm going to get right to it. 2023 was a foundational year in which we made substantial progress, simplifying Citi and executing the strategy we laid out at Investor Day. With that said, the fourth quarter was clearly very disappointing. Today, I'm going to provide a high-level view on our progress in 2023, discuss our Q4 results and finish with our priorities for '24. We know that 2024 is critical as we prepare to enter the next phase of our journey and we are completely focused on delivering our medium-term targets and our transformation. So turning to what we accomplished in terms of executing our strategy. As you can see on slide five, in 2023, we saw a record year for services where we maintained our number one ranking amongst large institutions in TTS, with client wins up 27% and a sustained win-loss rate above 80%. We've now gained over 100 basis points in share and security services since 2021. In wealth, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets during the year. In USPB, we enjoyed our sixth consecutive quarter of growth and we began to see the early fruits of our investments in key talent in banking. In September, we began the most consequential series of changes to the organization and the running of our firm since the aftermath of the financial crisis. We restructured around five core interconnected businesses to align our organization to our business strategy and to provide greater transparency into their performance. You can now see in our financials, the full year returns and P&L by business. While they are all impacted by investments and transformation expense, it is clear where we have work to do. The simplification of our organization structure will conclude at the end of the first quarter and will result in over $1 billion of run rate saves from the net elimination of approximately 5,000 roles mainly managers. As Mark will detail, this will contribute to the reduction of our expenses in '24. Over the medium term, between simplification, benefits of the transformation, stranded costs and other productivity efforts, we expect to eliminate 20,000 positions ex-Mexico, resulting in over $2 billion in run rate saves. Simplification is also enabling Citi to be more client-focused and less bureaucratic. Realizing the synergies between our five businesses is one of the key drivers to achieving our medium-term revenue target. With this new structure, I'm holding my business leaders accountable for enhancing connectivity across clients and products. In addition, having a Chief Client Officer Act to ensure we're disciplined in bringing the full power of our franchise to our clients. We have now completed the divestitures of nine of our 14 international consumer franchises and have wound down nearly 70% of our total retail loans and deposits in Russia, Korea and China. We've restarted the sales process in Poland and a well down the execution path for the Mexico IPO next year. We're exiting marginal businesses such as munis and a subset of distressed debt trading to focus on our core strengths and allocate our capital with rigor. And without doubt, all these changes are difficult, if they are necessary. At the same time, we continue to invest in our transformation, risk and control environment and data architecture. And we were pleased to have closed the FX consent order with the Federal Reserve. We're committed to fulfilling the expectations of our regulators, given the unique role we play in the global financial system. The modernization of our tech infrastructure is proceeding at pace, allowing us to deliver new capabilities to our clients. During the year, we consolidated trading and reporting platforms and retired 6% of our legacy applications for the second year in a row. These enhancements dovetail with significant investments in our businesses such as hiring commercial bankers to capture share, improving the digital payment capabilities we offer throughout our global network and automating processes for our security services clients. It was also a year where we upgraded talent with key internal promotions supplemented by selective external hires, including Andy Sieg. The simplified reporting structure has been embraced by colleagues. We're feeling empowered by the new structure to serve clients and drive value for shareholders. While Mark will go through the details, I'd like to level set on our disappointing fourth quarter before recapping the full year's results. Earlier this week, we disclosed additional external headwinds, some of which materialized in the second half of December, including a $1.3 billion reserve build related to transfer risk stemming from exposures to Argentina and Russia. We also saw a nearly $900 million negative revenue impact as a result of the larger-than-expected devaluation of the Argentine currency. These items, together with the $1.7 billion FDIC assessment, drove this quarter to a negative EPS of $1.16. And while these items are clearly very painful, they are quite idiosyncratic in nature and will not impact the course we have set. In terms of the performance of our five businesses, while services was the most impacted by the Argentine devaluation. The underlying growth remains very strong, driven by share gains and client wins. Overall, services revenues were up 16% for the full year despite the impact of the Argentine devaluation. In TTS, cross-border transactions were up 15% and AUC, AUA in Security Services were up by close to $3 trillion for the year. In markets, our fixed income results were disappointing as we saw a significant slowdown in December, particularly in rates and FX. Markets was also impacted by the Argentine devaluation. This franchise is well positioned with our corporate clients, and we continue to take actions to improve returns, whether by redeploying capital to high-returning products or exiting products, which aren't a strategic fit. We had a decent quarter in equities, particularly in derivatives and we saw growth in prime balances, an area we have been focusing on. Well activity picked up in the fourth quarter with revenues up 22%. Overall banking revenue continued to be impacted by a weak wallet globally. Investment banking was up slightly for the year and we finished 2023 as the fifth leading franchise. We certainly aspire to be better. We're seeing improved confidence among CEOs and we like our pipeline, but of course, the timing for a robust recovery is uncertain. The share gains we've made in areas such as health care put us in a good position when this business turns more decisively. While investment activity in Asia rebounded with quarterly revenues up 21% and Wealth at Work up 18% for the year. Overall, wealth revenues were down in 2023 and we fully recognized that this business isn't where it needs to be. Andy is off to a fast start. In addition to resetting the expense base and ensuring the right utilization of our balance sheet is tightening our focus to build fee-based revenue streams and investment AUM. With $100 trillion in new wells to be created by 2030 mainly in North America and Asia and with our clients holding $5.4 trillion away from us, we have an important affinity here to drive growth and return to where they should be. USPB was a bright spot with every product up double-digits in the quarter compared to last year, including retail banking, which benefited from a rebound in mortgage origination new and refreshed products have increased customer engagement as we see the benefits of the investments we've made and in Cards, IB and ANR continued their growth reflecting a more balanced lend versus spend mix and falling payment rates. As expected, loss rates are now back to pre-pandemic levels driven by customers in the lower FICO bands. In terms of the full year in 2023, we grew revenues ex-divestures by 4%, although the Argentine devaluation essentially prevented us from reaching the $78 billion revenue mark. We met our full year expense guidance and we increased our CET1 ratio to 13.3% during the year. We grew our tangible book value per share by 6% to $86.19 and we returned $6 billion in capital to our shareholders in the form of common dividends and share buybacks. We remain committed to continuing to return capital to investors through both of these channels. As I reflect on the year, I also want to note that we were a source of strength for the system and for clients during a volatile period for the banking sector and geopolitically and I'm very proud of how our people around the world performed during challenging times. 2024 looks to be similar to 2023 in terms of the macro environment with moderating rates and inflation. We expect to see growth slowing globally with the US well positioned to withstand a run-of-the-mill recession should one materialize. With a strong balance sheet, ample liquidity and diligent risk management we are well positioned to support our clients through whatever environment comes to path. Moreover, we think environments like these play to our strengths, given how far we are down the path of our simplification and divestitures. 2024 will be a turning point as we will be able to completely focus on the performance of our five businesses and our transformation. I recognize the importance of this year and I am highly confident that we will see the benefits of the actions we've taken through the momentum of our businesses. Backed by investments in key products we believe we can continue to grow revenues ex-divestitures by 4% to 5% over the medium term. Overall, we remain confident in our ability to adapt to the evolving capital and macro environment to reach our medium-term return targets and return capital to our shareholders whilst continuing the investments needed in our information. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. We have a lot to cover on today's call. I'm going to start with the fourth quarter and full year firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons, unless I indicate otherwise. I'll also focus on our guidance for 2024 and end with the path to our medium-term return target. The presentation of our results reflects the changes we've made in conjunction with our organizational simplification, including reporting legacy franchises and corporate other in all other. However, before I go into the results, let me walk you through some of the notable items that impacted the quarter that were included in the 8-K we recently filed. At the top right of slide seven, we show these items on a pre-tax basis. The FDIC special assessment of approximately $1.7 billion related to regional bank failures in March. This impacted expenses in all other. A restructuring charge of approximately $780 million related to actions associated with our organizational simplification, which will drive headcount reductions and future savings over the medium term, impacted expenses in all other the impact of the currency devaluation in Argentina of approximately $880 million. This was recorded in noninterest revenue across services, markets and banking and you can see the impact by business in the appendix of the presentation. While we did have an adverse impact from the Argentina devaluation this quarter, we also benefited from high interest rates, earning approximately $250 million of NII on the net investment in the quarter given the hyperinflationary environment and a reserve build of $1.3 billion related to increases in transfer risk associated with exposures to Russia and Argentina as described in the 8-K. This impact is mostly included in other provisions and cost of credit and spans multiple businesses due to their globality. The combination of these items negatively impacted diluted EPS by approximately $2 and RoTCE by approximately 920 basis points. Now turning to the left side of the slide where we show our financial results for the full firm. In the fourth quarter, we reported a net loss of $1.8 billion and a net loss per share of $1.16 on $17.4 billion of revenue. Excluding the notable items, diluted EPS would have been $0.84 with an RoTCE of 4.1% for the quarter. In the quarter, total revenues decreased by 3% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, revenues increased 2% driven by strength across services, USPB and investment banking, partially offset by lower revenues in markets and wealth and the revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to expenses, we reported expenses of $16 billion, which include the FDIC special assessment and modest divestiture-related costs. Excluding these items, expenses increased 10% to $14.2 billion, largely driven by the restructuring charge I just mentioned. Cost of credit was approximately $3.5 billion. Excluding the reserve bill for transfer risk, cost of credit was primarily driven by card net credit losses, which are now at pre-COVID levels as well as ACL builds for new card volume. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves, with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. And on a full year basis, we delivered $9.2 billion of net income and an RoTCE of 4.9%, adjusting for the notable items, net income was approximately $13.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.3%. On slide eight, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2023. It is important to highlight that in conjunction with the change to align with our new financial reporting structure, we moved the majority of the financing and securitization business from banking to markets. We also implemented a revenue-sharing arrangement within banking and between banking, services and markets to reflect the benefits of businesses get from our relationship-based lending. These changes are now reflected in our results and our historical financials. Now looking at the full year numbers. Services had a record year with revenues of $18.1 billion, up 16%, benefiting from both rates and business actions, new client wins and deepening with existing clients, partially offset by the Argentina devaluation. Markets revenues decreased 6% to $18.9 billion, largely driven by lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December. The markets business was also impacted by the Argentina devaluation. Banking revenues decreased 15% to $4.6 billion, primarily driven by the mark-to-market on loan hedges as well as a decrease in corporate lending. Investment banking revenues were relatively flat for the year as we gained share amidst the declining wallet. Corporate Lending revenues were down 4%, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges. Wealth revenues decreased 5% to $7.1 billion, primarily due to the deposit mix shift towards higher-yielding products, which drove lower deposit spreads. USPB revenues increased 14% to $19.2 billion, primarily driven by growth in card balances as we continue to see the benefit of our investments in digital acquisition and customer engagement. Total revenues, excluding divestitures, came in at $77.1 billion, below our guidance of $78 billion to $79 billion for the year, largely due to the impact of the Argentina devaluation, softer markets performance, particularly in December and losses on loan hedges. However, NIIX ex-markets came in at $47.6 billion in line with our guidance. Despite the challenging environment and the impact of the Argentina devaluation, we grew firm-wide revenues by approximately 4% ex-divestitures in line with our Investor Day target, demonstrating the benefit of our diversified business model and the investments we've been making. On slide nine, we show full year expense trends from 2021 to 2023, excluding the FDIC special assessment and divestiture-related impacts, full year expenses were $54.3 billion for 2023 in line with our guidance. As I mentioned, this includes roughly $780 million of restructuring costs associated with our organizational simplification and additional severance costs of approximately $730 million, which included actions to address stranded costs and start to right-size the businesses. Relative to the prior year, expense growth continued to be driven by transformation and business-led investments, volume-related expenses and other investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by productivity savings and a reduction in expenses and legacy franchises within all other. Over the past few years, we've been investing across these themes, which has not only impacted the performance of the firm, but also the businesses. On slide 10, we show the components of our transformation and technology spend from 2021 to 2023. Over the past three years, we have invested significantly in our infrastructure, platforms, applications, processes and data. As you can see in the bar chart at the top of the slide, roughly 30% of our transformation investments over the last three years were in technology, with the remainder related to non-tech employees and consultants. In 2023, we've seen a shift from consulting expenses to technology and compensation as we've gotten deeper into the execution of our transformation. And you should expect to see this trend continue. In total, we invested over $12 billion in technology in 2023. Beyond transformation, our technology investments are also focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience enhancements and areas that support our infrastructure like cloud and cyber. On slide 11, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. Across branded cards and retail services, approximately 80% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 680 or higher. And across both portfolios, NCL rates have reached pre-COVID levels, but we continue to be well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 7.7%. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of nonaccrual loans at 63 basis points of total corporate loans. We feel good about the quality and mix of our portfolio and are well reserved for the current environment. As it relates to Argentina, we've included a slide in the appendix summarizing the value it brings to the global network and the broader institutional client relationships we hold as well as the strength of our financial profile in Argentine. As it relates to Russia, we've also included a slide in the appendix. You will see that the reserves for transfer risk that we have taken have significantly reduced our net investment and therefore our risk of loss related to Russia. On slide 12, we show our summary balance sheet and key capital liquidity metrics. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion balance sheet, which is funded in part by a well-diversified $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is deployed into high-quality diversified assets. The majority of our deposits, $801 billion, are institutional and operational in nature and span across 90 countries and are complemented by $426 billion of US personal banking and wealth deposits. We have approximately $561 billion of HQLA and approximately $690 billion of loans and we maintained total liquidity resources of $965 billion. Our LCR decreased modestly to 116% and our tangible book value per share was $86.19, up 6%. On the bottom left corner of the slide, we show a full CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers in 2023. First, we generated $8 billion of net income to common, which added 70 basis points. Second, we returned $6.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 53 basis points. Third, we benefited from the impact of lower rates on our AFS investment portfolio, which drove an increase of 20 basis points. And finally, the remaining three basis points was largely driven by higher RWA, partially offset by capital releases from the exit markets. We ended the quarter with a 13.3% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 100 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. As you can see, we've grown our CET1 ratio by approximately 30 basis points over the course of the year while returning over $6 billion to shareholders in common dividends and repurchases. Before I take you through each business, as Jane mentioned, we are not satisfied with the performance and returns of our businesses. And therefore, we are laser-focused on executing against our strategy, simplifying the organization and rightsizing the expense base. As a reminder, the investments that we've been making have impacted each of the businesses, as you will see in the next few slides. So now turning to slide 13, where we show the results for services for the fourth quarter and the full year. Revenues were up 6% this quarter, largely driven by NII across TTS and security services, partially offset by NIR, driven by the Argentina devaluation. Services noninterest revenues were up 20%, excluding the impact of the Argentina devaluation. Expenses increased 9%, primarily driven by continued investments in technology, product innovation and client experience. Cost of credit was $646 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $652 million primarily associated with transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Net income decreased to $776 million as higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and higher expenses. Average loans were up 6%, primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisition and deepening with existing clients. However, sequentially, deposits were up 1%. Services delivered an RoTCE of 13.4% for the quarter. And for the full year, services delivered an RoTCE of 20% on $18.1 billion of revenue. On slide 14, we show the results for markets for the fourth quarter and the full year. Markets revenues were down 19% versus a strong quarter last year, driven by a decline in fixed income and the impact of the devaluation, partially offset by an increase in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased by 25% largely driven by rates and currencies on lower volatility and a significant slowdown in December as well as the impact of devaluation. However, we saw a good underlying momentum in equities with revenues up 9%, driven by gains across all products and we continue to grow prime balances while making solid progress on our revenue to RWA targets. Expenses increased 8%, driven by investments in transformation and risk and controls and volume-related costs, partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $209 million, driven by a reserve build of approximately $179 million, primarily associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. Markets reported a net loss of $134 million as revenues were more than offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit. Average loans increased 4% to $115 billion as we saw increased client demand for credit driving growth in warehouse lending. Average trading assets increased 18% to $391 billion, largely driven by treasuries and mortgage-backed securities, given the strong client activity in fixed income for much of the year. While it was a challenging quarter, markets performed relatively well for the full year with revenue of $18.9 billion and an RoTCE of 7.4% compared with very strong performance in the prior year and we are focused on improving returns over time through a combination of revenue growth, expense discipline and capital optimization. On slide 15, we show the results for banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. Banking revenues increased 22%, driven by growth in investment banking fees and lower losses on loan hedges, partially offset by lower corporate lending revenue. Investment banking revenues increased 27% year-over-year, driven by DCM and advisory due to improvements in market sentiment. In advisory, we saw signs of strength across technology, health care and energy, and we feel good about the strength of our pipeline. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges decreased 26%, largely driven by lower revenue share from investment banking services and markets. Expenses increased 37%, primarily driven by the absence of an operational loss reserve release in the prior year. Excluding the reserve release, expenses were roughly flat. Cost of credit was $185 million, driven by a reserve build associated with the transfer risk in Russia and Argentina. The NCL rate was 32 basis points of average loans and we ended the quarter with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 1.6%. Banking reported a net loss of $322 million as higher expenses and cost of credit more than offset higher revenue. RoTCE was negative 6% for the quarter. And for the full year, banking reported an RoTCE of negative 0.2% on $4.6 billion of revenue. So clearly, we have more work to do on returns. And while it's difficult to predict when activity will normalize, we're positioning the business to capitalize on the rebound in the market wallet, and that includes continuing to invest in key growth areas, upgrading talent in traditional sectors and continuing to right-size the business. On slide 16, we show the results for wealth for the fourth quarter and the full year. Wealth revenues decreased 3%, driven by lower deposit spreads, partially offset by lower mortgage funding costs and higher investment fee revenues. We're seeing good momentum in noninterest revenue, which was up 13% in the fourth quarter, driven by higher investment assets, increased client activity and market performance. Expenses were up 4%, primarily driven by investments in risk and controls and technology, partially offset by replacing strategic investments and tighter expense control as we begin to right-size the expense base in the business. Wealth reported a net income of $5 million as revenues were mostly offset by higher expenses. Client balances increased 6%, primarily driven by higher client investment assets, partially offset by lower deposit balance. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 2%, reflecting the continued mix shift of deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by new acquisitions and the benefit from higher market valuation, and we're seeing good momentum in net new assets, which more than doubled to $16 billion for the quarter. For the full year, we added an estimated $21 billion in net new assets. RoTCE was 0.1% for the quarter. And for the full year, RoTCE was 2.6% on $7.1 billion of revenue. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns in the business as we invest in talent to execute on our refocused strategy to drive investment revenue with an eye towards rightsizing the expense base. We will wind down non-core initiatives, exit less productive performers and enhance discipline across every expense line. On slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and the full year. US Personal Banking revenues increased 12%. Branded cards revenues increased 10%, driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balances growth of 13% and we continue to see healthy growth in new account acquisition up 8% and spend volumes up 3%. Retail services revenues increased 15% also driven by higher net interest margin and interest-earning balance growth of 11% as well as lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses. Retail banking revenues increased 15%, driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth and improved mortgage margins. Expenses decreased 1% as higher expenses to support lending programs and client engagement as well as the rollout of simplified banking were offset by lower non-volume-related expenses. Cost of credit of $2.1 billion, increased 20%, driven by higher NCLs, partially offset by a lower ACL build. Net income increased to $201 million, driven by higher revenues, partially offset by higher cost of credit. Average deposits decreased 5%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. We continue to make progress against our digital strategy with digital deposits up 14% and active digital users increasing 6%. RoTCE for the quarter was 3.6%. And for the full year, US Personal Banking delivered an RoTCE of 8.3% or $19.2 billion of revenue. Here again, we are focused on improving the return profile of the business. Managing through this part of the credit cycle and continuing to make progress in retail banking will be key. On slide 18, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 17%, driven by a decrease in NII of 29% driven by the closed exits and wind down, partially offset by higher noninterest revenue and expenses increased to $4.5 billion, driven by the FDIC special assessment and restructuring costs, partially offset by lower expenses in both wind down and exit markets. Turning to slide 20, as we kick off 2024, the environment remains somewhat uncertain and markets remain difficult to predict. But based on what we see today, we expect revenues to be approximately $80 million to $81 billion, as shown on the left side of the slide. And on the right side of the slide, we list the key drivers. In TTS, we expect revenue growth to be driven by new client wins, deepening with our existing clients and continued momentum with commercial clients as we continue to leverage our global footprint and product innovation. In Security Services, we have a very healthy pipeline, and we'll continue to on-board assets under custody from new mandates, win new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. In Investment Banking, we anticipate a rebound in activity and to maintain our position as the wallet recovers. Over time, we do expect the investments that we've made in key growth areas, such as health care and technology to allow us to gain share. And we also expect a modest rebound in wealth as we execute on our refocused strategy with an eye towards growing investment fees, particularly with our existing clients. In USPB, we expect continued growth in card balances driven by the investments we've been making as well as lower partner payments in retail services to continue to drive revenue growth. We also expect to continue to improve our retail brand performance. And as it relates to NII, excluding markets, we expect net interest income to be down modestly as the volume growth we expect from loans and deposits is more than offset by lower US rates and the reduction from the closed exits and wind down. Turning to slide 21. We expect expenses to be approximately $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, down from $54.3 billion, subject to volume-related expenses. The decrease in expenses will be driven by the benefits of our organizational simplification, a continued reduction from exit markets and wind down and productivity savings partially offset by investments in risk and controls and volume-related expenses. Embedded in this guidance, includes an elevated level of severance as well as additional potential costs related to the organizational simplification totaling approximately $700 million to $1 billion. This will contribute to reducing headcount over 2024 and the medium term, which we will discuss on the next slide. On slide 22, we show the drivers of headcount and expense reduction over the medium term. As we've discussed in the past, there are three drivers that will reduce our expenses, organizational simplification, including the reduction of management layers, eliminating stranded costs as we take additional actions to reduce excess overhead in light of the exit markets and realizing productivity savings from our investments in the transformation and technology. We expect the combination of these three drivers to reduce our headcount by a net 20,000, excluding Mexico and generate a net run rate save of $2 billion to $2.5 billion over the medium term. This will underpin our path to $51 million to $53 billion of expenses, subject to volume-related expenses. Both the headcount and expense reduction will allow us to right-size the firm and businesses to improve performance and returns. On slide 23, we show our outlook for US Cards in 2024. In terms of credit performance, based on the trends that we're seeing, we expect NCL rates both in branded cards and retail services portfolios to rise above pre-COVID levels and peak in 2024. On a full year basis for 2024, we expect the branded card's NCL rates to be in the range of 3.5% to 4% and the retail services NCL rate to be in the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. From an allowance perspective, we are reserved for a weighted eight quarter average unemployment rate of almost 5%, which embeds a downside scenario of approximately 6.8%. ACL builds in 2024 will primarily be a function of the volume growth that we see as well as changes in the macro scenarios and the probabilities associated with them and we expect continued momentum in cards, albeit more in line with mid-single-digit loan growth. On slide 24, we summarize our medium-term targets. From a revenue perspective, we continue to expect 4% to 5% revenue CAGR in the medium term, including the ongoing reduction of revenue from the closing of the exits and the wind down. From an expense perspective, we're now on the path to lowering our expenses beginning in 2024. From a credit perspective, we expect credit costs to be a function of portfolio mix, volumes and macro assumptions. And we are committed to returning capital to our shareholders and, in fact, expect to do a modest level of buybacks in the first quarter of 2024. So to wrap it up, while the world has changed significantly and the components have shifted since Investor Day, our strategy has not, and we are confident we are on the right path to deliver our 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Okay. Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. I looked in detail at the earnings presentation, especially slide four. And I think the question is on many people's minds. I count 12 restructurings at Citigroup. And I count 12 restructurings that have failed at Citigroup. You might disagree with the number 12. It could be five, it could be eight, it could be 12. It could be more, but I've not spoken to one person of any investor who would say that Citi has succeeded on its prior restructuring. So the question is, why is this time different? Number one, who is this new and improved Citigroup? Number two, why are expenses down even more, especially when few people that I talk to think you'll hit your revenue target. And three, Jane, what is your conviction level of getting to that 11% to 12% RoTCE in '25 or '26? Thank you. Jane Fraser : Well, thank you very much indeed, Mike. I'll start with who is Citi. Citi is I'm delighted to say finally simple. At Investor Day, I set out a vision to be the preeminent banking partner for clients cross-border needs. That vision was based on five core interconnected businesses. We set out on a deliberate path to get there. And over the last three years, we've done so. Page four is who we are today. We are five interconnected businesses. No more, no less. We have our organization now aligns with those five businesses, and this enables us to focus on two priorities. The first is improving the performance and the returns of those five core businesses, so that we can meet the medium-term RoTCE target we laid out. And the second is on addressing our regulatory issues through the transformation. And I would also be I need to note that I fully recognize that 2024 is an inflection year, Mike. And I and the management team are accountable to deliver and that you and our investors have the transparency need to hold us accountable. So why is this time different? Look, it's not lost on me that there have been many attempts in the past to change this firm. I and the management are fully committed to transforming this company for the long-term and we are addressing the issues that have held us back in the past. And you've got proof points of the last three years where we've made a lot of tough decisions, and we have put through a tremendous amount of change to get to the simple Citi that we are today. We completely reset our strategy. So we now have a significantly more focused business and operating model. We've announced the most consequential set of changes to our organizational model. And frankly, from my perspective, more importantly, how we run the bank, since the financial crisis aimed at simplifying the bank and increasing accountability. You've seen we've moved quickly. We're on track with our execution of this effort and it will generate over $1 billion of run rate saves at the end of the first quarter, purely from the organization efforts that we put in, that we announced in September. We've done this while investing and I think this is another difference. We've invested heavily in our transformation. And while that was capitalized by our consent orders, these investments will ultimately deliver benefits from automation from well governed data from consolidated platforms. We also have made significant investments in our business to support the 4% to 5% revenue growth and to ensure client momentum. And those investments have helped us expand our product suite, invest in digital capabilities, automate our processes, capture synergies through a client organization. We've also brought in some incredible external talent in key strategic areas, including Andy to lead wealth, and we now have a good balance between experienced Citi people and external talent with fresh perspectives through multiple layers of the organization. So we are doing things the right way. We're doing it for the long-term and we're moving with urgency. We will need and are spending the money that we need to, to address our regulatory requirements, but that's already embedded in our path to the 11% to 12% RoTCE in the medium term. And this already feels like a different bank. We have more work to do. I recognize '24 is a critical year. And as I said, the decks are much clearer now so that we can focus on two imperatives, improving our business performance and executing the transformation. Neither is an entirely linear path as we've seen over the last three years. We all know that. We get, we have to build our credibility. We're committed to doing so and we are providing far more transparency around the business performance, so investors have a better sense of how we're doing, and I and my management team, to your final question, are fully accountable for getting this all done, we will. Mark, expenses? Mark Mason : Yeah. Thanks, Jane. And why are expenses down more? I think, to your point, Jane, we've been investing in the franchise, both on the front end and importantly on the transformation and the risk and controls. What I would point out is that in 2023, we delivered expenses of $54.3 billion, ex the FDIC charge. That is the guidance that we gave. But I'd also highlight that we also included $780 million associated with the restructuring charge that is more than I had articulated in the way of guidance. So the capacity that we created through our efforts through the year, we use that in a smart way. We use that to fund the org simplification costs so that we can realize the savings down the line and we're going to continue to manage our expenses in a disciplined and smart fashion. That means spending what we need to spend on the transformation and risk and controls, but driving greater efficiencies and productivities along the way to ensure we get to that 11% to 12%. And to your point of revenues are to come down or come in lower-than-expected, we'll adjust the expenses accordingly. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Glenn Schorr : Hi. Thanks very much. So, you're clearly making a lot of progress, and I hate to like ask this question too early, but I think it is important. Your expense guide is good, your revenue guide is good, and you have your arms around the expenses, so the question I have is, how do you think about balancing that near-term profitability improvement that we all want desperately with making sure you do make the right investments, because if you look around the world, there's a lot of places to grow, whether it'd be your branch network or wealth management aspirations that you have or the digital investments, so how do you -- how do we know that all the right future investments are being made, while you extract costs in all the good ways that you've been doing? Mark Mason : Yeah, thanks, Glenn. I guess, I'll start and Jane, feel free to add in on it. Look, it is a balancing act, right, and we do look at each of our five core businesses. We, obviously, are clear on the strategy, but where is the growth, where the return opportunities associated with them, and how do we ensure we are deploying resources after them in order to deliver for the client and deliver on those returns over time? We have to juxtapose that against the required investments to modernize our operations and we're making those trade-offs on a regular basis. But importantly, when we do invest to capture those growth opportunities, we're agile, we're trying to be agile about it, which means, if those opportunities don't play out in the way we're expecting, because the cycle just doesn't mature or materialize in that fashion, we've got to be disciplined enough to dial them back and that's what you've seen over the past year-plus, is that we've been investing in the business where we didn't see the upside that we anticipated, we dialed back that spend, right, and that's the type of iterative process, if you will, Glenn, that we're putting in place to ensure that on the other side of this we're still positioned to capture growth. Investment Banking, for example, we've invested in healthcare and technology, building out to prepare ourselves for when that market rebounds. We feel good about that. We've done similar things in the way of our wealth business. We are investing heavily in our TTS franchise to ensure we can remain competitive there. So it's that type of discipline that's required. It is sometimes a trade-off, but it's one that we've been very focused on being smart about. Glenn Schorr : I appreciate that. Maybe a quickie on Services, obviously, up 16% in a record, it's great. I don't know if you've dimensionalized how much was rate versus new business, but you have good core business momentum and a pipeline of one, but not yet funded. So I guess the question is that, where can Services be over, let's say, the next two years in terms of growth, while rates come down yet your business is winning new wins? Mark Mason : Yes, sure. Do you want me to? Sure. Jane Fraser : Yeah. And I'll jump in. Let's maybe start with TTS. When we think about the performance of TTS, which, as we say, the growth this year, up 19%, ex-Argentina, came from a combination of both rates and the strong business actions we've taken. And you can see that in the different drivers. Cross-border was up 23%, commercial cards up 8%. And in terms of the growth prospects, we've generated 22% in average revenue growth from '21 to '23, well ahead of the Investor Day guidance we had a high single-digit. That was not just because of the rate cycle. It obviously helped, and we certainly expect to grow revenues at mid-single digit now as we lap the prior periods that benefited from those rate increases. And that's going to come from a few different areas. One, the focus on our fee strategy, where we're capitalizing on strong client engagement, market-leading client solutions, and we're delivering on a lot of the different growth initiatives that we've been investing in across all our client segments. We'll continue optimizing our deposit book and bringing in high-quality deposits. And in a lower rate environment, GDP is typically higher, so you'd expect to see some higher growth in our capital-efficient payment volumes. You'll see us continuing to acquire new clients and deepen relationships with existing clients. And I point to our confidence here 27% increase in our new client acquisition this year and a sustained win-loss ratio of 82% on new deals. And that was across different client segments. And revenues from these clients just continues to ramp up as we expand across the different geographies and product suites with them. And you'll also continue to see us investing in the infrastructure and platforms we've been doing, launching new innovative products, and we're seeing momentum from some of the things we've recently done, Citi Token Services, Payment Express, 24/7 Clearing, et cetera. So I think the main takeaway from TTS is that we'll continue to invest in it. We expect to see strong client momentum. We've been getting consistently good client feedback regarding our capabilities. So we expect to see good global growth that will certainly help as the rate cycle comes down. And it is a crown jewel for a reason. And then just quickly on security services, I think, where we're seeing, we mentioned we've got a number of marquee wins there across all the client segments. That pipeline is both investors and issuers, and one of the core strategies that open put in place was to grow share with the US-based asset managers. We had a very low -- we were at 2.6% share in 2020. We're now at 4.3%. And a lot of the growth in the pipeline has been coming not only from our global network names but also from the marquee players in the US asset manager space. And I think that's our ability to connect our capabilities and that gives these players huge efficiencies for our clients. Mark, anything I've missed there? You know I know this business. Mark Mason : As you said, rightly, so high returning business, great growth prospects. To answer one of your questions, Glenn, about half of the NII growth we could attribute to interest rates and about half, I'd say, is business action, so us working with the clients to drive that momentum. And then if you think about the noninterest revenue for services. They're up about 20% in the quarter year-over-year, if you exclude the impact of the Argentina devaluation and up 7% on a full year basis. And so good momentum in the noninterest revenue growth as well. Operator : Our next question comes from John McDonald with Autonomous Research. Your line is now open. John McDonald : Hi. Good morning. Mark, I was hoping to ask you, how you're thinking about the pacing of capital build? Obviously, the Basel III proposals are out there, but they could change of course, even if they don't change, you have a couple of years to leg into those with the phase-ins and perhaps some mitigation opportunities. How should we think about you kind of building capital, given all of those variables and the ability to buy back some stock along the way as you mentioned earlier? Mark Mason : Yeah, sure. So look, John, obviously the Basel III proposal still out there and under discussion. We've been very vocal about the potential impact of that. We've also been very disciplined about how we've been managing our capital. We've built that over 30 basis points over the course of the year. You've seen us actively manage that through the year. We're going to continue to do that. We obviously, generate earnings that contribute to that. We want to continue to drive growth across the business. We're trading at 0.5 times book, where we can we want to buy back as much as we can in shares and we tried to be disciplined about that over the past couple of quarters doing that as a modest level. You heard me saying -- you heard me say, we're going to do that again this quarter at a modest level. But we're going to be -- we have to be thoughtful about what those headwinds might look like and we're actively working what mitigation actions we have to put in place, should it turn out closer to the way the current proposal sit. So it's an ongoing active management that drives the balance servicing our client needs, with obviously, holding a responsible amount of capital in light of the uncertainty that's out there, and with an eye towards buy backs where we can do that. John McDonald : Okay. And just as an expense follow-up, I wasn't clear. Has the transformation spend peaked when you think about what you'll spend on transformation this year versus last year? And are the transformation benefits starting to kick in at this point? Mark Mason : Yeah. So to be clear, we're going to continue to spend whatever we need to spend on the transformation and on risk and controls. And so we did see a tick up this year. We've got a plan for 2024. And if we've got to spend a bit more than what we spent this year, we're going to spend more. That's what the plan calls for. And so that's what we'll do. That's inside of the number that I've given you for guidance, right? And so that is -- that's important for us. I think it will drive, obviously, operational improvement and saves down the line. It is part of the $2 billion to $2.5 billion, but that is the early stage, if you will, of the transformation spend paying back. I think as we talked about at Investor Day, frankly, we'll continue to see expense benefits beyond the medium term from some of this transformation investment that we've been making. And so I would think of the medium term as the start of the benefits that we'll see from the investments we've been making in transformation and risk and control. Jane Fraser : Yeah, I think, Mark, you're spot on. So we'll continue making the investments we need to in the transformation. It's a multiyear journey as we've always been clear around this, ultimately, with benefits for the shareholders and more of the expense saves that we've been talking about are separate our transformation from sort of the operating expense base of our businesses, which we want to make sure is productive and as effective as possible. And the types of benefits we're seeing, this is second year in a row that we've retired 6% of our legacy platform base. And you've heard me talking about moving 20 of our cash equity platforms onto one, six reporting ledgers on to one, 11 sanction platforms onto one. So we start seeing some of the benefits of those come in. Other things, we automated independent price verification for 90% of our prioritized fixed income and equity securities. That's reduced manual controls. That's improved valuation consistency. That's also had an impact on the efficiency of the business. We've loaded 98% of our prioritized wholesale and consumer data into two authorized repositories that will also begin to start having some benefits for us. So there is a cumulative effect. It is beginning to build now from all the work we've done, but it will take some time to really kick into the, as Mark said, when you really feel it is a few years out, but we'll keep giving you the proof points of things as we're going. So it's not just a trust us, this is coming, you'll begin to see it build. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good afternoon. Mark, maybe just a follow-up on the expense, slide 22, where you talk about $2 billion to $2.5 billion of expense saves. I guess, I'm struggling with the numbers there. I think if you look at exit, and wind down markets you're probably close to $2 billion in numbers there and maybe the stranded costs, you can't get all that out. You're doing about, severance is $700 million to $1 billion in '24, so it doesn't seem like there's a ton of actual cost saves in that number, just maybe I'm wrong, if you could just kind of walk me through the numbers embedded in there and if there is, you've kind of alluded to more to come beyond the intermediate term. Mark Mason : Yeah, I think the thing I'd point out to you is a couple of things. One, obviously we're forecasting revenue growth over this period of time. And so it's going to be volume-related expenses associated with that. The second thing I'd point out, as I just mentioned to the prior question, is that we're continuing to invest in risk and controls and in the transformation over this period of time. And so what you see is, there is an increase in expenses associated with at least those two things and that's offset by the savings that we're starting to generate, particularly from the org simplification that Jane has talked about, as well as from the stranded cost reduction that will continue to play out, as well as from some of the rightsizing of businesses that we've referenced in some of the prepared remarks. And so important to think about their headwinds and tailwinds that kind of net down to this $2 billion to $2.5 billion. And then the final point that I'd make is, if I look at this medium-term number of $51 billion to $53 billion that still has Mexico in it. And in one of the other pages, we point to expenses around Mexico, but because of where we are, will be in the IPO process, that's still going to be part of this expense base. And so, you can't lose sight of that. Jim Mitchell : Well, that's an important clarification that the $2 billion to $2.5 billion includes some revenue-related volume growth. So that's helpful. And then just maybe the other, on the slides talking about revenue targets, one of the big numbers not talked about was markets. How are you thinking volatility has come in, macro picture is getting better, maybe that mutes volatility. How do you think about that business in '24 as it relates to your guidance? Mark Mason : As you know, it's a tough business to forecast, certainly for full year and in some instances for a quarter. And so we basically kind of back that out, but we've assumed markets kind of flat to modestly down, but we've backed it out, and it's roughly flat. Not of the 81 -- not of the 80 to 81, but you see the guidance of NIR ex-markets and NII ex-market. So in the 80 to 81, we've assumed it roughly flat. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good afternoon. I think, Mark, just wanted to -- good morning -- afternoon, Jane. Just wanted to follow-up on something I think Mark said at the end of his very first response around, it's very hard in my seat to figure out whether you're going to grow revenues or shrink revenues given the macro, should we take it based on what you said today, as we look into '26, getting to that 11% RoTCE, if for whatever reason revenue fall short, you feel good about the expense flex to mitigate that headwind. Jane Fraser : Hi. It's Jane. Obviously, I want to just jump in on one bit, which is, we are committed and we're very confident around the 4% to 5% revenue growth rate, and so there isn't any backing away from that number, and that's in various macro environments, et cetera. And as we look across the different businesses and the projections we have, we're confident around that. Obviously, if there is a very adverse macro environment, et cetera, we've got other levers we can take, but Mark, let me pass it to you. Mark Mason : And I by no means was trying to suggest that we weren't confident in the forecast for the top-line. If you think about the strategy and the strength of those five core businesses, we've got a lot of conviction around that. With that said, as you pointed out, Jane, under a circumstance where that doesn't play out, obviously, volume-related incentive comp expenses and the like that would naturally come down, we'd ensure that they came down with the revenue decline or shortfall, and then we'd recalibrate other spend -- other investments spend not related to risk and control and transformation, but other investments across the platform we'd recalibrate accordingly. Ebrahim Poonawala : Perfect. Just what I needed. And one quick question. As we think about rightsizing the Markets business, there's been headlines around the muni and the distressed business that you've gotten out, is there a risk where you the Markets business becomes too small? Any lack the scale to be sort of efficient and relevant in certain just across the breadth of, be it fixed-income or equities, just if you can talk about that? Thank you. Jane Fraser : The short answer is no. We have -- if you think about our Markets business, we have four businesses each of which are around $4 billion or so in size. You have our Global FX network where we're typically number one in any year just given the strength and particularly the corporate client base we set off. Rates, typically top three, together these are two of the largest macro pools within fixed. In terms of the spread products, we've been putting our financing and securitization business as part of our simplification fully within Markets, so that we've created a unified scaled spreads product business. And then finally, equities, where we're focused on improving our prime offering building balances. We still have a way to go obviously in that. Prime balances, we're pleased they were nicely up this year, driven by client momentum, and we are a leading equities derivatives franchise. So you do have these four core businesses and I go back to our big point of differentiation and why we still we feel we're well-positioned, we have a very differentiated corporate client base, and a very strong partnership between our core markets franchise, TTS, and banking, and that -- and security services, and that helps us in FX and commodities and in rates around the world. So, Markets is important, both in terms of its leadership but also how it fits into the strengths that we have from this simplicity of those five core interconnected businesses. We demonstrated solid returns in the past. I think a lot of the actions we've been taking will help drive returns in the future and you should be getting confidence when you see the discipline we're putting onto RWA, 5.3%, getting close that target we set at Investor Day, we're moving that up to 6%. The exits we've got of non-strategic businesses shows our focus on efficiency, and we've also been doing some good investments in our technology and it's getting us into a good place there. So I think don't be concerned about the shrinking, we're just making sure that it really plays to our strengths and we optimize the returns. Operator : Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Gerard Cassidy : Good afternoon, Mark and Jane. Mark Mason : Good afternoon. Jane Fraser : Hey. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, can you share with us on your revenue guide in the net interest income, I know you mentioned this going to be lower and part of it is due to lower interest rates. Some of your peers have come out with their guides using the forward curve in their net interest income forecast, which includes the Fed in our country, six cuts. Can you give us some color what kind of rate environment. I know you said lower rates, but any insights around that guide? Mark Mason : Yeah, I think what I pointed to is in the range of the 81 -- the 80 to 81. We are assuming three to six cuts, right? You got a range there and the reason I describe it like that, excuse me, is that if you think about our IRE, as we've shown it in the Qs before, we are positioned such that with a 100 basis point move parallel shift in rate across the curve, the US dollar impact would only be a couple $100 million, right, and so to the negative, obviously, but it's a couple of $100 million. And so as we think about that forecast, and as I mentioned, NII being down a bit, that covers kind of three to six cuts over the course of 2024, likely back-loaded, but that's what's in there. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. I appreciate that. And then, Jane, more of a qualitative question rather than quantitative. But obviously, there's numerous moving parts of the strategies that you guys are executing on. Exiting businesses, downsizing businesses, especially on the downsizing, I think you guys mentioned the headcount of about 20,000 coming down. How do you keep the morale of the organization elevated when you have these types of tough decisions that you all have to make. Jane Fraser : Yeah, well, we've also got areas which are growing. So that does help to see -- we have a diversified portfolio here. I think we're very mindful of that there is a human impact of the decisions that we're making. We're trying to be as transparent with our people as we are with our investors about what we need to do, why we're doing it, what to expect and laying that out so people understand the logic behind the decisions and then they understand what the decisions are as quickly as they can. I think that's the most humane way to do this. Operator : Our next question comes from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Erika Najarian : Hi. I'm sorry to prolong the call. Thank you for all your color. Just one more question. Jane, when will you feel comfortable giving us a buyback outlook that's beyond just quarter-to-quarter. I know you still have a little bit of ways to go, but you do have a 100 basis point buffer to your minimum, and I know Basel III and game is still out there. And I'm sure that reducing risk just doesn't mean expenses, but also reducing your -- or being mindful of your RWA footprint. And given where your stock is relative to book, when will we be more comfortable about giving sort of a longer-term outlook that was -- that's underpinning your RoTCE target with regards to the buyback? Jane Fraser : Erika, it's a great question. It's one I ask myself every morning when I get up, because it -- given where we trade, the value for our shareholders of buybacks is enormous. And Mark and I are very committed to doing so. We also know that we're building our credibility. And I don't want to say things that we're not going to deliver against although we're going to have to change. I think it's one of the values that we're really trying to adhere to very strongly. And with the NPL, I think we'll get a better sense about this soon. The comment period just got extended and we want to see what that is. I think you've all heard us at the Senate banking hearings with our concerns about it. I very much hope that it is either completely revised or very materially, so it doesn't have a negative impact on the economy and the US banking system competitiveness, the move for more business, the shadow banks, which I think has got to a point, which is not healthy. So we're going to wait and see before -- where that comes out before we give it to you, but I would be asking exactly the same question in your shoes as well. Erika Najarian : Thank you, Jane. I think that it was very helpful that you said on this public forum where you're trying to build credibility because as I think about what long-only investors have been dying to see from Citi in terms of the previous leadership was that sort of awareness. And I think just having that awareness recognition will be very important to investors. So thank you. Jane Fraser : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Matt O'Connor: Hi. I want to follow-up on the Russia exposure on page 34. Looks like you guys have taken a really good whack on the vet investment, and you also highlight how this CTA would be capital neutral you know if you're going to write that down. But what about the remaining exposure and just like how frame -- are you responsible for some of these unremidable corporate dividends. I just don't -- I think a lot of us don't understand that type of exposure? And is there a risk to you going forward? Or did you hope for clear the deck from the fund exposure going forward? Jane Fraser : Yeah. And actually, I also want to kind of take a bigger picture answer to that before I turn it to Mark because I would have thought there's a question that is on everybody's mind, particularly given the firm's overall low level of returns and our headline numbers is this quarter about the -- what we've been doing with Russia and Argentina. So the bigger strategic question behind it, and then we'll get to you on specifics on the Russia front. If you think about Citi, we have a differentiated global business model, and that means we're committed to the countries in which our multinational clients operate over the long run. So that means we hold long-term capital in those countries upon which we generate solid returns through the cycle. And if we just point to our leading services and FX businesses are the heart of that network and they're generating double-digits, as you can see. With that footprint comes a set of risks. So I think in terms of credit currency transferability of capital. And we've proven our ability to manage those risks consistently over a long period of time. And with respect to the Q4 currency and transfer items, while the timing was unknown and we've highlighted those risks in our disclosures for a couple of years. I'd say Russia is rather unique. It's a wall and for us, a highly unusual liquidation. We've navigated it very well. We've executed our wind down in an orderly way with very low losses for our clients and very low losses for us. Our remaining net assets are now 100% reserved against, and I think similarly, if I just touch on Argentina for a minute because I'm sure folks have got a few questions on that. Similarly, over the last several years, we de-risked our business model there. We don't have a consumer bank, so we've really reduced our emerging market exposures to just our institutional presence focused on the multinational clients. You've heard us talk about that and select high-grade local clients. Look at Argentina, it's a very good business for us over the cycle. And even after the impact of Q4, we had less than $5 million in credit losses in Argentina over a 10-year period. That's remarkable, $5 million over 10 years. In terms of the currency risk, we all have to book revenues the official rate versus the parallel market rate. We were able to partially, but not fully hedge the exposure, but we will certainly always take economic decisions on the business we do and did mindful of likely devaluations and capital controls. And the reserve is a reserve, it centers on the ability to convert and transfer capital as per US banking rules. So I just want to put part of the things of this quarter into that context, we have a global business model. It's heavily focused on high-grade multinational clients. Our track record for managing the various risks associated with our global network has been very strong. And I think you're seeing us with a very conservative and a reserve profile. Mark, what would you add? Mark Mason : Yeah, very quickly on the Russia point, as you know and as the slide points out, we continue to bring our exposure down there. It's down to $6.5 billion, it's down 13% from the previous year. And a third from 2021, we brought down the consumer loans, the consumer deposits in a significant way there. And essentially, what's left in -- is that we have a custody business and we are holding corporate dividends that are our clients' proceeds. We're unable to pay those out by law by regulation. And so we have to hold those and that's what's being referenced in the slide where we say unremitdable Russia corporate dividends. And so that is not a risk that -- of loss for us, but we're unable to kind of clear those because of the state of play in Russia at this stage. Matt O'Connor: Okay. That was clear. And then just separately, in credit card, you and a lot of your peers expect losses to go up from here, but most seem to be things that repeat this year, including you. And just what gives you confidence that the card losses will peak this year as you just getting back to that a little bit above normalized level, is it some tightening that you've done? What's driving that confidence looking out this year because there's obviously a step-up coming still, right? Mark Mason : Sure. There's a step-up coming. We give a forecast when '23 as you point out to what the full year estimate for NCLs will be for both branded and for retail services. What I'd point out is you can see actually on the slide how there was a dip in loss rates during the COVID period. And so to some extent, what we're seeing is kind of a catch-up of those as those portfolios go through a longer maturation than what you'd normally see in our cards portfolio. On top of that, we've been originating new card, you've noticed our acquisitions have grown, so we obviously have new card loans and those are going through a much more normal maturation period. And so as we look at kind of the early buckets and the delinquencies that are playing out, we've got a pretty good sense for when we would expect those to peak and at what level. And we think they'll peak inside of '24, so that's captured in that average forecast that we've given. We haven't made material changes to our underwriting. However, there is mix evolution that happens. Transactors, we have a number of transactors that have kind of come on to our portfolio and are in the mix of our branded portfolio as well. And so anyway, those are the drivers that give us confidence and inform the trajectory that we -- that we're talking about here. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Ryan Kenny : Hi. Thanks for taking my question. So I have a question on quantitative tightening. Wondering if you have any early thoughts on how Citi is positioned if the Fed ends Q2 early. Is that a material catalyst for you? And would that help you hit your revenue targets even sooner? Mark Mason : Yeah. Again, I mean, when I think about our interest rate exposure and for US dollar, in particular, we showed it in our last Q, we'll show it in this Q for a 100 basis point move in a parallel shift, we're looking at probably a negative $1.6 billion or so. But important to point out that the US dollar component of that is only a couple of hundred million dollars. Similarly, if rates moved in the other way, positive of 100, there'd be a small movement as it relates to US dollar exposure. So our US dollar exposure is relatively neutral again, assuming a static balance sheet, a parallel shift in the curve. And so we're kind of neutral relative to rates moving in either direction and therefore the impact there. Ryan Kenny : And there's a lot of optimism and debate around capital markets rebound. Are you seeing that? And can you help us update us on investment banking pipeline across M&A, ECM, DCM? Jane Fraser : Yes. We certainly had a much more constructive market environment at the end of '23 interest rate spreads and volatility at most of the year, equity prices are high. And I think we view this as a helpful foundation for activity to accelerate in '24, assuming the tailwinds persist. And speaking of our own pipeline, the breadth, the depth, the quality of it is very sound. It's higher than it was pre-COVID. So when markets are constructive, we expect to move these opportunities forward, and we're hearing a lot more confidence from the CEOs, CFOs around this. And when we're looking at our own side, as you know, we've been investing in some higher growth areas. So we get a good balance between our traditionally strong sectors as well as high-growth areas. And we've been seeing some very good momentum in health care and technology as well as areas of traditional strength, which is energy and industrial. And I think we feel very confident in the recovery in DCM, the beginnings of one in 11. And so cautiously optimistic here. I'm not -- so I wouldn't say that it's going to accelerate enormously and with incredible speed, but I think we're feeling much better about the foundation. Mark, anything you'd add? Mark Mason : I completely agree. Jane Fraser : Yeah. Operator : Our next question comes from Scott Siefers with Piper Sandler. Your line is now open. Scott Siefers : Afternoon, everybody. Thanks for taking the question. Have you all assumed any revenue attrition just related to the reduction in force? And I guess, just broadly, how might that be embedded in the '24 revenue guidance. And I guess just at a top level, maybe just a thought or two on. Jane Fraser : Scott, Sorry, I didn't hear what it was. I think the phone line cut out. The revenue in attrition? Scott Siefers : I'm sorry. Yeah. Just curious if you have assumed any revenue attrition related to the reduction enforce over the coming year or two? Jane Fraser : Okay. No, we haven't. I think a lot of the moves that we've made from the organization simplification. So the 5,000-or-so roles we talked about, they're mainly managerial roles. And they've mainly impacted the functions and the geographies, not nearly so much the revenue from revenue generators. And the other piece is with the client organization, we're actually putting much more time into the hands of our people to drive revenue forward. So I think what we're looking at here is it getting a bit of areas of bureaucracy and where we've been too complicated, where we can drive efficiency whilst preserving our frontline and encouraging them to be as revenue-productive and delivering the full force of the firm to the client. So I'd like to see the opposite actually. Scott Siefers : Okay. Perfect. Thank you. And then, Mark, could you discuss for a second, maybe just broadly the flow of expenses through the year? I know that they should begin to decline toward the end. But what happened between now and then? Do they hold kind of flattish with a core rate, or would there be any normal course of business growth? Mark Mason : I think what I'd say is that you should expect that in the first quarter, we'd likely see an uptick in our total expenses relative to the fourth, in part because, as Jane has mentioned, we anticipate that there'll be more to the org simplification and, therefore, dollars associated with that in Q1. And then from there, I would expect that you'd see a downward trend through the fourth quarter. Scott Siefers : Perfect. All right. Thank you. Mark Mason : Yeah. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question will come from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Jane Fraser : Hi, Vivek. Vivek Juneja : A couple of quick clarifications. On your NII guide, you talked about you're assuming three to six cuts. That's US, I presume. So are you assuming flat unchanged rates outside the US since you're more sensitivity outside? Mark Mason : Modest declines outside, but yes, declines outside as well, but not nearly of the magnitude of what we're talking about in the US. Vivek Juneja : Okay. And then, Jane, to your point about the 20,000 headcount cuts, and I heard you just mentioned 5,000 from managerial positions. Where are the rest 15,000 coming from? Jane Fraser : Let me just -- so let me just be clear about where the ones that we've just done and that we're working on through the organization simplification. So when I think about that effort, it will close at the end of the first quarter, as we said, we're expecting to get about $1 billion of run rate saves from the org simplification work alone. That constitutes about 5,000 heads. We're just about to, at the end of this month, finish Phase III, which will mean the first four layers of the organization have been addressed. That's been a net reduction of about 1,500 managers out of a total of 12,000 roles. So it was about 13%. And these are mainly manager roles, as I talked about earlier. Then when we think about where are other expense opportunities on top of this, as Mark was talking about earlier, I mean, the stranded costs will be completing the elimination of the stranded costs from the divestures, we'll be continuing, and you've seen it been doing that, exiting marginal businesses and hobbies and the like and being very disciplined about that. We've got some businesses where we feel we need to right-size the core expense base. Andy Sieg is going to be kicking off that in Wealth, and you will begin to see some of the impact of that in the first quarter. He's off to a strong start. And then we've got other areas where we'll be creating more utilities. We've got -- still got different fragmented activities across the firm that the organization simplification as highlighted we'll be aggregating those, creating utilities or consolidating some of those different functions. And that is before we get to beginning to get benefits from the transformation where there will be efficiencies that come through. We'll still have areas that we're investing. These are going to be, as we talked about, core business investments, it's going to be expense growth still in the top -- from volume growth that we've got, and we will be investing in our transformation. And all of this is happening over the medium term to get us to the 11% to 12% RoTCE target we talked about. So that 20,000 is -- it's the number that we estimate at the headcount. I don't love thinking headcount and I'm thinking about expenses. I think it's a more meaningful number. So as Mark laid out in his presentation, we've got a net expense saves that we're expecting to achieve in the medium term, and these are the raft of different areas that we will be contributing to it, and we're working hard at it. Operator : Our next question will come from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Steven Chubak : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Really some ticky-tack modeling questions on the revenue side. Does the revenue guidance for the full year include any reduction in credit card late fees? And how large of a contributor is that to revenues overall at Citigroup? Mark Mason : So let's see. So obviously, the proposals out there, and we've factored in what's knowable as it relates to that. We haven't given guidance externally on what that impact is, but we do believe there offsets and mitigants that over time, we'll be able to kind of bring into play. And so long-winded way of saying our revenue forecast does assume some basic level of late-fee adjustment. Steven Chubak : Got it. And just on the earlier comments you made, Mark, around services NII. I am struggling to reconcile the 50-50 NII contribution from rate and volume components just given average loan and deposits were essentially flat year-on-year. NII grew $3 billion it does imply a much larger contribution from rates. I know there's deposit fund transfer pricing and other noise. So I was hoping you can maybe unpack that a little bit further. Mark Mason : I mean there are a lot of factors in there. There's obviously as well the mix as it relates to what we have in the US versus outside of the US. So it's -- there are a number of factors there and probably too much to kind of take you through on the call here, but we're happy to kind of follow-up with you off-line and take you through it. Operator : Our final question comes from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Mike Mayo : Yeah. Just a clarification, when you said medium term in this call as it relates to employee reductions, expense savings, revenue targets and 11% to 12% lastly, does medium term mean by 2026, or does it mean something different? Mark Mason : Yes, it's -- Jane Fraser : 2026. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you. Got it. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Mike. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks. Jennifer Landis : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. If you have any follow-up questions, please contact IR. Have a great day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes the Citi Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. You may now disconnect.",

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you will be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jennifer Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning and thank you all for joining our First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Today, I'm going to touch on the macroeconomic environment before I update you on the progress we're making, and then I'll discuss the quarter. While global economic performance was surprisingly [desynchronized] (ph) last year, the overall story has been consistent of late, one of economic resiliency supported by tight labor markets and the consumer. Growth this year looks poised to slow in many markets, and conditions are generally disinflationary. We're already seeing some Central Banks in the emerging markets starting to cut rates. In the U.S., a soft landing is viewed as increasingly, likely. But we continue to see a tale of two Europe's, with Germany hurt by the weak demand for goods, while southern European countries such as Spain and Greece benefit from stronger demand in services. In Asia, Japan is joining in the [areas of] (ph) bright spot, and China's economy has gained some more traction, although its property market remains a concern. Amidst all these dynamics, we continue to focus on executing against our strategy and delivering the best of Citi to all our stakeholders. I said 2024 will be a pivotal year for us, as we put our business and organizational simplification largely behind us and we focus on two main priorities. The transformation and the performance of our businesses and the firm. Last month marked the end to the organizational simplification that we announced in September. The result is a cleaner, simpler management structure that fully aligns to and facilitates our strategy. We are now more client-centric. We're already seeing faster decision making and a nimbler organization at work. We have clear lines of accountability, starting with my management team. Fewer layers, increased spans of control and frankly much less bureaucracy and needless complexity. It will all help us run the company more efficiently, will enhance our clients' experience and improve our agility and ability to execute. And while reducing expenses wasn't the primary driver of the program, more roles were ultimately impacted than the 5,000 that we discussed in January. We also took a number of other steps to sharpen our business focus and improve returns by right-placing businesses to better capture synergies, exiting certain businesses in markets that just didn't fit with our strategy, and right-sizing the workforce in wealth. As a result of all these combined steps, which include the simplification, we are eliminating approximately 7,000 positions, which will generate $1.5 billion of annualized run rate expense saves. The combination of these actions and the measures we're taking to eliminate our remaining stranded costs will drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in cumulative annualized run rate saves in the medium-term. We are keeping a close eye on the execution of these efforts and overall resourcing to ensure we safeguard our commitment to the transformation. As you know, given its magnitude and scale, the transformation is a multi-year effort to address issues that have spanned over two decades. We've made steady progress as we retire multiple legacy platforms, streamline end-to-end processes, and strengthen our risk and control environment, all of which are necessary not only to meet the expectations of our regulators, but also to serve our clients more effectively. A transformation of this magnitude, well it's never linear. So while we've made good progress in many areas, there are a few where we are intensifying our efforts, such as automating certain regulatory processes and the data related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right and we'll look to self-fund the necessary investments to do so. Turning to the quarter, we had a good start to a pivotal year. We reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, earnings per share of $1.58 and an RoTCE of 7.6% on over $21 billion of revenues. Our revenues were up over 3% year-over-year, excluding divestitures, which was primarily the $1 billion gain from the India consumer sale last year. Our expenses were slightly down quarter-over-quarter, excluding the FDIC special assessments. Services continues to perform well and generate very attractive returns. Revenue was up 8% for the quarter as both businesses won new mandates and deepened relationships with existing clients. Fees were up a pleasing 10% for services year-over-year driven by the investments we've made across our product offering platforms and client experience. In Securities Services, we took share again this quarter, and in TTS, cross-border activity continued to outpace global GDP growth and commercial card spend remained robust. We look forward to diving deeper into these two businesses at our investor presentation on services in June. Markets bounced back from a tough final quarter in \u201823. While revenues were down 7% as lower volatility impacted rates and currencies, that was off a very strong first quarter last year. We saw good client activity in equities and in spread products, where both new issuance and securitization activity were particularly robust. We fully integrated our financing and securitization capabilities within our markets business and we started to see the benefits of having a unified spread product offering for our clients. The rebound in banking gained speed during the quarter, led by near record levels of investment grade debt issuance, as improved market conditions enabled issuers to pull forward activity. And after a bit of a slow start, ECM picked up in the second half of the quarter, notably in convertibles. Our strong performance in both DCM and ECM drove investment banking revenue growth of 35% and overall banking revenue growth of 49%. While M&A revenues are still low across The Street, I was pleased that we participated in some of the significant deals announced in the quarter, such as Diamondback's merger with Endeavor Energy and Catalent\u2019s merger with Nova Holdings. We are cautiously optimistic that we could see a measured reopening of the IPO market in the second quarter in light of improved market valuation. .: As you've seen, Andy continues to form his team and is focused on three areas. First, rationalizing the expense base. Second, turning on the growth engine by focusing on investment revenues. And third, enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. Now these won't happen overnight, but getting these things right will help us get more than our fair share of the $5 trillion of assets that our clients have away from us. And that will help us get our returns to where they need to be in this business in the medium-term. USPB had double-digit revenue growth for the sixth straight quarter. We feel good about our position and our resiliency as a prime lend-centric issuer and are seeing positive momentum across proprietary card and partner card businesses. Healthy spend growth persists in branded cards, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Across both portfolios, increased demand for credit continues to drive strong growth in interest earning balances. And while they're only a small part of our portfolio, we are keeping an eye on the customers in the lower FICO bands. We also continue to see strong engagement in digital payment offerings, such as Citi Pay, as a point-of-sale lending product, which is easily integrated into merchants\u2019 checkout processes. And we are driving more value from our retail branches, as well as getting the expense base right to increase returns there. Our balance sheet is strong across the board, an intentional result of our high quality assets, robust capital and liquidity positions, and rigorous risk management. During the first quarter, we returned $1.5 billion in capital to our common shareholders and that includes $500 million through share buybacks. Our CET1 ratio ticked up to a preliminary 13.5% and we grew our tangible book value per share to $86.67. We have a great franchise around the world with great clients who are served by great colleagues. I'm pleased with where we are and I'm excited about where we're going. With the organizational simplification behind us and a good quarter under our belt, we have started this critical year on the right foot. Now while there will be bumps in the road, no doubt, we will continue to execute with discipline and we are committed to reaching our medium-term targets. With that, I'd like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will both be delighted, as always to take your questions. Thank you. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results focusing on our year-over-year comparisons for the first quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On slide six, we show financial results for the full firm. In the first quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.4 billion, EPS of $1.58, and an RoTCE of 7.6% on $21.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were down 2% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, largely consisting of the $1 billion gain from the sale of the India consumer business, in the prior year, revenues were up more than 3% driven by growth across banking, USPB, and services, partially offset by declines in markets and wealth. Expenses were $14.2 billion, up 7% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts and the incremental FDIC special assessment, expenses were up 5%. Cost of credit was approximately $2.4 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases in wealth, banking, and legacy franchise. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of approximately 2.8%. On Slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. We reported expenses of $14.2 billion, which included the incremental FDIC special assessment of roughly $250 million. Also included in this number are $225 million of restructuring charges, largely related to the organizational simplification. In total, we've incurred approximately $1 billion of restructuring costs over the last two quarters. As part of these actions we expect approximately $1.5 billion of annualized run rate saves over the medium-term related to our headcount reduction of approximately 7,000. In addition to the restructuring, we took approximately $260 million of repositioning costs largely related to our efficiency efforts across the firm, including a reduction of stranded costs associated with the consumer divestitures. The expected savings from these actions will allow us to continue to fund additional investments in the transformation this year. And relative to the prior year, the remainder of the expense growth was largely driven by inflation and volume-related expenses, partially offset by productivity savings. In the remainder of the year, we expect a more normalized level of repositioning, which is already embedded in our guidance. Therefore, you can expect our quarterly expense trend to go down from here in-line with our $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion ex. FDIC expense guidance. On Slide 8, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the first quarter, net interest income decreased by $317 million, largely driven by markets, which resulted in a 4 basis point decrease in net interest margin. Excluding markets, net interest income was relatively flat. Average loans were up $4 billion, primarily driven by loans in spread product in markets, as well as card and mortgage loans in U.S. Personal banking, partially offset by declines in service. And average deposits were up nearly $7 billion, primarily driven by services, as we continue to grow high quality operating deposits. On Slide 9, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics. This quarter we adjusted our FICO distribution to be more aligned with the industry reporting practices and now show our FICO mix using a 660 threshold. Across branded cards and retail services, approximately 85% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And we remain well-reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 8.2% for our total card portfolio. In our corporate portfolio, the majority of our exposure is investment grade, which is reflected in our low level of non-accrual loans at 0.5% of total corporate loans. As a reminder, our loan loss reserves incorporate a scenario-weighted average unemployment rate of approximately 5%, which includes a downside scenario unemployment rate of close to 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 10, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital and liquidity. We maintain a very strong $2.4 trillion high-quality balance sheet, which increased 1% sequentially. Despite this increase, we were able to decrease our risk-weighted assets, reflecting our continued optimization efforts and focus on capital efficiency. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and diversified business model. The foundation of our funding is a $1.3 trillion deposit base, which is well diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits, $812 billion, are corporate and span 90 countries. Most of our corporate deposits reside in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. In most cases, we are fully integrated in our client systems and help them efficiently manage their operations through our three integrated services, payments and collections, liquidity management, and working capital solutions, all of which greatly increased the stickiness of these deposits. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $423 billion, are well diversified across the private bank, Citigold, retail, and wealth at work, as well as across regions and products. Now turning to the asset side. Over the last several years, we've maintained a strong risk appetite framework and have been very deliberate about how we deploy our deposits and other liabilities into high quality assets. This starts with our $675 billion loan portfolio, which is well diversified across consumer and corporate loans. And the duration of the total portfolio is approximately 1.2 years. About one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high quality, short duration investment securities that contribute to our nearly $1 trillion of available liquidity resources. And for the quarter, we had an LCR of 117%. So to wrap it up, we are active and deliberate in the management of our balance sheet, which is reflected in our high-quality assets and strong capital and liquidity position. On Slide 11, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3.1 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $1.5 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of about 13 basis points. Third, we saw an increase in our disallowed DTA, which resulted in a 10 basis point decrease. And finally, the remaining 6 basis point benefit was largely driven by a reduction in RWA. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.5% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 120 basis points, or over $13 billion above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. That said, our current capital requirement does not yet reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation, or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to bring down capital requirements over time. So now turning to slide 12. Before I get into the businesses, let me remind you that in the fourth quarter we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within banking and between banking services and markets to reflect the benefits that businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all-other line for each business in our financial supplement. In services, revenues were up 8% this quarter, driven by continued momentum across both TTS and Securities Services. Net interest income increased 6%, driven by higher deposit and trade loan spreads. Non-interest revenue increased 14%, largely driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers. In TTS, cross-border volumes increased 9%. U.S. Dollar clearing volumes increased 3%, and commercial card spend volumes increased 5%, all of which was driven by strong corporate client activity. In Securities Services, our preliminary assets under custody and administration increased 11% benefiting from higher market valuations, as well as new client onboarding. The growth in both businesses is a direct result of our continued investment in product innovation, the client experience, and platform modernization to gain share across all client segments. TTS continues to maintain its Number One position with large corporate and FI clients, and see good momentum in the commercial client segment, and we continue to gain share in Securities Services. Expenses increased 11%, largely driven by continued investments in technology and product innovation. Cost of credit was $64 million as net credit losses remain low. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion. Average loans were up 4% primarily driven by strong demand for working capital loans in TTS. Average deposits were down 3% as the impact of quantitative tightening more than offset new client acquisitions and deepening with existing clients. However, it is worth noting that we continue to see good operating deposit inflow. And services continues to deliver a high RoTCE of 24.1% for the quarter. On slide 13, we show the results for markets for the first quarter. Markets revenues were down 7% as lower fixed income revenues more than offset growth in equities. Fixed income revenues decreased 10% driven by rates and currencies, which were down 21% on the back of lower volatility and a strong quarter in the prior year. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up 26% driven by an increase in client activity, particularly in asset-backed lending. And we continue to see good underlying momentum in equities, with revenues up 5% driven by growth across cash trading and equity derivatives. And we continue to make progress in prime with balances up more than 10%. Expenses increased 7%, largely driven by the absence of a legal reserve release last year. Cost of credit was $200 million, primarily driven by macroeconomic assumptions related to loans and spread products that impacted reserves. Net income was approximately $1.4 billion. Average loans increased 8%, primarily driven by asset-backed lending and spread products due to an improvement in market activity. Average trading assets increased 4% sequentially, largely driven by seasonally stronger activity in the first quarter. Markets delivered an RoTCE of 10.4% for the quarter. On slide 14, we show the results for banking for the first quarter. Banking revenues increased 49% driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending and lower losses on loan hedges. As I previously mentioned, corporate lending results include the impact of revenue sharing from investment banking, services and markets. Investment banking revenues increased 35% driven by DCM and ECM, as improved market sentiment led to an increase in issuance activity, particularly investment grade, which is running at near record levels. Advisory revenues declined given the low level of announced merger activity last year. However, in the quarter, we participated in the pickup and announced M&A across sectors, including those where we've been investing, such as technology and healthcare. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 34%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage this quarter as expenses decreased 4%, driven by actions taken to right size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $129 million, primarily driven by changes in portfolio composition. The [NPL] (ph) rate was 0.3% of average loans, and we ended the quarter with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of 1.5%. Net income was approximately $536 million. Average loans decreased 6%, as we maintained strict discipline around capital efficiency as we optimized corporate loan balances. RoTCE was 9.9% for the quarter, reflecting a rebound in activity, reserve releases, and continued expense discipline. On slide 15, we show the results for wealth for the first quarter. Wealth revenues decreased 4%, driven by a 13% decrease in NII from lower deposit spreads and higher mortgage funding costs, partially offset by higher investment fee revenue. We're seeing good momentum in non-interest revenue, which was up 11% as we benefited from higher investment assets across regions, driven by increased client activity, as well as market valuation. Expenses were up 3% driven by technology investments focused on risk and controls, as well as platform enhancements, partially offset by the initial benefits of expense reduction as we continue to right-size the workforce. Cost of credit was a benefit of $170 million, driven by a reserve release of approximately $200 million, primarily related to a change in estimate, as we enhanced our data related to margin lending collateral. Net income was $150 million. End of period, client balances increased 6% driven by higher client investment assets. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits decreased 1%, largely reflecting lower deposits in the private bank and Wealth at Work, and the continued shift of deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform, which more than offset the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB. Client investment assets were up 12%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. RoTCE was 4.6% for the quarter. Looking ahead, we're going to improve the returns of our wealth business by executing on our three foundational priorities. As Jane mentioned, this will take time, but over the medium to longer term, we view this as a greater than 20% return business. On Slide 16, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking for the first quarter. U.S. Personal Banking revenues increased 10% driven by NII growth of 8%, and lower partner payments. Branded Cards revenues increased 7%, driven by interest earning balance growth of 10%, as payment rates continue to moderate. And we continue to see healthy growth in spend volumes up 4%, primarily driven by our more affluent customers. Retail services revenues increased 18%, primarily driven by lower partner payments due to higher net credit losses, as well as interest earning balance growth of 9%. Retail banking revenues increased 1% driven by higher deposit spreads, loan growth, and improved mortgage margins. Expenses were roughly flat due to lower compensation costs, including repositioning, offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit of approximately $2.2 billion increased 34%, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic and are now maturing. In branded cards, the NCL rate came in at 3.65%, in-line with our expectations. In retail services, the NCL rate of 6.32% was slightly above the high end of our guidance range for the full year and will likely remain above the range in the second quarter, reflecting historical seasonality patterns. However, given the persistent inflation, higher interest rates, and continued sales pressure at our partners, we now expect to be closer to the high end of the full year NCL guidance range for retail service. This expectation, along with the continued mix shift from transactors to revolvers across both portfolios, led to an ACL build of approximately $340 million. Net income decreased to $347 million. Average deposits decreased 10% and as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. RoTCE for the quarter was 5.5%. We recognize that this business is facing a number of headwinds from a regulatory perspective and from higher credit costs given where we are in the credit cycle, both of which are putting pressure on returns for the quarter and for the full year 2024. However, this doesn't impact our longer-term view of the business. We feel good about our position as a prime and lend-centric issuer. We will continue to take mitigating actions to manage through the headwinds, [lap] (ph) the credit cycle, and drive more value from retail banking and retail services, while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business, all of which will ultimately result in a higher returning business over the medium-term. On Slide 17, we show results for All Other, on a Managed Basis, which includes corporate other and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 9%, primarily driven by closed exits and wind-downs, as well as higher funding costs, partially offset by higher revenue in Mexico. And expenses increased 18%, primarily driven by the incremental FDIC special assessment and restructuring charges, partially offset by lower expenses from the wind-down and exit markets. Slide 18 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We have accomplished a lot over the past few years and have made substantial progress on simplifying our business and organizational structure. The year is off to a good start as we are laser focused on executing the transformation and enhancing the business performance. These two priorities will not only enable us to be a more efficient, agile company, but a client-centric one that brings together the best of Citi to drive revenue growth and improve return. And we are on the path to reach our 11% to 12% return target over the medium-term. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Well, you just finished your seven months of your org simplification and you said 7,000 positions go away with $1.5 billion of expense savings. So that's very concrete, but more generally after 20 years, 30 years, 40 years of matrix structure down to five lines of business, you're reporting these differently, you're talking about them differently. But the question that I think a lot of people have is, are you simply reporting these lines of business differently or are you actually running them differently? Thanks. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Mike, for the question. The simplification that we've just gone through, it is what we said it is. It is the most consequential set of changes, not only to the organization model that we have, but how we run the bank. It's aligned the structure with the strategy. It's simplified the bank, it's eliminated needless complexity. It's created greater transparency into the five businesses and their performance, as you can see. It's increased accountability. And very simply, it's just easier for our people to focus on our clients, but also getting things done and the execution that we have ahead of us. So maybe if I try and bring this a bit more alive. The first thing we did was we elevated the five businesses and that eliminated the ICG and PBWM layer. And we brought all the elements that the businesses needed to run end-to-end under the direct management of those five business heads, an example being operations. And -- it's enabled transparency, greater accountability, and this end-to-end and total P&L focus, so focus on the bottom-line and the returns, driving growth, expense discipline, et cetera. We also right place businesses to align with the strategy. So banking, all being under one umbrella, the investment bank, the corporate bank, commercial bank, really helping us drive synergies there. Putting finance, F&S and securitization into markets so that we have a unified spread product there, also beginning to see the benefits of that this quarter. So that's an example on the businesses, but I do want to highlight a couple of other areas around this change. So by eliminating the regional layer and putting in a far slimmer, lighter management structure in place in the geographies. That's enabled us to make sure that our countries are focused on client delivery and legal entity management. And we've eliminated the whole shadow geographic P&L. We've eliminated a large number of committees in the geographies. And this is where a lot of the functional and management roles were streamlined and eliminated through the last seven months. And we also broke the regions into smaller, lighter clusters. And that allows us to much better capture the big changes in trade flows and financial flows, et cetera, we're seeing around the world. It's just much nimbler. The third piece, we created the client organizations. So that organization makes sure that our core capabilities and disciplines are being applied firm-wide to drive revenue synergies. And then the governance has got a lot easier. It took up a lot of time. And we've given much clearer mandates in that we've more than halved the number of committees. That's 200 committees plus that we've eliminated in the firm, either by consolidating them or eliminating them. The spans and layers, if you exclude me, 98% of the firm now operates within eight layers. That is a much, much faster decision-making. It's much quicker to get execution done. It also means that you can very quickly get closer to where the engine [room] (ph) of the firm is. We've got clearer accountabilities, we've eliminated most co-heads, we've reduced matrix reporting, we've got the producer to non-producer ratio improved. So all of this really means, as I've said, a clearer deck, so we can be laser-focused on business performance in those five businesses and the transformation. It already feels different. Around my table, I'm much closer to the businesses and the clients. It makes it much easier for Mark and I and the rest of the team to run the bank like an operator versus the head of a holding company. You don't have to go through these aggregator layers to get things done. And we're done, as we said we would be at this point, we're wrapping up the final consultation period, not an easy few months with the organization. We've had to say goodbye to some very good people. We put a lot of change through the organization. And now as we close the chapter on this, we look forward to being back in BAU mode, again continuing to drive improvements in simplification and processes and alike. But now the focus is going to be really getting the full benefit from all the changes we've made in business and organization and moving forward. Operator : Our next question is from Glenn Schorr at Evercore. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Thanks very much. Yes, so I think it shows how much you've helped us, see the simpler organization. I think people have totally bought into the expense story, so a lot of credit for you guys. I think where I personally and others still have questions on is, on the revenue side and getting to those 4% to 5% medium-term targets. So could you take us just conceptually where we're going to -- where you think you'll drive that growth from this baseline where we're at now? And if you want, you can totally use my second question in there and tell us what good things you're doing inside the Investment Banking line to help tease out one of the [industry] (ph)? Jane Fraser : It's not that one in, Glenn. So I'll kick off with some of this, pass it to Mark and then I'll come back to banking. So look, we are laser focused on the growth and improving the returns of these businesses to where they should and will be in the medium-term. And it's not just the growth story, but let me anchor it in those medium-term return targets. In services, we want to continue around the mid-20s in RoTCE. Banking should be getting to around 15%. Markets 10% to 13%. So we'd like to see at the higher end of that range. USPB getting that back to the mid-teens and then moving on to the high teens in the medium-term. And then lastly, as Andy and Mark have talked about getting wealth to a 15% to 20% return in the medium-term, but the goals to the mid-20s in the longer-term here. And we're confident that our strategy is going to drive the revenue growth of 4% to 5% CAGR in the medium-term. And that's a combination of maintaining our leadership in certain businesses, gaining shares in others. We have good client growth. Look at our win rate for example in TTS at over 80%. We've got our commercial bank also bringing in new clients in the mid-market and helping them accelerate their growth and success around the world. But Mark, let me pass it over to you. Mark Mason : Sure. And good morning, Glenn. And we appreciate the acknowledgement around the expenses. As you know, we've been quite focused on that and working hard to ensure that we deliver on what we say, we're going to do there. I'd point on the revenue line, I'd first point to, if you look back since Investor Day, we've in fact been able to deliver on the guidance that we've given for the medium-term, so that 4% to 5% top-line growth. And yes, it was a different rate environment, but that growth that we delivered over the past couple of years has been a mix of both revenue and underlying business strength. As you think about the guidance we talked about for this year, we talked about the NII ex-markets being down modestly. And so what that means is that the momentum and the growth that we expect is going to come from the non-interest revenue. And I think this quarter, is a good example of where and how that\u2019s likely to play through. So the revenue topline being up 3 plus percent. But when you look through each of the businesses and if you look on each of the pages where we disclosed the revenue, you can see the underlying NIR growth in the bottom left hand corner of each of those pages that's coming through as well. So security services up 14% with growth in both TTS between cross-border clearing commercial cards, but also -- and security services, right, with the growth that we're seeing from continued momentum in assets under custody. We expect that trend to continue with existing clients and more -- and new clients, as well as how we do more with our commercial market -- commercial middle market business excuse me. So NIR growth there, the investment banking pieces, the other driver of fees, we\u2019re seeing that while it start to rebound, we\u2019re part of that rebound, the announced transactions were part of those in sectors that we've been investing in. We're bringing in new talent to help us realize and experience that. And even in wealth, where we're not pleased with the top-line performance this quarter, down 4%. When you look through that, we do have good underlying NII growth in the quarter in wealth, and that's up 11% year-over-year. And it's in the area that Andy and the team is leaning in on, which is investments, and not just in one region, but across all the regions. And then finally, the USPB piece, which is showing good NII growth as well. So the long and short of it is that the 4% growth that's implied in $80 billion to $81 billion, is going to be continued momentum, largely in fees, helping us to deliver for our clients and make continued progress towards that medium-term target. Jane Fraser : So let me pick up the [side] (ph). I'm sure Jenn Landis will give us the evil eye for sneaking in a second question there, Glenn, but let me pick up on banking and what's going on there. So we have a very clear strategy that we've been executing over the last couple of years, really to lay the foundation for growth in banking. North America is our key priority. It's the biggest contributor to the global IB wallet. Tech, health care, and industrials are likely to constitute over 50% of the fee wallet going forward. So we have better aligned our resources to position the franchise for this, defending areas of traditional strength in industrials and the like energy, whilst investing in high-growth sectors such as healthcare and technology with some strong talent. Financial sponsors are sitting on $3 trillion of estimated firepower, which they are incentivized to deploy. So they're likely to be between 20% to 30% of global investment banking fees. We have great relationships with this community. We have built that over years and decades. You are going to see us more active in the LevFin space, in the right situations for our key clients, and we will continue to ensure we are well-positioned to active around this important opportunity. You'll likely see us seeking to remain competitive in the private capital asset class, that can be an important source of liquidity for many clients. And the middle market will be fertile hunting ground for corporates and private equity. And our investment bank and commercial bank are going to be closely coordinated to harvest the deal flow around the world. And indeed, the new org structure that I was just talking about really enables us to drive a more joined-up, client-centric strategic coverage across corporate, commercial, and investment banking. So over and above the wallet recovery, Mark and I can be very laser focused on ensuring that we're driving revenue growth from a more holistic focus on the wallet share across flow and episodic activity. Vis Raghavan is the right person to take over at this important moment for our banking franchise. The momentum that we've been generating with the foundations we've been laying, the intention here from him is to accelerate that. He will focus on increasing our performance intensity, driving productivity and discipline growth and he will keep us firmly on the path towards delivering on our commitments, fundamentally improving the operating margin, generating higher returns and that all-important fee revenue. Operator : Our next question is from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Or, yes -- we're almost pinging into the afternoon here. Jane Fraser : Hi Betsy. Mark Mason : Great to hear you, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : I guess a couple of questions. Well, I know we talked through the institutional securities business already on moving that expense ratio a little bit. Could we dig in a little bit on the wealth side, because the expense ratio there is running a little higher, and so it would be useful just to understand the pace or speed or timeframe when we should expect to see that start to inflect? Jane Fraser : Yes, absolutely. And some of it, just as a reminder, the actions that we've been taking on org simplification and that Andy's also been taking in the wealth business. We will work through notice periods in the coming weeks, and so you'll see the impact coming through in our headcount numbers, and in wealth and the expense base next quarter. Look, As Mark said in his opening and Andy's been talking about, this should be a sort of up to a 30% pre-tax margin business. Andy's focused on rationalizing the expense base. He's also, as Mark said, turning on the growth engine, he's enhancing our platforms and capabilities to elevate the client experience. The heart of the opportunity for us lies with our existing clients. They are an extraordinary client base, but they're under-penetrated. So [now] (ph) the operating efficiency is frankly going to be -- is going to come on the revenue side here. That said, Andy's taken a number of pretty decisive moves this quarter on the expense side. Mark, let me pass it over to you. Mark Mason : Yes, I mean, look, I think that the quarter expenses that you see of growth of 3% is not yet reflective of the work that Andy has been steadfast at. There is still some investment in there in technology and in the platform that's important, but I think coming out of the first quarter you'll start to see some of the reduction in expenses that's a byproduct of that work. And the work has been across the entire expense base in the wealth business. So that includes non-client-facing roles and support staff. It includes looking at the productivity of existing bankers and advisors. And those kind of reductions will start to play out in the subsequent quarters. I do want to point out, as Jane mentioned, this is a growth business for us. And so you can see on some of the metrics on page 15, the bottom left, some of those good signs of investment momentum. And I highlight that because as the expenses come down from some of those efficiencies, there will be a need for us to continue to invest and replenish low-performing or low-producing bankers and advisors with resources that actually can generate the revenues we expect and take advantage of the client opportunity that's in front of us. So long-winded way of saying, there's some operating efficiency upside for us for sure is a combination of the top-line and the expense we\u2019re playing through the balance of the quarters in the year here. Operator : Our next question is from Jim Mitchell at Seaport Global. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Okay, good morning. Jane and Mark, I very much appreciate the comments on your growth opportunities and driving growth, but revenues are often dictated by the macro that \u2013 it\u2019s a little bit out of your control. Can you talk a little bit about the flexibility on the expenses, you have a range in 2026 of [51 to 53] (ph), So if revenues are coming in below the targets, is it, I guess, a, fair to assume you'd be at the very low end of that range, or is it -- and I think there is some revenue growth built in there. So is there some flexibility to the downside to try to get your targets in a tougher revenue environment? Thanks. Mark Mason : Yeah, look I mean with the top-line growth as you've heard us say, is a CAGR of 4% to 5%. We put that target out there [51 to 53] (ph) as a range of what we're working towards. We're given you a good sense of how we expect to get there with the $2 billion to $2.5 billion reduction by then. We've already signaled the $1.5 billion that's in front of us. The reality is that if there's softness in revenues, that's why we have a range. Obviously, the volume-related expenses would come down with any softness in revenue. And depending on the drivers of why that revenue is softening, we'd look at the investments that we're making across the business and make sure that those are appropriately calibrated for where we are in the cycle and what we're seeing on the top-line. With that said, we've got to continue to invest in the transformation. We're not going to compromise that. That's going to be something that we have to spend on to ensure we continue to get right. But that's kind of how the dynamic works. There's a top, we've got a mix of businesses that I think we've demonstrated resiliency around if you think about the past couple of years. And we expect for those to continue to drive some top-line momentum but we've got levers in case they don't. Operator : Our next question is from Ebrahim Poonawala at Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Thank you. I guess just one question, Mark. Around capital. So you talked about [$13 billion] over the Reg. minimum. You could easily be doing 2 times the buyback you did in one quarter, if not more. I know you don't like to talk about out quarters, but give us a sense of, at least this quarter, should we expect the pace of buybacks to increase and if you could provide additional color as we think about the rest of the year would be greatly appreciated. Thank you. Mark Mason : Sure, look \u2013 and I've said it repeatedly, Jane has said it repeatedly given where we trade, we think buying back is smart and we'd like to do as much as we possibly can and -- as much as makes sense, in light of the uncertainty that's out there. We have run at about [$13.5 billion] (ph) this quarter. That does give us capacity above the [$13.3 billion] (ph). (Technical Difficulty) we want to make sure we can support the clients that want to do business with us, whether that be in markets or other parts of the franchise. And then there's still uncertainty out there about how the capital regulation evolves. The good news is, we are hearing kind of favorable things about how the Basel III endgame proposal could evolve, but that hasn't happened yet. It's not finalized. It's not in place yet. And so we want to see how that continues to play out. We're obviously in the midst of a CCAR process. We want to see how that evolves. And we'll continue to take the buyback decision on a quarter-by-quarter basis, but we recognize that there's an opportunity there and we'll get after it just as soon as it makes good sense for us. Operator : Our next question is from Erika Najarian at UBS. Please unmute your line and ask your question. Erika Najarian : Hi. Good afternoon. Hey. So, you know, clearly the theme of this -- that's emerging on the Q&A is, you know, a healthy skepticism about the revenue targets in-line with the, in light of the expense declines, which you know, it's not really as analysts, where we're sort of a little bit [parroting] (ph) what we're hearing from long-only investors that haven't yet you know jumped into the stock. So to that end I guess I'm going to ask Ebrahim's question differently then ask a question about card late fees. How are you balancing, clearly your valuation would demand that the buybacks be ramped up from $500 million, but growing revenues at a 4% to 5% CAGR, you know, would mean potentially some capital clawback into the business. I guess, how are you balancing that, especially given that the demand for buyback is louder at Citi than any other money center peer. And could you give us a sense of what card late fees are and, you know, how that would impact the $80 billion to $81 billion for the year, if we do get an earlier implementation in October? Mark Mason : Yeah, thank you, Erika. On the first part of the question, I just remind you and everyone else that we're playing for the long-term here, right? So we have set some medium-term targets. Obviously, Jane has re-casted the vision and the strategy. I think we're making very good progress against that. But we're playing for the long-term. And what that means is that we have to continue to invest in the franchise. It's why I've given you a range around the expenses at least in part. It's why I've continued to stress the importance of protecting the transformation and risk and control spend. And it's why, I started the answer to Ebrahim's question by saying that we want to be sure that we can match the client demand out there where the returns to do so makes sense. And so we are having to balance kind of the use of capital and other resources against that longer-term strategic objective and utilize it where it makes sense and generates good returns against the idea of returning that to shareholders. And so this will continue to do that. It's an everyday assessment. It's an everyday discussion with the teams. Frankly, it's why things like the revenue sharing has been put in place to intensify the discussion around the clients that we're using balance sheet with and ensuring that we're driving broader revenues across the platform. And so that's kind of how we're operating in terms of making that trade-off on a regular basis, in addition to obviously the broader regulatory environment that we're in. In terms of the second part of your question around late fees, we haven't disclosed kind of the dollar amount of the late fees. What I would say is that we did and have factored that into the $80 billion to $81 billion. And the only thing I'd add to that is, it did kind of -- it's being implemented a bit earlier than what we had assumed, but again, it's inside of the range of the guidance that I've given you for top-line revenue for the year. Jane Fraser : And also just as a reminder, 85% of our [two-CCAR] (ph) portfolios are prime. And in CRS, where you tend to see some of the lower income households, we do have that -- the economics of the fee change will be shared with our partners in CRS. So we want our customers to pay on time with a number of mechanisms to do so. But in terms of the economics, I think we, along with the rest of the industry, will be putting in mitigating actions over time, some of which we've already begun to implement. Operator : Our next question is from John McDonald at Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. John McDonald : Thanks. Mark, I was hoping you'd give a little more color on how you're feeling about the credit card charge-offs. You maintained the outlook for the year. You mentioned the higher end on retail services. You still feel like -- you'll see a peak this year and what kind of metrics are you looking at in terms of delinquency formation and seasoning to inform that view that you might see the peak in card charge-offs this year? Mark Mason : Yeah, thanks, John. We have obviously continued to manage this portfolio very actively. We've seen continued top-line growth, we've seen continued average interest earnings, balance growth. We've talked about how we expect for the cost of credit to normalize, and we've seen that continue to happen. The range that we've given on branded cards, we're inside of that range. When you look at the spend across the portfolios, the spend is really happening with the affluent customers more so than anything else. And so we're watching the lower income customer profile or customers that we have. But again, as Jane mentioned, we tend to skew to the higher end to begin with. Where we're really seeing the pressure is where I mentioned in terms of retail services. And so there, the current NCLs are higher than the high end of the full year range that I've given. But if you look back, that is not inconsistent with seasonality that we've seen in the past in that portfolio where the first two quarters are higher than the back half of the year, in part because of coming out of the holiday season and how losses tend to mature or materialize through that process. And so I\u2019d expect to not only see them be higher than the average range in Q1, but also in Q2 before coming down. And then I still expect that in 2025, you tend to see them further normalize and come down a bit off of these ranges. But look, the reality is that we continue to watch it in the factors that are out there, that are important include how unemployment evolves, what happens with inflation, what happens with interest rates and those will be important factors as to how the loss rates continue to evolve over time. I think the final point I'd make, and I mentioned it in the prepared remarks, is that we have to remember that the loss rates in both portfolios reflect multiple vintages maturing at the same time. And you'll recall, and this is an industry dynamic, you know, through the COVID and pandemic period, losses were at an all-time low, payment rates at all-time highs, supported by government stimulus. And now coming out of that, we're seeing the COVID vintages mature albeit at a lagged pace from what would be normal. And we're seeing the incremental acquisitions that we've done, start to mature at their normal pace. And so these loss rates are exacerbated by that impact, and that's an important factor we can't lose sight of. But the bottom-line is that we're watching it. The macro factors matter. We feel good about the quality mix that we have and we'll kind of see how things evolve from here. John McDonald : Okay, and on the branded side, you still expect kind of the peak this year. You're still inside of the range for the full year and expect 2025, you could move lower on the branded charge-offs? Mark Mason : Yes, I still kind of expect that trend line of peaking and then kind of moving a bit lower in branded. Operator : Our next question is from Ken Usdin at Jefferies. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Great, thanks. Can I follow up on the card line of thinking and just ask you, Mark, to talk a little bit about just cost of credit? We did still see some card-related build this quarter, even with the comments you just made and seasonal softer loan growth. So just from a bigger picture perspective, how do you think -- continue to think about reserve builds from here and how that informs your outlook for cost of credit? Mark Mason : Yeah, sure. Look, I think that, you know, when I think about the reserve builds, I think it's the same factors that come into play. So obviously the view on the macro is important. And right now, if you think about some of the key macro factors that impact the cards portfolio, the unemployment assumption weighted is about 5%, the downside is about you know 7% kind of weighted over the period. And so feel -- how that evolves will be an important factor. How [HPI] (ph) evolves will be, you know, important consideration here for this portfolio. But also what happens with volumes becomes a factor on reserve builds and how important or how much they increase or decrease. And then the final piece is mix, and it's kind of related to that revolver point. As we see the mix evolve from transactors to revolvers, that's going to play into how much of a reserve, from a lifetime point of view, we have to continue to build. And so it's -- why I mentioned on John's question, you know, the importance of looking at, you know, the interest rates looking at what's happening with inflation, watching the lower income customer base, because all of those things combined with how we think about the scenarios and the weighting will be a factor on the reserves. But I will say, Ken, as I sit here and think about what we have in the quarter, I feel very good about the reserve levels. The 8.2% for combined kind of, you know, ACL to loan ratio feels right for the mix of this portfolio, and we'll continue to watch it. Ken Usdin : Okay. And a separate question on TTS. That NII related to TTS has been remarkable with rising rates. This quarter, granted there was a lesser day and there could be currency stuff in there, the first quarter that it stepped back, I'm just wondering like where is that in its asset liability sensitivity, the TTS-NII, and what are your thoughts about that piece of the NII puzzle going forward? Thanks. Mark Mason : Sure. Yeah, I think I'd say a couple things. We do have some Argentina playing through the NII line. I will say that the best way to think about it is kind of the underlying beta activity. And we have seen, this is a corporate client, it is an institutional client, we have seen betas, particularly in the US, at kind of normalized or terminal levels and playing a bit through that. We are seeing betas outside of the U.S., continue to increase as it relates to the TTS client base. But all of that, again, is inside of the range that we've talked about. I don't expect to see kind of year-over-year growth on the NII line anywhere close to kind of what we've seen in prior years, prior quarters, just in light of kind of how the rate environments evolved and in light of kind of quantitative tightening \u2013 and tightening and the impact on deposit levels. The last point I'd make on this is, we will continue to drive and see growth as it relates to the operating deposits. And that'll be an important tailwind that kind of plays through. Operator : Our next question is from Vivek Juneja at JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, thank you. Jane, Mark, just a question maybe on Argentina. You had -- you've shown $100 million in NII, total net income benefit of $500 million after tax, so probably implying about $500 million, $600 million of non-interest income benefit. Which line item -- sorry, which segment did that come through and is that sustainable? Mark Mason : Yeah, look, there's a mix obviously of things that are driving that net income, including a tax impact on the heels of last year Argentina devaluation activity that's in that line. But the short answer is that you know if you think about the nature of the business that we do in Argentina, it is a big part of our institutional client relationships. And the primary activities include some of the TTS type of activities that we've talked about, so liquidity management payments, custody within the services business. And so you'd see a good portion of the activity in Argentina playing through the services business, some of it in markets as well, but again, the majority of the activity in services. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thanks so much. Our next question is from Scott Siefers at Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Scott Siefers : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking the question. Mark, I think you touched on at least a component of this a couple questions ago, but maybe just broadly an update on your rate positioning. I guess I only ask because it looks like we might be starting to diverge in terms of global rate trajectories, if we potentially go, lower in Europe but higher here for a while. In the aggregate, do these kind of complicate your management or make you feel better or worse about the overall NII momentum for the company? Mark Mason : Yeah, let me try and take it in two pieces, I guess. So one is, if I think about how the rate implies have evolved from the three to six to now something a little bit north of one, in the context of what I expect for our performance. It doesn't have a material impact on the guidance that I've given of $80 billion to $81 billion. And in part, that's because, as I think about the timing for the planned cuts, which was generally backloaded, as well as some of the other factors that play through. So, you know, Argentina just announced a policy rate reduction yesterday or a couple of days ago. If rates are a bit higher for longer, we'll watch how the betas continue to evolve. I mentioned earlier the late fees for the cards business happened a bit sooner. Late fees are actually booked in our NII line and so those factors you know put me in a place where I feel like, there'll certainly be puts and takes around how that rate curves evolve, and therefore I'm very comfortable kind of leaving the guidance where it is. To answer your broader question in terms of kind of how we're positioned, you know, I'd point you to the 10-K that we have that's out -- and in that 10-K, we offer as we have before a number of IRE scenarios for plus or minus 100 basis points and what it means for our business. And if you look at it, you'll see that for the aggregate firm, for Citi, U.S. dollar and non-U.S. dollar, that we're asset sensitive. So as rates increase, we should see an increase in our NII performance. But if you look at the breakdown, and that's about, I think it was about a [$1.4 billion] (ph) or something in terms of the impact of that move. But if you look at the breakdown, what the breakdown will show is that for U.S. dollar, at this point, we're neutral. So if rates were to go up, rates were to go down, no material impact as it relates to our revenue. For the non-U.S. dollar, we're still quite asset sensitive, right. And so that should give you some sense for at that -- and we recognize the limitations with IRE, it assumes, you know, a 100 basis point parallel shift across the curve, the static balance sheet, et cetera. But that should give you some sense for the implications of the rate curve moves as it relates to our book of business. Operator : Our next question is from Gerard Cassidy at RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open, please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi Mark, hi Jane. Jane Fraser : Hi, Gerard. Mark Mason : Hi Gerard. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, can you share with us, there's been obviously a lot of conversation around the credit card charge-offs and the credit quality there. If we could shift over to the corporate side, which obviously is very strong. We've seen spreads narrow in the markets on high-yield corporate debt, leveraged debt, et cetera. It's very robust out there, but around the global geopolitical risk, do you think the spreads would be widening. Can you guys share with us what you're seeing in the corporate side in terms of competition, are underwriting standards getting a little weaker now, as people are trying to grow their books, what are you seeing on that front? Mark Mason : Look, we're still seeing good demand for corporate credit. And what I'd say is that we've been very disciplined about where we want to play on the risk profile here. We've been very disciplined in terms of the investment grade, you know, large multinationals that we serve. And that hasn't shifted from an underwriting point of view. We have seen spaces like private credit pick up quite a bit. And that, I think, will continue to evolve. I think, importantly, as we think about our corporate lending activity, you'll note that, actually, we've been very disciplined about how we want to deploy balance sheet and part of that again is a byproduct of the revenue sharing that we've implemented where there's been healthy debate and discussion around the names that we want to continue to serve and whether they're positioned to take advantage of the broader platform that we have. And so I think the space will continue to evolve. I think there's been good, healthy demand, despite continued strong balance sheets. And part of that demand has been because of where rates are likely to go and continue to evolve. And I think we're well positioned to be thoughtful about that. But Jane, you may want to add a couple points to it. Jane Fraser : Yeah, look, around the world, the corporate client base and our commercial banking mid-market client base have very healthy balance sheets. And we're also seeing market access gradually opening up as well, which is also helpful for the quality issuers across all asset classes. We've seen both the issuers taking advantage as well as the investors. The deals are well oversubscribed. So that's also been beneficial as corporates think about their financing needs. The other piece I just pop out there as well is the recent large M&A announcements in multiple industries is a sign of rising confidence from CEOs and Boards. And active discussions are increasing as supportive capital markets create confidence as people think about larger strategic transactions. This is going to feed acquisition finance, bridge financing, and some of the higher margin capital markets and lending activity as well. So as we look forward, I think it's recognizing the shift in some of the drivers from companies just investing, refinancing, looking at where they can, diversifying their capital, raising in different quarters. But I just close by saying, I couldn't agree with you more about geopolitical risks and fragility. I think the market's too -- but it's too benign in its risk pricing on some of these factors. Mark Mason : Important for us to take \u2026 Operator : Our next question is from Matt O'Connor at Deutsche Bank. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Hi. In your prepared remarks, you talked about intensifying certain efforts regarding regulatory processes and data on Slide 4 here. And I was just wondering if you could elaborate on, you know, I guess what you're doing or trying to do differently on that front and if there's any meaningful financial impact. Thank you. Jane Fraser : Yeah, look, I think Matt, as we've talked about many times, the transformation is our top priority. It will be for the next few years. It is foundational for our future success, both in terms of delivering the strategy and the medium-term financial path. And we've been making significant investments behind it, as well as not only in the consent order but also making sure we've got this modern efficient infrastructure. We're currently deep into a very large body of work, upgrading our data architecture, automating manual controls and processes, consolidating fragmented tech platforms. And all of these help enhance our business performance more broadly, not just the risk and control in the medium-term. As I've said, though -- there are a few areas where we are intensifying our efforts, such as the automation of certain regulatory processes and data remediation, particularly related to regulatory reporting. We're committed to getting these right. The org changes will help us with execution and making sure that we have the impetus and everything that we need behind it, the investments that we need. We keep a close eye on execution, making sure we've got the right level of resourcing and expertise. And we'll invest what we need to do, to make sure that we address these different concerns. I can't go into much more detail in terms of our CSI, obviously, but \u2013 at [some day] (ph) this magnitude, you'd expect us to have some areas where we have good progress and others where we need to intensify efforts. Mark Mason : Yeah -- I mean, I think that's exactly right. But you'd also expect that in this type of environment and on the heels of the regional bank stress last year that we're looking at stress scenarios, we're enhancing our CCAR processes, we're enhancing our resolution and recovery processes, all of those things just to kind of -- to make sure that we're shoring up capabilities and you'd expect that across the industry quite frankly. Operator : Our next question is from Saul Martinez at HSBC. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, good afternoon. I'll change tack a little bit here, but I'm curious if there's any update on the Mexican IPO, and more specifically I'm kind of curious how [set it stone] (ph) the IPO processes -- you will have a new administration and even if the candidate from same-party, she may have a less confrontational view the private sector, perhaps be more allowing a low bank -- local bank to extract value from buying a bank. And, you know, I guess if the facts on the ground were to change, would you be open to a sale potentially being back on the table? Because it does seem like this is a situation where a private market valuation could be higher and even materially higher than a public market valuation. Jane Fraser : The guiding principle that we have and we've had all along is making sure that we make a decision here that is in the best interest of our shareholders and makes the most sense for them. We are -- we never say never, but we are very focused on the IPO path here. We believe it is the right one for our shareholders. We are well on track in the path in Mexico. We are very pleased to bring Ignacio Deschamps in as the Banamex Chairman to help guide the IPO process. We announced the management teams for the two banks earlier this quarter. We're far down the path of the technological separation of both banks and then the full legal separation in the second half of the year. Obviously, the election is coming up fairly shortly, but we're not anticipating that we would be deviating from the IPO path. That is the path that we are on at the moment. I'll never say never, but we do believe that this is the right one. But we'll keep an eye on what's happening in Mexico as we always do. Operator : Our next question is from Chris Kotowski at Oppenheimer. Please go ahead. Chris Kotowski : Hello and thanks. Just a quick one for Mark. Previously you had talked about quote bending the cost curve, between the third and the fourth quarter of this year. And on this call I thought I heard you say, it's basically bent that second quarter should be down and we should be sequentially lower from here. So did it just happened six months earlier or is there still some other bending that comes late this year. Mark Mason : I'll take it. I'll take that. Jane Fraser : Damn. I wanted that one. Mark Mason : I'll take that. I mean I'll take the win, a downward trajectory from here through the end of the year in-line with the guidance of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. And so yes. Operator : Our next question is from Steven Chubak at Wolfe Research. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good afternoon. So Mark. Jane Fraser : Hello, Steven. Steven Chubak : Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. I did want to ask on DFAST and SCB, just recognizing this will be the last opportunity before the results come out. The macro scenario Fed assumptions look quite similar to last year, but just given the significant transformation that's underway, repositioning actions which [admittedly] (ph) depressed earnings last year. I want to get a sense as to whether there are any [IDEO] (ph) factors that could result in greater SCB volatility in the coming exam and just broader thoughts on the longer-term trajectory for the SCB, just given the Org simplification efforts are underway. Mark Mason : Yes, Steven. The first part of your question is just impossible to answer, to be candid with you, right? We obviously have an internal base scenario we've run. We have a severely adverse scenario that we've run. We've provided a balance sheet as part of the submission, but ultimately, the regulators have to run through their models, the information that we've provided and that informs what happens with the stress capital buffer. And we don't have as much transparency to that as we'd like. And so really hard to call at this stage. The second part of your question, I think is spot on, and I kind of alluded to in my prepared remarks, in that we have the medium-term targets that we've set. And we're still in the midst of kind of the execution of our strategy, the evolution of the business mix and the business model. The mix towards more consistent, predictable, and repeatable revenue streams that would impact PPNR, the simplification which obviously plays through an expense base that will be lower, when we get to that medium term period. So all of those things, the divestitures and kind of what that means and how that might impact the G-SIB score and the like, and the freeing up of capital, which we've already freed up, you know, $6 billion or so. And so all of those things have kind of yet to have been factored in. And we believe will be beneficial to the SCB over the medium term. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Mayo at Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. A follow-up, Mark. You said, TTS, we said -- we will have growth and operational deposits. And I was just wondering what gives you such confidence that you will or is that accelerating or the same pace or what? Mark Mason : We have seen growth in the quarter, in operating deposits. The confidence comes from the focus that we've had with our existing clients, as well as the growth we've seen with new clients, doing more with existing and more countries, more deeply penetrating the commercial middle market space. And so we've been very thoughtfully focused on deposits that obviously give us the most value and also provide the most stickiness, as it relates to that relationship. And so yes, the confidence is rooted in what we're seeing in the way of underlying operating deposit growth, including inside this quarter. Jane Fraser : It's also a lot of the investments that we've been making, fuel a lot of the growth we've got. We have a market leading product innovations and those continue to drive good returns, good growth. If it's Citi Token Services, Citi Payment Express, 24/7 -- all of these different elements really mean that this business is utterly invaluable and indispensable to our clients. And the stickiness of the deposits, and the operating deposits comes with that. So we feel good about that growth. And you'll hear more about this as well, Mike, in the Investor Day in mid-June, which will be, I think we hope will be very helpful to everyone, so you really get your arms around how this business operates, makes money and see why we call it a crown jewel. Operator : Our next question is from Vivek Juneja at JPMorgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi, Mark. A completely different topic because I think I understood your answer to be just for my previous question to be the tax benefits, so we'll leave it at that. I don\u2019t know, if it is different, then I need to go down that path. But the question I signed on to ask was, you talked about the percentage of revolvers increasing from transactors in the private label and the retail partner cards. What is that percentage and how does it compare with what it was pre-pandemic? Mark Mason : Yeah, I don't -- we haven't broken down the transactor versus revolver mix, and so I'm not going to get into that. I will say that the revolver levels are at least back to where they were pre-pandemic and leave it at that. But we are seeing kind of continued revolver activity which you'd expect kind of given the way the cycle has evolved and given payment rates have started to moderate and the stimulus has kind of unwound and so all of that is kind of consistent with expectations but obviously is a factor in reserve levels as I mentioned earlier. Operator : Our final question is from Betsy Graseck at Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi. Thanks so much. I just wanted to make sure of one thing on the expenses. I know in the past you've talked about the fact that 1Q will be a little elevated with the restructuring, and you showed that was the $225 million in the quarter. And then when we look to 2Q, should we still be expecting a step down in 2Q? And is that step down just the elimination of the $225 million? Or is there some restructuring that we're likely to see in 2Q as well? In other words, should I just fade sequentially 2Q, 3Q, 4Q to hit your annual number? Or is there a bigger step down in 2Q that I should still be expecting here, thanks. Mark Mason : Sure, I think you should just fade it to answer your question very directly. But I'd also point out that, you know, in Q1, if you really look through to it, it has the $250 million of FDIC charge in it. And so when you back that out, we effectively are coming in lower than what we had guided. All right? Despite that, I'm telling you the same -- I'm making the same point, which is you can expect a downward trend from here through to the end of the year. And while there won't be additional restructuring charge, there will be the normal BAU activity around repositioning that plays through. So hopefully, that answers your question, Betsy. The guidance still holds and the downward trend is what we are managing towards as we kind of play out the balance of the year. Operator : There are no further questions. I will turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks. Jennifer Landis : Thank you all for joining us. If you have any follow-up questions, please call us and we look forward to talking to you. Thank you very much. Operator : This concludes the Citi First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jenn Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our second quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jenn, and good morning to everyone. Before I discuss the results of the quarter, let me first address the regulatory actions by the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Controller of the Currency, which were announced on Wednesday. These actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in 2020. And those orders covered four primary areas : risk management, data governance, controls, and compliance. Addressing these areas is the primary goal of our transformation, our number one priority. It is a multi-year effort to modernize our infrastructure, unify disparate tech platforms, and automate processes and controls. This week's actions focused primarily on data quality management. We've been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result. The regulatory actions consisted of two civil money penalties and under the amended consent order with the OCC, a new process designed to ensure we're allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones and that is called the Resource Review Plan. We are currently developing a plan for submission to the OCC. Now by way of background, while the Federal Reserve is the primary regulator for Citigroup, our bank holding company, the OCC is a primary regulator for Citibank, N.A., we call it CBNA, which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately 70% of our assets. The amended consent order with the OCC allows CBNA to continue paying to Citigroup at a minimum the dividends necessary for debt service, preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations. While we're developing and seeking OCC consent for our Resource Review Plan, dividend amounts above that would require the OCC's non-objection. Now these dividends are intercompany payments that are made from CBNA ultimately to the parent Citigroup. They should not be confused with the common dividends Citigroup pays to its shareholders. Indeed, there is no restriction on Citigroup's ability to pay common dividends to shareholders, nor is there a restriction to buying back shares. And let me be very clear, even with the investments needed for our transformation, Citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders. We will increase our dividend from $0.53 to $0.56 a share as we announced in late June and we will resume modest buybacks this quarter. While these actions were not entirely unexpected to us, it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and for our people. We completely understand that. At the same time, we're confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be, as we have been able to do in other areas of the transformation. And we are pleased that it was acknowledged on Wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our transformation and simplifying our firm. A multi-year undertaking such as this was never going to be linear, but I can assure you, the investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk, improve controls and deliver very tangible outcomes. The tech investments we have made are making a difference. We have reduced the time it takes to book loans, automated controls for our traders to reduce errors, move risk analytics to a cloud-based infrastructure, and increase the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime. The changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference. We have eliminated managerial constructs and layers, whilst empowering our leaders. We introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs. Our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as Vis Raghavan, Tim Ryan, and Andy Sieg. You have my and the entire management team's commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it. We will get this work where it needs to be as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization. Now, turning to what was another good quarter, our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our medium-term return target. We reported net income of $3.2 billion with an earnings per share of $1.52 and an RoTCE of 7.2%. Revenues were up 4% overall as well as up in each of our five core businesses, where all but one had positive operating leverage. Expenses were down 2% year-over-year. The steps we're taking to simplify our organization, right-size businesses such as Markets and Wealth, and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold even as we increase investment in our transformation. Over the medium-term, we expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive $2 billion to $2.5 billion in annual run rate saves. Services grew 3%, driven by solid fee growth, which we have prioritized. TTS saw increased activity in cross-border payments and in commercial cards. Security services was up 10% with new client onboarding, deepening with existing clients and market valuations, helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary 9%. At our recent Services Investor Day, we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in-depth about how we're going to continue to grow this high-returning business. And we're very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel. Overall, Markets had a strong finish to the quarter, leading to better performance than we'd anticipated. Fixed income was slightly down year-on-year due to lower FX and rates, but we had good issuance and loan growth in financing and securitization, an area which generates attractive returns. Equities was up 37%, driven by strong performance in derivatives, which includes a gain on the Visa B exchange offer. Banking was up 38%, as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share. Our clients continued to access debt capital markets with investment-grade issuance near-record levels. Equity issuance increased, particularly in convertibles, as companies wait for a fuller opening of the IPO window. Investment banking fees were up 63% versus the prior year, and we've seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals year-to-date, particularly in natural resources and technology. Combined with the strong pipeline, advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year [Technical Difficulty]. Wealth is starting to improve. Growth in client investment assets drove stronger investment revenue, especially in Citigold, and was up a preliminary 15%. Our focus on rationalizing the expense base is also starting to pay off with expenses down 4%. Andy and his team continue to attract top talent from the industry, as they focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience. US Personal Banking saw revenue growth of 6% with all three businesses again contributing to the top-line. There was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services, and we continue to see differentiation in the credit segment with the lower-income customers seeing pressure. Retail banking benefited from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads, while delivering strong referrals to Wealth. Overall, while we saw operating margin expansion, our poor returns were pressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages. We certainly expect USPB's returns to improve from here. The recent stress tests again showcased the strength of our balance sheet. Our CET1 ratio now stands at 13.6% and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, given the reduction of our stress capital buffer. Our tangible book value per share grew to $87.53. During the quarter, we returned $1 billion in capital to our common shareholders and we are increasing our dividend by 6%. We expect to buy back $1 billion in common shares this quarter, and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis, particularly given the uncertainty around the Basel III endgame. Looking at the macro environment as we enter the second half of the year, US is still the world's most structurally sound economy. After a break in progress, inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory. Services spending has remained on an upward trend, although there are clear signs of a softening labor market and the tightening of the consumer budget. And, of course, you might have heard there is an election in November. In Europe, while rate cuts have begun, the region's lack of competitiveness continues to be a drag on growth. In Asia, China is growing moderately, albeit with government stimulus, and their pivot to high-tech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on EVs and semiconductors. Despite this uncertainty, as you saw at our Services Investor Day when we went through our performance over the last two years, our business model can produce good results in a wide variety of macro environments and there is plenty of upside for us across our five businesses. We have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification, both strategically and organizationally. We've completed most of the exits of our international consumer markets. We streamlined our organization to catalyze agility and faster decision-making. We are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service, and we are automating processes to strengthen controls. We are on a deliberate path. We will continue to execute our transformation and our strategy so we can meet our medium-term targets and then continue to further improve our returns over time. With that, let me turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the second quarter, unless I indicate otherwise, and then spend a little more time on the business. On Slide 6, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.52 and RoTCE of 7.2% on $20.1 billion of revenue. Total revenues were up 4%, driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate $400 million gain related to the Visa B exchange offer. A significant portion of this gain is reflected in equity markets with the remainder reflected in all other. Expenses were $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% on a sequential basis. The combination of revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm and the majority of our businesses. Cost of credit was $2.5 billion, primarily driven by higher card net credit losses, which were partially offset by ACL releases and all businesses except USPB, where we built for loan growth. At the end of the quarter, we had nearly $22 billion of total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%. On Slide 7, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.4 billion, down 2% and 6% sequentially, which includes the $136 million civil money penalties imposed by the Fed and OCC earlier this week. The decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification, stranded cost reductions, and lower repositioning costs, partially offset by continued investment in transformation and the Fed and the OCC penalty. As we said over the past few months, we will continue to invest in the transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure. We expect these investments to offset some of our sales and headcount reduction going forward. However, based on what we know today, we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range, excluding the FDIC special assessment and the civil money penalties. With that said, we will, of course, continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties. Before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter, I'd like to also give more color on the transformation and address what the Fed and OCC announced Wednesday. We've made good progress on our transformation in certain areas over the last few years, and I want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement. First, wholesale credit and loan operations, where we implemented a consistent end-to-end operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology, this has not only reduced risk, but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience. We've also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessment and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring. And in data, while there's a lot more to do, we stood up a data governance process and streamlined our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straight-through processing. Overall, we've improved risk management and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency. These efforts represent meaningful examples of how we're making progress against our transformation milestones. That said, we have fallen short in data quality management, particularly related to regulatory reporting, which we've acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year. As such, we've begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance, but also stress-testing capabilities, including DFAST and Resolution and Recovery. We also reprioritized our efforts to ensure we're focused on data that impact these reports first. We take this feedback from our regulators very seriously and we're committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations. Now, turning back to the quarterly results. On Slide 9, we show net interest income, deposits, and loans, where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the second quarter, net interest income was roughly flat. Excluding Markets, net interest income was down 3%, largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation, seasonally lower revolving card balances, and lower interest rates in Argentina, partially offset by higher deposit spreads in Wealth. Average loans were roughly flat as growth in cards and Mexico consumer was largely offset by slight declines across businesses. And average deposits decreased by 1%, largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to investments in Wealth as well as non-operational outflows in TTS. On Slide 10, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our card portfolios, approximately 86% of our card loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. And while we continue to see an overall resilient US consumer, we also continue to see a divergence in performance and behavior across FICO and income bands. When we look across our consumer clients, only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of 2019, and it is the over 740 FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates. Lower FICO bands customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates. That said, as we will discuss later, we're seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance across our cards portfolio. And we've taken this all into account in our reserving and we remain well reserved with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 8.1% for our total card portfolio. Our corporate portfolio is largely investment-grade at approximately 82% as of the second quarter, and we saw a nearly $500 million sequential decrease in corporate non-accrual loans, largely driven by upgrades and repayments. Additionally, this quarter, we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions driven by HPI, oil prices, and equity market valuations. And our credit loss reserves continues to incorporate a scenario weighted-average unemployment rate of nearly 5% and a downside unemployment rate of nearly 7%. As such, we feel very comfortable with the nearly $22 billion of reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 11, I'd like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity. It is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility. Our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and diversified business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. The majority of our deposits are corporate at $807 billion and span 90 countries. And as you heard at the Services Investor Day, most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world, making them operational in nature and therefore very stable. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $404 billion are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth at Work offering, as well as across regions and products. Of our total deposits, 68% are US dollar-denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currency. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $688 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans, and about one-third of our balance sheet is held in cash and high-quality short-duration investment securities that contribute to our approximately $900 billion of available liquidity resources. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us to be a source of strength for the industry and importantly for our clients. On Slide 12, we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our CET1 ratio this quarter. We ended the quarter with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 130 basis points or approximately $15 billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of 12.3%. We expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to 12.1% as of October 1, which incorporates the reduction in our stress capital buffer from 4.3% to the indicative SCB of 4.1% we announced a couple of weeks ago. We were pleased to see the improvement in our DFAST results and the corresponding reduction in our SCB. That said, even with the reduction, our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts, the benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy, all of which we expect to reduce our capital requirements over time. And as a reminder, we announced an increase to our common dividend from $0.53 per share to $0.56 per share following the SCB result. And as Jane mentioned earlier, we plan on doing $1 billion of buybacks this quarter. So now turning to Slide 13. Before I get into the businesses, as a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, we implemented a revenue-sharing arrangement within Banking and between Banking, Services and Markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationship-based lending. The impact of revenue sharing is included in the all other line for each business in our financial supplement. In Services, revenues were up 3% this quarter, reflecting continued underlying momentum across both TTS and security services. Net interest income was down 1%, largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in Argentina, partially offset by the benefit of higher US and non-US interest rates relative to the prior-year period. Non-interest revenue increased to 11%, driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. The underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investment in product innovation, client experience, and platform modernization that we highlighted during our Services Investor Day last month. Expenses increased 9%, largely driven by an Argentina-related transaction tax expense, a legal settlement expense, and continued investments in product innovation and technology. Cost of credit was a benefit of $27 million, driven by an ACL release in the quarter. Average loans were up 3%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, particularly in Asia, as well as working capital loans to corporate in commercial clients in Latin America and Asia. Average deposits were down 1%, driven by non-operating deposit outflows. At the same time, we continue to see good operating deposit inflows. Net income was approximately $1.5 billion, and Services continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 23.8% for the quarter. On Slide 14, we show the results for Markets for the second quarter. Market revenues were up 6%. Fixed income revenues decreased 3%, driven by rates and currencies, which were down 11% on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads. This was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income, which was up 20%, primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization in underwriting fees. In addition to a benefit from the Visa B exchange offer, we continue to see good underlying momentum in equity, primarily driven by equity derivatives, and we continue to make progress in prime with balances up approximately 18%. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $11 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Average loans increased to 11%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products. Average trading assets increased 12%, largely driven by client demand for treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated positive operating leverage, and delivered net income of approximately $1.4 billion, with an RoTCE of 10.7% for the quarter. On Slide 15, we show the results for Banking for the second quarter. Banking revenues increased 38%, driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending. Investment banking revenues increased 60%, driven by strength across capital markets and advisory, given favorable market conditions. DCM continued to benefit from strong issuance activities, mainly in investment grade as issuers continued to derisk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half in the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment. In ECM, excluding China A shares, we're seeing a pickup in IPO activity, led by the US as well as continued convertible issuance as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer. And in advisory, we're seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in 2023 coming to fruition as those transactions close. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we gained share across DCM, ECM, and advisory, particularly in technology, where we've been investing. Corporate lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, increased 7%, largely driven by higher revenue share. We generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased 10%, primarily driven by actions taken to right-size the expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $32 million, driven by an ACL release, reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook, partially offset by net credit loss. Average loans decreased 4% as we maintain strict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit. Net income was $406 million, and RoTCE was 7.5% for the quarter. On Slide 16, we show the results for Wealth for the second quarter. Wealth revenues increased 2%, driven by a 13% increase in NIR from higher investment fee revenues, partially offset by a 4% decrease in NII from higher mortgage funding costs. We continue to see good momentum in non-interest revenue as we benefited from double-digit client investment asset growth, both in North America and internationally, driven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuation. Expenses were down 4%, driven by the initial benefit of expense reductions as we right-sized the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was a benefit of $9 million as an ACL release more than offset net credit loss. Preliminary end-of-period client balances increased 9%, driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits. Average loans were flat as we continue to optimize capital usage. Average deposits increased 2%, largely reflecting the transfer of relationships and associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Client investment assets were up 15%, driven by net new investment asset flows and the benefit of higher market valuation. Wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter, and delivered net income of $210 million, with an RoTCE of 6.4% for the quarter. On Slide 17, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the second quarter. US Personal Banking revenues increased 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 8%, driven by interest-earning balance growth of 9% as payment rates continue to moderate and we continue to see growth in spend volumes up 3%, primarily driven by customers with FICO scores of 740 or higher. Retail services revenues increased 6%, primarily driven by lower payments from Citi to our partners due to higher net credit losses and interest-earning balances grew 8%. Retail banking revenues increased 3%, driven by higher deposit spreads as well as mortgage and installment loan growth. USPB also generated positive operating leverage this quarter, with expenses down 2%, driven by lower technology and compensation costs, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit increased to $2.3 billion, largely driven by higher NCLs of $1.9 billion and an ACL build of approximately $400 million, reflecting volume growth in the quarter. But let me remind you of the three things driving our NCLs this quarter. First, card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time. These vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic. Second, we continue to see seasonally higher NCLs in the second quarter. Third, certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and higher interest rates resulting in higher losses. However, across both portfolios, we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance, but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses. Despite these factors, we still expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year, and retail services to be at the high end of the range of 5.75% to 6.25%. Average deposits decreased 18% as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our Wealth business more than offset the underlying growth. Net income was $121 million, and RoTCE for the quarter was 1.9%. As we said before, we will continue to take actions to manage through the regulatory headwind, lap the credit cycle, and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high-teens return over the medium-term. On Slide 18, we show results for all other on a managed basis, which includes corporate/other and legacy franchises, and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 22%, primarily driven by the closed exit and winddowns and higher funding costs, partially offset by growth in Mexico as well as the impact from the Visa B exchange offer. And expenses decreased 7%, primarily driven by closed exit and winddowns. Slide 19 shows our full year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance, both of which remain unchanged. We continue to remain laser-focused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the business' performance. And while we recognize there's a lot more to do on transformation, we are pleased with the progress that we're making towards our 2024 and medium-term targets and remain committed to these targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Could you elaborate more on the amended consent order? Jane, you said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week. It's almost four years into the consent order. And a little bit why it hasn't been resolved? And what's on the -- that's the loss column, and maybe a little bit more on the win column too. I mean you have, what, 12,000 people thrown at the problem, billions of dollars. Is it not enough people? Not enough money? Is it -- do you need to look at it in a different way? Are you not talking the same language? I mean, you have John Dugan as your Lead Independent Director, exit of the OCC, and it seems like you got your report card, I guess you passed overall, they went out of the way to say some nice things, but it looks like you got failing grades and data and regulatory management. So, your confidence is going to be resolved, but it's already been four years and it hasn't been resolved. So, what is it going to take from here? And how can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better? And then, in the win column, since it's so nebulous this back-office, what are you achieving? You mentioned some items, but you could put more meat on those bones? Thanks. Jane Fraser : Yes. Thank you, Mike. That's a few different parts of that. So, let's start by just taking a step back. Our transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in large parts of Citi's infrastructure and in our risk and control environment. And when you unpack that, those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise-wide standards and governance, we've had a siloed organization that's prevented scale, a culture where a lot of groups are allowed to solve problems -- the same problem in different ways, fragmented tech platforms, manual processes and controls and a weak first-line of defense, too few subject matter experts. So, this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order. And this is not old Citi putting in band-aid. This is Citi tackling the root issues head-on. It's a multi-year undertaking as we've talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week, we have made meaningful progress on our transformation -- excuse me, and on our simplification. Mark, do you want to... Mark Mason : Yeah. And so, what -- as Jane says, the progress that we -- that we've made, it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work. Remember, that consent order and transformation work includes risk, it includes controls, it includes compliance, it includes data and data-related to the regulatory reporting. And we've got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Mark. Mark Mason : Yes. Jane Fraser : So, transforming -- to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time, transforming Citi will drive benefits for our shareholders, our clients, and our regulators. This is not mutually exclusive. At the beginning of the year, we honed in on two priorities, the transformation and improving our business performance. And we're able to do so because we've largely cleared the decks. We have a clear focused strategy. We've executed the divestitures. We've got a much simpler organization, so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both. You can see that in our results again this quarter, multiple solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts. We have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and we're executing against them. We have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we're addressing them. Mark Mason : Yeah. And just to add a couple of data points to that, Mike, you've heard us mention some of these before, but we've retired platforms. We've reduced the number of data centers. Platforms are down some 300. We've moved from 39 corporate loan platforms down to south of 20. We've got 20 cash equities execution platforms down to one. We've reduced the six reporting ledgers down to one, 11 sanctioned platforms down to one. So, we've been making considerable progress over the past couple of years. With that said, there's a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work. If you think about Citi, we've got 11,000 global total reg reports, right? So, we've got to make sure that the data that's going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be, but more importantly, that we're doing it efficiently that it doesn't take thousands of people to reconcile that information. And so, this is an end-to-end process in the way we're approaching it. One example is the 2052a liquidity report that we have. It has 750,000 lines of data, and that data is -- it's important again that we're efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures that it's of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it. Operator : The next question comes from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thank you. So, Mark, I heard your comments on credit this year -- I'm talking US Personal Banking. I heard your comments for credit for the rest of this year and I think in a position that you're very conservative reserves. But right now, you put up a 3% margin, credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in the space. I guess, my question is, as we roll forward, in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower some rate cuts, how does the P&L evolve? How does it improve from here? Because can we be expecting credit cost to come in a slowing economy? I'm just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful that USPB obviously marches to where you need it to be. Mark Mason : Yeah. Look, like I said, we do think that there is certainly upside to USPB. We're looking for that upside in the medium-term targets that we've set for ourselves. You got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half, frankly that we're still in a period where we're seeing the normalization of the cost of credit. And as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, you have kind of a compounding [Technical Difficulty] now maturing at the same time that's playing through the P&L, that's not just true for us, that's true for others as well. And so, we'd expect and we are -- we do believe we're seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now. And so, we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium-term. At the same time, we're investing in the business and we're looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top-line. And the combination of those things as we drive towards the medium-term will help us to deliver both the top-line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in-line with what we've guided to. So, it's a combination of top-line performance from volume, and obviously, the environment plays into that, but we feel like we've got a reasonable assumption around top-line growth there, cost of credit normalizing, continued discipline on the expense line, allowing for us to get improved returns across that USPB business. Glenn Schorr : Okay. I appreciate all of that. And one quickie on DCM. You had amazingly good performance. There's been plenty of conversation about pull-forward this year on just refi driving like three quarters of the activity. Could you just help us think through the second half, when thinking about DCM and just to make sure that we don't like start modeling this into perpetuity? Jane Fraser : Look, I think when we think about the back half of '24, we're going to see a different mix of activity in Banking. We do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because you've got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years. But we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half, getting ahead of potential market volatility. So, if you put it all together, I think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative and as well as to a continued deal-making with M&A being a bit larger in the overall mix, although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that. Mark Mason : Yeah. The only thing I'd add to that is, look, the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple of things. So, one, the return of a more normalized IPO market; two, the direction of volatility of interest rates; the ongoing global conflicts that we're all kind of seeing and witnessing; and then finally, as Jane mentioned in her remarks, the elections and what those outcomes look like, not just in the US but abroad. And so, there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet, but as we said, we believe we're well-positioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense. Operator : The next question is from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Just Mark, maybe on NII down almost 4% year-over-year, it seems a little bit more than the guidance, but down modestly for the year. So, can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year? Mark Mason : Yeah. So, I'd say a couple of things. So, one, as I mentioned, in the quarter, and if you see it on Slide 9, ex-Markets were down about 3%. That's largely driven by some FX translation that played through, but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in Argentina. And what that is in Argentina, we have capital there, the policy rate was adjusted downward, and as that happened, we obviously earn less on that capital that flows through the NII line. As I think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down, there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind. So, one is going to be rates, right? So, as I think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment, that will be a tailwind that plays through from an NII point of view. The second would be volume growth, particularly in our card loans portfolio. And we do expect to see continued volume growth across the -- certainly the branded portfolio and so that will be another tailwind for us on the NII line. In terms of the headwinds, you've got the lower NII earned in Argentina from rates that will continue to play through. We've got assumed higher average betas in 2024, specifically on the non-US side. We still have in our forecast the impact of CFPB late fee. So, assuming that that goes into effect for this year, that will have an impact and it's in the forecast. And then, the impact of lost NII from the exits that we have. And so, the combination of those things will probably mean that NII in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half, but again, consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down. Jim Mitchell : That's helpful. And maybe just quickly kind of a similar question on expenses, better-than-expected this quarter, but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges. I think to get to the high end of your range, you'd have to be up a little bit in the back half from 2Q run rate, is that because you expect more repositioning/restructuring in the second half, or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here? Mark Mason : Yeah. So that's right. When I talked about at the first quarter, I talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after Q1. The second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting. I'm sticking with the guidance and that does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in -- will come in higher than the second quarter. That's a combination of a couple of things, including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done. It also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise. And then, the second quarter did -- yes, the second quarter did have a one-time or so in some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items. So, yes, the second quarter will -- the third and fourth quarter, the back half will be higher than the second quarter, but consistent with the guidance that I've given. Operator : The next question is from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. I had two questions, and I'll ask the first one on expenses first since it's a good follow-up to the previous. Mark, just to clarify, let's just say take the highest end-of-year range at $53.8 billion, just trying to think about how consensus will move. So, we take that $53.8 billion and then add the $285 million of FDIC expenses year-to-date so far and add the civil money penalties of $136 million, so that gets us to $54.2 billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the $53.8 billion? Mark Mason : So, yes, the answer to last part of your question is yes. So, in the range that I've given, $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges. That range excludes the FDIC special assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the CMP of $136 million. Erika Najarian : Got it. And my second question is for Jane. I mean, I'm sure you're getting tired of the question on capital return. So you're buying back $1 billion -- you plan to buy back $1 billion this quarter. It looks like you didn't buy back any in the second quarter. And I'm asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly $1 billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher. And I guess, is the $1 billion number a catch-up pace because you didn't buy back any in the second quarter? And I fully appreciate that you also have the Banamex IPO coming, which is different from peers that are also waiting for Basel clarification, but I'm just wondering, do we need to wait for that Banamex IPO for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quarter-to-quarter guidance? And also, of course, I just want to readdress the beginning of the question when I asked specifically about the pace. Jane Fraser : Okay. So, we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks. We are going to continue to give quarterly -- and make it a quarterly determination as to the level. And a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes. I think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our stress capital buffer, reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out, but with the regulatory changes uncertain and we are -- that's one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance. Mark Mason : Yeah. That's right. On the first part of your question, Erika, I'd say, look, we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for Q2 [Technical Difficulty] Q3, as we talked about would be at $1 billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level. As Jane mentioned, we'll take it quarter-by-quarter from here. Operator : The next question is from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Thank you. Hi, Jane. Hi, Mark. Mark Mason : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses, the three factors that you gave us, can you also talk about if this was a factor at all for you folks? Was there any FICO score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses? And as part of the credit card question, you mentioned the CFPB, the fees that you have factored them, the lower fees, you factor that into your forward look, where do we stand on that? Do you guys have any color on that as well? Mark Mason : Yeah. So, on the first part of the question, look, we all kind of have talked about in the past the prospect of FICO inflation back during the COVID period of time. We've been very, very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that we've made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that we've been bringing on. In light of the environment, we have looked at moving towards higher FICO scores for new account acquisitions. But as I think about what we're seeing now, there is that dichotomy that I mentioned where we have the higher FICO score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances in savings and it's really the lower FICO band customers where we're seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and more borrowing. And so, the FICO inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point. And in terms of the CFPB, late fees, well, I don't have an update on that. Like I said, we've built in an assumption in the -- in our forecast, but in terms of the timing, I don't have a formal update on the certainty of it. Operator : The next question is from Ken Usdin with Jefferies. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ken Usdin : Hey, thanks, good morning. Hey, Mark, talking about the NII outlook and the fact that now we've got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between US rates, maybe higher for longer, and then the beginnings of some of the non-US curves starting to at least put forth their first cut, I know we've got that good chart that you have in the Qs about the relative contributions, can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how you're thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between US-related NII and non-US-related NII as you go forward? Mark Mason : Yeah, thank you. So look, I think that as we look at it out through the -- certainly through the medium-term, we expect to see continued NII growth at obviously a modest level, certainly lower than what we've seen historically. And that's in large part because -- or in-part, I should say, because of how we've been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning. In some instances, they were five-year terms on some of these investments. And so, we still think there's some upside from a reinvestment point of view. The point you make around kind of non-US dollar or US rates kind of coming off, that will play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that we're expecting outside of the US. And so, we've assumed that we have higher betas pickup outside of the US. If rates kind of come off in a more substantive way, then we could see kind of a little less NII pressure than we're forecasting there. But net-net, as I think about the combination of volume growth that we're expecting between loans and deposits over that medium-term, the higher yield we can earn on our assets, combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio, offsetting some of that beta, we believe will have continued NII growth. As I think about what I often point to in terms of the IRE analysis and you have to remember that, that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously across currencies. And in that case, the 100 basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative $1.6 billion, with about $1.3 billion of that coming from non-US dollar. But again, that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesn't account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that I mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that we'd be able to earn. Ken Usdin : Got it. Okay. And just one follow-up on the OCC amendment, and that's specifically related to the resource review plan. Do you have a line-of-sight on how long that will take you guys to finish because it seems like -- and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language that's written in the order? Jane Fraser : So, Ken, look, the Resource Review Plan is just that it's a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance with the order. Essentially, if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be, we'll determine what additional resourcing, if any, is required to get back on track, and then we'll share that with the OCC in a more formalized way than we do today. We obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves. We're already working on the plan after it's finalized with the OCC. So, it will be confidential supervisory information that we can't disclose. So, we won't be able to tell you that the plan is -- whether the plan -- what the nature of the plan is going to be, but it won't be much more complicated than what we talked about. And we're expecting to get it, we're not expecting this to take long. Operator : The next question is from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good afternoon. Mark Mason : Hello. Jane Fraser : Hi, Betsy. Betsy Graseck : Okay. So, I know we talked a lot about expenses. I just have one kind of overarching question here, which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term as we have kind of come quite a long way in the simplification process, maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are? And overlapping with the regulatory requirements, do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards regulatory requirements being a bit heavier than what's left on simplification from here? Thanks. Mark Mason : So, thank you, Betsy. I guess, I'd say a couple of things. So, I think we said it in the past, so the target for the medium-term, I think 2026 is somewhere around $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. As we've said, we'll have about $1.5 billion in savings related to the restructuring that we've done and another $500 million to $1 billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that medium-term period. And so, we've made, I think, very good headway, as Jane has mentioned in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that, those saves will -- have started to generate some of those saves in the early part of that, meaning this year will likely be offset by continued investment that we're making in areas of the business like transformation, but also in business-led or driven growth. And you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards 2026 and achieving that range. Jane Fraser : And I just want to reiterate, we remain confident that we will meet our 11% to 12% RoTCE target over the medium-term. And we've got the -- we have the ability to manage the different elements we've been talking about today, making sure that we're investing sufficient resources into the transformation, so we can be on-track with that, as well as in our businesses, as well as the return of capital to our shareholders. And so, we feel confident around that and good about that we can manage this. Mark Mason : Yeah, I think that's a great point, Jane. Look, the reality is, as was pointed out earlier, we spent about $3 billion last year, a little bit under that on the transformation-related work. And the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year. And frankly, in the first half of the year, as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that Jane and I have mentioned earlier in the year that we've been focused on like data and data related to regulatory reporting, we've had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half, right? And we've done that and we funded that. We've been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that we've given for the full year. So, we are managing this entire expense base, right? So, not -- the whole $53-plus billion of it, we are actively managing that with an eye towards what's required from a transformation point of view to keep it on-track, to accelerate in areas where we're behind, and to shore up areas where we are tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are there other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base. And so, things like the work that Andy Sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that we've been able to tease out of the business. Things that we have done in parts of USPB and that we have continued to get up there in parts of Banking, which you see in the down 10% this quarter are areas where we've been keenly focused on, where are there duplicative roles, where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of. So, long-winded way of saying, we understand the expense guidance that we've given. We also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with what's required and we are doing both. Betsy Graseck : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Appreciate that. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Okay, let me just clarify this, Mark and Jane, just to make sure that we all have it right. The $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the Resource Review Plan, meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order, am I right there? Jane Fraser : No, you're not right. So, I think -- as you've heard us talk about, Vivek, for a while now that we knew the areas that we were behind in elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments, some of that is in people, some of that is in our technology spend, it's using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year. And you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators, who pointed to the fact that we've already begun addressing the areas that we're behind. Mark? Mark Mason : That's right, Jane. What you have heard is that, despite having to spend more, some $250 million or so more, we're not changing the guidance, right? And so, we have -- as Jane mentioned, we have worked on areas already that we've needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance. Vivek Juneja : Okay. So, going forward, even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators, we should not expect any change to this expense? Mark Mason : Look, the plan -- the Resource Review Plan, as Jane mentioned, is what we're working through now with the regulators. That will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have. Appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution. If you think about what that will entail, it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas, being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that we've got proper funding allocated to get it back on track. And that's me framing out how I think about what something like this might look like. And so, what we're saying is that, if we identify issues in the quarters to come that we haven't identified already, that's the process we're going to apply to those issues. And as you've heard us say repeatedly, we're going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track, and as we've done thus far this year, we're going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds. I hope that's clear. Operator : The next question is from Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt O'Connor: Hi. Apologies if I missed it in the opening remarks, but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from 1Q to 2Q? It looks like they were down about 6% in aggregate even though average loans went up, spending went up. What was the driver of that? Mark Mason : Credit card revenues seasonality... Jane Fraser : Yeah. Seasonality... Mark Mason : Seasonality playing through there. Jane Fraser : Sequentially. Mark Mason : Yeah, sequentially. Yeah. Jane Fraser : I think if you look year-over-year, you'll be able to see a pretty common trend there. The consumer is slowing in some of the -- in the spend, as Mark had referred to Matt, but -- and a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and the underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer. Mark Mason : Yeah, I think there's also the dynamic on the CRS of the reward -- across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other. So, the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there. Jane Fraser : But nothing that's particularly worrying us, Matt. Matt O'Connor: Okay. And then, just separately on -- the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks, you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what can be upstreamed from the bank to the holding company because of the OCC thing that came out this week. Like, for all intents and purposes, like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital? I understood the comment, no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company, but is there any impact from that, that we would notice on the outside? Thank you. Jane Fraser : Look, the -- let's be clear. This action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders. The dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from CBNA to the parents. So, first of all, don't confuse what a dividend is here. We will -- it's not going to impact how we run the company, the subsidiary, the capital or the liquidity at all, and the dividends are not capped. Mark Mason : Yeah. I think the -- Jane, that's right. And I think let's not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there. And the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that we're funding and allocating the effort appropriately, right? So, the regulators want essentially the same thing we want, right, is for us to get this done, right? And so, that is the primary objective. The reference to the dividending from out of CBNA up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that Resource Review Plan, but as Jane mentioned that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do. And as opposed to -- it's not a cap. What it is, is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other non-discretionary obligations would require a non-objection from the OCC. Jane Fraser : Until the resource plan is agreed... Mark Mason : Until the resource plan... Jane Fraser : And as you'll have seen the resource plan needs to be submitted within 30 days. And as I indicated, we're working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem. Operator : The next question is from Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hi, good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Just -- I guess I just want to follow-up on the latter question. I just want to be very clear. So, the -- what you're saying is that the requirement that CBNA receive a non-objection to before dividending upstream to the parent, that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility, how you think about -- it doesn't restrict you in any way and shouldn't impact, for example, your ability to benefit from -- for example, a Basel endgame rule that is softened or some of the benefits, Mark, that you talked about in terms of simplification. So, you don't see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out? Mark Mason : No. No, I don't. Saul Martinez : Okay. That's fair enough. That's clear as it can be. Good. Mark Mason : Thank you. Saul Martinez : Second question on, I just want to follow-up on USPB. I mean, I still -- I get the point that you're seeing normalization in losses in cards, but even if I adjust for reserve builds, your RoTCE is still single-digit. I would think even at these NCL levels, your cards business is pretty profitable. You're a scale player. I mean, you're above sort of pre-pandemic levels, but not -- I don't know if I -- it doesn't seem like it's that much higher by a dramatic amount. It would seem to imply that the retail bank is a huge drag on profitability even maybe even losing money, I don't know. But can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the retail bank profitability and just give any more color that you can in terms of the path to get to that high-teen RoTCE that you talked about? Jane Fraser : Yeah, let me let me kick-off there. And let's say, look, clearly, we're very focused on improving the returns in USPB to get us to the high-teens level over the medium term. And you've seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter. We've had a number of quarters of good revenue growth. And as Mark said, however, we're at the low point of the credit cycle. We knew this year we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated NCLs and some of the industry headwinds we've talked about. But as the NCL rates approach steady-state levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds as those take hold, we expect the returns will improve and support the medium -- the firm-wide medium-term targets. In the retail bank, we're continuing to focus on growing share in our six core markets and we're doing that leveraging our physical and digital assets and it plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we are looking at in our Wealth franchise. We are continuing to improve our operating efficiency, being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the retail bank network. But we're at the high point of the credit cycle, it's driving the low point for USPB, and as I said in my remarks, we're expecting to see those returns improve from here. Operator : The next question is from Steven Chubak with Wolfe Research. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Steven Chubak : Hi, good afternoon. So, Mark, I have a fairly technical question on DTA utilization and specifically the NOLs. The deduction is still fairly significant at $12 billion. It roughly equates to about 10% of your market cap. And the good news here, I suppose is that it should come back into capital over time, but we've seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable. And so, wanted to better understand is, what's constraining your ability to utilize those DTAs? And are there catalysts on the horizon that can actually help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation? Mark Mason : Mason Yeah, thank you. So, I'm going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question. It really comes down to driving US income, right? And so, we are focused on not just all of the things that we've mentioned, but driving higher income in the US that allows for us to utilize the disallowed DTA. We saw some of that in the quarter, and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium-term, but that is the major driver of that utilization. And... Jane Fraser : And we've got our -- and we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well. So, winning in the US is a very important leg, for example, of the strategy that this is refreshing. Similarly, we see opportunities in -- from the commercial bank, we see it in Wealth, we see it in obviously in US Personal Banking and in Services. So, we're very -- we're focused from a business strategy point of view on this not just from the financial side. Steven Chubak : Yeah, thank you both for that color. And maybe just a quick follow-up. Just on the retail services business, we are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates. I was hoping you could just speak to what you're seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers? Jane Fraser : Well, I think you'll be delighted to hear that we're very focused on returns rather than just on revenues. So, when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new RFP for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with Dillard's, it's all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue side of things. And it's a shift probably from some of the ways in the past, but I'm very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and we're seeing the benefits of it. Mark Mason : And that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space, but as Jane mentioned, we're keenly focused on ensuring that, yes, we have a good partnership, but that we're generating an appropriate return. That's part of achieving our medium-term targets. And as you know, since you brought up retail cards, I mean, when we think about how CECL works in the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships, we're establishing full lifetime reserves that's on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics. So, it's another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us. Jane Fraser : And Mark and I have no problem saying no to revenue that doesn't come at the right returns and being very disciplined around that. Operator : The next question is from Vivek Juneja with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Sorry, just a follow-up on this whole consent order stuff, Jane. What do you think this does in terms of timing? How much longer for you to sort of get this past you? Are you talking couple of years? Is it now longer by a year? Any sense of that? Any sense of helping us think through that? Jane Fraser : Look, in terms of the consent order and the areas we've had delays, there are four areas to the consent order; it's risk management, it's data governance, it's around compliance, and it's around control. As we've said, we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and we've been investing to address the areas that we were behind. We also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting. So, we added some more bodies of work there and we are well underway. So, we are not expecting this to extend on the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order. We have a target state for the different areas of it. We have the plan to achieve those target states. We'll make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so. We'll try and get this done as quickly, but as robustly as possible. And we're doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than what I would call the old city way, which is a series of band-aids that remediate, but don't actually fix the underlying issue. And that way, we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because we're putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all, but I'm not expecting this to change the timeframes. Vivek Juneja : Thank you. Operator : The final question comes from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just two clarifications. So, this is a very high-profile amendment to the consent order. And I think what I hear you saying, but if you can confirm, your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grades. It's really the data. And as it relates to the data, you're talking about, 11,000 regulatory reports, some of which have 750,000 lines of data. Is that really the scope of what you need to fix? Because people see this externally and say, hey, you're failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency, but I think I hear you saying it's really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting, which is important, but more of a slice of a broader picture. Is that correct? Jane Fraser : Yeah. Mike, maybe I just -- you're asking a great and it's an important question. So maybe I try and explain what we -- the data elements because it's an area that Mark and I have pointed to. So, first of all, we use data all over the firm. We use it to deliver 72 million customer statements every month. Our corporate clients, that you heard about at our Service Investor Day access account data real-time across multiple countries on CitiDirect, and we're moving $5 trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world. We trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms. We can see our liquidity positions real-time around the world. This can only be done if you've got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems. So -- but what is the transformation doing? What it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and it's about upgrading the management and governance over those flows. And we -- as I've said, we're doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure. So, what are we doing? We're making sure we're capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation. We will often talk about this smart system, make sure there's no errors when we book a trade. We've seen our error rate down 85% as a result of it. We're housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories. They're the golden sources, Olympus and Data Hub, which you've heard me talk about a few times. And they're a golden source now for all of the downstream data use, populating the thousands of regulatory reports Mark talked about and other areas. And what a single repository means is that the data models, the data quality rules, the controls you put in place to govern and manage that data, they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically. Mark has been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure. You've heard us talk about a single full-suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we've had in the past. And we're delivering all of this through consolidated systems, through the automation and streamlining of data flows. So, instead of being in multiple pipes, the flows go through single pipes. So, it's a -- sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment, but I think it's important to understand what it is, because it's a lot of work. It's a strategic overhaul. It's not a series of tactical fixes. Where we're behind, as we do the work on data, we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place. There's some more areas to address and we knew back when we did the plan. So, we've -- and we've also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well. It's more comprehensive than originally planned. So, what we're doing? We're adding resources and data experts. We're learning from best practices. And we're using some great AI and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much quickly. We're also to the -- to some of the culture side, we're learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprise-wide manner. So, all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors, more revenue opportunities, better client service, fewer buffers, drive more efficiencies, and hope at the end of -- the end goal here is, it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm. That is the data plan. Clearly, there's a very important element of it related to the consent orders. We're behind in a few areas. We're investing. We've already begun that investment, as Mark and I have talked about, to get it done, we'll get it done. Mark Mason : The only thing I'll add... Mike Mayo : Real short follow-up... Mark Mason : Sorry. What was that, Mike? Mike Mayo : Yeah, just to say -- real short follow-up to that. So you're doing all this great stuff, but you still fell short. Just in, like, one sentence, despite doing all this great stuff that you described, the regulators still said you didn't get it done. Why after doing all that, didn't you get that it done in the eyes of the regulators and why won't be fixed now? Just like a one-sentence explanation for that if you have it? Jane Fraser : I always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear. We have many steps forward. We have setbacks, we adjust, we learn from them, we move forward, and we get back on track. Mark Mason : And Mike, if I could just put one number into context, because you played back the 11,000, which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here. There are probably 15 to 30 that are core US reports that are pivotal to our US regulators. And a lot of what we're discussing here is about ensuring that we're prioritizing the data that impacts those 15 to 30 reports as we work through this. Operator : There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks. Jenn Landis : Thank you all for joining us. Please let us know if you have any follow-up questions. Thank you.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jennifer Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our third quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials, as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. Well, we certainly live in interesting times, and while I usually start our calls with our views on the global macro-environment, we're particularly proud of our progress this quarter and so I shall start there. Indeed, in a pivotal year, this quarter contains multiple proof points that we are moving in the right direction and that our strategy is delivering concrete results. We saw revenue growth and positive operating leverage for the firm and across all five businesses. Our businesses performed well as the rate-cutting cycle began with a double-digit increase in fee-based revenues, reflecting the growing diversity of our earnings mix. We continue to have share gains in services and banking. In wealth, we saw a sizable increase in client investments and flows. We brought expenses down, whilst continuing to invest in our transformation and businesses, and we continued to attract the top leaders in the industry and successfully combine them with our own teams in banking and wealth. So, while we are not yet where we want to be, the impact of the changes we're making is clearly evident in our momentum and our improving performance. Turning to the macro. Now while growth is a notch slower than last year, global economic performance continues to be surprisingly resilient. Whatever you want to call the US landing, the sentiment around it is more optimistic, supported by the recent positive payrolls report. And we see a healthy yet more discerning US consumer and a US corporate sector on its front foot. Manufacturing weakness is restraining a modest rebound in Europe, which continues to struggle with more structural challenges around its competitiveness as highlighted by Draghi's report. And in China, consumer sentiment and the property market remain a concern as markets await details on the expected fiscal stimulus. India, ASEAN, Japan, the Middle East, Mexico, and Brazil are all notable bright spots globally. Today, we reported net income of $3.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.51 with an RoTCE of 7%. Overall revenues grew by 3% ex-divestitures, with each of our core businesses delivering growth and positive operating leverage. While we continue to make substantial investments in our transformation, the efficiencies gained from our simplification and other efforts drove a 2% reduction in overall expenses. Turning to the five businesses. Services delivered a record quarter with revenues up by 8%. Fee growth, the best indicator of underlying momentum was significant. And this combined with loan and deposit volume growth drove this quarter's excellent performance. Treasury and Trade Solutions was up 4% year-over-year, reflecting good underlying momentum in the core drivers. And Security Services was up 24%, reflecting the benefit of new mandates and an increase in assets under custody. Both TTS and Security Services achieved over 10% wallet share in our target markets through the first half of the year. Last week, we announced that we are the first global bank to complete the integration of our cross-border services with Mastercard Move. Now this will ultimately enable near-instant secure payments to the vast Mastercard debit network, starting with 14 markets with more to come early next year. And this is another great example of our continued investment in market-leading innovations. In Markets, revenues were up slightly on the back of a better-than-expected September. Equities was up 32% with robust performance across all products. Our continued strong performance in Equities validates both our strategy and execution to grow Prime and Cash. Fixed Income, however, was down 6%. Our Rates and Currencies business didn't match last year's standout performance. It was a particularly pleasing quarter in banking. Despite the muted IPO market, investment banking fees are up 44%, that's driven by investment-grade debt issuance as our clients pulled forward activity ahead of the US election. Corporate sentiment remains positive as Boards pursue strategic transactions such as the $36 billion Mars acquisition of Kellanova, where we are the sole advisor and the lead financier. Our strategy in banking continues to gain momentum. We are steadily growing our share in key target sectors, such as healthcare and tech with a healthy pipeline ahead and a significant upside of our franchise continues to attract the top talent to Citi. During the quarter, we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our long-time client Apollo, giving us the ability to source new transactions without using our balance sheet. This partnership positions us with another solution for debt financing for our clients and it allows us to engage in private credit with the same depths and expertise as we currently do with syndicated debt markets. We are also starting to see the positive impact of the significant changes we've implemented in our Wealth franchise with revenues up 9%. It's a notable example of the traction that I referenced earlier. As Andy and the team intensify the focus on our Investments business, we grew client investment assets by 24% and we were particularly pleased with the performance in Asia and in Citigold. I continue to be excited by the opportunities and the sheer potential of our franchise. During the quarter, we signed an agreement to exit trust administration and fiduciary services as we continue to sharpen the focus of our Wealth business. We have more to do to reach our medium-term margin and return targets, but this quarter is a good indicator that we are on the way there. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%. We grew Branded Cards' revenues by 8% with account acquisitions, spend and payment rates, all driving higher interest-earning balances. Lower discretionary spending is impacting our retail services portfolio. However, we continue to see lower payment rates contributing to interest earning balances. In retail banking, we are growing our mortgage portfolio as the rate environment shifts, as well as growing overall loans. The US consumer dynamics remain remarkably consistent with prior quarters. Our customers are healthy, but more discerning in their spend with signs of stress isolated to the lower FICOs. We have maintained strong credit discipline and our card portfolios continue to perform very much in line with our expectations. In terms of capital, while uncertainty about the Basel III Endgame prevails, our capital position remains very robust and we ended the quarter with a CET1 ratio of 13.7%. During the quarter, we returned $2.1 billion in capital, including the repurchase of $1 billion of common shares. We will continue to repurchase stock as we evaluate the right level on a quarterly basis. As you know, our transformation is our number one priority. This quarter, we closed another longstanding consent order, which related to the effectiveness of our anti-money laundering systems. We have increased our investments in areas where we have not made sufficient progress such as data quality management. I and the management team remain steadfast and determined to get this transformation right and to get this done. We will close out this pivotal year with momentum and with determination to continue to improve performance in each business and the firm overall. We are committed to meeting our revenue and expense targets for the year, as well as our return target for the medium term. I am very proud of our senior leadership and the entire organization as we demonstrate the potential of our unique global franchise. It is a privilege to lead this firm. With that, I would like to turn it over to Mark, and then we will be delighted, as always, to take your questions. Mark Mason : Thanks, Jane, and good morning, everyone. I'm going to start with the firm-wide financial results, focusing on year-over-year comparisons for the third quarter unless I indicate otherwise. And then spend a little more time on the businesses. On Slide 5, we show financial results for the full firm. For the quarter, we reported net income of approximately $3.2 billion, EPS of $1.51, and an RoTCE of 7% on $20.3 billion of revenues. Total revenues were up 1% on a reported basis. Excluding divestiture-related impacts, revenues were up 3%, driven by growth across each of our businesses. As you can see on the bottom-left side of the page, net interest income, excluding markets was down 1% year-over-year, largely due to lower interest rates in Argentina. And non-interest revenue, excluding markets was up 9% as we continued to see strong fee momentum across services, banking, and wealth. Year-to-date revenues were up 1% on a reported basis and are up 3% excluding divestiture-related impacts. Expenses were $13.3 billion, down 2%, largely driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification and stranded cost reductions, partially offset by volume related expenses and continued investments in the transformation and other risk and control initiatives. Year-to-date, expenses are up 1%, primarily driven by the FDIC special assessment and civil money penalties. Cost of credit was $2.7 billion, largely driven by net credit losses in card, as well as ACL builds across the businesses, primarily for portfolio growth and mix. At the end of the quarter, we had over $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 2.7%, and year-to-date, excluding the divestiture-related impacts, we generated positive operating leverage for the firm and reported an RoTCE of 7.2%. On Slide 6, we show the expense trend over the past five quarters. This quarter, we reported expenses of $13.3 billion, down 2% and 1% sequentially. As we've said before, we will continue to increase our investments to address data governance and data quality related to regulatory reporting and are committed to spending whatever is necessary to address these areas and the transformation more broadly. Although a lot more work remains, we have started to see benefits from our prior investments play through. We've continued to simplify our technology infrastructure, retiring over 450 applications year-to-date and now over 1,250 since our 2022 Investor Day. We've upgraded 100% of our over 2,300 ATMs in North America and Asia Pacific to next-gen software for better customer security and monitoring. And we've streamlined our cloud onboarding process, reducing time to onboard applications to the public cloud from over seven weeks to two weeks. Each of these initiatives will result in both improvement of our operating efficiency and our safety and soundness. And in terms of our full-year expenses, we continue to expect that we will be at the higher end of the guidance range of $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties. And as we've said before, we, of course, will continue to look for opportunities to absorb the Civil Money Penalties. On Slide 7, we show net interest income, loans, and deposits where I'll speak to sequential variances. In the third quarter, net interest income declined 1%. Excluding markets, net interest income was up 4%, largely driven by volume growth in USPB, as well as higher deposit spreads in services and wealth. NIM declined by 8 basis points, driven by a decline in markets due to seasonally higher dividends in the second quarter. Average loans were up 1%, driven by growth in services and USPB, partially offset by modest declines in Banking and Legacy Franchise. Average deposits were roughly flat as growth in Services was largely offset by a decline in Legacy Franchise. And as you think about guidance for NII ex-markets in the fourth quarter, as short-end rates continue to come down, we expect a headwind on floating-rate assets, which will be somewhat offset by disciplined deposit pricing. Further offsetting that will be a continued benefit from securities being reinvested at higher yield. And as a reminder, we expect an ongoing NII headwind as Legacy Franchises loans and deposits continue to come down. So taking all of this into account, we expect NII ex-markets to be roughly flat sequentially in the fourth quarter and for the full year to be slightly down, better than we had previously guided. On Slide 8, we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics, which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework. Across our cards portfolio, approximately 85% of our loans are to consumers with FICO scores of 660 or higher. Based on what we see, the US consumer continues to remain healthy and resilient. Spend and payment rates continue to normalize and underlying credit performance remains broadly in line with our expectations. NCLs increased year-over-year as card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years continue to mature at the same time. Sequentially, NCLs declined while delinquencies increased, both in line with historical third quarter seasonality. Absent this seasonality, we continue to see stabilization in early-stage delinquencies. We remain well reserved with a reserve-to-funded loan ratio of approximately 8.2% for our US card portfolio. Our corporate portfolio is largely investment-grade and corporate non-accrual loans remained low at 31 basis points. As such, we feel very comfortable with the over $22 billion of total reserves that we have in the current environment. Turning to Slide 9, we provide details on our balance sheet, capital, and liquidity, which are a reflection of our risk appetite, strategy, and business model. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base is well-diversified across regions, industries, customers, and account types. $840 billion are corporate, spanning 90 countries, and are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world. The majority of our remaining deposits, about $400 billion are well-diversified across the Private Bank, Citigold, Retail, and Wealth and Work offerings. And of our total deposits, roughly 70% are US dollar-denominated with the remainder spanning over 60 currencies. Our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework. Our $689 billion loan portfolio is well-diversified across consumer and corporate loans. In the quarter, deposit growth outpaced loan growth, resulting in higher cash balances, which contributed to available liquidity resources of approximately $960 billion. We continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities, which position us well to serve our clients and execute on our growth strategy. On Slide 10, we show the sequential CET1 walk to provide more detail on the drivers this quarter. First, we generated $3 billion of net income to common shareholders, which added 27 basis points. Second, we returned $2.1 billion in the form of common dividends and share repurchases, which drove a reduction of 18 basis points. Third, we generated 12 basis points from unrealized AFS gain. And finally, the remaining 9 basis point reduction was driven by an increase in RWA as we continue to invest in accretive growth opportunities. We ended the third quarter with a preliminary CET1 capital ratio of 13.7%, relative to our target of 13.3%. As a reminder, effective October 1st, our new CET1 capital ratio requirement is 12.1%, and we still plan on holding a 100 basis point management buffer on top of that for now. As we think about the coming quarters, there are a few things that we will continue to consider as we manage our capital levels, including client demand, as well as how the macro and Basel III Endgame evolves. We will take all of this into account as it relates to capital levels and the level of share repurchases on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Turning to the businesses on Slide 11. In Services, revenues were up 8%, reflecting continued momentum across Security Services and TTS, both of which continued to gain share through the first half of this year. Net interest income was roughly flat as the benefit of higher deposit volume was largely offset by a decline in interest rates in Argentina. On a sequential basis, net interest income was up 7%, driven by volume growth as we continue to onboard high-quality operating deposits and the benefit from higher deposit spread. Non-interest revenue increased 33% driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers in TTS and security services. Excluding the impact of the Argentine peso devaluation, NIR increased 11%, driven by growth in cross-border transactions, US dollar clearing volumes, and commercial card volume. Expenses increased 3%, primarily driven by investments in technology, other risk and controls, and product innovation, including the expansion of the CitiDirect commercial banking platform into additional markets. Cost of credit was $127 million, primarily driven by a build related to unremittable corporate dividends being held on behalf of clients. Average loans increased 5%, primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance, as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.7 billion and continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 26.4% for the quarter and 24.7% year-to-date. On Slide 12, we show the results for markets for the third quarter. Markets' revenues were up 1%, driven by growth in equities, partially offset by a decline in fixed income. Equities revenues increased 32%, driven by momentum in Prime with balances up approximately 22%, growth in derivatives, and higher cash volume. Fixed income revenues decreased 6%, driven by rates and currencies, which was down 10%, partially offset by spread products and other fixed income, which was up 5%. While rates and currencies declined from last year, which was the strongest third quarter in the previous 10 years, we did see good momentum in FX from increased corporate client activity. Spread products and other fixed income was higher, driven by financing securitization volumes and underwriting fees, partially offset by lower commodities on lower gas volatility. Expenses increased 1%, primarily due to higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $141 million, driven by an ACL build primarily related to portfolio mix and spread product. Average loans increased 10%, largely driven by asset-backed lending and spread products as well as margin loans in equity. Average trading account assets increased 18%, largely driven by client demand for US treasuries, foreign government securities, and mortgage-backed securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately $1.1 billion with an RoTCE of 7.9% for the quarter and 9.7% year-to-date. On Slide 13, we show the results for banking for the third quarter. Banking revenues were up 16%, largely driven by growth in investment banking. Investment banking revenues were up 31% and fees were up 44% with increases across debt capital markets, advisory, and equity capital markets. DCM benefited from continued strong investment-grade issuance. Advisory benefited from strong announced deal volume earlier this year. And in ECM, we saw a stronger follow-on activity, which was offset by fewer IPOs amid market volatility in August. Both year-to-date and in the quarter, we've driven wallet share gain, including in the healthcare and technology sectors where we've been investing. Corporate lending revenues, excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges increased 5%, primarily driven by a smaller impact from currency devaluation in Argentina. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reductions as we continue to right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $177 million, driven by an ACL build primarily for portfolio mix changes. Average loans decreased 1% as we maintained strict discipline around returns. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the third quarter in a row and delivered net income of $238 million with an RoTCE of 4.3% for the quarter and 7.2% year-to-date. On Slide 14, we show the results for Wealth for the third quarter. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenue was up 9% driven by a 15% increase in NIR as we grew investment fee revenues on momentum in client investment assets, which grew 24%. NII increased 6%, driven by higher deposit volumes and spreads. Expenses decreased 4%, driven by the continued benefit of headcount reductions as we right-size the workforce and expense base. Cost of credit was $33 million, largely driven by net credit losses of $27 million. End of period client balances increased 14%, driven by higher client investment assets and deposits, both in North America and internationally. Average deposits increased 4%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher-yielding investments on Citi's platform. Average loans decreased 1% as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $283 million with an RoTCE of 8.5% for the quarter and 6.8% year-to-date. On Slide 15, we show the results for US Personal Banking for the third quarter. US Personal Banking revenues were up 3%, driven by NII growth of 2% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 8% with interest-earning balances growth of 8% as payment rates continued to normalize and we continue to see growth in spend volume, which were up 3%. Retail services revenues were down 1% due to a slowing growth rate in interest-earning balance. Retail banking revenues decreased 8%, driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. Expenses decreased 1%, driven by continuous productivity focus, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was $1.9 billion, largely driven by net credit losses and a modest build for volume growth. We continue to expect branded cards to be in the 3.5% to 4% NCL range for the full year. In Retail Services, we continue to expect to be around the high end of the 5.75% to 6.25% range for the full year, driven by both the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as well as lower sales activity at our partners. Average deposits decreased 23%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposit to our wealth business. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $522 million with an RoTCE of 8.2% for the quarter and 5.2% year-to-date. As we've said before, the USPB segment creates a lot of value for the firm. We knew 2024 would be a tough year as we lap the credit costs, but we have a path to higher returns. We will continue to drive revenue growth through product innovation while improving the operating efficiency of the business and at the same time, we expect the credit environment to normalize, all of which will ultimately drive USPB to a high-teens return over the medium term. On Slide 16, we show results for All Other on a managed basis, which includes Corporate Other and Legacy Franchises and excludes divestiture-related items. Revenues decreased 18%, primarily driven by closed, exits and winddowns as well as margin compression on mortgage securities that have extended. Expenses were down 5% as the reduction from closed, exits and winddowns was partially offset by a legal reserve. And cost of credit was $289 million, largely driven by net credit losses and an ACL build in Mexico. Slide 17 shows our full-year 2024 outlook and medium-term guidance. We generated $61.6 billion of revenue year-to-date, driven by NIR ex-markets growth of 12%, and are on track to meet our $80 billion to $81 billion full year guidance. As I mentioned, we now expect NII ex-markets to be slightly down for the full year. And with year-to-date expenses of $40.4 billion, excluding the FDIC special assessment and Civil Money Penalties, we continue to expect to be on the higher end of our full year guidance range. As we take a step back, the third quarter represents another quarter of solid progress, and a set of proof points towards improving firm-wide and business performance. We remain focused on continuing to improve our performance and executing on our transformation. These priorities remain critical to strengthening our operations and becoming a more efficient, agile, and client-centric company as we continue to make progress on achieving our medium-term targets. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : At this time, we will open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Glenn Schorr with Evercore. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Glenn Schorr : Hi, thanks very much. Good guidance. I appreciate it. I'm curious on the card losses in Retail Financial Services. If you could talk to like the 2024 exit rate seems like it will be higher than the full year guide at 6.25%. Maybe you could talk to the trajectory there and then the huge reserves that you have built in there and anything you could tell us about the portfolio so we can keep the expectations in the right spot. Thanks. Mark Mason : Yes, sure. Why don't I take that? Good morning, Glenn. So a couple of things. So one, I think that on Retail Services, you're seeing a couple of things kind of play out. So one, you're seeing kind of spend volumes trend down a bit. You are seeing payment rates come down as well. That obviously is fueling the average interest-earning balanced growth that we're seeing. And then you're also seeing with the spend volume come down, there's a denominator effect that plays through, which pushes up obviously the loss rates that we -- that we're seeing. That still in the quarter is in line with our guidance. But in light of what we saw earlier in the year and normal seasonality, we'd expect that number to be on the higher end of that range and likely higher in the fourth quarter. But the higher in the fourth quarter again depends on what traffic is like and what the holiday spending season looks like through the end of the year. I would say the reserve levels we have are very healthy as it relates to this portfolio. I think in the back of the deck, we show kind of the reserve-to-loan ratio at about 11.7% or so. So well reserved for the Retail Services portfolio in light of the environment that we're in. Similarly, we are seeing the stabilization from a delinquency point-of-view across both portfolios kind of play through. And so, net-net, we are, obviously, actively managing this. The retail partner activity is a critical component of it and that will drive fourth quarter activity or levels, but we do feel as if we'll end up on the higher end of the range here. Glenn Schorr : Okay. Thanks for all that, Mark. Just one quickie on your partnership with Apollo, very interesting and in line with a lot of other things we've seen. So, I'm curious on why -- how you thought about going with one specific partner versus a group? And then more importantly, are there other parts of the franchise that could benefit -- with stronger ties to private markets, I'm thinking specifically in the asset-backed world? I appreciate it. Thank you. Jane Fraser : Yes. So we're delighted to partner with Apollo because, what this does is, it's uniting our comprehensive banking reach and expertise together and it's enabling us to offer our clients more innovative and tailored financing solutions. There will be some other partners involved in this as well. Mubadala is another participant in this. And when we look at this, it's very, very beneficial for our clients. We're always looking at how we can best serve our clients, give them the most options. And this platform enhances corporate and sponsor clients' access to the private lending capital pool at real scale. I think $25 billion is a very sizable partnership here and it provides funding certainty and strategic transactions. It's exclusive for [LPOs] (ph), non-investment grade in the US. The US is obviously the bulk of the private credit market, so the BMS globally. It would be great to see that market developing in Europe. And I -- it wouldn't surprise me to see us doing more partnerships in other pieces going forward. Operator : Our next question will come from Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ebrahim Poonawala : Good morning. I guess maybe, Mark, for you like looking at Slide 7 on NII, and maybe we can break it down into markets and ex-markets. In the ex-markets NII, $11.96 billion this quarter. Based on what you've said, the back book repricing deposit flex, is it safe to conclude that the ex-markets NII bottomed in 2Q 2024? And I noticed the securities yield actually went lower 7 bps quarter-over-quarter. So was there something one-off that impacted the yields this quarter relative to the expectations you outlined earlier? Mark Mason : Yes. So when you look at Slide 7, you got a couple of things playing through. So your point around that the low number, the low $11.46 in the second quarter, that really is a combination relative to first quarter FX translation, some seasonally lower card balances, and lower interest payments in Argentina playing through that sequential 1Q to 2Q. The third quarter, as I mentioned earlier, is really a byproduct of volumes on the lending side and spreads, deposit spreads in services, and wealth. I think that I've already given kind of the guide for the fourth quarter where that is likely to be flat. But I think it's important to just remind everyone of the headwinds and tailwinds that play through this NII line. And from a tailwind point-of-view, I would expect to see continued volume from loans, and USPB in particular, but also services and we're talking ex-markets of services. I'd also expect to see continued benefit from the reinvestment of securities at higher yields. And then we're actively managing beta as it relates to with our clients. And if you think about kind of what we saw in the uptick of rates, we're actively managing that on the downtick as it relates to our institutional clients. I think the other point here is, let's not forget that our interest-rate sensitivity skews more towards non-US. And so a lot of what we think about and talk about tends to be how US rates move and the betas around that. We're still going to have a bit of beta catch-up outside of the US and so that's one of the headwinds there as well as the legacy franchise exits. So you've got this long-winded way of saying, I do expect flat into the fourth quarter. I'm not going to give guidance for 2025. But what I will say is to keep the growth momentum to get to our medium-term targets, that's 4% to 5% of a CAGR and that's going to be a combination of NII and NIR, but skewing NIR, and I want to point that out because the third quarter and the year-to-date numbers that you see in our performance shows very strong fee NIR growth across each of these five businesses. And I don't want to lose sight of that as you all really try to get a handle on how we get to that medium-term. We're evidencing that shift towards more fee revenue as we speak. So I'll stop there, but I think that's important and hopefully, I've answered your question around the NII forecast here. Ebrahim Poonawala : Yes. That's helpful. And agreed on the fee momentum. Just one quick on the Wealth segment. We've seen a considerable progress year-to-date in terms of going from a zero ROE to about 8.5% RoTCE, significant operating leverage. I think I heard Jane say that momentum should continue. Is it fair to assume that RoTCE remains -- like wealth remains a positive story as we think about how Citi's ROE continues to improve from here as we get towards the targets? Any color on the wealth side would be helpful. Thank you. Jane Fraser : Yes, I agree with you. I think we're all very pleased to see the progress. On the strategy we laid out at Investor Day, the wealth target we have in the medium term is 15% to 20%. And with that, a 25% to 30% operating margin. And we're making steady progress there. I think the first piece was putting the pieces of the global wealth organization together. And now we're focused on positioning for growth and reshaping the business to deliver the returns that we all expect. A very important part of that is shifting our mix by growing investments. We had 24% growth in client investment assets this quarter. I would call that a good start to realizing the potential that we have here. And at the same time, Andy continues to right-size our expense base and drive productivity. Our adviser productivity increased over 50% in Citigold North America. So a number of different areas that are -- that he's focused on so that we can continue to grow the investment space, including some important new talent that we've been bringing in that I'm sure you've noticed. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi. What assurance can you give that Citi can both meet its 2026 expense guide, the $51 billion to $53 billion? And I know the year-to-date run-rate implies $54 billion. So getting from that $54 billion run-rate down to the $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026 and meet its regulatory targets. In other words, assurance that Citi can both walk and chew gum at the same time. And I guess I'd highlight, as you know, on October 2nd, Senator Warren asked the OCC to impose growth restrictions because Citi is \u201ctoo big to manage\u201d. Now I would assume you don't agree with that, but still the question that a lot of people have is, what assurances can you give that an asset cap won't happen at Citigroup? Thanks. Mark Mason : Thanks, Mike. So why don't I start with your expense question and then I'm sure Jane will chime in on some of the other parts of your question? So look, we put out medium-term targets of $51 billion to $53 billion in 2026, revenue dependent, of course, and that's with the -- consistent with the target we gave of less than 60% efficiency ratio. And we've got a target this year, as you know, on the high-end of $53.8 billion. And so we've got to get from $53.8 billion down to $51 billion to $53 billion by 2026. I'm not giving guidance for 2025, but you can expect that would probably likely glide down to that number. What's driving the reduction? So we've talked before about $1.5 billion in savings, largely related to the restructuring and driving down headcount reduction associated with that. We talked about another $500 million to $1 billion related to expense reductions from eliminating stranded cost. As we continue to exit, we're out of nine of these consumer countries already. And we talk about starting to see efficiencies and benefits from the investments in the transformation and technology towards the end of 2026. And those are the three drivers that are important for us to continue to realize between now and 2026. Will there be headwinds? Yes, there will be. The transformation is a multi-year process. We're also investing in risk and controls and regulatory spend to support improving our operations. Of course, there'll be headwinds, but there will also be things that we shift away from. There'll be tailwinds associated with it. Jane mentioned some of the productivity efforts that both Andy as well as Vis are pushing on. You look across these businesses and you see positive operating leverage across the board. So that means that Andy Morton, as well as Gonzalo are too looking at their cost structures at expenses that they can take out or productivity that they might improve. And so there will be additional costs that we have to incur. We incurred additional costs this year, but there also be additional productivity savings that we've continue to tease out to ensure that we get to these targets. Jane Fraser : And Mike, let me pick up on part of the second part of the question in terms of the progress on the transformation. As you know, as Mark is talking about, the transformation reverses historic under-investment in Citi's infrastructure. It enhances our risk and control environment. And it's a strategic overhaul as we've talked about that goes well beyond the consent order to simplify and to strengthen Citi to the benefit of all of the stakeholders we have. We are already a very different Citi today. We've made enormous change over the past three years, dramatically simpler business model, significant org change. So we align our structure to that model. We now have a flatter organization with greater accountability. And as Mark talked about through the investments in our transformation, we're focused on simplifying our operational model, modernizing our infrastructure risk and controls, and all of that reduces risk as we go. We are well on the way in executing the transformation plans. We've made meaningful progress as was acknowledged publicly by one of our regulators. And it's a wide range book of work. We've made significant strides in areas such as risk management, compliance, and accountability. And that's well beyond the big bodies of work about consolidating our platforms. So, we had 1,250 retired since 2022, as Mark mentioned. Other areas of progress enhance our stress-testing capabilities. They're faster, more frequent, more precise assessments. We put in place new target operating models for wholesale credit risk, enterprise risk, price risk firmwide. A huge body of work reducing risk and high-risk processes such as payments and markets through systemic preventative controls. We've been implementing the Cin[ph] platform this is the strategic cloud solution for market risk analytics that values trades on-demand and at scale. And we've embedded risk and controls into our performance management framework and tied that to compensation for the full firm. So these are just giving you a flavor of this big body of work that we are executing and getting done with risk. I was very pleased that we closed the FRB, AML, BSA consent order, particularly given heightened risk and scrutiny in this area. That is the third consent order we've closed since 2021. And we've been very transparent on where there are areas in which our execution is delayed against our original timelines, and as is the case with our data work, we take a step back, determine what we need to change in those areas, and get back on track, and make relevant tech and people investments. So I feel very confident about the strategy we've laid out for the firm, the deliberate path we're on, the huge progress we've already made, and that we will continue making with determination and with clarity going forward. Mike Mayo : So just one follow-up when -- and you do have the amended consent order that's not new anymore. But is this a problem with your dealing with clients or is this an issue with giving the regulators the information that they need? And just again, you don't -- just to confirm, you don't have an asset cap now, is it fair to assume that you don't expect an asset cap anytime soon, or could you have an asset cap and we don't even know about that? Thanks. Jane Fraser : We don't have any problems dealing with our clients, quite the opposite. We're a source of strength for our clients in terms of the provision of their payments businesses, their trading businesses, their consumer credit businesses all across the board. So I would say quite the opposite. We are a source of tremendous strength for them and you see that in the results of this quarter on -- which were very pleasing across the board in every single one of our businesses. And we are working closely with our regulators. We incorporate their feedback as well as our own lessons learned if we fall behind in an element of the consent orders, but do understand the breadth of the consent order work as I laid out and the meaningful progress we're making across multiple areas. And when we fall behind in an area, we increase the investments needed and look at any lessons learned in the approach and address it. So I'm -- I feel very comfortable. Mark Mason : Yes. So again, we don't have -- we're not talking about issues as it relates to client information, client data or client reporting. We're not talking about information as it relates to financials. We're talking about regulatory reporting, all right, in regular reported reporting, as I've mentioned in prior calls, we're a global firm. We've got over 11,000 regulatory reports. And we're talking about ensuring that the data that we capture at trade entry is the data that's required to ultimately show up on these various regulatory reports in the way that we need it, ensuring that we've got the proper controls on that front-end. So we don't do -- we don't have to do a lot of the reconciliation and management and manual adjustments to that data in order to get it how we need it in the report and ensuring that we have standardized rules and controls around that process so that we can do it as efficiently as possible. But this is largely around ensuring that we improve those regulatory reports that we have to produce by starting with the underlying data that's required to do that. Operator : Our next question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Jim Mitchell : Hey, good morning. Mark, consensus expectations and it is just another expense question in a different way, but consensus has you not hitting your revenue growth targets and you certainly free to disagree and I think that's fine. But they also have your expenses at the high end of your $51 billion to $53 billion range in 2026. I guess, does that make sense or do you feel confident that if revenues do sort of disappoint your targets that you could come in at the -- you should or can come in at the lower end of that range to help get to your RoTCE target? Mark Mason : Yes. So let's take it in pieces. So I think the first thing is that, I think Jane and I have been very consistent with trying to give guidance on full year performance for the past couple of years. And we've largely actually delivered on that guidance. If you look at the top-line growth since Investor Day, it's largely consistent with what we talked about in the medium term. If you looked at the expense guidance that we've given, largely consistent with that, including this year, even if I -- even as I look at the $80 billion to $81 billion revenue guidance we gave for the year and you look at the $60.6 billion that we've done year-to-date and you think about what we have to deliver in order to hit that target, that is achievable, particularly when you remember that we had a large Argentina devaluation last year. That fee momentum required in the fourth quarter is very achievable. And we believe that we will obviously hit the high end of the range for 2024. As I think about that outer year period and the guidance that we gave there, look, you all want proof points before you actually believe that we can deliver on that medium-term target. I'm pointing you to proof points. I'm hopeful that as you see those proof points through 2024, full year and each of the quarters that you will start to believe in that revenue momentum that's required in the medium term. The fee revenue is a very good indicator. What we delivered this year and this quarter is a very good indicator of the momentum we should see across these businesses in the next couple of years. I also hope that you would then see that as we deliver on the expense target that we have a path to continuing to deliver on the medium-term expense target, the drivers of which I mentioned earlier. Yes, if revenues come in short of the target that we've set for ourselves, you would naturally expect for the volume and transaction-related expenses and compensation expenses to come down in a commensurate way with that revenue decline. And you would also expect that we would look to see if there are other productivity opportunities that we can tease out in order to still deliver on that operating efficiency target that we've set for ourselves. Jim Mitchell : No, that's great color. I appreciate it. And maybe just as a follow-up on the capital question. I guess one thing that's been a bit of a headwind over the last year has been sort of growth in the DTA deductions. Do we start to see that become a tailwind again? How do we think about that accreting back into capital over the next couple of years? Mark Mason : Yes. Look, the main driver of our DTA utilization will be driving higher income in the US. That's going to be the major driver. And as we think about -- so as you think about each of the strategies that Jane has described for our business, you will often hear the importance of winning in the US. You'll hear it as it relates to banking and the activity that we saw, the strong performance we saw this quarter in [indiscernible] world, you hear it as it relates to the wealth business and the importance of us growing investments, particularly in North America. You see it in USPB, which is largely a US-focused business. That DTA utilization is about us increasing net income or higher net income in the US and as we work to execute on our client-driven strategy, we are looking for opportunities to do that. We're incenting the business to drive that momentum. And that's what's going to give us a higher utilization on a quarter-by-quarter in the coming years. Operator : Our next question will come from Erika Najarian with UBS. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Erika Najarian : Hi. I think we -- Mark Mason : Good morning. Erika Najarian : [Multiple Speakers] Good afternoon, guys. The first one is for you, Jane. As I speak with longer-term investors, they often offer the commentary that clearly, the path from the 7% RoTCE this quarter to the 11% to 12% is -- hopefully will be bridged and to be able to initiate a position before that progress is made they really sort of want to see more capital optimization. And this question is not really the same question I ask you about buybacks every quarter, but really maybe a progress update on Banamex. So there was chatter in the market about Banamex needed to have four quarters of separate financials before being IPOed. And I'm wondering if you could give us specific progress on how that's going. And Mark, maybe remind us on what Banamex's contribution is as we think about the unlocking that excess capital versus taking it out of the P&L? Jane Fraser : Yes. I'd be delighted to, Erika. And I would also just before I jump into Banamex from point to a laser-focus on capital optimization. It's been a mantra for a long time in our markets business in banking and a discipline that we've driven throughout the organization. And I would say there isn't anyone at Citi that is not keenly aware of the focus around optimizing our capital. Returning to shareholders, particularly given where we're trading and making sure that we drive to returns. So if I turn to Banamex, our singular focus right now is the separation of the two banks, which we expect to complete in the fourth quarter of this year. This has been an enormous body of work because we are creating effectively [De novo] (ph]), Mexico's eighth-largest bank. We've just now got the core regulatory authorizations that we need to proceed with separation. Although there are a few other approvals pending. We are in the very final stages and are working with our clients to prepare them for this switchover and later on in Q4. Once the separation is complete, we will turn our full attention to the IPO itself and the successful execution of the IPO is the highest priority for our Head of International, Ernesto Torres Cantu to run Banamex and our incoming Banamex Executive Chairman who starts this quarter, Nacho Deschamps. We plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors that we can control. But I think as Mark and I have always said, the timing is going to be driven by market conditions to ensure we maximize the shareholder value. And we're making the necessary investments to continue growing share and I was very pleased that Banamex outpaced the average market revenue growth year-to-date, good expense discipline being maintained despite the complex separation process and the environment. So I'm pleased with where we are and I hope that gives you a bit of a flavor of what the path ahead looks like. Mark Mason : Yes. In terms of the second part of your question, a couple of things. So one, we've been seeing good growth in our Mexico consumer business. We've also been investing in it appropriately so to make sure that we protect the strength of that franchise as we prepare it for separation and ultimately for the IPO. Erika, if I understood your question right, if you turn to Page 16 of the deck in the bottom right-hand side, we show the P&L for Mexico consumer for 2022 and 2023. And so you can see the contribution from a revenue and expense point-of-view, it's about $1.5 billion in 2023. And I believe we probably -- I think it's about $4 billion or so of TCE that we have associated with this business. So that gives you some sense for the contribution, but it continues to perform quite well as we manage it through the -- through this process. Erika Najarian : Perfect. Thank you. And as a follow-up question, I'm sure it is frustrating for you to see the stock reaction in a quarter where you had PPNR strength and better expectations for net interest income in the fourth quarter. So maybe I'll frame the question this way for you, Mark. As we think about the gyrations in interest-rate expectations globally, maybe remind us sort of -- is it fair to assume that Citi is asset-sensitive internationally and neutrally positioned domestically. How should we think about late fees? I know you told us that late fees going to $8 for a part of your initial -- your initial guide for the year. And additionally, I think perhaps because capital markets was so strong across the board across all of your peers, maybe that's not why you're getting good credit for your strength this quarter. So as we look into 2025 and having NIR be that bigger contribution to your revenue CAGR, maybe walk us through what are the other sort of core fee strengths that we should look forward to other than like -- other than FIC and banking remaining strong and coming back that could bring into that path to 2026. Mark Mason : Okay. There's a lot there, but thank you. Thank you for the question. I would like to see the stock reacting much more favorably because this really has been a strong quarter for us. And in fact, as you mentioned, NII, when you look through it, we've in fact taken our NII guidance up just a tad bit as we referenced that the full year would be slightly down versus modestly down with the fourth quarter that's flat to the third quarter. And so that is an important takeaway. I mentioned the headwinds and tailwinds earlier and we shouldn't lose sight of those. We will get a lift from reinvesting the securities as those mature, we will continue to see volume growth and those are important drivers of tailwind activity for us. You rightfully mentioned our interest rate exposure analysis that we do on a quarterly basis that reflects the asset sensitivity of our business. And last quarter, it was about $1.6 billion, or so of a negative, assuming a 100 basis point decline across the curve, assuming a static balance sheet, and cross currencies. And as you look at that asset sensitivity, again, you rightfully pointed out that we skew non-US in terms of the magnitude of that decline in NII, should we see that parallel shift. And in fact, it's as much as $1.3 billion, or so of that $1.6 billion is non-US dollar related across 60 currencies. And so you'd have to see all of that move in tandem for that drag. And the US dollar drag is about $300 million, assuming a 100 basis point shift, and that's been coming down. If you look back over the quarters, we've been thoughtfully managing that down and that's down to about a $300 million number. I would expect when we print the third quarter too, it will be down a bit more. And so again, we are asset-sensitive, but it does skew outside of the US, and thank you for asking the question because I think it's important to remind our investors and analysts of that dynamic, which in many ways may be different from that of other institutions. In terms of the late fees, we did say that we were including late fees in our assumptions and our outlook that we've given. I'll state the obvious, Erika, which is that we want people to obviously paid on time and we do everything that we can to assist and ensure that they do that. With that said, we don't have a definitive timeline on late fees, nor are we overly reliant on late fees to drive revenue for our firm. And so it looks like that decisioning will likely kind of fall closer to sometime in 2025. And so there is a small adjustment in the last quarter of our revenue forecast, but it's inside of the guidance that we gave and doesn't materially change that in any way. And then the last part of your question, I think, was around NIR and the fee revenue. And as I mentioned earlier, I'm not going to give guidance for 2025, but I think your question was around where are we likely to see continued momentum as it relates to fee revenue growth. And I'd start with services, which with fees were up some 33% year-over-year. And yes, we should adjust for the Argentine peso devaluation. But even if you adjust for that, it's double-digit, 11% year-over-year non-interest revenue growth. And when you look at those drivers, they've been consistently strong, cross-border transaction value up 8%, US dollar clearing volume up 7%, commercial card spend up 8%. In the supplement, you'll see that it's mid-to-high single-digit year-to-date growth across those KPIs as well. We expect that will continue with our corporate clients and as we bring on new commercial clients as well. I'll turn you to -- if you look at Banking, we talked about already, so I won't kind of lean into that too much, but except to highlight a really strong quarter in Banking, in investment banking fees, in particular, the rebound that we've been talking about, but importantly, us capturing share in that rebound and these important partnerships that position us well as sponsors start to lean back into the market, the investments that we've been making in talent and sectors we need to strengthen, all of those things are going to play to continued fee momentum as we go into 2025. Wealth, again, really strong performance this quarter with revenues up 9%. But look at the client investment assets up 24%. The client balance is up 14%. That's driving fee momentum and it's a keen area of focus for Andy and that team that he's pulled together and it's a real opportunity for us given the $5 trillion or so of assets that our clients hold away from us and we're better positioning ourselves to capture that. And then finally, you can see kind of continued momentum on USPB. But it's across-the-board is what I'm saying, Erika, in terms of that fee momentum, and it is important. It's an important aspect as we think about getting to those medium-term targets in that 4% to 5% revenue. Operator : Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Gerard Cassidy : Hi, Mark. Hi, Jane. Mark Mason : Good morning. Gerard Cassidy : Mark, you touched on in your prepared comments about growing the US Personal Banking RoTCE to higher levels. And you mentioned two items. One, innovative products and the normalization of credit costs. Can you elaborate on those two items that will be contributing to the driver aside from the efficiency improvement that you also touched on? Mark Mason : Yes, sure. So I mean, so obviously, USPB is a combination of the cards businesses that we have in the retail banking business and that cards portfolio has both branded as well as retail services as part of it. And even within branded, we have proprietary cards where we frankly have been looking to how we can come up with new innovative products. So an example of product innovation is the recent refresh that we did of our Strata Premier Card, which was designed to drive acquisition and engagement with a new rewards offering. And with that acquisitions are up some 7% both quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year for branded cards. So that's an example of product innovation. Another one is we also launched Flex Pay at Costco a few quarters ago, and you can see good installment loan growth as a consequence of that, up some 15% or so. And so that type of product creation is important to acquisitions. It's important to ensuring the card stays top of wallet and important to kind of driving some of that top-line performance. And then the other thing that I mentioned, you're right, was around cost of credit and that really is the continued normalization of cost of credit. I mentioned a couple of times now the idea that multiple vintages are maturing at the same time and that's kind of -- that has to play through and us to -- for us to kind of see a more normal level of credit. And that will be important to the returns. And again, we are starting to see stabilization in both the cost of credit line, but also in delinquencies and that's a good indicator for us. Gerard Cassidy : Very good. And just following up on credit. In the Banking division, you guys mentioned cost of credit was, I think, $107 million due to a ACL build of $141 million and it was due to a mix -- a change in the mix in the portfolio. Can you share with us what that mix change was that drove this provision? Mark Mason : Yes. There's nothing -- it's a mix of kind of different asset classes and clients that we've lent against. There's nothing material or significant in that number when you look at the non-accrual loans, that ratio is still 31 basis points. So it's a mix change of our exposures, but nothing material there. Jane Fraser : And we continue to see a very healthy corporate sector really across the world. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Juneja with J.P. Morgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Vivek Juneja : Hi. Two questions to Jane and Mark. One is on expenses and the other is on your response to the asset cap question before. So first one, expenses for an easier one. You had -- earlier in the year, you had said you expect about $700 million to $1 billion of severance charges in the $53.5 billion to $53.8 billion. Did you have any in the third quarter? Expect any in the fourth? And do you expect to be done with those this year or any to continue into next year too? Mark Mason : Yes. So that number was a combination of restructuring charges and severance charges or repositioning charges. And we break out obviously restructuring so that you can see those. And this restructuring component was largely driven by the org simplification. That will be done this year. The normal severance or repositioning charges that we take as a normal course of BAU, you'd expect that to occur in any year and it certainly will be part of 2025 and 2026 going forward. We did have some this quarter. I would expect that we will have some next quarter, but I don't see us being outsider by any stretch, the range that I gave and again the range was for the combination of both. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Thanks on that. And shifting to the asset cap question, Jane and Mark. I -- we didn't hear a clear answer on, A, do you have an asset cap? And B, if -- even if you don't, what is the effective implication or impact of what the regulators have said? Jane Fraser : So let me be crystal clear. We do not have an asset cap and there are no additional measures other than what was announced in July in place and not expecting any. So then the implications of what we're doing as I've laid out, we've increased investments in the areas where we were behind, particularly in the data related to our regulatory processes and regulatory reporting. We're increasing investment behind it, and we continue to make progress -- material progress on the orders in place, including closing the BSA/AML order this quarter. The third order closed since 2021. Vivek Juneja : And you don't expect anything meaningful, Jane, that would impact business like there was this new story about the China sub-license that you didn't get approved by the regulator. Anything more meaningful like that might be occurring that maybe -- Jane Fraser : Absolutely, let me be crystal clear. Absolutely nothing. Vivek Juneja : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Matt O\u2019Connor: Hi. Just a couple of clarification questions. I guess first on Banamex, are you on track to sell IPO at the fourth quarter of next year or does it just get pushed out by a quarter with the legal separation taking a little bit longer? Jane Fraser : Look, I think as I mentioned in response to Erika's question, we plan to be ready to IPO at the end of 2025 based on the factors we can control. The timing is going to get driven by how we maximize shareholder value and that will be market conditions. So that's where we stand. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay. Sorry. So I think that means it's by the end of 2025, you talk about 1Q 2026, but that was kind of my clarification question on that. Jane Fraser : [Multiple Speakers] Matt O\u2019Connor: I thought you need four quarters -- I thought you needed four quarters after you legally separated it to officially IPO it? Jane Fraser : We believe as we stand at the moment, we will -- we would be ready to IPO at the end of 2025. It's much more a focus on what the market conditions at that point will be. And Mark and I are in very, very much focused on the shareholder value and maximizing that over -- rushing over one quarter versus another quarter. Mark Mason : And there's no hard rule on -- Sorry, go ahead. Jane Fraser : Yes. There isn't a hard rule on -- you have to have got four full quarters after you have separated. Matt O\u2019Connor: I see. Okay. That's super helpful. We just haven't had that many of these, so that's helpful. And then just separately, I think in the prepared remarks, you guys mentioned a modest provision within services for some of the unremitted corporate dividends. And I just wanted to clarify that, and what country is that? And I guess I thought there wasn't really much liability to you guys from that. So any clarification on that? I know it was a small amount, but I think that might be helpful. Thank you. Mark Mason : Sure. It's a small amount. And if you look in the back of the deck, we have a page on Russia exposure, it's related to that. Matt O\u2019Connor: Okay, but still feel like there's not risk to you guys from all those kind of trapped dividends. And I guess why take a small reserve if there's legally any risk to you guys? Mark Mason : Well, it's the way we treat the exposure there. We're following kind of the guidelines on how we need to treat exposures in the country that we aren't able to distribute to clients, but we actually have to hold on their behalf. And so we have to book a reserve associated with that. And so we do that. We obviously show on the page what the exposure is in the event of a loss of control and you can kind of see how that ultimately nets out, but we're following the appropriate guidelines for what's required to for reserves of that nature. Matt O\u2019Connor: Got it. Okay. Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ryan Kenny with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Ryan Kenny : Hey, thanks for taking my question. I have one for Mark. So you mentioned that services NII is a tailwind as rates declined. Can you just unpack how that happens? Is there any benefit from swap roll-off or pay floating swaps that we should be thinking about that's embedded in that statement? Mark Mason : There are a couple of things kind of to keep in mind on the Services business. So one is, obviously this is a client business, it's not just a deposit-taking business. And so how we think about pricing to those clients becomes really important. You've got the US and non-US dynamic that's playing through, where for institutional clients, we've largely been holding to the higher betas that we saw as rates have ticked up again with the relationship in mind and we have some offsetting pressure outside of the US as those betas kind of catch-up. But I think importantly, you also heard me mentioned the reinvestment into securities at higher yields and that reinvestment or those higher yields ultimately play out through the businesses. And so that will show up as part of kind of NII as we think about services, but the other businesses as well. And so those are important components of the NII story for services. I think when you look at the end quarter performance and NII is down 5%, a big part of that is driven by the Argentina high -- lower or rates movement in the quarter versus last year. So lower rates we're earning in Argentina playing through that line, particularly in this quarter. If you adjusted for that on the NII line, it would be flat to slightly a little bit better. So that's really what it is. It's kind of management of client relationships as well as the higher earnings on reinvested securities contributing to that as well as volume from operating account growth that we expect. Ryan Kenny : Thank you. Mark Mason : Yes. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Saul Martinez : Hey guys. I guess a couple of quick questions. First, just a follow-up on Banamex. Jane, as you know, there are concerns about judicial reform in Mexico and the implications for rule of law and Mexican asset prices have suffered as a result, I think the largest Mexican bank trades up something in the neighbourhood of seven times earnings. If market conditions don't improve and Mexican asset prices remain depressed and these concerns persist, then what -- I mean, do you just wait till market conditions improve, or how do you think about this process in the context of what seems to be a deteriorating macro backdrop for Mexico? Jane Fraser : Yes. We've got to wait and see what the market conditions will be, but the North Star for me and for Mark is crystal clear, right? It is optimizing and maximizing our shareholder value. And so, if the conditions are not appropriate at that time, then we will wait until they are. In the meantime, the business is performing well. It's accretive to our returns. It's not a drag here in any shape or form. And so there is no need to rush for a suboptimal result here. But we will IPO and we will exit Banamex, but we won't do that in a reckless manner. We will be disciplined about it as you would expect us to be and as I think we're demonstrating that we are on multiple different dimensions. Saul Martinez : Great. Fair enough. And then I guess a follow-up on the US Personal Banking RoTCE improvement and the normalization of cost of credit, it seems to be a big component of that. But Mark, can you just remind us where you are in terms of the cost of credit versus what you would think a more normalized level is for Branded Cards and Retail Services? I guess how much more -- how much of a tailwind does a more normalized credit environment entail in terms of the credit costs? Mark Mason : Again, I don't want to get into 2025 at this stage. I mean, I assure you we will give more color and commentary on that as we get into the fourth quarter earnings in January. What I will say, again, as you think about these businesses we do see continued top-line -- we do expect continued top-line momentum. We've had eight consecutive quarters of positive operating leverage in USPB of 49% this quarter. So we're managing the expense base well. We think there's more upside to the top line. We're really focused on growth across the portfolios. And I do think that cost of credit, again, if for no other reason, but the compounding effect of those vintages maturing as well as kind of inflation starting to come off, rates trickling down, that should be better for the consumer and should start to play out in both the macroeconomic scenarios that we run for CECL purposes, but also ultimately in delinquencies and NCLs. And we're starting to see that improvement in delinquencies and its stabilization already somewhat. So I don't want to get into guidance, but that's kind of how I think about the drivers or contributors to improve returns over the medium term. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Your line is now open. Please go ahead. Mike Mayo : Hi, thanks for the clarification on the asset cap question that I asked earlier. And I know you are limited on how much you can say about regulators, but just to be clear, because a lot of email traffic going back, you did say there is no asset cap and you don't expect one and you don't expect other additional actions at this time. Jane Fraser : Correct. Mike Mayo : Okay. Thank you for clarifying that. And I guess, look, I have great respect. I'm an ex-regulator, Paul Volcker was my hero. I respect regulators and nobody wants to see you cut corners to get to your $51 billion to $53 billion of expenses. But I'm just wondering -- and you have consolidated systems, apps, layers, bureaucracy and you're divesting lots of activity. So it's just even the amended consent order was surprising because you have taken so many efforts and if you should have had an amended consent order or other actions, they probably should have been in place one, five, 10, or literally 20 years ago. And so that's just confusing on the outside. So with that said, is this a matter of spending more money or about doing these tasks more intelligently? In other words, if you put more gas in the tank, the car is not going faster. So is it the amount of resources or just being more intelligent in terms of resolving some of these regulatory issues? Jane Fraser : So, let me break it down to a couple of pieces. So I start off just to remind everyone, the consent orders are very, very broad and this -- the action that was taken was because we're behind in a narrower area, which is the data, particularly regarding our regulatory reporting where we're behind is the main area of focus. We moved swiftly to address it. We're very transparent about it from early on in the year that we were falling behind on this. And overall, I'm pleased with our progress. And as you say, Mike, I listed a number of areas of progress and trying to make it as tangible as we can, given what we can and can't say as this is supervisory. I'm pleased that our businesses continue to improve their performance while the transformation is going on. They are the two priorities we have this year. So I think effectively, yes, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. And the huge benefit of all of the simplification on the business, on the organization, the other efforts is making it easier for us to execute and be very focused. And well, maybe, Mark, I pass it over to you. Mark Mason : I think your question is helpful in the sense that you said, is it kind of a rethink on our approach or is it the need to spend more money? And one of the things that we've done, Mike, is take a step back and look at how we've been approaching data, for example. So this is -- and we are going to make -- we have made some changes to our approach. And those changes relate to how we get after resolving data issues that are identified, ensuring that there is engagement from the front-end business from the functions that are most relevant and that there's consideration for what's required on reg reporting, in order for us to get that process, streamlined and correct. And so there is -- there are aspects of this that require a change in our approach and we've been taking that change and making that change rather, and we'll make more changes accordingly as we've taken that step back. And then the other -- and there are aspects of it that require at a minimum review of what is causing either the delay or us not moving at the pace that we'd like to or that we'd like to move or that our regulators would like. And that is in fact what the resource review plan was that was in the amended consent order. It was basically a statement saying that you need to ensure that you have sufficient resources and that they're allocated towards achieving the timely and sustainable compliance. And so part of our process is in fact that taking a regular review of what is on track in the way of our milestones and deliverables, where we see things that are being delayed or going red, what is the underlying root cause for why? Is it a resource issue where we need to put more dollars and people or technology to it? Is it a process issue where we need to reconsider our approach? And on the other side of that root cause, taking action to fix it. And so your question is spot-on. The answer is that in many instances, it will be a little bit of both. But importantly, our processes include that type of analysis and assessment so that we can get after the execution on this in an effective way. I hope that helps. Jane Fraser : And all of this drives productivity and other benefits for our shareholders as well as making sure that we're strengthening Citi from the regulatory perspective. Mike Mayo : And then my last follow-up, you know, to the extent that you see a disconnect between your performance and the stock price, that would seem to create more of an opportunity to buy the stock at $64 when tangible book value is $90. And so I hope that I've used this analogy before, but hopefully, you're selling the chairs and the desks and the silverware and the executive dining room to go ahead and buyback stock, whatever you can. Jane Fraser : Yes. It's clearly given where we are trading, it is -- we're very focused around the opportunities to buyback stock and mindful of the importance of it. And equally, yes, we are proud of the performance of the franchise this quarter. It was a very strong quarter and an important set of proof points for our investors that we are on a deliberate path. We're making the progress that we need to and actually pretty excited about the path ahead of us and the potential that we see. Operator : There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks. Jennifer Landis : Thank you, everyone, for joining the call. Please follow up with IR if you have any additional questions. Thank you.

We ask that you please hold all questions until the completion of the formal remarks, at which time you'll be given instructions for the question-and-answer session. Also, as a reminder, this conference is being recorded today. If you have any objections, please disconnect at this time. Ms. Landis, you may begin. Jenn Landis : Thank you, operator. Good morning, and thank you all for joining our fourth quarter 2024 earnings call. I am joined today by our Chief Executive Officer, Jane Fraser; and our Chief Financial Officer, Mark Mason. I'd like to remind you that, today's presentation, which is available for download on our website, citigroup.com, may contain forward-looking statements, which are based on management's current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances. Actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors, including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our SEC filings. And with that, I'll turn it over to Jane. Jane Fraser : Thank you, Jenn, and a very good morning to everyone. I'm going to start with the macro backdrop and then walk you through our results for the full year. I'll share some thoughts on the progress we're making executing our strategy, and then conclude with why we have decided to adjust our 2026 return target. We entered 2025 with strategic clarity and good momentum across all our businesses. From the global macro perspective, economies have done a good job tolerating hikes from central banks and inflation has clearly been receding. While policies will certainly impact economic activity, whether in the form of tariffs or taxes, 2025 doesn't look that different from 24. The U.S. remains at the heart of the macro picture. Growth is not only being driven by the higher-end consumer, but also by a strong innovative corporate sector. China's growth has been slower-than-expected, but there is still the prospect of further stimulus. Europe continues to underachieve and many emerging markets have re-emerged as bright spots, a trend which certainly benefits us given our global network and deep presence in countries, such as India and throughout the Middle East and ASEAN. I told you, 2024 was a critical year and I'm proud of what we accomplished and how our businesses performed. We finished with a very strong fourth quarter which Mark will detail shortly. For the full year, our net income was up nearly 40% to $12.7 billion. We exceeded our full year revenue target with revenues up 5% ex-divestitures. Fee revenue was up 17% and we saw a smaller impact from Argentina's currency devaluation. We delivered expenses within our guidance and improved our efficiency ratio by 340 bps whilst increasing investment in our transformation. Our RoTCE grew over 200 bps albeit from a low level. Our five core businesses each generated positive operating leverage for the full year which we also achieved at the firm level. Services was up 9% and had another record year despite the low rate environment as a result of new mandates and our emphasis on fee growth. We grew share in both TTS and security services backed by our best fourth quarter in a decade, market was up 6%. The performance of this franchise in the low volatility year shows the benefit of our diversified product mix. Equities was strong throughout and was up 26% in what was a record year for us. Banking was up 32% as we gained share across all three investment banking products and we announced an innovative $25 billion private credit partnership with our long-term client Apollo. Under business leadership, we expect to continue to gain on our competition in 2025 and beyond. 2024 was a turning point for wealth as we sharpened our focus on investments, right-sized the expense base and improved the client experience. Revenue was up 7% for the year including fee growth of 18%. Citigold and Asia were particularly strong and net new investment asset flows grew a very pleasing 40%. We attracted top talent throughout the year in wealth most recently bringing in Kate Moore as our CIO and Anne McCosker as our Head of Lending. This business has tremendous potential with both new and existing clients and we're really leaning into it. USPB revenues were up 6% driven by borrowing across both card portfolios and by fee growth. We announced a 10-year extension of our cobranded partnership with American Airlines ensuring that this valuable relationship enters into its fifth decade. With the acquisition of the Barclays portfolio, we will become American Airlines exclusive partner in 2026 and we expect to deliver more value for our cardholders and high returns for our shareholders as a result. We grew our tangible book value per share by 4% and ended 2024 with a CET1 ratio of 13.6% approximately 150 bps above our regulatory capital requirement. After repurchasing $1 billion in common shares during the fourth quarter, we returned almost $7 billion in capital to our common shareholders in 2024. Even how committed we are to returning capital, I am particularly pleased to announce that our board authorized a $20 billion share repurchase program. You can see the very tangible progress we're making in executing the strategy that we laid out at our Investor Day three years ago. We have materially simplified our firm since then. We exited consumer businesses in nine countries and near completion of wind downs in three and are on-track to exit the final two. This includes Banamex, which we legally separated from our institutional business in December. We're now fully-focused on getting ready to IPO, with the timing heavily dependent on regulatory approvals and market conditions of course. To align our structure with our strategy, we went through a significant simplification of our organization, removing management layers and the regional construct. This has accelerated decision-making and made us a better partner to our clients. We have strengthened our culture by better aligning compensation with our shareholders' interests, enhancing our scorecards to ensure we're delivering for clients. We attracted top industry talent throughout our organization and that includes new leaders around my table for banking, wealth, and technology. We have raised the bar on what we demand from each other and what we expect to deliver to our clients. We have continued to innovate to improve the client experience and our efficiency. We are now live with Citi Payments Express in 18 countries and have converted 4 million retail bank customers to our simplified banking platform in the U.S. We accelerated our use of AI arming 30,000 developers with tools to write code, launched two AI platforms to make our 143,000 colleagues more efficient. The investments we're making to modernize our infrastructure, streamline processes and automate controls are changing how we run the bank. We consolidated our balance sheet reporting to one unified ledger. We implemented a cloud-based solution for risk analytics to better value trading assets. We have closed out three longstanding consent orders. Our capital, liquidity and reserves are robust. Our focused strategy, infrastructure, and targeted client selection have all reduced our risk profile significantly. We have made considerable progress on our transformation. While there are areas that are more advanced, there are others where we still have a lot more work to do, particularly around data and regulatory reporting as last summer's regulatory actions reinforced. We have reviewed the entire data program and made changes to its governance and structure as well as increased the level of investment. As CEO, I want this company set up for long-term success and to ensure that we have enough capacity to invest for that. In terms of expense guidance, therefore, most of the sales from the org simplification and stranded costs will be used to fund the additional investments we need to make this year in both transformation and technology. As a result, we expect our total expenses in 2025 to be slightly below the 2024 level and to deliver another year of positive operating leverage. We expect our elevated expense level to be temporary and for it to keep coming down beyond 2025. However, when we take the required investments into account, we now expect our 2026 RoTCE to be between 10% and 11%. The 2026 RoTCE is a waypoint. It is not a destination. Our intention is to continue to improve returns well above that level and we are accountable for doing so. We are relentless in our determination to run the bank more efficiently, fulfill Citi's potential and meet the expectations of our shareholders. Before I turn it over to Mark, I'd like to acknowledge the catastrophic wildfires in Los Angeles. Many of our clients and several of our colleagues have lost their homes and we will do whatever we can to help them recover from this devastating event. They and their loved ones are in all of our thoughts at Citi. Now, over to Mark. Mark Mason : Thanks Jane and good morning everyone. I am going to start with the fourth quarter and full year financial results focusing on year-over-year comparisons unless I indicate otherwise. I will also focus on our current expectations for 2025 and 2026. On Slide 7, we show financial results for the full firm which reflect improved performance both in the quarter and the year. As a reminder, in the fourth quarter of last year, revenues were significantly impacted by Argentina currency devaluation. Adjusted revenues and non-interest revenues for the full firm and services are shown in the appendix of the earnings presentation on Slide 36. This quarter we reported net income of $2.9 billion, EPS of $1.34 and RoTCE of 6.1% or $19.6 billion of revenues generating positive operating leverage for the firm and in each of our businesses. Total revenues were up 12% driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Net interest income excluding markets was roughly flat with growth in USPB and wealth offset by declines in corporate other and banking. Non-interest revenues excluding markets was up 40% driven by continued strong fee momentum across services, banking and wealth along with lower partner payments in USPB as well as a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. And total markets revenues were up 36%. Expenses were $13.2 billion, down 18%, largely driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge in the prior year. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment and divestiture related impacts, expenses were down 7% driven by the absence of the restructuring charge in the prior year and savings associated with our organizational simplification partially offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was $2.6 billion, largely consisting of cards, net credit losses and ACL build. At the end of the quarter we had over $22 billion in total reserves with a reserve to funded loan ratio of 2.7%. And on a full year basis, we delivered $12.7 billion of net income with an RoTCE of 7%. On Slide 8, we show full year revenue trends by business from 2021 to 2024. This year we delivered $81.1 billion of revenue, up 5% on an ex-divestiture basis, driven by growth in each of our businesses and a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Services revenues increased 9% to $19.6 billion benefiting from a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation, fee growth and higher deposit volumes. Markets revenues increased 6% to $19.8 billion primarily driven by growth in equity, which had its highest annual revenue in a decade and spread products. Banking revenues increased 32% to $6.2 billion, largely driven by growth in Investment Banking with fees up 42%, as we gained approximately 50 basis points of share on an increased wallet. Wealth revenues increased 7% to $7.5 billion, primarily driven by a 15% increase in non-interest revenue, as we continue to grow client investment assets. USPB revenues increased 6% to $20.4 billion, driven by growth in cards, as we continue to see strong customer engagement and an increase in interest earning balances as well as lower partner payments. Overall, this year demonstrates another year of performance consistent with our medium-term target of 4% to 5% annual growth and the value of our diversified business model. On Slide 9, we show the full year expense trend from 2021 to 2024. Excluding the impact of the FDIC special assessment, our full year expenses were $53.8 billion in-line with our target. Expense reduction was driven by savings related to our organizational simplification and stranded cost reduction, as well as lower restructuring and repositioning charges. Organizational simplification, stranded cost reduction, as well as efforts to drive efficiencies across the businesses contributed to a net decline of roughly 10,000 direct staff. These savings were mostly offset by higher volume related expenses, as well as investments in the transformation and other risk and controls and the civil money penalties. As you can see at the bottom of the page, we spent $2.9 billion on transformation this year, which includes investments in our infrastructure, platforms, applications and data. Transformation investments were up 1%, driven by an increase in certain programs including data largely offset by a reduction in the transformation bonus award. And we spent $11.8 billion on technology, focused on digital innovation, new product development, client experience and other areas such as cybersecurity. Turning to Slide 10, we provide details on our $2.4 trillion balance sheet which decreased 3% sequentially largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation. In the fourth quarter, we deployed some of our excess liquidity into loans while maintaining 116% LCR and $933 billion of available liquidity resources. Our $1.3 trillion deposit base remains well diversified across regions, industries, customers and account types. We maintained strong capital ending the year with a preliminary 13.6% CET1 capital ratio, approximately 150 basis points above our regulatory capital requirement of 12.1%. For the year, we returned nearly $7 billion in the form of common dividends and repurchases to our shareholders. Turning to the businesses on Slide 11. We show the results for services for the fourth quarter and full year. Services revenues were up 15%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation and reflecting continued momentum across security services and TTS, both of which gained share this year. NIR increased 61%, driven by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation as well as continued strength in underlying fee drivers such as U.S. dollar clearing, commercial card spend, cross border transactions, and assets under custody and administration. NII was roughly flat as the benefit of higher deposit volumes was offset by the impact of lower interest rates in Argentina. Expenses increased 1% driven by continued investment in technology and platform modernization partially offset by productivity savings. Cost of credit was $112 million with a net ACL build of $84 million and net credit losses of $28 million. Average loans increased 5% primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance as well as working capital loans. Average deposits increased 4% as we continue to see growth in operating deposits. Services generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $1.9 billion and $6.5 billion for the year and continues to deliver a high RoTCE coming in at 29.9% and 26% for the year. On Slide 12, we show the results for markets for the fourth quarter and full year. Markets saw its highest fourth quarter revenue in a decade and increased 36% with broad-based gains across all products. Fixed income revenues increased 37% driven by rates in currencies which were up 39% and spread products and other fixed income up 30% both reflecting increased client activity. Rates and currencies also benefited from a conducive trading environment compared to a challenging prior year quarter. Spread products and other fixed income was driven by credit and mortgage trading as well as higher securitization volume. Equities revenues increased 34% driven in part by strong execution of strategic client transactions in cash equities and momentum also continued in prime with balances up approximately 23%. Expenses decreased 8% primarily driven by lower legal expenses and productivity savings. Foster credit was $134 million driven by a net ACL build primarily related to spread products. Average loans increased 6% primarily driven by asset-backed lending in spread products as well as margin loans in equities. Average trading account assets increased 15% largely driven by client demand for U.S. treasuries and foreign government securities. Markets generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $1 billion and $4.9 billion for the year and delivered an RoTCE of 7.4% and 9.1% for the year. On Slide 13, we show the results for banking for the fourth quarter and full year. Banking revenues were up 27% largely driven by investment banking with fees up 35% as we saw growth across all products. ECM was driven by continued investment grade issuance momentum and increased leverage finance activity. ECM saw strong issuance activity particularly in follow on and convertible instruments. In M&A, growth was driven by continued strong client engagement as well as the completion of previously announced acquisitions given the more conducive macro environment. For the year, we gained share across regions, products and several sectors including healthcare and technology. Corporate lending revenues excluding mark-to-market on loan hedges, decreased 24%, driven by lower revenue share and volumes partially offset by a smaller impact of Argentina currency devaluation. Expenses decreased 9%, primarily driven by benefits of headcount reduction, as we right sized the workforce and expense base, partially offset by higher volume-related expenses. Cost of credit was a benefit of $240 million, driven by a net ACL release of $247 million, primarily driven by improved macroeconomic conditions. Banking generated positive operating leverage for the fourth quarter in a row and delivered net income of $356 million and $1.5 billion for the year and delivered an RoTCE of 6.5% and 7% for the year. On Slide 14, we show the results for wealth for the fourth quarter and full year. As you can see from our performance this quarter, we are making good progress against our strategy and expect that momentum to continue. Revenues were up 20%, driven by a 22% increase in NIR, as we grew investment fees with client investment assets of 18% including net new investment assets of $16 billion. NII increased 20%, driven by higher average deposit spreads and volumes. Expenses decreased 3% driven by the continued benefit of headcount reductions, as we right-sized the workforce and expense base. End of period client balances increased 8%, driven by higher client investment asset flows and market valuation. Average deposits increased 3%, reflecting the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits from USPB, partially offset by a shift in deposits to higher yielding investments on Citi's platform. Average loans decreased 1%, as we continued to optimize capital usage. Wealth generated a pretax margin of 21% and another quarter of positive operating leverage, delivering net income of $334 million and $1 billion for the year and delivered an RoTCE of 10.1% and 7.6% for the year. On Slide 15, we show the results for U.S. Personal Banking for the fourth quarter and full year. U.S. Personal Banking revenues were up 6%, driven by NII growth of 5% and lower partner payments. Branded cards revenues increased 7% with interest earning balance growth of 7%, as payment rates continue to normalize and we continue to see spend growth, which was up 5%. Retail services revenues increased 7%, driven by lower partner payments and interest earning balance growth of 3%. And retail banking revenues were roughly flat, as the impact of higher deposit spreads was offset by the impact of the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. Expenses decreased 2%, driven by continued productivity savings, partially offset by higher volume related expenses. Cost of credit was $2.2 billion, largely driven by net credit losses, as well as a build primarily for volume growth. Average deposits decreased 18%, largely driven by the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business. USPB generated another quarter of positive operating leverage and delivered net income of $392 million and $1.4 billion for the year and delivered an RoTCE of 6.2% and 5.5% for the year. On Slide 16, we show results for all other items which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiture related items. Revenues decreased 34%, primarily driven by net investment securities losses as we reposition the portfolio, higher funding costs and close, exits and wind outs. Expenses decreased 51%, primarily driven by the absence of the FDIC special assessment and restructuring charge in the prior year as well as the reduction from the closed exits in wind down. And cost of credit was $397 million with net credit losses of $257 million and a net ACL build of $140 million primarily driven by Mexico. Turning to Slide 18, where I will walk you through our current expectations for 2025. As a reminder, what underpins our current expectations is a reflection of a number of scenarios that include different macro and capital market environment. And based on what we know today, we expect revenues to be around $83.5 billion to $84.5 billion, a roughly 3% to 4% increase year-over-year. We expect a continuation of the NIR ex-markets momentum we saw this year driven by investment banking as we continue to gain share in the areas of strategic focus such as healthcare, technology, as well as leverage finance and sponsors assuming a constructive industry wallet. Wealth, supported by a continued focus on growth in client investment assets and banker productivity, which will drive investment revenue services as we execute the strategy we laid out at our Investor Day in June, expanding our leadership position with large institutions and growing our market share with commercial clients in TTS. And in security services, continuing to gain share through investments in our digital and data capabilities while deepening with asset managers and asset owners. Turning to Slide 19, we expect NII ex-market to be up modestly this year. However, there are several tailwinds and headwinds that I will walk you through. Looking at the left hand side of the page, we expect most of the increase to come from volume growth and mix, primarily driven by higher loan volumes in USPB, mainly in cards and deposit volumes in services. We expect the continued benefit from lower yielding investment securities rolling off and being repriced into higher yielding assets such as cash, loans and securities. Partially offsetting these tailwinds are several headwinds including various scenarios around lower rates both in U.S. and non-U.S. Which we expect to be mostly offset by repricing actions across the franchise as well as the potential impact of card late fee reduction and FX. Turning to Slide 20, we expect expenses to be slightly lower than $53.8 billion for 2025. Our expectations reflect continued benefits from our organizational simplification, reduction in stranded costs, and productivity savings from our prior investments. However, offsetting most of these benefits are increased investments in the transformation, technology and the businesses as well as higher volume related expenses. Embedded in our outlook for the year is roughly $600 million for repositioning, which remains elevated, as we continue to reduce stranded costs, drive efficiencies across the businesses, and as benefits from investments in transformation and technology allow us to eliminate manual processes. As Jane said, we recognize that, our expense base remains elevated and we remain very focused on bringing down our expenses each year, while ensuring that, we have enough capacity to invest in the company. Now turning to Slide 21, I will talk you through our expectations going forward. As we enter 2025 and think forward to 2026, we continue to have a clear path to improve returns. Having gone through another robust planning process and having provided revenue and expense targets for 2025, we want to update you on our 2026 RoTCE target range. In 2026, we expect continued revenue growth from both NII and NIR, with drivers largely consistent with recent performance. We expect expenses to decline from 2025 and are targeting an expense level below $53 billion. The reduction in our expense base will come from a decrease in legacy and stranded costs, a more normalized level of severance, and an increase in productivity savings from our prior investments. We will maintain strict discipline on the entire expense base looking for more opportunities to drive further efficiencies, as we go into 2026. We also remain laser-focused on continuing to optimize RWA, but as you know, the future of capital rules and therefore requirements remain uncertain. In light of all of this, we are now targeting an RoTCE in the range of 10% to 11% in 2026. We're committed to driving positive operating leverage and improving our returns every year, for both the firm and the businesses and we will do so in a sustainable way, which will set this company up for long-term success. With that in mind, as part of the $20 billion share repurchase program, we plan on buying back $1.5 billion of common stock in the first quarter. As we take a step back, 2024 represents another year of solid progress and a set of proof points towards improving firm-wide and business performance, as well as continued execution against our transformation. And as we enter 2025, these priorities remain critical, as we continue to make progress on improving our returns. With that, Jane and I will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Jim Mitchell with Seaport Global. Jim Mitchell : Good morning, everyone. Just I think as Jane noted, it seems like a material driver of the reduction in the OCC target in '26 is expenses. I think you kind of backed off the lower end of that given higher investments in the transformation, but also talked about it being somewhat temporary. So when we think about and we appreciate the below 53 for '26, but how much more is there to go beyond that in terms of eliminating parallel running parallel systems, reduce consultant spend and all that stuff? Is there still that path to a 60% or lower efficiency ratio? Jane Fraser : Well, Happy New Year, Jim. I know you want to talk about the guidance, so let me put it into context here. Last year you've heard me be very clear about our two priorities. First one is driving the business performance and the second is executing the transformation. You've seen this quarter, you've seen last quarter, you've seen the full year, our businesses are delivering the progress we wanted them to. The strategy is working. We change the business mix, we're generating more fee based revenues. You see that in services with NIR up 37% this year, wealth NIR up 15%, IBCs up 35%, an important part of the mix around the quality of our earnings. We said services is a crown jewel. It's delivered growth, high returns, it's taken share. It's a crown jewel. We made a strategic plan well and you've seen us very steadily prove out why we can be a force globally with a clear path to delivering the financial performance that we said we would do. We've consistently delivered on our revenue and expense targets. And I see a lot more opportunity and more upside to strengthen our business performance. We're very tangibly getting after it. We're pretty excited by it. The second priority, transformation. I got to tell you, I'm broadly pleased with the progress we've made in risk and compliance and accountability. I'm excited by the work we've got going on in controls for the business as well at the moment. We've been very transparent. Data was an area we have more work to do in. Last year, as you know and then as part of the annual planning process, we took a big step back to reassess our plan. And I decided along with Mark and the management team, we needed to expand the scope and accelerate some of the work to satisfy our regulators' expectations. I'm confident that the decision to do that, it was the right one. It's the right one for our transformation efforts. It's certainly the right one for the firm overall. I could have taken a short term decision to cut other investments that are important for our long term investment and competitiveness. I'm just not going to do that. You shouldn't want me to do that. And as I said in the opening comments, this \u201826 target is a waypoint not the final destination. Mark Mason : And if I could add. Jim Mitchell : Yes, please Mark. Mark Mason : Yeah, thanks. I just want to address the second part of your question, Jim, in terms of the path to less than 60%. I think Jane framed it out quite nicely in that, we're building a franchise that will have continued and sustainable top line revenue momentum. We are focused on driving out the inefficiencies and stranded cost and legacy franchise expenses from the organization and the benefits from these investments we've made in the transformation will yield a lower cost structure over time as well. And so the combination of those things will get us to that targeted operating efficiency as we come out of 2026 at less than 60%. So yes, there is still a path and we are focused on that path. Jim Mitchell : Okay, great. That's very helpful. And then just maybe pivoting to the buyback rate to see the $20 billion authorization. Obviously, can't help but ask about beyond 1Q. If we do sort of get this more certainty, maybe no increase in capital requirements, does it -- does that start to help you may be at least temporarily lower the buffer to take advantage of your trading below tangible book and getting the accretion and accelerating the buyback? Or, how do you think about the rest of the year on the buybacks? Mark Mason : Look, I'll make a couple of comments. One, we're very pleased to have announced the buyback program at $20 billion. I think in many ways that is a demonstration if you will, of continued confidence in the earnings generation and momentum that we have around that, as well as the recognition that we are trading below book and not where we want to be. And you've heard both Jane and I, speak to the importance of increasing and doing more in the way of buybacks. We've increased that to $1.5 billion. I think that supports that same degree of confidence that we have in the momentum. We are constantly looking at every year on an annual basis, as we go through our planning process at the management buffer that we have of 100 basis points. And despite the last couple of quarters at running above the 13.1%, our target is the 13.1%. And so, as we get -- as we go through the balance of the year, as we get clarity on reg rules and what have you, you will see us continue to that 13.1%. Obviously, the two important characteristics that we keep or drivers that we keep in mind is, the opportunity to invest more in the business at accretive returns and where we're trading and the need to do more buybacks in order to reflect the underlying value. So target is 13.1%, we continue to look at that management buffer as the regulatory environment evolves and we will continue to do more in the way of capital actions as that makes sense. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of John McDonald with Truist Securities. John McDonald : Thank you. Mark, just wanted to follow-up on your answer to Jim right there. So when you look at the 10% to 11% RoTCE target for 2026, is that kind of assuming you'll be around the target or like using the 13.1% as the target and then longer-term you hope to bring that target down as rules get clarified and the franchise gets simplified? Mark Mason : John, good to hear from you. In fact, yes, the 10% to 11% RoTCE target we've set for '26 does assume that we are running and using a 13.1% CET1 ratio. Obviously, there will be an SCB that comes out sometime later this year. The rules are continuing to evolve and what have you and we'll factor those in, as we know more about them. But yes, it does assume the 13.1% which is our management target, if you will, for CET1. John McDonald : Okay, great. And then my next question is, could you clarify what you're expecting this year for card net charge-offs? I understand, the quarterly cadence has seasonality, but for the full year expecting the charge offs to be in the range of last year's guidance. Can you just kind of clarify that, and then maybe just talk about provision build, which you had a lot of in 2024 and whether that could slow down, as the maturation of balances slows down? Mark Mason : Sure. In terms of the net credit losses and the forecast that we have, we are expecting that, the net credit losses will be at the high end of the range that we've given. In the case of branded cards that 3.5% to 4% is the full year range that we've given. In the case of retail services, it's 5.75% to 6.25%, excuse me. And so right now, retail services is at that high end at 6.28% for 2024. We'd expect it to stay at that high end, although I'm sorry. And then on branded cards, we're at 3.64% we'd expect it to creep up to about the 4% level over the course of the year. But full year NCL rate and we know that there's seasonality through the quarters. And so you'll see movement through the quarters based on that dynamic. And then just in terms of the provision build, there are a couple of drivers there. One is obviously volume and we do expect to see volume growth in USPB. So that will be an important factor in how the CECL calculations are done. And then the second driver is obviously as we run models and the models have they have a base scenario, they have a downside and upside scenario depending on the broader macro factors, unemployment, GDP, etcetera, etcetera and are waiting towards the likelihood of high or upside or downside scenario. Those factors become important considerations in the provisioning. And so that's how we think about that going into 2025. I hope that helps. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just a clarification. So you are guiding for three consecutive years of lower expenses, including that $600 million reposition this year. So they were down in \u201824, you're guiding them lower in \u201825, and you guide them lower in \u201826 again. And you're also guiding for three consecutive years of higher revenues based on what you said. I didn't say that in the written materials, but I think I heard you say that Mark. So three years of lower expenses, three years of higher revenues through at least 26%. Is that correct? Mark Mason : No, I mean, I think you described it correctly like we're seeing continued momentum on the top line and we're focused on continuing to bring our expenses down just as we did in '24, a tad bit in '25 and then more in '26. Mike Mayo : All right. Then I guess this is for Jane. Well that beat haggis on toast if you achieve that, but I'm wondering why that efficiency might not improve even more. If you have $5 billion of stranded costs and transformation costs in 2024 and some of that goes down, I heard you're investing in tech and transformation and volume and the businesses and there's always a trade-off between the bottom line results you show today and the growth you show in the future. And it seems like you're going to get this done, the lower expenses, why you're leaning into a little bit extra growth. So talk about that trade off and where you're leaning in for growth a little bit more. Jane Fraser : First of all, I'm a little disturbed by your comment about haggis on toast, it's haggis with mashed potatoes and whiskey, just to be clear for everyone. It's Robert Burns night coming up soon. On expenses, Mike and everyone expenses are a focus not just for Mark and I but for the entire management team. We're making sure that focus and discipline is really getting installed and instilled into the DNA of Citi. And you've seen that as you've referenced. We've been meeting our expense guidance over the last couple of years. We've been driving positive operating efficiency. We're all very focused on improving our operating expense base. Consolidating technology, the simplification work, automation, getting different utilities put in place rather than fragmented around the firm using AI tools now, our location strategy, right? So that core operating expense base is something that we're really looking at how do we drive to be more efficient, more modern and getting it to the level it should be, for the revenues that we generate. We all want transformation to get done quickly and we want it to get done right. That is why our expenses are temporarily elevated to make the investments that are needed there. This is not all run rate. As you say, as CEO, I will not sacrifice the right long-term investments in our growth and competitiveness for short-term expediency. This is a waypoint, it's not a destination and we know what we need to do. We've got our arms around all of this with execution. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley. Betsy Graseck : Hi, good morning. Jane, just to follow-up on what you mentioned. As you do execute, we all expect or at least, I do that the market will be giving you credit for that execution, and meaning multiple should increase. I'm a little bit -- I have a few questions here on the buyback, because right now, today, as we all know, you're trading blow book. It has got to be, buying back stock has got to be the most accretive use of capital today. And why wait on the buyback when you can lean into it today and keep your 2026 guide? I mean the old guide was 11% to 12%, RoTCE, new guide 10% to 11%. I'm kind of confused why you don't pull that lever more aggressively because buying back the stock, the accretion to tangible book, it's got to be the easiest thing to do to help that RoTCE go up when you compare and contrast against all the hard work you've been doing, which will obviously be very important to getting the RoTCE up. But why not lean more into that buyback? And can you give us a sense of the timing of that $20 billion? Jane Fraser : Yes. Betsy, I love the passion. I've got to say, I can hear the determination in your voice. I think it's the same determination we feel. Look, we're very committed to returning capital to shareholders period or full stop. We've got a $20 billion buyback program. As Mark said that is reflective of the growing earnings power that we have and our confidence in the path ahead. We've been increasing the amount of capital turn over the last few quarters, and we -- I'm also happy to see a more aggressive Basel III scenario firmly off the table. We have nonetheless a 13.1% CET ratio that we put in the plan that can change over time as well. But there's not complete certainty around where the capital requirements are going to go. We hope there will be a holistic one that is reflective of the risk profile of the bank that's been improving significantly over the last few years. So we have some great growth opportunities. I look at the different areas. I'm excited by what we see in wealth. We've got a great runway with our clients who want to do business with us in banking. We've got some very important investments and investment agenda that we're putting in to help us continue growing the bank, gaining competitiveness in a responsible way. I'll just conclude with exactly your point. The bar is high on those investments, right? We don't make them unless we see extremely attractive marginal RoTCE and there's a lot of things we say no to in order to put the $20 billion program in place. In terms of timing, like our peers, we're not committing to this particular timeframe from this, but you can see our commitment. You can hear our commitment. Operator : Our next question will come from the line of Ebrahim Poonawala with Bank of America. Ebrahim Poonawala : Hey, good morning. I guess maybe Jane, I want to follow-up on a couple of segments. I think you said 2024 turning point for wealth and you've seen very steady progress on the RoTCE in wealth. Just talk to us in terms of [Indiscernible] has been in the seat for a year now, you've seen progress, what needs to happen? Just talk to us a little bit about the franchise positioning competitively both in the U.S. and abroad as you think about going head to head with some of your global peers and where are the most likely growth opportunities over the next year or two? Jane Fraser : Yes, so my vision is that we become a global leader in wealth management. There are not many firms that have the globality of Citi. We have all the assets especially the client relationships all around the world, which we just not tapped for investments in the past. It's a big opportunity. We have $5.3 trillion off from existing clients. I think the fact that I find interesting is 55% of it, it's almost $3 trillion with affluent clients in our branch network in America, in the U.S. We're also very well-positioned to capture new wealth. Just think about what Citi does in terms of our footprint, our capabilities really supports wealth creation from the commercial bank, our investment banking side, markets obviously servicing it too. These are all great feeders for us to strengthen wealth relationships with our clients. To report in Andy. Andy greatly sharpened the focus on the investment business. This is where we see this big upside. He's been building a differentiated value proposition around wealth creation. He's been leveraging a lot of the leading capital market capabilities, the different relationships we have with PE firms, asset managers around the world, get a great platform in place. And importantly, improving our client experience, again particularly around investments and asset allocation, performance etcetera. What else I've got to love is the surgical approach that he's taking to the expense base and driving productivity, something that we're doing across the firm. I'm also excited by the talent he's bringing in. The market leaders like Kate Moore and Keith Glenfield in the investment space. And we've made a lot of investments in training and building this investment culture that we didn\u2019t have before. So to your point, the proof points are working. Q4 revenue up 20%, operating margin at 21% on its way to 25% to 30%, 10% RoTCE on its way to 15% to 20%. These last few quarters, you've just seen us on that March and the number I'm most excited by net new investment asset inflow of $42 billion up 40% year-over-year. The strategy is working. We're going to be a leader in wealth, the growth opportunities Asia, U.S, Middle East, all the places where we are with our existing clients and the new wealth generators of the future. Ebrahim Poonawala : If I can draw a parallel segment with the RoTCE is about 5% to 6% last few quarters, there you brought in a [Vivek] Agarwal from JPMorgan. Just give us a sense of could we see a similar trajectory in that business over the next 12 months and where the opportunities are to improve their ROE? Jane Fraser : Yes. Absolutely, we have a strong performance, the strategy we have in place is delivering nicely. If you look at the revenues, the investment banking fees, positive operating leverage all through the year and gaining share, all three products, gaining share in all three in all of the geographies we're in. I'm really excited and happy to see the healthcare and the technology at two areas that we've been investing heavily behind. And you're also seeing us playing a leading role in some of the key transactions, the biggest transactions last year, Mars, Kellanova, single advisor, big role in Boeing, and then just this week, the J&J acquisition of Intra-Cellular. The deals that matter playing a leading role in. So when this joined, the mandate a bit similar to Andy, become a top three investment bank, deliver the full potential of One Citi to our clients. So we've got a lot of upside there, instilling some more discipline in capital allocation, client coverage, some of the cross firm linkages. We're getting a lot more from our people. We've been bringing in some great new talent. We've also been cutting some of the unproductive spend. I think what you can see is, we're just on a path of systematically growing our wallet. We'll be improving our operating margin, generating higher returns that should be your expectation over the next couple of years of what you'll see from us. As we head into great environment in 2025, it should be pretty conducive for a lot of client activity. I'm very confident we've got the -- we're well positioned. We've got the groundwork done to take advantage of it. Mark Mason : I thought I heard you say RoTCE of 5%. It's actually 7% for the full year for banking and on its way to the target that we have set of mid-teens for our banking business. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Erika Najarian with UBS. Erika Najarian : Thank you. Hate to ask [indiscernible] question on the buyback, but clearly the way the stock is reacting today, the buyback is very important to your shareholders. I guess my first question, if I could have the two questions is, it's very clear that you want to return capital to shareholders. It's very clear that you have excess capital. It's very clear that your PPNR trajectory is positive. And so what are the specific mile markers that Citi needs to see in order to increase that piecing from that $1.5 billion a quarter to something that is more suggestive of a pace that would be in line with that $20 billion authorization? I know that this has been asked of you already, but is it the consent order? Is it the stress test? We have some news over the holidays that were positive for the sector. What are those specific mile markers? I mean, you're doing it on the PPNR side, right? What do you need to see to have gain even more confidence again like in leaning to Betsy's words to go all in on the buyback? Mark Mason : Yes. So thank you for the question. Let me make clear a couple of things. So one, and I have said this already, so I apologize for repeating myself. But one, our target for CET1 is 13.1%, right? And so what you're going to see over the course of the year is us managing down to that target. That's one point. The second point I want to be clear that it's not the consent order. That's not something that is impacting the capital actions and decisions that we take. We obviously forecast out the performance. As I've said, Jane has said already, we see very strong continued earnings momentum. I'm managing towards a 13.1% CET1 ratio and you'll see the buyback trajectory reflect getting down to that CET1. The one thing I will mention and you mentioned already is that we obviously have another CCAR process stress test that we will go through. And none of us can predict what's on the other side of that from an SCB point of view, but that will be an important factor as we get through the first half of the year and into the second half of the year in terms of the level of buybacks that we will be taking on a quarter by quarter basis. So I hope that helps. There are no artificial constraints so to speak that are in place. This is us planning and forecasting the performance of the franchise, ensuring that we can fuel high returning growth opportunities so that we're building a sustainable franchise looking at the capital requirements that we have and the management buffer that we put in place and therefore taking that excess capacity and putting it towards buybacks but with an eye towards the regulatory environment that we're in. And what by that are the capital requirements that come out of the annual stress testing process that's run. So that's the basics of it as we sit here today. Erika Najarian : Got it. And just my second question as we think about 2026, and again I don't want to put words in your mouth because clearly it's very critical in terms of your targets and hitting them. So you targeted less than $53 billion. Is it fair to assume like Jim was asking that $51 billion to $53 billion is not the target but it's less than $53 billion. But to that end, just taking a step back, I think Jane, you said something very important in that you want to get to the returns in a sustainable way. And clearly, your shareholders are scarred by previous management when the returns went up to double digits and went back tumbling down and wasn't sustainable. And should we just really think of this as look, like it takes a while to turn around a money center bank and 2026 may have been the target in 2022, but we're going to get there in '27, '28 anyway and we're just doing this in a sustainable way and we're not robbing the bank of investments. I guess, I'm just trying to think about everybody is super focused on what you had said, what you had said previously and now you have different targets, but is it just really like look it just takes longer, we'll get there but it just takes longer and maybe just an addendum to that, how should we expect Banamex to impact that 10% to 11% RoTCE in terms of the immediate impact after IPO and then after you deploy the excess capital that you get back? Jane Fraser : Erica, we chose the words very carefully to say that \u201826 is a waypoint, it's not the destination. And when I'm looking out to \u201827, \u201828 what is the bank that we want to be in terms of our strategy, our performance, our culture, all those different dimensions and we just relentlessly keep going down that path, but we're going to take the right and responsible decisions as we go down it. So our potential is for more than our medium-term target RoTCE. The potential of the Bank and the journey that we're on is to improve our returns beyond there for sure. And then, you asked a question about Banamex. On that front, look, we had a singular focus on the separation of two banks. That was an enormous body of work, because we had to put up Mexico's eighth largest bank, de novo, in a very short period of time. It got done December 1st. That was over 100 regulatory approvals to get that done. Now we have turned our full attention to the IPO. We're getting ready to be able to IPO as soon as we can. But given market conditions and given regulatory approvals, it's possible this could go into '26, but we're doing everything in our control to be ready as soon as possible. We are not the right owner of the Bank. We are committed to the simplification of Citi. We will follow a responsible process here. Mark Mason : Just in terms of the impact and the timing that Jane referenced, just keep in mind that, the financial impact of exiting Banamex comes in two forms. One is the gain or loss on sale and two is the risk weighted asset release. The gain or loss on sale will run through the P&L at deconsolidation. So that's the point where we've gotten or we've IPO-ed more than the 50%. And the ultimate benefit will be driven by the RWA release when we fully divest our stake. And so, hopefully that helps, but it's not until we've deconsolidated that we see that P&L impact and the CTA and other things like that kind of flow through the P&L for Banamex. Operator : Our next question will come from Gerard Cassidy with RBC Capital Markets. Gerard Cassidy : Jane, I'll pass on the -- but I'll take you up on the whiskey. Jane Fraser : I didn't say I was buying, just to be clear. Gerard Cassidy : Okay, I got it. Our expense report on this end. Anyway, just following up Mark on your comments about the IPO with Banamex, can you guys remind us or refresh our memories on when the IPO process starts, what will you be -- once it goes public, what percentage ownership do you guys expect to have? And second, have you given us any color on whether you expect to report a gain on this transaction or a loss, as you just referenced will go through the P&L? Mark Mason : Yes. We haven't given you any sense for the exact timing of that. As you know, this is a process. And so, Jane just spoke to the timing of that process, the first step having been completed on December 1st with the separation. We are now obviously gearing up and readying ourselves for the IPO. There will obviously be important filings associated with that, given our intent to dual list. There will be regulatory approvals, that are required kind of, as we make headway with potential investors as part of the IPO process. And so, there are series of IPO steps that we will need to take over the course of the year in order to continue to ready ourselves. There are things that we don't control, like, as Jane mentioned, the regulatory approval process and timing for that as well as the market conditions. And so all of those factors are important, and then how the IPO occurs in terms of percentage that is taken on at that first tranche versus follow on tranches are important factors on when we get to deconsolidation. And so I haven't given you an exact timing on that, but you can envision 15% kind of tranches that happened over a 12, 18-month, 24-month period. And then obviously reaching a point of deconsolidation at which point that currency translation adjustment starts to flow through the P&L. There's no material impact on capital, but it does flow through the P&L and then ultimately we over the course of time. So I'm sorry I'm not giving you precise dates and percentages and part of that is because we are obviously on the front end of not only readying ourselves, but considering alternative IPO structures and potential investors/shareholders as part of that process. Gerard Cassidy : Well, I appreciate the insights. And then, as a follow-up question and I really don't mean this what have you done for me lately type question because you guys have made so much progress in what you're doing in your strategic changes here. But can you talk about the U.S. Personal Banking, many of your questions today is about the RoTCE consolidated and how you can improve that. And this business has a very low RoTCE as you guys know below your cost of capital and structurally when you look at it, if you look at the loans at the end of period just over $220 billion your deposits about $90 billion which is quite a bit different than your peers who have much higher ROEs. So how do you approach this business? And again I know you've been very busy divesting a lot of the businesses that are not important but it seems to me that this is a giant hurdle that you guys have to approach at some point in the near future? Jane Fraser : Let me just chat a bit through this. So how did what's the path to the high returns in U.S. Personal Banking? It's coming from top line revenue growth, improved expense base and also a more normalized credit environment. And that gets us to the mid to high-teen returns in the medium term. I think we feel very confident and comfortable in that. You're seeing the proof points, I talked about banking wealth earlier. We've had another good quarter of revenue growth. We've had the ninth consecutive quarter of operating leverage. So I think you should be getting some comfort around that. What's going to drive that growth? Co-brands, we just extended with American to be their sole issuer. It's going to give exciting benefits to the American Airlines and the Citi cardholders, and it will be beneficial for both our growth and our returns. In the proprietary front, we're investing. There's a lot of investment in innovation to drive growth. So refresh the start of Premier card, we've been enhancing the reward offerings and you're seeing us often now number one in recognitions and awards around that area. Retail Services being forensically focused on improving the partnership economics and driving top line growth. And then retail banking, there we're driving primary checking growth. We put in simplified banking, so we get a much more streamlined customer proposition that's driving more of a relationship based banking approach as opposed to a transactional one. Importantly as well, the retail banks been feeding our Wealth business. You heard me earlier talking about that, almost $3 trillion of off us investment opportunity that we have from the retail banking customer base. We transferred $17 billion of deposits from USPB to wealth. So you got to take that those dynamics into account. So, I hope you're taking from me. I feel confident in our ability to get to the medium-term targets we set for the business of mid-to-high teens. I feel comfortable about the growth trajectory that we've got based off the innovations we're putting through and the changes and good expense discipline and a better credit environment. So when you look at the mix of our business, you'll see us performing nicely here. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Matt O'Connor with Deutsche Bank. Matt O'Connor: Hi. I just want to follow-up on Page 9 where you break out the technology and transformation investment spend. Sorry if I missed this, but did you talk about the pace of those two levels in your '25 and '26 expense guidance? I know directionally you said it's going up, but did you get a magnitude? Mark Mason : I did not. Obviously, for both technology and transformation those are areas that we are going to continue to invest in for all the reasons that we've mentioned. They obviously contribute to the number in '25 being slightly down from the 53.8%. But they also represent as I mentioned, what we believe is required to kind of get the work done that we need to get done. And so, those numbers will increase. There are lots of puts-and-takes, as you know through an annual expense forecast, including as you would expect we've got volume -- we've got revenue growth here that's going to come with volume growth. Volume incentive comp, there's merit increases that go with that, and then we also have a series of productivity actions that are playing through to offset those headwinds, whether it be the additional carryover from the org simplification and full year impact of that, or some of the legacy stranded coming down. And so, there are puts-and-takes, but transformation and technology specifically, we are continuing to invest in order to achieve what we need to get done here and also ensure the businesses have what they need to drive sustainable growth going forward. Matt O'Connor: I guess, how do you know that the recent increase that you are modeling internally in these areas? How do you know you are spending enough and in the right ways to address your goals in the transformation and also satisfy the regulatory requirements? Jane Fraser : Well, if I jump in, I feel very confident indeed that we know what we need to do, we know what we need to be spending on through the annual planning process that concluded last month. It was clear that, we did need to invest some more. We increased the scope of some of the work on the data front. We brought some other work forward. We looked at what we needed to do on the technology front and some of the critical investments. This is pretty forensic. And when, we're looking at transformation, we're looking at technology. We know what our target states need to be and we know what we need to do to get there and the outcomes they need to be delivering. So we've got our arms around this, and I think you're hearing that confidence from us around know what we need to do, we know the investments we need to make, we know what the outcomes and the benefits for shareholders and the regulatory side need to be. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Saul Martinez with HSBC. Saul Martinez : Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Mark, the NII ex-markets outlook, if I just take the fourth quarter and annualize that, it gets to something in the neighborhood of, I think, around 47.4%, 47.5%, which is above the full year \u201824 level. I am not sure exactly what up modestly means, if that's 1%, 3%, 4%. But correct me, if I'm wrong, but it seems like maybe there's a little bit of conservatism built in. But can you just -- if you can just comment on how you think how we should think about the quarterly trajectory of NII ex-market? Obviously, there's day count issued in 1Q, but maybe how do you think through like how we should expect that NII to evolve over the course of the year? Mark Mason : Yeah. why don't I just cut to the chase on it a little bit, Saul, in the sense that up modestly, call it a couple percentage points, 2 to 3 percentage points or so, right, in terms of how I think about it. And I think I've taken I've gone through the tailwinds and headwinds. I won't take you through that again, but I think the important takeaway should be that we are going to see continued momentum across the franchise driven by loan growth in the branded card side of the business and continued deposit momentum particularly operating deposits and services. And we're going to do everything that we always do around the management of pricing and we'll get a benefit from how we've been managing our investment portfolio as those things mature. And the combination of those efforts will offset some of the more than offset some of the headwinds that you would expect in a declining rate environment and modestly, let's call it, 2% to 3%. Saul Martinez : Okay. Fair enough. And then on the expense outlook getting to below 53% in 2026, I know that's consistent with what you said in the past. But it does imply a pretty sharp reduction in '26, especially in light of continued revenue growth, It's pretty material operating leverage. Just, how much benefit do you get from a more normalized severance? In other words, how much the severance how much are we thinking about severance coming down? What sort of the impact or how to think about the legacy stranded costs coming down? Just maybe a little bit more meat on the bone in terms of how much these items will benefit '26 versus '25? Mark Mason : Yeah. Look, a couple of things. So if you look if I as I look at our severance costs, which as I mentioned has been running high with 700. We're forecasting 600 in 2025. I think kind of normal through the cycle is probably, call it, 300 or so. And so that gives you some sense for that. I think the other thing is if you look at the other page and again there were a number of drivers or levers that we intend to pull to bring that down, but in the all other page where you look to the right, we show wind downs and what's remaining in terms of legacy franchise. And there's if you add those numbers together $1.9 billion or so of expenses and think about a subset of that being stranded. And we're going to continue to focus on how do we bring down stranded cost over the next couple of years. So those are two important factors or contributors to the decline from the slightly lower than 53.8% to the 53%. There are additional productivity saves from prior investments that we've made, but those are important factors. And then, as we look at the transformation spend that will continue to or start to pay dividends or help to bring down cost as well. So you've got really those four variables that contribute to us bringing that number down. And as Jane has mentioned, we're going to, even post '26 continue to bring or drive out more inefficiencies around the organization to fund required investments for the business growth and all with a continued focus on getting to less than 60%, as we exit 2026, less than 60% operating efficiency. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Mike Mayo with Wells Fargo. Mike Mayo : Hi. Just first full year of having the five line of business structure. Mark, do you still have the same line of business targets that you had last year? And Jane, with all the -- it must have been a degree of hell to organize this way, get rid of your two intercompany holding companies, eliminate five layers of management, expand the span of control. You guys went through a lot last year. I'm just wondering, is the worst over in terms of that kind of reorganization internally and the culture and the sentiment and how you see that continuing? But first a concrete question about the targets please. Mark Mason : I guess I'll start first. In terms of the targets, look, we set the targets across each of the lines of business for the medium-term. We've obviously brought down the 2026 to 10% to 11%. And so, you'd imagine, there's some movement at least for the 2026 in terms of those targets. Banking will likely be a little bit lower than the mid-15% if I think about 2026, as being that medium-term target date. But over time, I expect that, the targets that I've set are the targets that we will achieve and even more, because as Jane mentioned 10% to 11%, while that's our 2026 target. It is not our longer-term target, as we think about RoTCE and the strength of these businesses in the aggregate franchise. Hopefully, it answers your question. Jane Fraser : On terms of org simplification, culture, the best is still ahead that is for sure. The org went through a lot. I'm really proud of how people responded, and I think we're really proud of how each of the lines of business are driving the business performance forward. The bank is simpler. There is tremendous transparency for me. There's much greater proximity to the businesses now, and you can see that the benefits that we're starting to realize from the strategy as we get closer and closer to the RoTCE targets and beyond for each of the businesses. So I am pleased to have '24 behind us. I'm proud of what we achieved in 2024. All the focus is on the future onwards. Operator : There are no further questions. I'll now turn the call over to Jenn Landis for closing remarks. Jenn Landis : Thank you, everyone. Please call us or e-mail us if you have any follow-up questions. Have a great afternoon. Thank you.
