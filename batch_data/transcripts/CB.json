Those listening after April 24, 2014, should please note that the information and forecast provided in this recording will not necessarily be updated and it is possible that information will no longer be current. Now, I'll turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan. John Finnegan : Thank you for joining us. As we said in the press release today, Chubb produced solid results in the quarter, which was adversely impacted by several factors, including cat and non-cat weather losses due to the harsh winter weather in the United States, and then usually high level homeowners' fire losses. We are very pleased with the continued positive rate movement in all three of our businesses along with continued strong retention. Our commercial businesses have particularly strong quarters. In professional liability, our combined ratio of 84.6 was as good at quarter as we've had in five years. It represented a whapping 7.8 point improvement from our first quarter of last year. In CCI, our x cat combined ratio of 82.4 was our third best quarterly performance in six years. The performance of both of these businesses benefited from the rate actions and underwriting initiatives that we have undertaken over the past few years. Operating income per share was $1.50 compared to $2.14 in last year's first quarter. Annualized operating ROE was 10.1% for the first quarter of this quarter. The combined ratio for the first quarter was 93.2 this year compared to 84.6 last year. Excluding the impact of cats to combined ratio for the first quarter was 86.6 in 2014 versus 84 a year ago. This deterioration is more than fully accounted for by the higher x cat weather-related losses and homeowner fire losses in this year's first quarter. During the first quarter, we had net realized investments gains of 160 million before tax or $0.30 per share after-tax. This brought up first quarter net income per share to $1.80 resulted in an annualized ROE of 11.1%. GAAP book value per share at March 31, 2014 was $66.36, that's 2% increase in sheer end 2013 and a 7% increase at March 31 a year ago. Our capital position is excellent and we continue to actively repurchase our shares as Ricky will discuss later. In addition, during the first quarter we increased our common stock dividend by 13.6% to $2 per share on an annualized basis. It was Chubb's 32nd consecutive annual dividend increase. Now, for more details on our operating performance, we will start with Dino, who will discuss Chubb's commercial and specialty insurance operations. Dino Robusto : Thanks, John. Chubb commercial insurance and Chubb's specialty insurance, both had strong performance in the first quarter, starting with CCI, the first quarter combined ratio was 88.5 in 2014 compared to 81.9 in 2013. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 6.1 point of the combined ratio compared to minus 1.7 point in the year ago first quarter. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI's first quarter combined ratio improved from 83.6 in 2013 to 82.4 in 2014. The 82.4 is within (indiscernible) points of CCI's, the best x cat combined ratio in the last six years. CCI's first quarter net written premiums were down 1% to $1.4 billion with flat growth in the U.S. and down 4% outside the U.S. which in general continues to be a more competitive environment. Although overall growth was down, we continue to retain our best accounts and write new business in the segments where we are the most rate adequate. While at the same time, maintaining discipline of culling accounts where we can't secure appropriate terms and condition. A balance among these actions will vary from quarter-to-quarter based on our mix of business, which in the first quarter resulted in a small decline in overall premium. This slow start in the beginning of the year actually improved in March. In April, it's coming in even stronger than March. So we are optimistic about stronger growth in the second quarter than the first quarter based on the quality and quantity of opportunities we are seeing in our target markets. CCI's average U.S. renewal rate increase in the first quarter of 2014 was 5%, which is above our long run loss cost trend. Given the 6% to 7% increases we experienced in the U.S. in the prior three quarters, the year end impact in the first quarter was 6%. Outside the United States, CCI's average renewal rate increases were in the low single-digit. CCI achieved average U.S. renewal rate increases in every line of business. And as we discussed on our prior earnings call, after three years of rate increases much of our book is no longer in need of large rate increases. So, on a number of segments we are pushing for greater retention and more moderate rate increases and we are writing the majority of new business and segments, but we are the most rate adequate. And the first quarter in the large part reflects this strategy. CCI's first quarter renewal retention in the U.S. increased to 85% from 83% in the fourth quarter of 2013. CCI's new to loss business ratio in the U.S. was 0.9 to 1 compared to 0.7 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2013, and 0.8 to 1 in the same period last year. It's important to remember we have never relied solely on rate to achieve our historically excellent results. As more and more of our book approaches rate adequacy and rate increase is moderate, we will continue to target growing our profit by remaining vigilant in our underwriting and management of our mix of business across our board set of products in customer segment. It is this legacy of underwriting expertise that allowed us to build an enviable book of business, which we expect will enable us to maintain strong performance relative to the industry in any market. Moving to Chubb's specialty insurance, net written premiums were down 1% in the first quarter to $624 million. CSI's first quarter combined ratio was 88.9 in 2014 versus 87.4 in 2013. For the professional liability portion of CSI, which represents the lion share of the portfolio, net written premiums were up 1% to $552 million. Similar to CCI, the marketplace outside the U.S. continues to be more competitive than in the U.S. with premiums down 2% outside the U.S., but up 2% in the U.S. The combined ratio for professional liability improved almost eight points to 84.6 from 92.4 in the year ago quarter. That 84.6 is the best combined ratio that professional liability has produced in the last ten quarters. We are very pleased with the 7% average renewal rate increase we achieved for professional lines in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2014 as we continue to drive greater profitability. The first quarter of 2014 was the 10th consecutive quarter of professional liability renewal rate increases in the U.S. and the 7th consecutive quarter that professional liability rate increases ranged from 7% to 9%. Each of our professional liability lines of business in the United States achieved renewal rate increases in the first quarter. As in CCI, we continue to differentiate our rate and retention action based on the performance of each line of business and each policy. In markets outside the U.S. average renewal rate increases for professional liability in the first quarter were consistent with the fourth quarter 2013 rising by low single-digit. Renewal retention for professional liability in the U.S. in the first quarter was 85% up one point from the fourth quarter 2013 and up four points from the first quarter of 2013. Retention was the highest for our best performing segments and lowest for our worst performing, again improving the overall quality of our book of business. The new to loss business ratio for professional liability in the first quarter was 0.9 to 1, up from 0.8 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2013, which continues the flow of steady improvement in that metric since the first quarter of 2013 as more of the new business we target is meeting our demanding underwriting standards. Turning to the surety portion of our CSI book, net written premiums in the first quarter were down 13% to $72 million, also impacted by the competitive marketplace outside the U.S. The combined ratio for surety was 122.9%. The unusually high combined ratio was driven by one large loss in the current accident year from an insured outside the United States that was primarily engaged in mining construction services, whose business failed due to several problem contacts they inherited as a result of an acquisition. As we've stated in previous earnings calls, results can e lumpy in the surety business as the presence or absence of a large loss can have a significant impact especially on one quarter's results. The last time surety had an unprofitable quarter was back in 2008. Our aggregate loss ratio since 2005 is under 15%. So clearly our surety business has been very profitable and remains attractive to us. And with that, I'll turn it over to Paul, who will review our personal lines and corporate-wide claim results. Paul Krump : Thanks, Dino. Chubb's personal insurance net written premiums increased 3% to $1 billion, and CPI produced a combined ratio of 101.8 compared to 87 in the corresponding quarter last year. CPI's profitability was adversely affected by the severe winter weather resulting in both increased cat and non-cat losses as well as several large fire losses. The impact of catastrophes on CPI's first quarter combined ratio was 11.2 point in 2014 compared to 3.9 points in the first quarter a year ago. On an x cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 90.6 in the first quarter compared to 83.1 in the first quarter of 2013. Homeowners' premiums grew 4% in the first quarter. The combined ratio was 104.9 compared to 82.5 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 17.9 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of 2014 compared to 6.1 point in the first quarter of 2013. Due to the unprecedented cold snap, some of the homes of our targeted high net worth customers experienced costly interior damage especially from burst pipes and ice damages. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, the 2014 first quarter homeowners combined ratio was 87 compared to 76.4 in the same period a year ago. This 10.6 point difference is more than accounted for by the first quarter's unusual non-cat weather-related losses and an increase in the impact of large fire losses. As I mentioned, the severe winter resulted in an elevated level of non-cat weather-related losses compared to last year's mild winter. Non-cat weather-related losses accounted for about 14 points of our homeowners combined ratio in the first quarter of this year, which is nine points higher than in the first quarter of 2013. In addition, we experienced an uptake in home fires or a perspective on how the first quarter 2014 fire loss impact stacks up. It was 4.5 points higher than in the first quarter of 2013. To summarize, when one compares the homeowners x cat loss ratios of the first quarter of 2014 and the first quarter of 2013, this year's elevated non-cat weather-related losses added nine points. And the impact of fire losses added about 4.5 points. Together, these 13.5 additional points of losses in the first quarter of 2014 more than account for the 10 points fixed point of year-over-year deterioration in the homeowners' x cat loss ratio. During the first quarter of 2014, we achieved an average homeowner's renewal rate and exposure increase of 7% in the United States. The same is in the first quarter of 2013. Our pricing momentum remained strong, and this is our fourth year of homeowners renewal rate and exposure increase. Personal auto premiums declined 2%, and the combined ratio was 101.4 compared to 94 in the first quarter of 2013. Worldwide auto growth was down in the quarter as we experienced a negative impact from foreign currency translation, as well as, slower growth in our Brazilian operation due to targeted rate action. Auto growth in the U.S. remains strong at 5% driven by renewal rate and exposure increases. U.S. in force comp was up slightly as well versus the first quarter of 2013. The auto combined ratio in the quarter was adversely affected by challenging winter driving conditions in many parts of the United States including flooding in an affluent section of Palm Beach County, Florida in mid January. All told, the unusual winter weather resulted in about three points of auto losses in the quarter. Policy retention in the U.S. in the first quarter was 90% for homeowners and 89% for auto, both of which are essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter of 2013. In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht volume, premiums were up 3%, and the combined ratio improved to 92.4 from 94 in the first quarter a year ago. Turning now to claims corporate-wide; in the first quarter of 2014 we had cat losses of $199 million before tax or 6.6 points on the combined ratio. This reflected about $206 million of losses from seven cat events in the United States and one event outside of the United States, partially offset by about $7 million decrease in our estimated losses from catastrophes which occurred in prior years. The U.S. events included two catastrophes that occurred in early January of this year for which we provided a preliminary loss estimate at the time of our last earnings conference call. Our current estimate for those events remains in line with our earlier estimate, and they accounted for the bulk of the overall catastrophe impact in the quarter. Of the total first quarter catastrophe losses, 60% were attributable to CPI and 40% to CCI. Now, I'll turn it over to Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail. Richard Spiro : Thanks, Paul. As usual I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also provide an update on the April 1st renewal of our major property reinsurance program, looking first at our operating results underwriting income with $208 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after-tax was down 4% to $277 million due once again to lower reinvestment rate in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolio. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $116 million or $0.30 per share after-tax. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2013 we had net realized investment gains before tax of $138 million or $0.34 per share after tax. In both quarters, $0.14 per share of the net realized investment gain came from alternative investments. As a reminder, unlike some of our competitors, we do not include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments in property and casualty investment income. We included a net realized investment gains and losses. Unrealized depreciation before tax at March 31 was $2.2 billion compared to 1.9 billion at year end 2013. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $42.9 billion as of March 31, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is 3.9 years and the average credit rating is AA3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At March 31st, our holding company portfolio had $2 billion of investment including approximately $830 million of short-term investment. Book value per share under GAAP at March 31 was $66.36 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost was $62.39 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end. As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the first quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had approximately 5 million, CCI had 90 million, CSI at 65 million and reinsurance assumed had zero bringing our total favorable development to approximately $160 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the first quarter combined ratio of almost 5.5 points overall. For comparison, in the first quarter of 2013 we had about 119 million of favorable development for the company overall including 5 million in CPI, 125 million in CCI, 55 million in CSI and 5 million in reinsurance assumed. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the first quarter of 2013 was about six points. For the first quarter of 2014, our x cat accident year combined ratio was 91.7 compared to 90.2 in last year's first quarter. During the first quarter of 2014 our loss reserves increased by $26 million, including an increase of 40 million for the insurance business and a decrease of 14 million for the reinsurance assumed business which is in runoff. The overall increase in reserves reflects an increase of $57 million related to catastrophes and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $25 million. Turning to capital management, we repurchased 4.7 million shares at an aggregate cost of $409 million during the quarter. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $86.73 per share. At the end of the first quarter, we had $1.2 billion available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we said on our last earnings call, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2015. In February, as John mentioned, our board raise the quarterly common stock dividend by 14% to $0.50 per share or $2 on an annual basis. This is our 32nd consecutive annual dividend increase, a continued indication of our consistent performance and financial strength. I'd now like to say a few words about our reinsurance program. On April 1st, we renewed our major property treaties including our North American Cat Treaty, our Non-U.S. Cat Treaty and our commercial property for risk treaty. We renewed these programs with a similar limit structure to what we had in 2013, but with expanded coverage and improved terms and condition. The reinsurance market was orderly and there was plenty of capacity to meet our needs in each treaty as you might expect we are an attractive [cedent] (ph). We achieved double-digit price decreases on all three property treaties that we renewed and the aggregate cost of these three treaties will be meaningfully lower than last year. In addition in March, we successfully completed our sixth catastrophe bond offering East Lane VI to replace the maturing cat bond. The transaction was very well received by the market, and this enabled us to increase the existing limit from 225 million to 270 million and expand the perils covered relative to the expiring arrangement at attractive pricing. Under this new arrangement, we purchased fully collateralized multiyear coverage to supplement our reinsurance program for the perils of main storm including hurricane and tropical storm, earthquake, winter storm and severe thunderstorm in the northeast U.S. running from Virginia to Maine. In terms of pricing, we attained the lowest pricing ever achieved on a cat bond with U.S. hurricane risk. Similar to our previous cat bonds we have indemnity-based trigger, which means that our right to collect is based on our actual incurred losses as opposed to industry or index-based losses. We like the diversification that these cat bond arrangements bring to our overall reinsurance program, especially in our peak zone. Importantly, they provide us with the cost effective fully collateralized alternative to traditional reinsurance with pricing locked in for several year. And now I'll turn it back to John. John Finnegan : As you can see, first quarter results were a mixed bag. A strong underlying performance was offset to a large degree the by the impact of higher cat, non-cat weather-related losses and unusually high homeowner fire losses. The adverse effect of these factors is reflected in our operating income per share for the first quarter of $1.50, which was $0.60 per share less than the $2.14 per share we earned in the first quarter of 2013. This $0.64 per share differential, $0.45 per share was attributable to higher cat in this year's first quarter. Remaining $0.19 per share difference was more than accounted for by the $0.23 per share aggregate negative impact of higher non-cat weather-related losses $0.15, and homeowner fire losses $0.08 per share in the first quarter of 2014. Bear in mind that we also had this surety loss which accounted for approximately $0.10 per share this quarter. Cat/non-cat weather-related losses and homeowners' fire losses had the most pronounced adverse effect on the profitability of personal lines in the first quarter of this year. The deterioration in the personal lines combined ratio versus the first quarter of last year was more than totally attributable to these factors, which can swing significantly from quarter-to-quarter. As we have said before we have enjoyed benign loss experience with respect to non-cat weather and large homeowner fires for a number of years. And as indicated in our January call, our guidance for this year contemplates some reversion to the mean in 2014, and we certainly got it in the first quarter. Well, nothing is for sure, we think it is reasonable to expect lower level of non-cat related weather and fire losses during the balance of this year. Turning to our commercial businesses, we feel good about a number of positive developments in the first quarter. Professional liability first quarter combined ratio improved almost eight points from the first quarter of last year. It was the eighth consecutive quarter in which our combined ratio and professional liability improved. All of our accident year loss ratio was about 66, 4 points better than last year's first quarter. Our x cat CCI combined ratio of 82.4 was 1.2 points better than the first quarter of last year, two points better than last year's full-year combined ratio and better than any full-year combined ratio in the recent memory. There is also place in all three of our business units we continue to obtain mid single-digit renewal rate increases in the U.S. in the first quarter of this year. Commercial, we now enjoy mid to high single-digit renewal rate increase for 10 consecutive quarters. Also in professional liability we have now enjoyed eight quarters of mid to high single-digit renewal increase. In personal lines, the homeowners' line of businesses enjoyed nine quarters of mid to high single-digit renewal increases. Meanwhile we continue to enjoy strong renewal retention in all of our business units. Finally with respect to capital management, we returned $533 million to our shareholders in the first quarter, $409 million of share repurchases and $124 million in cash dividends. With that, I'll open the line to your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Thanks, and good afternoon. Two quick questions; first of all, just going back to the discussion on the fire losses. Can you sort of expand on the nature of these fire losses and was there some sort of a geographic concentration to these fire losses? John Finnegan : I think the quick and dirty answer is no geographic concentration, and most of fire losses from quarter-to-quarter are a matter of good fortune or bad fortune. No pattern really. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Okay, got it. That was just more of an aberration than anything else. John Finnegan : Well, we were aberrational on the low side for a few quarters, and this was a little bit on the high side. So we've been talking about a little reversion to the mean. Yeah, hopefully it will revert back down a little bit. But yeah, we've had a good run, though. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Got it. I got the point. The second question I have is -- and this relates to CCI. I think the comment was made that you have gotten good rate increases for some time, and hence based on the book of business that level of rate increases diminishes sort of going forward. If you were to fast-forward, let's say to the end of 2014, how do you foresee the rate versus loss cost equation to shape up? Dino Robusto : What I could say is we look at April. Pricing in April appears to be in line with what we saw in the first quarter, but I can't predict what the rest of the year is going to bring. What I can tell you is that we continue to differentiate our rate increases by account based on the underwriting merits and the performance of each of the accounts. There is a meaningful difference in the average rate changes we get. And so, we're going to continue to execute that strategy. One thing on loss cost trends, to keep in mind, obviously you got this sort of benefits of the like earned impact of the prior quarter's higher rate increases and those all play forward for a couple of quarters, but I can't really predict what's going to happen to rate by the end of the year. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Okay, so all is somewhat of a steady state right now. Dino Robusto : Yeah, what we saw essentially in April. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie: Got it. Okay, that's all I have. Thanks for the answers and good luck for the future. Dino Robusto : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And let's now go to Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein : Hi, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the call. So, I appreciate all the commentary on pricing and it sounds like you guys think your bad adequate, and obviously record earnings, so it is a probably a good confirmation of that. The question is if you think about the industry structurally, you guys have visibility to sort of the way people actually act, we are just trying to respond to earnings calls and things. What do you think happens when the rest of the industry isn't inadequate? Are we going to maintain sort of pricing stability more or less like around the rate of inflation, kind of like theoretically the new rationality should leave people to do, or when you talk about things like double-digit declines in reinsurance pricing, do you think we'll sort of see like a real softening cycle, if you look at six months or a year and you are sort of doing your planning and you are thinking about the people you are actually competing with? John Finnegan : So, I think for one thing the industry is a good deal from price adequate. I mean I think in some lines we are getting the price adequate. I have seen professional liability for example, we have made great strives and we are probably running a steady face '95. If you look at normalized expense ratio, and that's still not really price adequate over a longer term in current interest rate. I would guess the industry on a current accident year basis fully loaded for caps to current investment rates, the industry itself is probably running high single-digit. There are some of our competitors that are running like us, running low double-digits, but that's still not quite where people want to be. So I think there is a way to go.  : Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein : That's fair. If I can ask another question, so I am surprised as you guys are shrinking internationally this quarter. I realize I didn't know that much honestly about your national businesses, and I am wondering it's better to refer to your book, and we don't talk that much about it. I am wondering if you can give us just some color on sort of what's going on, and big picture, the growth opportunities internationally, and how you guys are sort of able to leverage Chubb as a global brand? Thank you. John Finnegan : Paul, you can answer. I'll start off and say it's more like a quarter of our business, not a third. Paul Krump : Yeah, I would say, Josh, it's about 25%, it depends on the line of business, and the personal lines base. It's right around 25%. We have some very good opportunities for growth. What you saw -- and we saw mostly in our auto, because Brazil is a very large automobile market for us. We took some rate action. I think Dino has mentioned that on previous calls. So we have been surgically improving the book of business there. So we had about flat policy in-force count in Brazil, but when it translated it into U.S. dollars, it came back down about 10%. If I go over to the accident help business and other areas, that is more disproportionately outside the United States and almost the inverse about 70% outside the United States, 30% inside the United States. We've been enjoying some very nice growth there. We have been writing both employer groups and some affinity groups. So things like travel accidents for credit cardholders outside the United States. Dino Robusto : And on commercial, as we've been indicating over some of the prior calls and we said it today too, we got a lot less rate historically overseas is just a much more competitive marketplace in particular places know Europe and clearly we are not going to chase any unprofitable business and maintain a disciplined approach. And so, we are seeing a little bit less growth recently. Over time though we still see good potential and we expect that the underpricing will eventually catch up in the marketplace, and we will continue to be a player outside the United States. Josh Stirling - Sanford Bernstein : Great. Thanks for the time. Operator : Thank you. And next we will go to Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley : Good evening, thank you for taking my call. First question on the 150 basis point deterioration in turn by your underlying combined ratio year-over-year, how much of that is attributable to this non-cat weather and the large fire losses, and also the surety loss? John Finnegan : Well, I would say about 200 basis points are attributable to non-GAAP weather and fire losses, so it's more than accounts for the deteriorations. And the surety loss will be another point. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley : Another point, okay. Dino Robusto : And then the fire losses were probably another point as well. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley : Okay. So as we -- sort of the rate of increase is actually slowing down, and if inflation keeps the same that it's right now, and at what point we would no longer see the underlying margin expansion? John Finnegan : As you know, I think the part of the thing is that it's a little bit complicated like most say. Margin expansion is a long-term projection that doesn't take into account quarter-to-quarter variation. We saw significant variation in this quarter. But just looking at it, I mean you can do the mathematics and say it's 4.5 or two points now and we still haven't earned premium as we move forward in terms of margin expansion. But also remember as rates come down, our book has improved. So whether you call that a lower loss cost trend line or more immediate impact to loss cost right now, there is a benefit. You need 10 points if you have -- maybe you have nothing but a lousy book and when you prune that book, you don't need 10 points any more, you need less points. I don't know that you can just as easily just look at -- given where the book is let's compare it to full points and say the point is too higher. It's got this pretty close. I think right now we get margin expansion, but again, we have a better book. So we would expect a little bit less rate as we move forward. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley : Okay, thank you. Lastly on the sort of reinsurance cost, you mentioned that meaningful lower sort of like reinsurance costs, would that flow directly into the bottom line, or are you going to tap some of it on to consumers? Richard Spiro : Well, again, I think as John said, we are now -- we are going to benefit from those lower costs whether or not we incorporated that into pricing as we go forward, time will tell. John Finnegan : You are thinking -- in the order of magnitude you are thinking $30 million, $40 million, $50 million on a $4 billion book. It's not a major driver of the pricing decision. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley : Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. Next we will go to Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Hi, good evening. For the higher fire losses in the non-cat whether that's about three points year-over-year change, just curious how much of it was higher was on a normalized basis for this quarter, because last year I believe it -- you had a below average number? Richard Spiro : Yeah. Give us one sec. So if you look over a five year average for first quarter for non-cat weather-related losses, this is excluding the current first quarter, so that five years prior, we had about seven points on average of non-cat weather relate losses in our first quarter. The same comparable number if you look at fire losses would have been about eight points. I am sorry, yeah, eight points. And again, those numbers are on homeowners' loss ratio, not on the overall company. John Finnegan : And remember you would expect that the first quarter of a year would have a little bit higher non-cat related weather than most of the other quarters, right? Fire will be different, but non-cat related-weather is almost -- first quarter was about 14. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Sure. So for the non-cat weather that was seven points in average versus I think this quarter was 14 points you said? John Finnegan : Yes. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Right. And on the fire, do you normalize this eight versus towards the nine for this quarter? John Finnegan : Yeah. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Okay, that's helpful. Secondly on the auto combined ratio, that also seems to be high. I believe you mentioned three points or something. If you could just help me understand that, it will be helpful. Thanks. John Finnegan : Sure. You are talking about the personal auto? Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Yes, correct. John Finnegan : Okay. What you have in the personal auto was the three points of the adverse weather that was hitting it. I mentioned as well we had experienced some profitability issues in Brazil. We have been taking action there. We feel like we are addressing that very adequately through our surgical underwriting action and specific rate taking by tier. I just -- of course you would remember that we have a very small auto book in our portfolio. So it doesn't take much to move the overall combined ratio. We have enjoyed good rate and exposure increases of five points in that book of business. And our U.S. book is growing at 5%. That's really the story behind auto and the personal lines front. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Fair enough. And just one last follow up. So looking at the reduction in the pace of rate increases and the increase in per retention and the new to loss business, it seems that there is a modest improvement, but curious from your perspective as to what -- so how you will you look at the risk reward period being taking less rate versus sort of growing the book, because the book doesn't seem to be growing right now. Dino Robusto : Yeah. As I indicated a little bit earlier, after multiple years of rate on rate increases plus given the fact that we have been calling the lowest performing parts of our book in managing our mix of business. Increasingly, we are focused on retaining our best accounts, and also those kinds of rate increases that have impacted some of the new business opportunities. So we are looking at increasing the retention and going after a little bit more new business which we saw. It didn't really manifest itself in the total. In the aggregate as I indicated outside U.S. was still a little bit more competitive, so our growth was down there, and there was a couple of additional factors affecting some of the growth on the U.S. side. Our exposure decrease was actually two points and that was function of the fact that we were reducing our participation on certain accounts to manage our aggregation. So that had a dampening effect on what you are seeing in term of the higher retention and a little bit more new business, but directionally clearly we are interested in retaining more of our accounts and we see some good opportunities going forward. And so, as I indicated earlier, a little bit more optimistic that the growth will look a little better in the second quarter. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Okay, thank you. Operator : Thank you. And the next question is from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Hi, thanks. So I guess one question I had was obviously reinsurance is very inexpensive for the market for you in particular, why not -- but the homeowners' book shrank obviously, there are some issues on homeowners' book that were specific to the quarter, but why not grow that book of business if you are able to get very good rate, you are comfortable with the risk profile and you can buy an expensive protection? Paul Krump : First of all, Mike, this is Paul, and homeowners grew at 4% in the quarter. So we felt pretty good about that. I would tell you that we do look at reinsurance, occasionally we look at it opportunistically in the homeowners' front. It depends on the geography. It depends on the customer, but when we most often step into the [fact] (ph) market is where we are looking at the ultra high net worth that kind of a family office type exposures where they have properties all over the globe often times in places like Florida. And that's where we use reinsurance the most often on a facultative basis in the homeowners' world. Dino, I don't know if you want to add anything. Dino Robusto : I mean you don't have any new overall strategy to increase the reinsurance prices, but clearly as thoughtful underwriters, we are always looking to maximize our risk-return tradeoff. And lower reinsurance pricing could potentially offer us that on certain accounts, and we will clearly look at that. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Got it. And then maybe if I could, Paul, on the comp book, can you comment just a bit on where that is right now on an underlying loss or combined ratio basis, and whether or not you are continuing to get rate there at the same level as previously or where that's factoring relative to loss trend? Thanks. Paul Krump : Yeah. So the workers' comp, it continues to be very profitable for us. The rate increases for comps have declined from the higher levels that we saw on 2011 and 2012, and -- but we continue to see some really good performance in it. Our growth was down a little bit this quarter, but in general we are very optimistic about our comp portfolio. It's been historically very profitable, and we continue to see it as an opportunity going forward. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : So where are you writing that business now? Can you tell us? Paul Krump : Yeah, so the combined ratio in the quarter for our commercial workers' comp was 84. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : On an underlying basis? Paul Krump : No, no, no, calendar year. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : Okay. So I guess my question is whether it's comp or other business, I mean, obviously you have your levels of profitability that you are willing to write business and we can't see it at the segment level because we just don't have this disclosure, but is there -- are you seeing the market competitors that are looking to get -- to frankly start to get more competitive and pick up your business if your threshold for profitability is higher than their's? I mean because you are running in 84 comps, you are probably writing it as 74 on an underlying basis -- it's clearly profitable. Are other people willing to write that business at less profitable levels because they can clip the coupon on the investing side and maybe give you more competition whether it's there or whether it's in other books? Dino Robusto : Well, just in terms of the competitive side of it, as we've always indicated we write our workers' comp in our work comp portfolio in parallel with other coverages, in our target niches and its attractive business. It's been historically profitable, but our retentions has stayed historically very high, and clearly based on our value proposition we can keep the business that we want on comp based on all the other lines that we are writing. And your question about where we are writing it, we are writing it across the U.S. in line with our target market strategy. Paul Krump : Mike, I would just add that as underwriters we put our business into -- we tier it all the time. It's where that we lose a customer just on a couple of points of price. We know which ones are performing exceedingly well and which ones are not performing so well. So we put them into different cohorts, and our underwriters are trained to know when to back away and when to let an account go and when to hang on one. I think at 84, it was a very good quarter for workers' comp. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs : We all know. Of course, absolutely. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And next we will go to Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Jay Cohen - Bank of America : Yeah, thank you, a couple of questions. You had mentioned in the property reinsurance treaties getting better terms and conditions, I'm wondering if you could give us a bit more detail on that? And then, second question I'll ask is, in CCI did you have a similar experience with non-cat weather as you did in personal lines or was that -- would you consider that to be fairly normal? Dino Robusto : You want to answer? Richard Spiro : Yeah. Jay, it's Ricky; I will start with the first question on reinsurance and then Dino will take the non-cat weather. So I'll give you one example, the biggest change that we were able to achieve was with the definition of a single occurrence for key perils. So as you probably know within cat treaties, a single occurrence or specific perils is based on the number of hours from the beginning of an occurrence to the ending of occurrence. And the losses that fall within the hours caused for a given peril are covered in the single loss occurrence. Generally speaking, one hour causes are better for the ceding company, so you have more time in which to cover losses that occur as part of an event. So with that as background, I'll give you one specific example. In our North American cat treaty for the peril of hurricane and tropical storm, our expiring hours caused with 96 hours or four days, and our new hours cause is a 168 hours or seven days, so a meaningful increase in the length of time that we can put losses for a specific event. And that sort of thing happen for almost all the perils in each our major treaties, so a very positive development for us. Dino Robusto : : Jay Cohen - Bank of America : Got it. If I could squeeze one more; it's a yes or no question. You talked about having some favorable development in the cat line, was that also -- did that also show up in a favorable development that you talked about overall? Richard Spiro : Yes, it did. It was about 0.2 points of development related to that. So you don't double count. If you're trying to get to say, our accident year, x cat combined ratio, you got to deduct about 0.2 points from the overall favorable development number. Jay Cohen - Bank of America : That's helpful. Thanks, Ricky. Operator : Next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields - KBW: Thanks, good evening. Just with regard to the weather, does that have any favorable impact on workers' compensation, because there is less activity going on outside, is that all relevant? John Finnegan : Good question. I guess we've never thought of it that way. I don't think we have an answer to that. I think (multiple speakers) claim data points they give you. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. I'm not trying to take anything away from the 84. John Finnegan : I think, A) It's a good question, B) It has stumped us, and C) I can assure you it wouldn't be material to the 84, I'm sure. Yeah. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. That's the part that matters. Second, with regard to the culling, I'm not sure how to quantify this question, but can you compare how much of your book now is in the underperforming tiers compared to what a reasonable long-term target is? Dino Robusto : I can't really quantify it exactly for you. What I can clearly tell you is that a lot more of our accounts in our book is rate adequate, and which is why you saw a little bit of the slight moderation in the rate. We are still getting, though, some strong differentiation. One thing maybe as the data point that I can give you, if you look at sort of distribution of the increases in the U.S. about 20% of our CCI book got greater than 10% rate increases, whereas our professional liability was roughly a quarter of the book that got over 10 in terms of price reductions. Less than 10% of our book got rate decreases from both our commercial lines and professional liability lines, but clearly over time, we have less and less of the need for the larger rate increases. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay. That's very helpful. And is there any difference in terms of loss cost trends outside of U.S. and inside? Richard Spiro : The lines of business are roughly the same. I would say it's roughly the same. Paul Krump : Yeah, I would agree. Meyer Shields - KBW: Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions) And we will take the next question from Ian Gutterman with BAM Investments. Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments : Hi, I just had a couple of questions on reserves. The first one, in CPI the 5 million releases, I know that's the same as last year, but most quarters that's 20, 30, 40 favorable, was there anything that was less unusual in CPI? Richard Spiro : No, really it's hard to say the correct definition. Most of it came from personal other, and then there was a small piece that came from homeowners due to what we were talking about earlier, the favorable prior year cats, and personal auto was a little bit adverse. Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments : Okay. So there is less releases from home than usual, that's what it sounds like. Richard Spiro : Yes. Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments : Okay. And then the other one, this is a little bit more tactical, but on D&O reserves, going through your Schedule P, the other liability claims made, my analysis, I think several of the analysts on the sell-side published more analyses that seem to show that they, say, starting in 2010 through 2013, those accident years don't look to be reserved as well as the older years. At the same time, obviously you guys have discussed for the past couple of years running hot in the lines that are more frequency-type lines that arguably would cause pays to happen sooner than if we looked at the historical pay pattern. So I was wondering if you had any insights into why we are seeing that pattern where it seems like reserves aren't as strong as what (indiscernible) professional lines? Richard Spiro : Sure. Well, obviously as you are pointing at it, if you aggregate what's shown in part two of Schedule P for our individual writing companies, the average development in the other liability claims made for two of the accident years, that being '11 and '12, were slightly adverse; about $4 million adverse in '12 and about $ 9 million adverse in '11. So when you say that there they're developing adversely, there is really hardly any change at all. The other thing I would say is that there are naturally many moving parts within an aggregated line of business like this. So parsing movement this small, it's contributing elements is inherently problematic, but as you point out, we have talked on prior earnings calls about, for example, some of the issues we've had with the employment practice liability line. And so, part of the adverse development you are seeing is related to that. Going forward, I'd say these accident years are still green and we will see how it develop over time, but we said our year end reserves we believe are at appropriate levels and you guys can draw your own conclusions. Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments : If I can just clarify a little bit, I'm not so much aware that they developed adverse initially. It was more looking at -- I am not so much worried that they developed adverse initially, it was more looking at sort of the initial page relative to incurred in the early years versus older early years and the initial IBNR versus other year's IBNRs, would that be -- it seems like there is maybe a tale that's changing. And it's obviously hard for us outside given some of the points you raised to disembowel that I guess. Is there any suggestions you can give us on what appropriate adjustments might be that might give us a better answer? Richard Spiro : Yeah. Again, it's hard to point anything specific. There have been some mixed changes that may have some impact there, but nothing on a philosophical basis that I would point out. Ian Gutterman - BAM Investments : Okay, great. That's all I have for tonight. Thanks. Richard Spiro : Thank you. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. Mr. Finnegan, I would like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. John Finnegan : Thank you very much for joining us. Have a good evening. Operator : This does conclude today's conference, and thank you for your participation.",

Now, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Mr. Finnegan. John D. Finnegan:  Thank you for joining us. Chubb produced solid results in the second quarter of 2014, we generated operating income per share of $17, net income per share $2.03. Our results benefited from strong premium growth of 5% ex-currency and our highest level of retention for commercial and professional liability in three years. In addition, we enjoyed excellent profitability in our long-tail lines of business such as professional liability, casualty and workers compensation. However, our results of the second quarter were adversely impacted by the performance of our short-tail property lines. We had unusually high levels of large fire losses in our commercial and personal books of property business. In addition, severe weather in the United States resulted in elevated non- catastrophe losses, as well as catastrophe losses of $0.39 per share. The market remained stable in the second quarter, as evidenced by the continued increase in the rates. We are pleased that we\u2019re able to secure our mid single-digit increases in our U.S. rate change metrics in all our businesses. With respect to our commercial and professional liability businesses, well the size of the increases was slightly less than in the first quarter. We\u2019re very pleased that we are able to obtain these increases and still achieve higher levels of renewal rentention. We produced the second quarter combined ratio of 90, including 4.8 points of cats. Excluding cats, our combined ratio was 85.2 compared to an exceptionally low 80.9 in the second quarter last year. That 80.9 last year was the best ex-cat combined ratio we\u2019ve had any quarter in the past six years. Annualized operating ROE for the second quarter was 11.3%, while annualized GAAP ROE was 12.2%. GAAP book value per share at June 30, 2014 was $68.60 an increase of 6% from year end 2013. Our capital position is excellent and we made progress on our share repurchase program during the quarter. For the first six months of 2014, we produced net income per share of $3.83 and operating income per share of $3.20. As a result of our performance in the first half, we have reduced our guidance for full-year 2014 operating income per share to a range of $6.75 to $6.95 from the $7.10 to $7.40 per share range, we provided in January. Ricky will discuss our revised guidance later. And now for more details on our operating performance will start with Dino, who will discuss Chubb\u2019s commercial and specialty insurance operations. Dino E. Robusto:  Thanks, John. Chubb Commercial and Chubb Specialty insurance both had strong performance in the second quarter characterize by excellent underwriting result in most lines of business particularly our long tail lines. We also had great retention, which as we stated last quarter was our focus and a modest increase in new business allowing us to improve our overall growth rate. Starting with CCI, second quarter net written premiums were up 3% to $1.4 billion. While the commercial market is always competitive, our value added underwriting driven approach continues to work well. CCI\u2019s second quarter combined ratio was 93.3% compared to 89.9% in the corresponding quarter a year ago. The impact of catastrophe losses accounted for 4.9 point of the combined ratio, compared to 8.1 points in the second quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes, CCI\u2019s second combined ratio was 88.4% in 2014 compared to 81.8% in 2013. The deterioration in CCI's ex-cat combined ratio from a year ago was entirely explainable by the property and Marine line of business. Our other three CCI lines performed well, in fact, casualty and workers' comp had much better results than in the year ago second quarter. In the second quarter of this year, the Property and Marine business experienced significantly higher than usual ex-cat loss activity. This line had a combined ratio, excluding catastrophes of 97.4%, which was 34 points worse and the extremely low second quarter of 2013. And if we consider a longer historical perspective, this year\u2019s second quarter property and Marine ex-cat combined ratio was about 15 points worse than our five year average. At current earned premium levels, this equates to approximately $50 million.  This elevated loss activity was driven by a combination of several large fire losses and some non-cat weather related losses. As we have pointed out in the past, property losses can fluctuate substantially in any one quarter. The second quarter last year was an unusually low outlier for the Property and Marine business. With an ex-cat combined ratio of 63.1%. In fact, that was the best ex-cat combined ratio a 9.5 year, whereas this year the second quarter was an unusually high outlier. We have carefully analyzed the losses in the quarter and found no trends or issues that warrant any change in our underwriting strategy. Partially offsetting the property results was in almost ten point improvement in the casualty combined ratio the 85.3% which was the best performance for casualty in 12 quarters. We also had about a two point improvement in workers' compensation combined ratio, an outstanding 84.5% reinforcing our status as one of the most profitable workers\u2019 comp underwriters in the industry. In our first quarter conference call we mentioned that in light of the rate increases over the past several years we were focusing on retaining profitable business and taking advantage of better price new business in this focus favorably impacted our growth rate. While we are always looking to call accounts where we cannot secure appropriate rates and terms and conditions, our underwriting and pricing actions over the past few years have resulted and there being fewer accounts that needed to be called. This benefited both retention and the new the lost ratio. Indeed, CCI's second quarter retention in the U.S. increased to 87% its highest level in ten quarters and up from 85% in the first quarter of 2014. We achieved this two point increase in retention over the first quarter while still securing average U.S. renewal rate increases of 4%. Outside the U.S., CCI's average renewal rate increases continued in the low single-digits. With respect to new business, we continue to penetrate our target market segment where our unique expertise and products and services afford us the greatest opportunity to achieve our required risk adjusted margin. CCI's new to last business ratio in the U.S. was 1.2 to 1 compared to 0.9 to 1 in the first quarter of 2014. Turning now to Chubb Specialty insurance net written premiums were up 5% in the second quarter to $655 million. CCI's second quarter combined ratio was an outstanding 78.7% in 2014, versus 86% in 2013. For the professional liability portion of CSI, which represents the majority of the portfolio, net written premiums were up 4% to $572 million. The combined ratio for professional liability improved to 83.2% from 91.9% in the second quarter of 2013 and from 84.6% in the first quarter of 2014. The continued improvement in the combined ratio over time reflects our discipline underwriting and culling action, aided by our advanced analytic and predictive modeling, skillful portfolio management and the compound effect of the price increases we have achieved over the last few years. Renewal retention for professional liability in the U.S. in the second quarter improved to 88% from 85% in the first quarter of this year. As our rate taking in underwriting actions have earned into our renewable portfolio as is the case with CCI, we have been increasingly focused on retaining our profitable renewal business, all the while securing a strong 6% average renewal rate increase. In markets outside the U.S., renewal rate increases remain consistent with prior quarters rising by low single-digits. Our new to loss business ratio for professional liability in the second quarter was 1.2 to 1 up from 0.9 to 1 in the first quarter of 2014 and 0.8 to 1 in the fourth quarter of 2013. The steady improvement in this metric is driven both by less loss business and we focus on retaining our profitable renewal business, as well as our success in writing better priced new business available in the market after several years of industry rate increases and underwriting action. One final note on our professional liability business. Several weeks ago the Supreme Court of the United States rendered its long-awaited decision in the Halliburton case. We view the ruling as a middle of the road outcome and not unexpected, while it will take a long time to know the full impact, if any on the frequency and severity of securities class actions, at this stage our perspective is that the ruling is a mild positive, but should do little to change the current D&O landscape with respect to underwriting or pricing. Turning now to the surety portion of the CSI book. Net written premiums were up 8% to $83 million. This compares to a decline of 13% in the first quarter of 2014 and was driven by an increase in U.S. construction activity among a few of our larger customers. Surety is a lumpy business from both a premium growth and a profitability standpoint.  The combined ratio was 45.3 compared to 42.1 in the second quarter of 2013. Despite the occasional large loss, our expertise in customer selection, underwriting and portfolio diversification, has enabled us to achieve outstanding long-term results in our surety line making this business very attractive to us. In conclusion, the results of the second quarter demonstrate that continued success of our long standing commercial and specialty underwriting strategy. In any one quarter the profile of accounts that are up for renewal can vary and as we have noted in the past, the change in premium growth from one quarter to another is sometimes attributable more to the renewal or non-renewal of a few large accounts than to any underlying trend.  Nevertheless, we are confident that our underwriters will continue to manage the rate retention dynamic, in order to strive for the optimal balance based on the underwriting characteristics of each insured. It is this commitment to underwriting discipline along with building strong relationship with the best agents and brokers in the industry in providing our customers with unparalleled claims service that should enable us to continue to grow our business profitably over time. And now I\u2019ll turn it over to Paul, who will review our results for CPI and corporate wide claims. Paul J. Krump: Thanks Dino. Considering the elevated level of homeowners losses Chubb Personal Insurance turned in a very good quarter. CPI net written premiums increased 5% to $1.2 billion and CPI produced a combined ratio of 92.7 compared to 89.6 in the corresponding quarter last year. The impact of catastrophes on CPI second quarter combined ratio was 7.5% in 2014. In the second quarter a year ago the cat impact on CPI's combined ratio was 12.7 points. On an ex-cat basis, CPI's combined ratio was 85.2 in the second quarter of 2014 compared to 76.9 in the second quarter of 2013. Homeowners' premiums grew 4% in the quarter and the combined ratio was 92.2 compared to 86.9 in the corresponding quarter last year. Cat losses accounted for 12.1 points of the homeowners combined ratio in the second quarter of 2014, compared to 20.1 points in the second quarter of 2013. Excluding the impact of catastrophes the 2014 second quarter, homeowners combined ratio was 80.1, compared to an extraordinary 66.8% in the same period a year ago, which was the lowest homeowners ex-cat combined ratio of any quarter in the previous eight years. As in the first quarter this year CPI experienced an elevated level of homeowners\u2019 fire losses in the second quarter. For comparison, U.S. fire losses in the second quarter of 2014 accounted for 13 points of the overall worldwide homeowners loss ratio, versus only five points in the second quarter of 2013. In addition the effect of U.S. non-cat weather related losses contributed about two points more of the loss ratio than in the corresponding quarter of 2013. Together the impact of U.S. fire and non-cat weather related losses accounted for ten points of the year-over-year second quarter ex-cat combined ratio delta for homeowners. Looking at our average combined impact of U.S. fire and non-cat weather related losses on homeowners over the past five years, the impact in the second quarter of this year was about six points worse than the average. At the current earned premium levels, this equates to about $40 million. Fire and weather losses do not occur in a linear fashion. We believe our book as well underwritten and that the losses will average out over time. Homeowners\u2019 rate and exposure premium increases totaled 7% in the U.S. in the second quarter. The same is what we achieved in the first quarter of this year, as well as in the second quarter of 2013. Apart from the dollar impact of rate taking we continue to implement a greater pricing sophistication as our ability to match price to specific risks improves thus, enhancing the quality of our portfolio. The use of sophisticated analytics is also helping us retain more of our best customers. We believe this suite of enhanced tools will continue to drive profitable growth in the years to come. Personal auto premium growth was flat for the quarter, auto premiums increased in the U.S. and decreased outside the U.S. driven by currency fluctuations. The combined ratio was 95.6 compared to 95.3 in the second quarter of 2013. Policy retention in the U.S. in the second quarter was 90% for homeowners and 89% for auto. Both of which were essentially unchanged from the first quarter 2014. In other personal, which includes our accident, personal excess liability and yacht lines, premiums increased 10% and the combined ratio was 93.1 compared to 93.3 in the second quarter a year ago. Growth was driven by accident and personal excess. Turning now to corporate-wide claims. Catastrophe losses for the second quarter totaled $146 million before tax. There were 13 cat events in the United States and two in Canada. The events included wind, flood and hail, and affected customers in 30 states and three Canadian provinces. The vast majority of our cat losses were in the U.S., and were skewed to CPI. As we are all aware the season of hurricanes and heighten wildfires is upon us. As evidenced by hurricane Arthur in the Carolinas, as well as the wildfires that are burning in Northwestern United States. Thus far, we have had only a handful of small claims from these events. That said, it takes just one significant event to create intense demand for the claims services, which are the hallmark of the Chubb brand. Therefore, each year we thoroughly review our cat preparedness protocols to ensure they are current and we incorporate lessons learned from prior events. And with that, I will turn it over Ricky who will review our financial results in more detail. Richard G. Spiro:   Thanks Bob. As usual I will discuss our financial results for the quarter and I will also review our updated earnings guidance. Looking first at our operating results, we had underwriting income of $278 million in the quarter. Property and casualty investment income after tax was down 4% to $275 million, due once again to lower reinvestment rates in both our domestic and international fixed maturity portfolio. Net income was higher than operating income in the quarter due to net realized investment gains before tax of $125 million or $0.33 per share after-tax of which $0.15 per share came from our alternative investment. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2013 we had net realized investment gains before tax of $179 million or $0.44 per share after tax of which $0.12 per share came from alternative investments. You will recall that in the second quarter of last year, we also recognized the gain of $0.21 per share related to the merger of Alterra Capital and Markel Corporation. As a reminder, unlike some of our competitors, we do not include our share of the change in the net equity of our alternative investments and property and casualty investment income. We included a net realized investment gains and losses. Unrealized depreciation before tax at June 30 was $2.6 billion compared to $2.2 billion at the end of the first quarter. The total carrying value of our consolidated investment portfolio was $43.5 billion as of June 30, 2014. The composition of our portfolio remains largely unchanged from the prior quarter. The average duration of our fixed maturity portfolio is four years and the average credit rating is AA3. We continue to have excellent liquidity at the holding company. At June 30, our holding company portfolio had $2 billion of investment including approximately $575 million of short-term investment. Book value per share under GAAP at June 30, 2014 was $68.60 compared to $64.83 at year end 2013 and $60.76 a year ago. Adjusted book value per share, which we calculate with available for sale fixed maturities at amortized cost was $63.87 compared to $61.86 at 2013 year end and $57.03 a year ago. As for loss reserves, we estimate that we had favorable development in the second quarter of 2014 on prior year reserves by SBU as follows. In CPI, we had about $50 million, CCI had about $70 million, CSI at $80 million and the runoff reinsurance assumed business had none, bringing our total favorable development to about $165 million for the quarter. This represents a favorable impact on the second quarter combined ratio of almost 5.5 points overall. For comparison, in the second quarter of 2013 we had about $215 million of favorable development for the company overall including $40 million in CPI, $115 million in CCI, $55 million in CSI and $5 million in runoff reinsurance assumed business. The favorable impact on the combined ratio in the second quarter of 2013 was about seven points. For the second quarter of 2014, our ex-cat accident year combined ratio was 90.6 compared to 88 in last year's second quarter. During the second quarter of 2014 our loss reserves increased by $28 million, including an increase of $35 million for the insurance business and a decrease of $7 million for the runoff reinsurance assumed business. The overall increase in reserves reflects an increase of $21 million related to catastrophes and the impact of currency translation on loss reserves during the quarter resulted in a decrease in reserves of about $10 million. Turning to capital management, during the second quarter we repurchased 4 million shares at an aggregate cost of $375 million. The average cost of our repurchases in the quarter was $92.95 per share. At the end of the second quarter, we had $823 million available for share repurchases under our current authorization. And as we have said previously, we expect to complete this program by the end of January 2015. Before turning it back to John, let me provide you with some additional details on our updated guidance. We've revised our guidance for operating income per share for the full-year to a range of $6.75 to $6.95 on the range of $7.10 to $7.40 that we provided in January. As John mentioned, we\u2019ve reduced our guidance primarily because of our operating results in the first half of this year. Our outlook for the second half of the year remains essentially unchanged from January, when we provided our initial guidance. As a result, at the mid point of our updated guidance, we expect our ex-cat combined ratio in the second half of the year to improve by about 1.5 points from our actual results for the first half of 2014, which was impacted by an unusually high level of large buyer in non-cat weather related losses. Our revised guidance is based upon the following underlying assumptions. We expect our combined ratio for the full year 2014 to be in the range of 90% to 91% compared to the January guidance assumption of 89% to 90%. This change reflects our actual operating results in the first six months of the year. We are assuming five points of catastrophe losses for the second half of 2014. Based on the 5.7 points of actual cat losses we had in the first half, our assumption for the full-year calculates to 5.3 points, compared to the 5 point cat assumption in our original guidance. For those who would like to make a higher or lower cat assumption the impacted each percentage point of catastrophe losses for the full-year on operating income per share is approximately $0.33. We expect net written premiums for the full-year to increase 2% to 4%, with an insignificant impact of foreign currency translation. This assumption is unchanged from our January 2014 January 2014 guidance. And we expect property and casualty investment income after tax to decline 4% to 6%, which is also unchanged from our January guidance. Finally, we assume 244 million average diluted shares outstanding for the full-year compared to 245 million in our January guidance. And now, I will turn it back to John. John D. Finnegan: Thanks Ricky. Despite an unusually high level of fire and weather related losses, we produced solid earnings in the second quarter of this year, which included a number of very positive developments. With respect to the U.S. market we enjoyed mid-single digit rate increases. All increase in overall retention to levels better than we have enjoyed for a number of years. In addition our new to lost business ratios improved. The upshot was ex currency premium growth of 5% in the quarter, versus 1% in the first quarter of this year. Profitability of our professional line business continued to improve professional liability, I'm sorry, reflecting rate increases in the underwriting initiatives we begin to undertake at the end of 2011. Our combined ratio and professional liability of 83.9% for the first six months of 2014. Represented about a 5 point improvement from calendar year 2013 and almost 13 point improvement from calendar year 2012. In fact the 83.9% posted in the first six months of this year is better than our professional liability performance in any full calendar year since 2007. We also enjoyed terrific performance in other long tail lines. For example, our 85.3 combined ratio in casualty was the best quarter we\u2019ve had three years. Equally as impressive was workers compensation were combined ratio in each of the first two quarters of 2014 were the best we have recorded in any quarter in about six years. Our reserve position remains strong as reflected in the 5.8 point a favorable development we had in a quarter. And finally, during the first six months of 2014 book value per share increased 6% from year-end and we will return more than $1 billion to shareholders in the form of stock repurchases and cash dividends. On the minus side, our second quarter earnings were significantly dampened by an unusually high level of fire and non-cat whether related losses. And both commercial property and homeowners business. As we have mentioned in the past, wide fluctuation in losses in these areas from quarter-to-quarter are generally a function of the presence or absence of good fortune. Nevertheless, we reviewed these losses exhaustively on a case-by-case basis to ensure that they do not reflect any important underlying trend. So we expect to reversion to the mean overtime. And as Ricky noted an updated guidance we assume some improvement in the loss experience in the second half of this year. With that, I will open the line to your questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) We will take our first question from Amit Kumar from Macquarie. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited :  Thanks and good afternoon. Just two quick questions on I guess the guidance and the discussion on pricing. You mentioned better priced new business few times. What is the approximate delta between the new business pricing and renewal business pricing? Dino E. Robusto:  Hi, its Dino. As we've always mentioned, it's not surprising that renewals are always going to perform better than new lines. We have an ability to review lost until modify terms and conditions as needed. Usually results in reduced losses. And so we are always careful in our new business selection process and that's why we just focus on the target niches that we did where we have developed some expertise and we see a little bit of contraction in that gap, but it\u2019s really just a function of new business always going to be a little bit less than renewals, there is always going to be a little bit of that gap, we just stick to what we know in our target markets that we like and where we have expertise and we are able to write a little bit more in new business in the second quarter. Now again, it's still at levels that are much lower than what they have been several years ago so just to keep that I guess the new business. Richard G. Spiro: Volume. Dino E. Robusto: Yes, the volume, yes, yes. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited : Okay, got it. The other question I had is on the guidance and premiums. Just based on your comments, it seems that you're probably incrementally more satisfied with the price adequacy of our accounts or I guess the buckets which need rate increases. I would have imagined that seven months from the initial guidance probably you would have ended up thinking about retaining more and hence the NPW guidance might have changed, but its essentially unchanged seven months from when it was announced. Can you just maybe just explain that to me? Richard G. Spiro:  I guess \u2013 it's Ricky, I'll try. I guess as we think about that the premium growth when we look at what we did in the first half and what we were thinking about when we came into the year, we were probably a little bit lighter in the first half of the year on margin than we had thought given in the first quarter this year we had premium growth of about zero and 1% on an ex-currency basis. So if I\u2019m answering your question correctly, you probably would get a little incremental growth in the second quarter in order to get from where we were for the second half to get from where we were in the first half for the year to say the midpoint of the guidance. Does that help? Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited :  Yes. I just wanted to asking was that Dino, are you now with seven months elapsed are you more satisfied with price adequacy of accounts than what you might have imagined at Jan, when you had come out with the guidance. Dino E. Robusto: Maybe \u2013 its Dino, maybe I can just take a look at \u2013 answer it from just overall rate adequacy and how we look at that if I can and I\u2019ll give you a little color and hopefully this answers its, but I don\u2019t want to talk about rate adequacy in terms of specific percentage of the book, because that\u2019s a little too over simplistic, right the book is very dynamic, its diversify, sophisticated, geographically diverse and also risk characteristics of an account or set of accounts can change in anyone year. Having said that clearly after the compound rate increases we've achieved over the last several years as well as the underwriting actions, it\u2019s important to keep that in mind. We clearly feel that the book has improved in terms of rate adequacy, but there is still are portions of the book that need rate and you have to keep in mind that this happens really at the individual account level. As I mentioned in my earlier remarks, our underwriters are focused on managing the rate retention dynamic based on the underwriting characters of each individual accounts and so you still see some variation on the individual accounts as an example, in the second quarter, in the top quintile by premium rate increasing we\u2019re still getting greater than a 15% increase and in the lowest quintile we were giving about a 5% decrease. You're still seeing that variation, but clearly bottom line, after several years both of rate increase and the underwriting action the book has an improved in terms of rate adequacy. John D. Finnegan:  I would just point out though it is a moving target and more rates was gotten over the first six months, improved rate adequacy on the other side. Interest rates and therefore investment income prospects are down from the end of last year you might remember interest rates are 50 points lower than they were at year end. There are headwinds here too. Amit Kumar \u2013 Macquarie Group Limited :  You answered my question I apologize, I phrased the question poorly. Thank you. Operator :  We\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Gould from Barclays. Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.: Thank you and good afternoon. I want to ask you given that we\u2019ve seen the underlined combined ratio tick up to the low 90% range from kind of high 80% level, should we anticipate going forward that low 90s is probably more reasonable run rate and that\u2019s excluding cats in prior development? Richard G. Spiro:  Yes Jay it is Ricky. I don't think that is the correct assumption. If you look at the guidance that the updated guidance and as we mentioned on the call, we are expecting some improvement in the combined ratio performance in the second half of the year. So I wouldn\u2019t make that assumption. And in fact. John D. Finnegan:  I\u2019m sorry you go ahead. Richard G. Spiro: All right in fact it\u2019s as I mentioned when I talked in my remarks, when we came into the year, if you look at what our initial guidance was on an ex-cat combined ratio basis, you do the math between what the midpoint of our guidance is now versus what we had in the first half in essence we believe that we\u2019re going to have the same performance in the second half as we'd assumed we started the year. Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.: So you would attribute the underlying combined ratio in the first half being in the low 90s more to these\u2026 John D. Finnegan: Definitely. Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.:  Number of fires and non-cat weather losses. John D. Finnegan: Absolutely. If you look at the comparison to last year \u2013 to this year, last year we look at year-over-year comparison, you\u2019re talking, I mean \u2013 I think Paul kind of gave it, but you\u2019re talking $180 million deterioration due to fire and non-cat weather and then a commercial property in marine lines, that's on $6 million of premium that\u2019s a mouthful. At three points right there. And I guess for the second half our guidance is what 88 to 89, what's the second half guidance? Richard G. Spiro:  We keep the year 90 to 91 and then and the second half is\u2026 John D. Finnegan: I want again doing on an ex-cat basis it would be something similar to the ex-cat combined ratio we assumed at the beginning of year which was about 80.5, calendar year. Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.: I see, okay. And then a separate issue, with regard to the Halliburton decision, I would have thought that could be more than a mild positive giving it has the ability to call the number of securities claims before they get the class certification. So wouldn't that meaningfully if not reduce the number of class actions and at least take down overall severity in defense costs? John D. Finnegan: If it all worked out Jay but I think we have to watch and see how the courts rule following the Supreme Court decision here. It's not clear what kind of real threshold are applying in practical matters. So were not beating a wardroom, it's a great victory, we have to say, and there are some argument that it might increase defense costs on the other side. If courts take aggressive approach at our position it would help. But again, we'll have to see what happens here. Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.: The defendants have the ability to say well prove to what you actually relied on that statement, or that you didn't rely on that alleged fraud when you brought the stock. Paul J. Krump:  Jay this is Paul, I will augment that a little bit by saying it\u2019s not just Halliburton you have got Omnicare, you got [indiscernible], you have got a number of decisions out there, and what really encourages us is that at first to at first to court continues to choose these cases right. So they a right to accept them or not and they're choosing to take them. I think that gives us a lot of hope. And second because these cases do present opportunities for the court to make changes that could benefit our insureds, the compounding effect of all of these cases could certainly be more than mildly positive. But taken on individual base I think you know, is characteristic of this mild positive for Halliburton is correct. John D. Finnegan: Yes. And again Jay it was also in the context, I mean, that we didn\u2019t think it\u2019s going to change the marketplace in the near term, right. The people are going to wait. Jay B. Gould \u2013 Barclays Capital Inc.: I see. That\u2019s helpful thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Josh Stirling from Sanford Bernstein. Joshua C. Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Hi good evening. Thanks for taking the call. So as you guys are shifting from focusing on driving margins to really more about retention and putting and getting into growth mode, I thought I had asked a couple of more longer term questions on your posture with growth. Paul, think you mentioned you brought up a topic I hadn't heard you guys talk about before which was sophisticated analytics that that it was interested because I was think if you guys first and foremost of having a brand and its relationship stay good business selection to start off with. I\u2019m wondering if you give us a sense of what Moore's behind the comment to what kinds of things you guys doing to integrate analytics in your strategy and may be where you think you stand compared to some of your competitors. And if you think that analytics can start to be a competitive advantage for you guys? John D. Finnegan: Absolutely Josh I mean we\u2019ve talked before, I know Dino last year, for example, brought up our panorama of product and that is certainly taken our auto to a far more sophisticated level. We\u2019ve got many tiers there. Now remember, what we write in automobile isn\u2019t the same lets say some of the large direct writer's that have been using sophisticated analytics for a very long time. That said, when we talk about our fleets of affluent or high net worth or high valued cars that type thing, these tools are very sophisticated in helping us a lot to retain the right business and to attract new business. The same thing can be said for our pricing tiers in our predicative models around the homeowners as well for the affluent. Now your point about our brand, our relationships with agents all of that comes into play, and the analytics are just one part of the tool, but they are not everything so, Dino you wanted to touch on the unified [ph]. Dino E. Robusto: Yes, just at the introduction of your question right, I mean our increased retention is increased retention of profitable business? As we are always focused on increasing our margin, so I don\u2019t want \u2013 I just want to clarify that point, but, just a talk a little bit about the analytics on our professional liability as an example there. Our strategy and our capabilities are good towards taking advantage of the wealth of experience in our tremendously rich data set of information that we have, having underwritten literally hundreds of thousands of professional liabilities, polices over roughly more than three decades. So it\u2019s through to this expertise and this data mining of coverage, pricing, loss data, we've built proprietary underwriting an account ranking tools and these tools can be also supplemented with external data feeds and it's the proprietary analytical tools are then just one more arrow in the underwriters quiver for them to drop on when making renewal decisions. As Paul said, analytics are increasing in this industry, but where we see it as being a real competitive advantage for us because of the history of proprietary data that we have amassed overtime. And the underwriters are very pleased with additional insight gained from these tools and we intend to continue to invest in this area. John D. Finnegan: Yes and Josh not to beat it to death, but we not only use them on the front end underwriting side, but we are using in awful lot of tools on the back end, on the claim side as well. So for example some of our tools are predicative models around fraud detection in workers compensation, you are seeing that manifest itself into some of the spectacular world-class combined ratio in workers comp. John D. Finnegan: Let me interrupt Josh, what Dino said. We are properly focused on profitability. We are happy with the growth we\u2019ve got in the second quarter; we didn\u2019t have much growth in the first quarter. Our accounts are in strong form, we want to retain more of the counts and we think that\u2019s certainly a stepping stone to more profitability, but we are not giving away any rate to do so, we are getting what the market will bear and what we need on the accounts. Joshua C. Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC:  Got it, that\u2019s really helpful. If I could ask just one another topic that\u2019s comes to mind a bit not sort of is internally focused but sort of more risk management and just sense of growth and how you think about risk return and the opportunity. Obviously, the markets changed a lot with changes to the reinsurance industry, smaller guys starting to try to take share and write more Florida business, more coastal opportunities. How do you guys think about the coast these days are you still sort of running from them and trying to play defense or is this something we could see you be serves a big opportunity for Chubb here? Richard G. Spiro:  I\u2019ll mention the coastal piece here Josh, just because I think you're probably thinking along the homeowner side of it. And again I\u2019ll go back to what John just really emphasize around profitable growth, where we are seeing it on the homeowner side frankly is maybe we are seeing some customers that have exposure in Florida along the coast where heretofore we weren\u2019t able to necessarily take on that house, but given their spread of risk that they bring to us, not just in Florida but maybe in the Northeast and Illinois another places. We are able to use some reinsurance opportunistically to hang on to those types of customers or to even write more than we\u2019ve seen in the past. Dino I don\u2019t know if you want to touch anything commercially. Dino E. Robusto:  I\u2019ll point out that the cat modeling agencies have significantly reduced PMLs on the coastal areas which hasn't hurt either. Joshua C. Stirling \u2013 Sanford C. Bernstein & Co., LLC: Got it. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Vinay Misquith from Evercore. Vinay G. Misquith \u2013 Evercore Group LLC :  Hello, good evening. The first question is the above average property and marine losses and the fire losses and the homeowners. We have seen that for a couple of quarters and I think you touched upon this in your remarks, in your opening remarks but if you could help us understand and if we see some sort of trend developing or is it just quarterly volatility? John D. Finnegan: I think that in the first quarter we had very high non-cat weather related losses in homeowners that's because the weather was awful, but we\u2019d expected that the \u2013 this quarter we had somewhat higher non-cat related weather, fire losses kicked in, first quarter we really didn't have unusually high commercial and property and marine losses just the second quarter last year was so unusually low, 63 combined. This quarter, sometimes as you never know. The quarters are discrete on a piece of paper but things we roll forward. We all loss experience was not very good in the second quarter, but we can't find any trend. Last year when I was on these calls and we had usually low losses and I certainly didn\u2019t talk about any trends in fact what I suggested you all was that you should not project or combined ratios in the future based on margin expansion of the base period last year, combined ratio last year because it was so low. Similarly, I don't think you should project anything out the next are off this years second quarter combined ratio because I think it's unusually high. You're talking way beyond what we normally have in way beyond we had second quarter. Paul J. Krump:  Really this is Paul, if you look back on the homeowners side to 2009 and you can see another period where we had some anomalous losses. We've been reading high network homes now for 30 years and as we go back and we look at the history of this there have been periods where you to get that kind of misfortune of a rashes of some fires but as John mentioned we scrubbed each of these individual accounts to look for anything that we can learn from them and try to detect any trends, but at the end of the day, I think the conclusion is this is the insurance business. Vinay G. Misquith \u2013 Evercore Group LLC : So that\u2019s helpful thank you. just to follow-up on the pricing and the competitive environment. If could you give us an update on the competitive environment out there? Thanks. John D. Finnegan: Sure. We didn\u2019t categories it as clearly the market is competitive, but frankly, it usually is. On average, we would say that the pricing dynamics though in the markets are rational. We can always point to a always to a situation where you're going to scratch your head asking why competitor may have right and account at a low price but general we are seeing most of the pressure emerge on the most profitable account. So if you're an account with longer-term profitability will on average its going to be priced much more aggressively than an insured with a similar operation that is historically less profitable or inherently tougher exposures which makes sense in particular after multiple years of rate increases. One area where we might question the rationality of pricing its around some large accounts. Example a situation where you have a low six-figure property account versus a large seven figure similar property account, the latter is going to tend to have much more aggressive pricing even if to exposure to loss on the large one as far greater and this dynamic seems to be especially prevalent at least wholesaling ENS markets as we see it. So I guess for some you can conclude that the Lora the big premium is driving motivation quite frankly in our opinion size doesn\u2019t matter. Its really the price and the terms and conditions measured against the risk characteristics that we rely on. And in fact if you look at our retention rate of these larger accounts its below our overall retention rate we just choose draw align in the sand. In professional liability I was mainly commercial but in professional liability you\u2019d to see same dynamics. The better businesses is being more aggressively priced however we also continue to see general acceptance in professional liability for meaningful price increases on those lines of business that have had particularly poor profitability over the years such as EPL and review the stability as encouraging. So I guess I'd say that's against this kind of competitive back drop were pleased what our mid single digital average rate increase in both commercial and professional liability and combined with some of the highest level of retention so that\u2019s the general feel for the market. I hope that helps. Vinay G. Misquith \u2013 Evercore Group LLC : Yes. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Mike Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.:  Thanks. One question maybe on other personal lines, so that picked up a bit, is that bundling or is there another effort or something else that's we seen that lift the couple of quarters here in the double-digits recently so I\u2019m just curious sort of what\u2019s been driving that and then just a follow-up. Thanks. Dino E. Robusto:  No problem, Mike. Other personal is where we report our accident and health business, up little over 15% of that other personal the remainder than it\u2019s represented by personal excess any odd accident as I mentioned had the highest growth driven by travel accident coverage in the United States. Personal excess liability also grew, but that was fueled by both rate and exposure, on a year-to-date basis other personal move about 6% I think grew for at 6% for the entire year 2013. so other personal growth had loss related little bit through out the year because if we have an additional subtraction of a single premium program so that can pretty much drive the growth in any one three month period of time, but I would just tell you that overall we\u2019re very optimistic about our opportunities in accidents and as well as personal excess and in last couple of months we\u2019ve seen some uptick in the yachts purchasing and mega yacht business that\u2019s good for us as well. That\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing out there another personal. Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.:  Got it okay and is the ANH cohort I mean is that you expect to continue to trend higher I mean is that relatively sustainable. Paul J. Krump:  Yes, we've got to learn very good plans for A&H in the coming years, I had mentioned before that we\u2019ve invested in the team of underwriters over the last five years, we've built-in some infrastructure around the globe and we\u2019re finding out that our reputation and our quality of our paper and the relationships are making a big difference in that market place and in fact, we\u2019re finding that there is just an awful lot of commercial accounts that we can round out with A&H covered and we\u2019re also seeing a lot of high net worth individuals that are looking to purchase travel accident as well. Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Great, thanks and then just one sort of bigger picture question I guess is just on this recent volatility that we\u2019ve seen I mean again I mean its part of the business and its part of the reason that you\u2019re able to sort of extract the premiums you do, but they are \u2013 I would their reinsurance solutions out there especially given sort of the state of that market on the property side at this time. Would you or how do you look into solutions that might help you reduced volatility of earnings and attritional losses outside of cats? Richard G. Spiro:  It\u2019s Ricky. Obviously given the environment as you point out, you know we do constantly monitor the reinsurance alternatives available in the market, see whether it can not only improve our overall performance of our portfolio but also help us manage our volatility perhaps potentially grow all at the same time well trying to maintain or improve our combined ratios. We have and will continue to consider variety of options in both the traditional and alternative markets and as always we look at the cost of these alternatives versus the benefit of purchase and protection and where we routinely manage our overall portfolio and reinsurance strategy by reviewing various types of risk transfer options. We\u2019re not going to change our outstanding strategy focusing on proper underwriting and pricing of each risk. Having said all that, we are looking at all kinds of alternatives. We understand that there are opportunities in the marketplace, but as you might expect there is always we try to balance the potential short-term opportunities with our long-term objective and strategy. So we\u2019re looking at things, but they've got to meet our particular objectives and our strategy. John D. Finnegan: You know in the end we are an insurance company and we have to bear some risk and eliminating volatility is a big step from eliminating true balance sheet risk and given away a lot of profitability and so you look at the downside. This is the worst quarter we've had since here in terms of fire losses and this kind of things and its three points worst than a five year average and guess what? We still make $2 a share on net income. So you know I mean its \u2013 we are sorry we didn't hit what we expected to hit, but this awful quarter we make $2 a share I don\u2019t think we have to ensure it away. Michael S. Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs & Company, Inc.: Got it. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good evening. Thanks for taking my call. As a first question you saw, do you see any sort of loss cost trend across your business and the question is really as you see the pricing increase gradually slowing down, I just wonder at what point the price increase is essentially matching the loss cost trend that was the no margin expansion or what potentially margin contraction? John D. Finnegan: Well let\u2019s talk a little bit about it. I mean, let\u2019s take, we use we say often that we have 4% loss cost trends. And I don\u2019t think for looking at margin expansion is kind of a theoretical notion, but if you project combined ratios out, it gets important to understand what\u2019s really going on there. We\u2019re above that in CPI and CSI. We\u2019re right above that and CCI. But I\u2019m thinking kind of couple of things when you project out loss ratios, in the future. The first is that, we\u2019ll turn transfer are different than what we might expect for losses in given short-term period. For example, when we talk about long run lost cost trends, we generally mean the economic forces our portfolio paces, before consideration of any underwriting initiatives, any business mix changes that we might adopt. So they assume a pass of underwriting approach. You know workers compensation it might be, or we\u2019re talking about as let\u2019s got to more the 4% with medical care, cost inflation and payroll inflation it doesn't take into account the types of things we might do in terms of changes in business mix, the client paper predict, but analytically we are using in claims and adjusting these things. So we\u2019re constantly seeking to improve our books of business and where you just beyond rate taking focused under initiatives calling in the performing risk. It was successful in our book management, the effective year-over-year pressure on our lost ratio is overtime what generally been less in the long-term most trend itself so that\u2019s one. Two, as I mentioned before even when you project loss ratio, you got a pickup base period that\u2019s representative. Last year, as I said we talked about don\u2019t use the second quarter last year that\u2019s very, very low and we found at that wouldn\u2019t have a good quarter to use. But because the second quarter was low initiate second was high.  Now going forward I would suggest as you look at what you called margin expansion a future loss cause, you also taking into account that this second quarter roughly high loss ratio and you know you probably need to assume some reversion to the mean as you project out into the future loss trend just not apply, the difference in margin expansion that help. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Yes, thank you with that. Just different topic on the buyback it looks like this first half you really terms some buybacks and dividends more than what you earned to operating earnings. If you fair to assume that you could have return 100% like operating earnings as through the entire 2014? John D. Finnegan: Yes, our objective as we\u2019ve said in the past, on average is that the buyback in essence we equal to operating earnings, less shareholder dividends. If you actually did the math when we came into this year, we were going to get back a little bit more than that formula might suggest an even with the updated guidance \u2013 operating earnings will exceed that amount, operating earnings less dividends would be a little bit less than our share buyback efforts. So, it depends on the period but on average we would expect that we would use the operating earnings less dividends as sort of the guideline. Richard G. Spiro:  It might recall last year the opposite\u2026 John D. Finnegan:  The opposite\u2026 Richard G. Spiro:  Were a couple of $100 million more in operating earnings, less dividends. And, we are not going to just the program of $100 million shorten income this year. Obviously give a big catastrophe all bets are off. John D. Finnegan:  And we continue to believe that we have a significant excess capital position, so we have plenty of flexibility. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley :  Thank you so much for all the answers. Operator :  We will go next to Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.:  Thank you. A couple of questions, first is on the surety business, obviously a big contributor to your profitability. I guess we're hearing some noise that, that business is getting more competitive, wants you to kind of discuss what you are seeing there. And then, secondly, the favorable development in the specialty business, presumably that's going to be from the professional lines business was with the highest we\u2019ve seen in something like six years or so. And I'm wondering if you can get into more detail what drove that pretty significant favorable reserve development in the quarter? John D. Finnegan:  Okay, maybe a I can start just with the \u2013 on the surety fees I mean clearly is the competitive market, because really surety capacity it\u2019s increased over the last several years with demand is down obviously due to the slowdown in the construction in the U.S. as well as actually many geographies around the world. So, it has put pressure on rates that we can and we obviously do compete successfully really because of our brand or underwriting acumen or pricing discipline and the quality of customers that we have and we have been able to do that very well, it tends to grow slowly to surety business and it\u2019s a little bit lumpy, but has been historically very profitable and we\u2019re going to continue steady as we go. Richard G. Spiro:  Okay. And then, Jay, as relates to the question on development, let me try to give a few data points to answer that. First if you look at the development we took in CSI for this quarter which was $80 million, it was driven mainly as you rightly point out by professional liability, but surety was also favorable and within professional liability it was driven by D&O and fiduciary and it was partially offset but it's a small adverse development in the crime and fidelity classes. If you go back and look at it compared to a year ago quarter where we also had more development this quarter than we did in the second quarter of 2013 that was mainly because a year ago we had more offsetting adverse development in crime and fidelity E&O and EPL reflecting some of that the trends that we've talked about on this call and on prior calls as well. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.: That\u2019s helpful. And then on the D&O and Fiduciary what accident years are we talking about? John D. Finnegan:  We are taking 2010 and prior. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch.:  Great. Thank you. Operator :  We\u2019ll go next to Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc:  Thanks good afternoon. I was just hoping I could get the catastrophe numbers for the other segments besides homeowners? Richard G. Spiro:  Can you just give me a second here? John D. Finnegan:  You want to split between commercial and personal? Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc:  Well if I could it online that would be great, but I will take it if it\u2019s available. Richard G. Spiro: Okay let see here. Okay, I got it right here by the line here. We got package at five multi parallel, yes and then we come down at Property and Marine 13.1, homeowners 12.1. Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc: Okay. So nothing in auto? Richard G. Spiro: Well auto and personal it was tiny, it was 0.6. All right that\u2019s enough. Meyer Shields \u2013 Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc: Okay thanks very much. Richard G. Spiro: Sure. Operator :  We\u2019ll go next to Ian Gutterman from Balyasny. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.:  Hi, thank you. I guess I wanted to follow-up on the fire losses, is there any other maybe the first spilt I take it, was this a large number of fires relative to normal or was it few and just a very high end homes and basically getting is it a frequency or severity issue? John D. Finnegan:  Both. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: Both okay. Any geographic or okay. John D. Finnegan: No, I mean there were \u2013 to get these numbers, you got to have a large number and by our nature of the kind of business we have, they are large in dollars too, but it was a too major losses there was a lot of losses. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: And but the factor we are calling is not cat means they weren\u2019t say wildfire related or tornado related or anything like that? Paul J. Krump:  You\u2019re absolutely correct Ian. We make a distinction between a brushfire that would get a PCS cat number say a wildfire that might take place out in California or something and burn up a neighborhood that may or may not, but if it got a cat number, we would put that in the cat numbers. These are just large individual homes that burnt to the ground that's the business we're in. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: Got it and has there been any issue is as far as on the severity that rebuild cost is maybe higher than you think or insured values were too lower, anything that suggest aside from the frequency that there might be something you are taking up on the underwriting? Paul J. Krump:  It\u2019s a great question and the answer is no, we've gone through those files with a fine-toothed comb. We\u2019re very proud of our appraisal process. Getting the insurance to values absolutely key for us its part of our underwriting DNA because we don\u2019t get that valuation right nothing else really matters, because the rates are promulgated off of that. So that\u2019s a big difference when we send people in that really understand high net worth homes all the special mill work and all the special features and fixtures to the homes, we have fine arts specials, jewelry specialist, you name it. So that's our bread and butter. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: Perfect, perfect, that was my real concern. Rick, a question on the guidance, just to make sure I heard right. I think you said earlier that the implied second half is a point and half better combined ratios than the first half, but it looks like that the fire in the non-cat was a best three points impact on the first half. So that would imply the second half apples-to-apples as a point and a half worst in the first half. Am I doing that right? Richard G. Spiro: Yes, the other piece that I didn\u2019t talk about redevelopment. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: Got it, got it. So we\u2019re assuming a less development I guess in the second and the first? Richard G. Spiro: We don\u2019t make any specific development assumption; we just run a whole bunch of different scenarios so make your type. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: Got it, got it. And then my last one, the pickup in the new to loss ratio given that the retention picked up or is it more a function of less lost business and sort of stable new business or was it more new business and stable loss business, I\u2019m just trying to get a sense of was it more in offensive or defensive driver I guess or both? Richard G. Spiro: It was both, but it was mainly attributable to the higher retention ratio in both the CI and CSI. Ian Gutterman \u2013 Balyasny Asset Management L.P.: Perfect. I think that\u2019s all I had. Thanks so much. Operator :  And with no further questions in this queue. I would like to turn the call back over to John Finnegan for any additional or closing remarks. John D. Finnegan:  Thank you very much and have a good evening. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. (Operator Instructions). For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Wilson : Thank you, and welcome to the ACE Limited September 30, 2014 earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company\u2019s performance, pricing and insurance market conditions, and acquisitions including our expected acquisition in Brazil, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings as well as our earnings press release and financial supplements which are available on our website, for more information on factors that could affect these matters. This call is being webcast live, and the webcast replay will be available for one month. All remarks made during the call are current at the time of the call and will not be updated to reflect subsequent material developments. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, ACE had a record quarter with growth in earnings, driven by growth in both underwriting and investment income. After tax operating income for the quarter was $891 million or $2.42 per share, up 6% versus last year\u2019s third quarter which itself was a record. To the nine months, we have produced $2.5 billion in operating income, up 4% on last year, so again year-to-date a record for our company. Our annualized operating return on equity was 12.6% for the quarter bringing the year-to-date ROE to about 12%, a very good return on shareholder capital while at the same time we continue to invest for the future. As you saw in our announcement yesterday, we\u2019ve received all regulatory approvals needed to close our acquisition of the large corporate P&C business of Ita\u00fa Unibanco in Brazil. We now expect to close at the end of the month, well ahead of our original schedule. Our integration teams have been hard at work and we are ready to hit the ground running including our two businesses together. We are excited about the addition of this terrific franchise and the joining of our collective forces. I don\u2019t expect we will miss a beat [ph]. Underwriting results in the quarter were simply excellent. We\u2019ve produced $586 million of total P&C underwriting income, up 5%. Underwriting income growth resulted from both earned premium growth and an outstanding underwriting margin which was essentially flat with last year. Our combined ratio was 86.3, and benefited from strong current accident year results, prior year\u2019s reserve development and relatively light cap losses. All divisions contributed to the good underwriting results. Our overseas general business in particular delivered another standout quarter producing over $340 million of underwriting income, up over 19% and 80% combined ratio. Growth in earnings was also driven by excellent growth in net investment income, up 8.5% to $566 million, primarily as a result of growth in the invested asset and partnership income. Book value per share growth was flat in the quarter, affected by both foreign exchange and the impact of a rise in interest rates on our corporate bond portfolio. That year per share book value was up 6.5%, so I have more to say about our investment portfolio, prior year\u2019s reserve development in cap losses. Turning to revenue, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew 2.2%. Growth was impacted by our agriculture business, or premiums were down 5% as a result of lower crop commodity prices versus prior year. Excluding agriculture global P&C net premiums grew 4% in the quarter. This compares with growth for the first nine months of over 7% in constant dollars. We expect stronger growth in the fourth quarter in constant dollar terms than what we experienced in the third. In North America, P&C net premiums written excluding agriculture were up 2.7%; we had good growth in ACE Westchester and ACE Commercial Risk Services, our middle market and small commercial ENS and specialty businesses where premiums were up 9% and 18% respectively. We also had good growth in our high net worth personal lines business, ACE Private Risk Services, with premiums up 9.5%. Premium growth was constraint this quarter in our large account commercial P&C businesses, ACE USA and ACE Bermuda. The premiums were flat in ACE USA and down 10% in ACE Bermuda as both businesses exercised continued underwriting discipline in a more competitive market. As I mentioned earlier, premiums in our agriculture division were down in line with expectations. Our crop business was a good contributor to earnings in the quarter, the combined ratio reflects our best estimate of the projected underwriting results for the year as of quarter end and fully considers commodity price movements, crop yields, and deductibles by stake. Our projected results also consider our portfolio protections, including reinsurance in commodity hedges. We are comfortable with our selected combined ratio and believe it accurately reflects our exposure as we know them to be. Internationally, net premiums for ACE International were up 11% in constant dollar. Asia had an exceptionally strong quarter with growth of 25%; Latin America also had a decent quarter with growth of 10%. In Europe, net premiums grew 4% in the UK while growth on the continent was down 1%. Premiums in our Lloyd based business were down 6.5%. In our Global A&H business, growth accelerated as expected in the quarter with net premiums up over 6% in constant dollars. International grew 10% led by Asia Pac which was up 25% and Latin America where we grew 13%. Premium from international personal lines small business division were up over 20%. For our Global Re business, premiums for the quarter declined 22%, the decline was due to the non-renewal of a large workers comp treaty. Given the competitive reinsurance market conditions, I\u2019m pleased with the underwriting discipline shown by our reinsurance team. Finally, our international life insurance business which is focused overwhelmingly in Asia and Latin America had an excellent quarter with production up over 22%. Let me say just a few words about the current market environment for commercial insurance. Overall in North America, markets conditions, particularly for large account business were incrementally more competitive. We continued to secure rate in many general casualty and specialty casualty related classes that are with harder to come by. Property rates continue to decline at around the same pace we experienced in the second quarter. To put some more detail around that, starting with our large retail large account business, risk management rates were up 3.8% and professional lines rates were up about 1.5%, both up essentially the same as prior quarter. General and specialty casualty rates were flat overall, with some lines continuing to receive decent rate while others were down. For example, excess casualty rates were up 4% and medical professional rates were down 4%. For retail property and other short tail classes, rates declined about 4% while in the second quarter they declined 5%, so essentially the same. Again, in our large account retail lines new business was harder to come by in the quarter. We increased our submission and quote activity while our quote-to-close ratio declined as we became more selective, to me that equals underwriting discipline. Renewal retentions were steady on a policy count basis and were up on a premium basis due to the retention of larger trades and rate increases. For our U.S. wholesale and specialty little market in small commercial businesses, pricing continue to hold up pretty well. Casualty rates were up over 4%, property was down about 5.5% and professional lines rates were up about 4% and that\u2019s why we continue to grow these businesses more quickly. For ACE International, our international retail business, commercial P&C market conditions grew more competitive in the quarter with rates down 4% overall. UK and Europe were steady with prior quarters while Latin America and Asia became more competitive. For international in total, casualty rates were down 3%, property was down 6%, and financial lines rates were down 2%. My colleagues and I can provide further color on market conditions in pricing trends. While we are realistic about the purchase of commercial P&C market becoming more competitive and our resolute and our discipline to trade premium volume for underwriting profit, I\u2019m encouraged by the solid growth opportunities for many of our businesses around the globe. From ENS middle market in small commercial specialty and high net worth in the U.S., to small commercial and personal lines in Asia, Latin America, and Europe, to our significant A&H operations globally and our international life insurance operations in Asia, and of course, our company\u2019s significant large account commercial franchise globally, I\u2019m confident in our ability to continue to outperform. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil, and then we\u2019ll come back to take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Starting with investments, strong investment income this quarter benefited from an increase in our cash and invested assets which are up $2.6 billion for the year. Investment income also benefited from an increase in private equity distributions and increased call activity from our corporate bonds. Our average new money rate for the year is 2.8% versus our current book yield of 3.7%. For the past twelve months our operating profits cash flow was $4.5 billion. As I have said on previous calls, our strong cash flow has offset the impact of lower reinvestment rates and we expect this trend to continue. Our cash flow for the third quarter was again strong at $1.1 billion. There are number of factors that impact variability in investment income including the level of interest rates, pre-payment fees on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, PE distributions and foreign exchange. We currently expect our quarterly investment income run rate to be $550 million. Net realized and unrealized losses were $396 million after-tax, this included losses of $301 million in our investment portfolio primarily due to increasing yields from our corporate bonds, and a $95 million loss from the mark-to-market impact on our variable annuity business. Our investments remain in an unrealized gain position of $1.8 million after-tax. Our net loss reserves were up $93 million and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 88%. We had positive prior period development of $232 million pre-tax, principally from long-tail lines and from accident year\u2019s 2009 and prior. This included $63 million of adverse development for legacy environmental liability exposures in our Brandywine run-off operation which is included in our North American segment. As in the past, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our space [ph] review in the fourth. On the other hand, our prior period development also includes the positive impact from the release of $52 million individual casualty related claim reserve dated back over a decade in our overseas general segment. Pre-tax catastrophe losses of $86 million include $53 million from Hurricane Odile in Mexico, but the remainder coming from a number of U.S. weather events. Our Global P&C gross premiums written were up 1.7% for the quarter while our net premiums written increased 4%. Gross written premiums were impacted by the non-renewal of a few large front end accounts with little or no net retention in the North America and overseas general segments. Normalizing for these, the growth of our gross written were before 0.3%. Gross written growth would have been 3.5% for our North American segment and 8.3% for our overseas general segment. Adjusting for these, our net-to-gross ratio for global P&C would have been consistent with the prior year\u2019s quarter. The expense ratio in the overseas general segment was 39.2% this quarter versus 38% last year. As we disclosed at that time, last year\u2019s ratio included a 2.1 point benefit from a onetime purchase accounting adjustment related to our Mexican acquisitions. The global re-expense ratio is up due in part that a non-renewal of the workers compensation treaty that Evan mentioned which had a low acquisition ratio and a change in the mix of our business which included new structured contracts with higher acquisition costs. Our operating profits effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9% versus 14.9% last year. And our effective tax rate based on net income was 18.3% versus 14.4% last year. Both rates were higher this year as we had more of our earnings that came from higher rate jurisdictions. The net income rate was also affected by the loss from the mark on a variable annuity business which generated no tax benefit. Last year\u2019s lower year-to-date operating tax rate of 12.4% was impacted by favorable adjustments to prior year tax accruals. Our operating profits tax rate is 14.2% year-to-date. We believe this is a better indication of our run rate which should range from 13% to 15%. Total capital return to shareholders during the quarter was $617 million including $450 million of share repurchases and $220 million in dividends. Since we made the announcement of our repurchase plan in last year\u2019s fourth quarter, we have repurchased a total of $1.1 billion through October 20. And now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you, Phil. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. (Operator Instructions). And we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Nannizzi from Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs : So just one question, you mentioned the reinsurance expense ratio, so taking out casualty business out or that comp business out and thinking about some of the structure transactions you\u2019re talking about, I mean is this where you expect the expense ratio to kind of normalize or do you expect to replace a net equivalent contract on \u2013 into the comp when it didn\u2019t renew to get that back down? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Number one, we don\u2019t expect to replace that contract but the portfolio composition this quarter is different than the portfolio composition you will typically see in the first and second quarter which \u2013 by the quarters when we write most of the volume. And I think the expense ratio you see in the first two quarters is closer to what you would see going forward. It\u2019s a mix of business class and most of the business written in the first and second. Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. So as we expect the mix of business to more likely approximate what you have now versus that then just given \u2013 I\u2019m just trying to figure out like if this is the way\u2026 Evan Greenberg : The third and fourth quarter are the lighter quarters for premium volume, you can\u2019t really \u2013 and it depends on the composition of the portfolio, we\u2019re in a competitive reinsurance environment and I can\u2019t tell you with specificity how much cap we\u2019re going to write versus risk property, quote a share versus excess of loss and global versus simply domestic treaty business. It will vary depending on where we see the opportunity to make some underwriting profit. Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it, thanks. And then taking the other side, thinking about the businesses that seed into the reinsurance market, how are you sort of leveraging what\u2019s taking place there, and where should we begin to see sort of example for that? Thanks Evan Greenberg : Well I don\u2019t know that you will see examples of that and we\u2019re major buyers of reinsurance as you loan out. We buy it to protect for both, capacity limits greater than we can manage on our balance sheet, retain on our balance sheet, and we also buy reinsurance for volatility and to help spread volatility. We are good buyers of reinsurance, we\u2019re professional at it just like we are on the front end underwriting, and so we will take advantage of what the market has to offer. Michael Nannizzi \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Got it. Okay, thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Jay. Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Good morning. Evan for the fourth quarter where you\u2019re anticipating an improvement in topline growth, does that simply reflect that the third quarter had a headwind from the non-renewals that workers compensation reinsurance program or other factors have play as well? Evan Greenberg : There are other factors and the business is a bit seasonal, different businesses have a greater weight depending on the quarter that you\u2019re in. And we have been growing at around 7% year-to-date on average, the third quarter was a bit lighter, and the only thing we were signaling was that we expected modestly stronger growth in the fourth quarter from everything we know. Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then my second question is on the North American agriculture. We\u2019re all aware the commodity prices have come in and your commentary on the call seem to signal that you\u2019d already taken that into account with the year-to-date accident year pick. And I\u2019m just trying to get a perspective on for the fourth quarter, should we also anticipate around the 90% calendar year combined in agriculture? Evan Greenberg : Correct. We pegged what we think is the run rate for the year. If we thought that run rate was up we would have \u2013 as we did last year, we would have adjusted our combined ratio. But we think as premium earns and this is the proper pegged combined. And we considered \u2013 we have reasonably good models, you never know what certainty until the crop is actually harvested, but we know by state, our exposures, we know our crop mix by state, we know our deductible levels by state, and we consider all that in addition to commodity price movements and that\u2019s what all goes into the thinking as we settle on what we think is the combined ratio that reflects the year\u2019s performance, what will be the year\u2019s performance. And by the way we also consider all our protections, reinsurance and commodity hedges. Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Clearly, that will be a lot better than the fourth quarter a year ago results? Evan Greenberg : Well, if we are correct in our estimate and we \u2013 as I sit here today and we made that estimate a couple of weeks ago but as I sit here I feel just as good about it. It means that the fourth quarter would be materially better than fourth quarter last year. Jay Gelb \u2013 Barclays: Great, that was a lot better than we were thinking. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : So the first question is on the margins trends. Thank you for giving the market color in terms of pricing and just wonder there are lot moving parts here but if you look out to see if the rate environment is what it is right now and given what the sub loss [ph] trend, do you see in each different line of your business across the globe, shall we expect the core underlying margin to be stable as we have seen in recent quarters or there will be some deterioration or you can see some improvements there? Evan Greenberg : Kai, a couple of comments I will make about that. As I said in recent calls, depending on the class of business I think the level of rate increases are either not keeping pace with loss cost or barely keeping pace with loss cost. There are a few that are ahead of loss cost and that overtime naturally you look at the kind of combined ratios we\u2019re producing, naturally overtime I would expect the combined ratios to rise, that\u2019s not \u2013 again, that\u2019s just natural. Beyond rate and loss cost it\u2019s really about risk selection and portfolio management. And so product mix that is in other tool that you have to help mitigate margin deterioration, and we practice that rigorously. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Makes sense to you? And then the other comment I\u2019d make is look, we\u2019re in the risk business and there is also at the same time there is volatility and losses quarter-to-quarter and that will bounce around, for instance this quarter we had \u2013 we\u2019re not out there trying to pound our chest about it, there were greater individual large losses in the short tail business, particularly in energy and aviation, and that impacted the current accident year a bit, but to me it meaning that it was losses outside or normal peg loss ratio and so we recognized those losses in the quarter. But that\u2019s just normal noise in the insurance business where a current accident year is just not a straight line. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thanks for the answer. My next question actually related to the cap \u2013 on the capital measurement sites. You pursue $1.1 billion out of the $1.5 billion authorization, so are we on track to finish our program by year end? And also, do you think the board like it will think these as onetime deal or [ph] on going forward you think about is more a two for you; one to sort of match your share grade; another one being probably more proactive in terms of reducing your shares given that you probably have access capital position? Evan Greenberg : First of all we are on track to complete our program which is to repurchase up to $1.5 billion, I believe we have repeated that continuously. Secondly, when our board meets in November and when we review \u2013 finish reviewing our plans for the year, for the coming year, we look out at opportunities as we view them in the landscape then that\u2019s how we think in totality about our required needs for capital and capital management at that time, and so as part of that we will consider all capital management tools available including share repurchase, and if we anticipate that that will be a tool that we employ for the 2015 year, we will alert the investing community to that fact as we did last year in due course. Kai Pan \u2013 Morgan Stanley : Thank you so much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Vinay Misquith with Evercore. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Hi, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the margin question, you\u2019ve done a good job in the past of business mix change and also chopping some wood in the underperforming countries where you\u2019ve improved your loss in a combined ratio. I\u2019m curious how much of wood is left to chop in the underperforming countries that will help you to keep improving the combined ratio? Evan Greenberg : I don\u2019t know what wood chop really means, and I don\u2019t know about underperforming countries, I don\u2019t recall speaking about underperforming countries and I don\u2019t even relate to that. I don\u2019t know about underperforming countries. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: Over the last \u2013 one last quarter call, I mean there was some commentary saying that not all countries are performing off the bar, so you managed to improve performance in certain countries and that helped the combined ratios. So I was wondering \u2013 I mean, do you have something more there that will help you in the future? Evan Greenberg : Vinay, again, I don\u2019t relate to the comment about countries at all but as far as portfolio management goes which is line of business and its line of business by cohort of insured by territory, by country, that is a constant work in progress. I mean it\u2019s iterative to constantly gain more insights into where are you making money, where are you not in cohorts of risk. And where can you improve your insights on predicting future loss behavior of individual cohorts of risk and that\u2019s a constant work in progress as well, and that helps to \u2013 that plus market conditions help to define how your mix of business changes overtime and it will change naturally if you have clear underwriting insight and you know your minds, and you\u2019re constantly working to improve that, and your distribution capabilities and your product innovation help to keep you relevant within the marketplace, then market conditions will then dictate how successful you\u2019d be at each of those efforts and that dictates what is really a dynamic kind of movement in the mix of your business overtime, and helps to meliorate [ph] what is natural grabbing that pulls on combined ratios as rates go one way and loss cost go another. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: So that\u2019s helpful and just one follow up, big 50,000 foot question when you\u2019ve been through various cycles, how does this feel \u2013 maybe seeing hide in competition but as it seems lower than the past and claiming that interest rates are now lower do you see a certain amount of discipline in the market? Evan Greenberg : You know the market is a chaotic place and everybody wants to always put at it a very neat statement, I know you want one and I struggle to give you one. Look, the market is growing more competitive and there are some ends to the market that are behaving in a more ferocious way, reinsurance is an example. And then there are ends of the market like little and small commercial that are behaving in a far more orderly way, and you have every gradation in between, and it varies very much by country and even within large countries, territory, and by line of business and different competitors have a different capability in different territories and behave differently. So the marketplace is dynamic that way, what I would say different than the past, it\u2019s more global, and so you do see some uniform trends at 50,000 feet that where the world is behaving more in locked step because there are major underwriting centers that can move their capacity around the globe rather quickly and that is different than in the past. On the other hand, I do see company\u2019s ability particularly large companies with the analytics and that data they have they are able to do a better job of discipline but at the same time they are always lot of smaller and mid-sized players who are just \u2013 they are gunning run and they come in, and they have a way of disrupting market. So you\u2019ve got all that going on right now but the fact is, we\u2019re moving into a softer market. Vinay Misquith \u2013 Evercore: That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. Two questions, I will just give you both and hopefully you can comment on them. First one, I\u2019m wondering relative to the Ita\u00fa acquisition, what you have found give as an update on kind of what you\u2019ve found as your again the integration process. And then secondly, it has been in the press that ACE is interested in forming some sort of internal hedge fund reinsurance operation, I\u2019m not sure if you can comment specifically on that but maybe I\u2019m mean if you can talk about the concept of reinsurance company linking up with an asset management company and generating more of returns from the asset side? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019ll take your second one first. I\u2019m not going to \u2013 as you can appreciate, I\u2019m not going to speculate \u2013 we\u2019ll comment on what is kind of rumors and speculation out there. I\u2019m wondering if we have something to say, you know we\u2019ll say it, we\u2019ll be clear about it. As far as more general sense of your calling it hedge fund marrying up, and the investment capability, I maybe see it a little bit differently, and that I think is just a feature. I went in our shareholder letter this year; I went into some link to try to give some thoughts, at least for me, that how I see the marketplace changing. And capital in our business, it\u2019s been a very traditional buy and hold model, for reinsurance, where the capital \u2013 where the originators of risk, and underwriters and managers of risk around the world, the primary companies would distribute to buy and hold pools of capital, simply traditional reinsurance. And that I think that overtime as has happened in other asset classes, that well evolve and evolve beyond that, and needs to evolve beyond that because the model constraints how much capacity there is to take on the values of risk that are being created around the world, the values are increasing. I think technology in all its forms, from the math, to the IT informs us that as these tools evolve, we will be able to evolve how we use and harness the capital around the world. I think what you\u2019re seeing right now are glimmers or early steps towards new kinds of buy and hold models potentially that are using other sources of capital. And if it\u2019s a buy and hold, and it\u2019s private and people are \u2013 and the purpose is long term gain, not simply annual income, then frankly the investments well remain in conservative and appropriate to an insurance company can evolve. And what it also says is the originators of risk can directly package and provide to the providers of capital, new forms of capital, don\u2019t need a wholesale market in between to do that necessarily. So I just think there is thought around that, there is activity around that, there is talk around that and that is natural, you can\u2019t stand in the way of progress, and you can\u2019t fight against that, if it has \u2013 if you think it has a sound premise, and that\u2019s kind of my view of it. And ACE as a large company, is an originator of risk around the globe and with a good reputation for being able to earn a reasonable return on the risk it takes, we\u2019ll necessarily be at the forefront and a leadership role as these things evolve if they make sense to us, it\u2019s our job. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Interesting observations. And then on the Ita\u00fa? Evan Greenberg : John Keogh and I just spent some good time with the Ita\u00fa and ACE people in the last two weeks on the granular detail related to implementation and integration, and I can tell you that we are as impressed or more impressed with the leadership, the people, with the culture, with the response of both, the ACE underwriters and team that is a great team in Brazil. And the Ita\u00fa team and the positive feeling among both about how one and one is going to equal three here, their insights and their capabilities are simply going to make us better. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great, thanks Evan. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Paul Newsome, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Good morning and congratulations on the quarter. I was hoping you might talk a little bit about the M&A environment, and I think at least my experience historically as we get into softer markets we see more stuff coming up for sale and I was wondering if you think that that is emerging as well. And maybe just give us an update of what you think the environment is from a competitive M&A environment? Evan Greenberg : Look I think M&A activity will increase, particularly around companies that will find it more difficult in this environment to continue with the strategy that has served them in the past and I think there will be more pressure that it holds on performance and as pressure builds on performance that generally is a catalyst for greater M&A activity, I think that\u2019s on the sell side. I think on the buy side typically what happens is there is inflation and what people will pay for properties because it\u2019s just a more competitive environment, others will see no other way of getting their growth or actually keeping themselves from shrinking or margins deteriorating and they see this as their only option, so that hunger builds. So I expect you will see more M&A activity as time goes on, I expect you will see more of a seeding [ph] friendly what comes market. So as we\u2019ve always said, for ACE it\u2019s pretty simple, we have a strategy that we are pursuing for organic growth, if an acquisition comes along, we\u2019ll compliment what we are already doing on an organic basis, and if the returns are favorable for our shareholders, we will pull the trigger, if not, we\u2019re very happy to sit on the sideway. Paul Newsome \u2013 Sandler O\u2019Neill: Actually I just had one question. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : Thank you, Paul. Operator : We\u2019ll move now to Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW: Thank you, good morning. Evan, you talked a little bit about what the marketplace for cyber and trends look like domestically whether it\u2019s attractive, how it\u2019s growing and all that? Evan Greenberg : Yes, look the demand for cyber is obviously growing quickly and that\u2019s very good, and it\u2019s among small companies to large companies, all sizes, and ACE is an active participant in the cyber insurance market. I think the question right now, particularly for larger target type risks is the kind of pricing, and the price reflects the actual exposure. And I think in smaller and medium size risks, as the market evolves in many classes, I think that looks \u2013 I think pricing is looking reasonable. I think on the larger accounts, that\u2019s the question, so I think there is an appetite to provide the coverage, can you get paid for it. Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW: Okay, fantastic. And really quickly, it\u2019s for Phil. The policy acquisition costs on life insurance side has been significant year-over-year, what\u2019s driving that? Phil Bancroft : It\u2019s simply in the prior year, during the course of this year we saw some expenses that were classified as administrative expenses that we think are now better priced as acquisition expenses. So you will see a decline in acquisition, I mean in admin expenses offset by an increase in the acquisition. Meyer Shields \u2013 KBW: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Cliff Gallant from Nomura. Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura: Thank you. And I believe in your opening remarks you mentioned growth in professional lines I think it was 4%, I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you see in that line of business? Also if you could update us what\u2019s happening in personal lines on your high net worth class of business? Thank you. Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m sorry because I didn\u2019t say 4% growth in our professional lines, I said two things. I said I only refer to pricing and so in the large account I said we got rate of about 1.4%, on an average that goes between ENO & DNO [ph] and not-for-profit and then in the smaller risk, medium-sized risk in wholesale market business we got 4% rate. Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura: Okay. Evan Greenberg : Okay. And second part of your question? Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura: It was on\u2026 Evan Greenberg : [Indiscernible] I think we continue to make good progress in that area, I\u2019m pleased with the progress. It\u2019s \u2013 we grew 9.5% in the quarter that makes about \u2013 that makes the right sense to us, I think there is a good balance between underwriting, our marketing and sales, and customer service, and portfolio insight and management, so we can constantly fine-tune our exposure and our view about pricing depending on the line of the coverage that we\u2019re providing. I think our reputation for service and for consistency is excellent, we run the surveys among our agents and brokers and among our customers, our retention rates are very, very high which speaks very good \u2013 obviously if customers aren\u2019t happy they are going to vote with their feet, so I think it speaks to good customer satisfaction, good reputation that way and we\u2019re speaking to [indiscernible]. We\u2019re very focused on the high net worth and to some degree the mass affluent, and we\u2019re not kind of straying away from that, we know the risk profile, and it\u2019s consistent with our vision from the beginning and that\u2019s the brand we\u2019re building. And remember, it takes years to do anything really well and create a great franchise in our industry. Cliff Gallant \u2013 Nomura: Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll take our next question from Charles Sebaski from BMO Capital Markets. Charles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Good morning, thank you. Have the \u2013 first question about the crop business and a follow up on how last year looked if we look at the fourth quarter and the first quarter this year and a true-up. I\u2019m wondering if you guys are doing anything different today regarding hedging of that portfolio where changes could have a similar outcome or a different outcome with the same kind of events? Evan Greenberg : First of all, we \u2013 and how we manage our selection of \u2013 or peg our combined ratios and our estimating process, that has not changed, if that is the same, if anything we have only improved it, it\u2019s more rigorous, we\u2019ve refined it, we\u2019ve worked on our models between last year and this year and we will work on it again between this year and next year. So that remains the same, we just think we\u2019re little better at it. As far as our protections go, our protections vary from year to year, for instance, we bought last quote a share reinsurance this year than we did last year, we\u2019ve been engaged in commodity hedging and that program was a bit more rigorous this year than last year. So the reinsurance and any other protections we have varied by year. Charles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. And in terms of the Ita\u00fa, the acquisition in Brazil, is that solely going to be in commercial or is there a personal lines element to that similar to the Mexican and Latin America business as you did previously? Evan Greenberg : Sure. No, this acquisition is only focused on \u2013 is only large commercial but ACE \u2013 our business in Brazil, we\u2019ve been there for many, many year\u2019s and our business in Brazil is a mix of large commercial, a very large portfolio of accidental health business, personal accident, and small commercial, medium-sized commercial, and some limited personal lines, more in the high net worth area that we\u2019re incubating there. This acquisition will not directly help us pursue those other channels of growth but what they do, it gives us a bigger image and profile in the country, it gives us greater attention of broad distribution in the country and so it will have a hallow effect that if we execute right we\u2019ll lend a benefit to those other lines of business. Charles Sebaski \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Excellent. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we\u2019ll go now to Thomas Mitchell from Miller Tabak. Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak : Thanks. Firstly, I\u2019m wondering historically it seems like India has always been a very hard place for financial services companies to do business, and I\u2019m wondering if the new government in India has created fresh or new or different opportunities and if you are looking at that area to expand. Evan Greenberg : Tom, the new government in India is a welcomed statement of change in direction by the electorate in India, the largest democracy in the world; it is a more business friendly government. Their economic, and trade, and investment related policies, the words are the right words and the right language, and Modi has a history, a track record of supporting economic growth and fostering it. I\u2019m hopeful that that will translate into legislation and action that will really help stimulate further growth \u2013 accelerate growth in India and I think it will. And for the insurance market, it may create greater opportunity, it may lift the ownership cap from 24% to 49%, ACE is not present as you know in India, we have \u2013 but we\u2019re dynamic, we\u2019re constantly probing and looking and if the environment is more favorable and we see the right opportunity and it makes sense to us, then we will take advantage of it and enter the Indian market. So it is on our radar screen, and there you go. Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak : That\u2019s very helpful. And my other question is, I\u2019m unsure of the timetable on the federal terrorism, as I understand that we need new congressional action. Is there any new reading on what that looks like going forward? Evan Greenberg : Congressional action for what? I\u2019m sorry, Tom. Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak : For TRIA. Evan Greenberg : Yes, we do need congressional action. We need congressional action to renew TRIA. And when you look at the risk of terrorism today, which is greater than the risk has been, I consider it irresponsible of Congress to keep TRIA as a question mark around the certainty of government backstop a protection that is bad for the economy, it is bad for business. Business thrives in an environment of greater certainty. Both houses know and both parties know what needs to be done to renew TRIA. The difference between them is not great, and the only thing they can take time for is campaigning rather than legislating to the benefit of our country, is shameful to me. Thomas Mitchell \u2013 Miller Tabak : Well put. Thank you very much. Operator : (Operator Instructions) And we\u2019ll go now to Ian Giverman [ph] with Balsun [ph] Investments. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, thank you. Evan my first question is, on the crop it looked like there was a footnote in the supplement that the hedging helped to something in my math is right, Phil it looked like about $40 million, is that pretty close? And secondly, am I understand right that that went through the combined ratio? Phil Bancroft : It was $45 million and it\u2019s in the combined ratio, absolutely. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you. Secondly, Evan did comment on the environment as pricing little bit was a wholesale for holding it better than retail and I guess I would have thought the opposite just we have a several lot of access capacity in the market and it\u2019s a lot easier to enter wholesale especially if you have Bermuda at London than to get a casualty retail. So A, are you surprised that? And B, why do you think it\u2019s happening and will precision [ph] think wholesale is just lagging in capital for retail? Evan Greenberg : Ian, good question. Chaotic market, so here it depends how you\u2019re defining wholesale. When I was talking about the U.S., I was talking about our wholesale, ENS and specialty business which is the Westchester and Commercial Risk Services, and those both grew nicely and thereafter that middle market and small commercial, and yes, they have offices around the U.S. and they are dealing with the U.S. wholesalers, and their pricing help up better. On the other hand, I said our Lloyd\u2019s operation shrank 6.5% and I said our ACE Bermuda operation which is large risk wholesale shrank 10%, and there pricing is more competitive. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. So you\u2019re not seeing \u2013 I mean we\u2019ve seen you obviously are aware sort of become flavor of \u2013 maybe not the month but flavor of the last couple of years for the guys who are struggling with reinsurance to try to set up, honest to our U.S. wholesale divisions, did those people were in the market in the mid-small county had been? Evan Greenberg : They haven\u2019t gotten quite to it yet, it\u2019s harder work. You got to have underwriters, the business is placed locally, it doesn\u2019t just box itself up into one place. So you got to be present in Chicago, and L.A., and San Francisco, and Atlanta, and Boston, and New York; you got to have underwriters across a broad swath of lines of business and you got to really have the relationship. It\u2019s flow business and trades move fast, and you got to have the confidence of the brokers, and not just \u2013 you know that\u2019s not instant. By the way easier form to get access than primary, the best work on access [ph] than you do on primary, so a lot of those guys are doing better with the writing access and it will be actually on larger account business than the smaller account. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then my final one, I hate to bring up your favorite topic but the A, reinsurance with interest rates back to the lows again, I guess I was looking at your old disclosure from a few years back and when you gave the scenarios and sure the more cautious scenario had a tenure, I think it was north of 2.5, I want to say 2.6 maybe, and obviously a much lower S&P than we are at today so maybe those offset but I guess also I think about halfway through the annuitization phase. I was wondering if you can just give us any update on what you\u2019re seeing from annuitization phase [ph] and what is sort of benefit of a higher market to reverse the offset of lower interest rates and you\u2019re hoping for few years ago? Evan Greenberg : Ian the annuitization and lapse rates, we study those on the portfolio and so we look at our actual experience versus our expected, and we\u2019re just completing studies and reviewing them in that area for the year and we\u2019re not seeing anything in aggregate that gives us concern that we\u2019re not pegging them correctly. So those seem okay to us. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Evan Greenberg : Equity market are ahead of what we expected, interest rates are lower, and I also don\u2019t believe that the ten year \u2013 word of volatile movement on interest rates right at the moment. And there has been a sort of risk off trade because there is the complex picture about economic and geopolitical at the moment, I don\u2019t believe the ten year rate is going to remain where it is. Unidentified Analyst : Understood. Say, the trend I think at primary players is that in lapse has been much lower and actual choice of annuitization has been much lower than expected, is that reasonable expect just seems from our trends? Evan Greenberg : What we have seen is certainly less utilization from an annuitization standpoint and lapse is, maybe marginally lower than we were expecting but net-net we don\u2019t think that the experience is going to change our view. Unidentified Analyst : Perfect. Thanks so much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our final question of the day from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thanks. Just one more follow up and it\u2019s related to a news item that came out [ph] the day before about ACE suggesting it may exclude Ebola coverage from certain geopolicies. I have not heard that from others, I\u2019m wondering why are you the only one to doing it. And secondly, what prompted this action? Evan Greenberg : Thank you for asking me that question Jay. I can\u2019t comment on what others are doing but I\u2019ll comment a little bit about ACE. I read the press report, we all did, that in my mind attempts to sensationalize normal common-sense underwriting. Look, as underwriters we start with the facts to understand the risk exposures of our clients on a case-by-case basis. These exposures for example include the types of activities they are engaged in, the locations where they take place and the kind of safety protocols that they employ. We have many tools to manage price risk, we can offer full coverage, we can sublimit exposures, we can exclude the coverage altogether and we can vary the price we charge depending on the exposure we assume. The Ebola endorsement referenced in our U.S. global casualty unit is only one of many tools that are disposal and we\u2019re using it selectively and on a case-by-case basis, it\u2019s not being applied in some indiscriminate, unilateral or blanket way to address the Ebola risk. Does that kind of\u2026 Jay Cohen \u2013 Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, now that\u2019s helpful. I wasn\u2019t \u2013 that made it clear then what I have been reading about in the press. So that was helpful. Evan Greenberg : Thanks, Jay. Helen Wilson : Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of the next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today\u2019s conference. And we do thank you for your participation.",

Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. ACE had excellent operating results for the quarter. All divisions of the company made a positive contribution to both quarterly and annual operating results, which were driven by growth in both underwriting and investment income. For the year, we produced record operating income, world-class combined ratios, strong premium revenue growth and reasonable book value growth considering foreign exchange. And lastly, we produced an excellent ROE. We also made many investments in our company that will contribute to our results in the future. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $827 million or $2.47 per share. For year, net operating income was over $3.3 billion or $9.79 per share, up 4.7% from 2013 and again a record for our company. Our P&C combined ratio was excellent, 88.5% for the quarter and 87.7% for the year with underwriting income increasing over 7% for the quarter and year. These calendar year underwriting results benefited from very strong current accident year performance. Current accident year underwriting income, excluding cats, was up 23% for the quarter and 13% for the year. The current accident year results were a reflection of our premium revenue growth globally and margin improvement around the world in many of our businesses as a result of pricing action, portfolio management efforts, product mix and expense control. To breakdown our current accident year underwriting results further, the combined ratio for global P&C, which as you know excludes agriculture, was 89.4% for the year and for agriculture was 87.8% for the year. The quarter\u2019s results for agriculture \u2013 the fourth quarter\u2019s results for agriculture, included a loss ratio true-up for our crop business for the year, which improved over our third quarter projections due to improved crop prices and yields. Net investment income was a record $577 million in the quarter. For the year, we benefited from strong operating cash flow and produced net investment income of $2.25 billion, up over 5%, quite a good result given the historic low interest rates. So, we will have more to say about the quarter and the year. ACE\u2019s strong earnings led to excellent operating ROEs of about 12% for both the quarter and year, with surplus capital scrubbing almost 200 basis points of the ROE. At approximately 1,000 basis points over the risk-free rate, our ROE is an excellent return for shareholders in this rate environment. And as we have said before keep in mind that every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield for ACE is equal to approximately 200 basis points of ROE. Interest rates will not remain this low indefinitely. ACE is a truly global dollar-based multinational insurer. And as such our premium revenue and book value growth in the quarter were impacted by the strong dollar. Per share book value grew 6.1% for the year, but declined modestly in the quarter due to FX. Excluding foreign exchange, book value per share grew 8.8% for the year. Our shareholders have and will over any reasonable period of time continue to benefit from our global presence and diversification and our ability to take advantage of opportunity all over the world. There has been a remarkably rapid investor flight to the dollar in search of safety as a result of several factors including the decline in the price of oil, from an increase in supply and reduced demand, declining economic growth in major economies of the world including China, Japan and the Eurozone which is in crisis. And the follow-on impact in natural resource-based economies in Latin America, Asia and Africa, not to mention geopolitical tensions particularly in the Middle East, spreading terrorism in Russia, Ukraine. The U.S. right now is the preferred destination for many investors seeking safety. We are the prettiest house in a pretty shabby neighborhood. Over time I imagine the dollar\u2019s strength against many currencies will go the other way. Keep in mind, ACE\u2019s book value $30 billion at December 31, has increased 22% in the last 3 years, 50% in the last 5 years and it has tripled in the last 10 years. For the year P&C net premiums increased about 6% in constant dollars or nearly 7% excluding agriculture. Growth was broad-based from all regions illustrating how we have successfully built a diversified business by product, geography, customer and distribution so that we can outperform in spite of the conditions around us. Let me breakdown the P&C growth by area, commercial P&C, A&H and personal lines. For the year, our commercial P&C businesses generated growth of over 5% globally with contributions from most every region. U.S. retail and wholesale grew 5.5% and 10.5% respectively. Internationally for retail Latin America led the way with commercial P&C net premium growth of 17% in constant dollars, followed by growth of 10.5% in Asia, while Europe declined about 1.5%. Growth in our London-based DNS business which saw more competition during the year was flat. Net premiums for our agriculture businesses were down about 2.5% for the year, in line with our expectations. The decline due to lower crop commodity prices versus prior year had no impact on our overall market share which basically remains steady at about 22%. For the year, our A&H insurance business grew 4.5% globally in constant dollars with international up over 7.5%, led by Asia with growth of 22% and Latin America with growth of 11%, while Europe declined 8% due to the economy and underwriting actions taken. Premiums for combined insurance business were down 1.3%, but modestly \u2013 but up modestly in the fourth quarter led by our core North American franchise which grew 2%, its best performance in several years and a sign that this business is turning the corner. Net premiums written for personal lines were up 25% in constant dollars or 13% excluding the contributions from our Mexican and Thai acquisitions. We are generating good organic growth for this $2 billion business which has tripled in size in the last 5 years and is now approaching 13% of the company\u2019s net premiums. Our personal lines business is a strategic growth area and poised to continue its growth globally. To that effect as you saw last month, we signed a definitive agreement to acquire the U.S. high net worth personal lines business of Fireman\u2019s Fund for $365 million. The addition of the funds business, which will be integrated into ACE Private Risk Services, will expand ACE\u2019s position as one of the largest high net worth personal lines insurers in the U.S. The fund has a good mix of business with about 80% of the book homeowners, collections and valuables, and umbrella liability. In fact, the fund\u2019s statutory filings don\u2019t readily upon reading them reflect the profitability of the business as they omit from the personal lines category, lines such as collections and umbrella. In total, the loss ratio of the business is good. The expense ratio, that\u2019s been a problem and that will run much lower under ACE given our technology, operational processes and combined scale. We expect the acquisition to be accretive to our earnings immediately. We also expect a good ROI and ROE over a reasonable short period. We anticipate the acquisition will close in the second quarter. We are proud and excited that most Fireman\u2019s Fund colleagues will be joining ACE. Returning to our production results for the year, our international life insurance business, which is focused primarily in Asia, had an excellent year with net premiums and deposit growth of 18.5% in constant dollars. Lastly, our global reinsurance business had a very good year with a combined ratio of 72.3%. Net premiums declined almost 6% as we maintained underwriting discipline in a market awash in capital. As we have said in the past and continually demonstrated, we are fully prepared to shed volume in any business as necessary in order to maintain an underwriting profit. And as a reminder, as a substantial buyer of reinsurance, we continue to benefit from the current reinsurance market in terms of pricing and improved terms. I want to now say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions. Pricing environment grew modestly more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business in the U.S. We continued to secure rate in many general and specialty casualty related classes, but at a modestly reduced pace from the third quarter. On the other hand, property rates continued to decline at about the same pace we experienced in the third quarter. Taking our U.S. commercial P&C business by its pieces and starting with our large and upper middle market retail business, general and specialty casualty related pricing was up 1% in the quarter compared to a 1.7% increase year-to-date with pricing varying by line. For example, large account risk management related casualty pricing was up 2.3% versus 3.2% for the year. Management and professional liability pricing was up about 1.25% in the quarter compared to 1.8% for the year. Pricing for excess casualty was up 2% for the quarter versus 3.5% for the year, while foreign casualty pricing was down 2.4% versus a 1.2% decline for the year. Property-related pricing continued to decrease at a steady pace, down about 7% for the quarter and year. For our U.S. retail business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 92% in the quarter. Turning to our U.S. E&S business, casualty rates were up 2.6% in the quarter versus 4.6% for the year. Professional lines rates were up about 4.5% in the quarter versus 4.1% for the year, while property was down about 7.5% versus 6% for the year. Internationally, the retail commercial P&C rate environment improved marginally with rates down 3% in the quarter versus 4% prior quarter. For the year, rates declined 2%. Asia was the most competitive region with rates down 6% in the quarter, whereas pricing in Latin America declined 2% and the UK and the continent are rather stable with rates down 1%. For international in total, casualty rates in the quarter were down 1%, property was down 4%, financial lines rates were flat. Looking ahead for January 1 business and what we see now, pricing was essentially the same as the fourth quarter globally. John Keogh and John Lupica can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. In summary, ACE had an excellent year. In addition to producing record financial results, we made numerous investments for future growth in earnings. For example, we launched retail distribution to complement our existing wholesale capabilities for our U.S. middle-market specialty and E&S business. We started a new micro business division to serve very small U.S. commercial businesses. We made three acquisitions and closed two of them in Thailand and Brazil further expanding our presence and capabilities in promising developing markets. And of course, as I mentioned, we signed a deal in the fourth quarter to acquire the Fireman\u2019s Fund high net worth personal lines business. These are the seeds of future growth for our company. Just as you are seeing today, the fruits of investments we made over the past 10 years. Finally, allow me to address point blank, a misconception about our company and our industry that I have read of late in some analyst commentary. There are some who seem to believe insurance is boring that we are nothing more than a common utility. Well nothing could be further from the truth. We are a vibrant, entrepreneurial, growth-related company that participates deeply in the diverse and complex economic and social activities of the world to truly know us as to understand the true dynamism of this organization and the unlimited opportunities that lie ahead for us over time. With that, I will turn the call over to Phil and then we will be back to take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. A record operating earnings for the year contributed to growth in our tangible book value per share of 5.3%. Book value was negatively impacted by foreign exchange valuation losses of $600 million for the quarter and $750 million for the year. These losses relate to our net asset exposure to foreign currencies. They represent a point in time mark-to-market valuation adjustment and do not affect the capital position of our foreign operating units. We match our assets and liabilities in each jurisdictions and we keep our required capital in local currencies. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency movements, tangible book value per share increased 8.6% for the year. Goodwill and intangibles relating to the two acquisitions we made in the year had an additional negative impact on tangible book value per share of 2.7 percentage points. Excluding the impact of both foreign exchange and the acquisitions, tangible book value per share increased 11.3% for the year. Our tax rate on net income for the quarter was 29.5%. This is higher than our normal run-rate and was impacted by deferred tax charge included in the $600 million foreign exchange loss. This item added 14.6 points to the tax rate. We had very strong cash flow of $1.3 billion for the quarter and $4.5 billion for the year that benefited our investment income and contributed to growth in our cash and invested assets of $63.6 billion, which were up $2.1 billion for the year. Record investment income for the quarter of $577 million was better than anticipated principally due to higher private equity distributions and higher call activity in our corporate bond portfolio. Our strong cash flow will continue to benefit our estimated quarterly investment run-rate \u2013 investment income run-rate of approximately $555 million even with current new money rates of 2.8% versus our current book yield of 3.8%. The estimated investment income run-rate is subject to variability and portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. During the quarter, we had after-tax realized and unrealized gains of $55 million related to the investment portfolio and a mark-to-market loss on our VA reinsurance portfolio of $153 million. Both of these were due principally to decreasing interest rates. Our net loss reserves were up $107 million for the year or 0.4%. They were up $659 million or 2.5% for the year, adjusted for foreign exchange. The paid to incurred ratio was 101% for the quarter or 87% on a normalized basis, which takes into account prior period development and crop loss payment activity. This quarter\u2019s ratio is seasonally affected by significantly more crop payments than incurred losses, which normally occurs in the fourth quarter. Our paid to incurred ratio of 96% for the year was flat with last year. In the quarter, we had net positive prior period development of $107 million pre-tax. For our active companies, we had $237 million of positive prior period development, approximately half from long tail lines principally from 2008 and prior. The remainder was from short tail lines. In our Brandywine and other run-off operations, we strengthened reserves by $130 million pre-tax. The charge related mostly to asbestos and comprised account specific development and defense-related costs on existing accounts. Average indemnity severity for individual asbestos claims has remained stable. Cat losses were $64 million after-tax in the quarter from a number of worldwide weather events. Full year A&H net written premiums were up 4.4% on a constant dollar basis, while A&H operating income was down 0.9%. Normalizing from prior period development and positive non-recurring items last year, A&H operating income was up 4.9%. Total capital return to shareholders during the quarter was $650 million, including $430 million of share repurchases and $220 million in dividends. Our total share repurchases were $1.5 billion from the November 2013 announcement of our plan to year end 2014. I will turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you. Yes. So, I guess one question in overseas, what drove the margin improvement there in the fourth quarter, it sounded like pricing was down year-over-year, but you saw the best margin improvement of the year in the fourth quarter. I was trying to get an understanding of what happened there? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Sure. Most of that is really due to large loss activity outside of a loss-paving fourth quarter last year versus this year, so a more benign quarter for us this year. Michael Nannizzi : Got it, okay. And then as far as the crop business, I was trying to understand I guess there was a hedge in the third quarter, if I remember right, which provided some benefit given the decline in crop prices. And so can you comment on kind of what happened to that hedge this quarter? Phil Bancroft : We closed out the hedge in the third quarter. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. And was there a gain or loss associated with that closeout? Phil Bancroft : We disclosed the gain during the third quarter both in writing and on the call. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. So, you closed it out at that gain level? Phil Bancroft : Yes, we did. Michael Nannizzi : Okay, got it. Great. And then on the\u2026 Phil Bancroft : And the current accident year crop result without the hedge was 91.1% combined ratio. Michael Nannizzi : Current accident year at 91.1% without the hedge. Okay, great. Thank you for that. And then any impact from the volatility of the Swiss franc in January that we should be thinking about? Evan Greenberg : No, we have very little net asset in Swiss francs. Michael Nannizzi : Okay, great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : We will go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. First question for Evan, you mentioned about the volatility in global economies, especially in Europe as well as on the emerging markets, so given your global footprint, I just wonder what you see as challenges as well as opportunity for ACE? Evan Greenberg : Yes. As you well know, we are pretty rigorous planners. We have a plan for 2015 and our growth in the fourth quarter and our growth in the first quarter as far as we can see in local currencies continue as we expected to be. There is always some places that get a little worst because of economic activity some places that get better. And overall we are looking pretty good. And the pattern overseas has been that Europe and the UK have been relatively flat for sometime. Asia and Latin America have been going \u2013 growing overall at double-digit. And that pattern excluding some re-underwriting in Latin America in the fourth quarter continued and we see a continuing from what we can see. Kai Pan : It\u2019s great. Then if the currency stay the same, what\u2019s the impact your premium growth as well as profitability in 2015 and do you have any sort of foreign currency hedges? Evan Greenberg : First of all, we don\u2019t give guidance. So you won\u2019t get that. But you saw \u2013 you yourself see what the fourth quarter impact currencies had on revenue growth. So I think you see a theme that a stronger dollar obviously impacts revenue though far more modest and its quite modest impact to earnings. Kai Pan : And currency hedges? Evan Greenberg : We don\u2019t hedge on revenue. The only thing we hedge from time to time is cash movements, remittances. Kai Pan : Great. Well, thank you so much for the answer. Evan Greenberg : I am answering all of Phil Bancroft\u2019s questions. Kai Pan : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : Thank you and good morning. Evan on the reinsurance business clearly there has been a flurry of consolidation activity over the past two months and it will be helpful to get your updated perspective on those trends? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I think there were given \u2013 we have talked about this for a while. And I was asked this I think in the call that we had my view of given the softness in the reinsurance environment and the wholesale market particularly London and Bermuda, which to me are quite akin to the reinsurance market. The pressure that that places on smaller players and to me I imagined there would be more consolidation and we are seeing that. I think there is a drive to a bigger balance sheet that gives some more flexibility and it\u2019s more attractive to counterparty. And that creates more efficiency in terms of expense takeout. On the other hand it is doubling down on a bet, more concentration to reinsurance and London and Bermuda wholesale. Though it is a player then who swings a bigger stick and so maybe commands more attention and respect in the marketplace and I understand that. And the balance sheet flexibility does give them a chance to write out conditions more easily. On the other side of the coin, it means fewer players competing. And maybe it means some capital comes out of the business. And that hopefully that creates some stability and hopefully bigger player will equal more rational behavior. And that\u2019s what I end from a counterparty perspective. I like a bigger balance sheet for those that we are reinsuring to or doing business with. Jay Gelb : That makes sense. For ACE\u2019s owned reinsurance operation, can you talk a bit about given the, I think 5% contribution to ACE\u2019s overall premiums, how you feel ACE\u2019s reinsurance business fits this into the scheme of things these days? Evan Greenberg : Yes. ACE Global Re or Tempest is a very important of our company. It\u2019s a \u2013 it will wane and wax to some degree with market conditions as we maintain discipline, but a very good contributor to book value growth in the company. It\u2019s a reinsurance market. It is deep and big and dynamic and over time presents opportunity. There is a very big balance sheet behind ACE Global Re. It\u2019s the ACE balance sheet that is AA rated. There aren\u2019t a lot of AA rated re-insurers. And there aren\u2019t a lot with the balance sheet of our size participating in the business. And those continue to present advantages to Global Re. And then on the other side of the coin in the short-term, mergers and acquisitions of size relative to your own size can be distracting and you got to look a little more inward and that can present some tactical opportunity for Global Re and fewer players should mean maybe a little rationale competitive environment over time and that can only benefit us. Jay Gelb : Thank you for that. And then my final question probably for Phil, on the Fireman\u2019s Fund deal, I believe ACE assumed the legacy reserves attached to that, can you describe why that was the case and what that is made of and how big is it? Evan Greenberg : You are saying we are assuming the existing liabilities of the business that we are acquiring. Phil Bancroft : We are assuming the unearned premium\u2026. Evan Greenberg : Unearned premium and the liabilities. There are still liabilities associated with the owner. Jay Gelb : Right. I just, it was\u2026 Evan Greenberg : If you like it on a written basis going forward, why wouldn\u2019t you like the unearned? Jay Gelb : I understand the unearned premium, but does it include the legacy loss reserves as well? Phil Bancroft : In the existing portfolio, we are transferring to our books, but its personal lines to short tail. Jay Gelb : Just personal lines. Evan Greenberg : Yes, high net worth. Phil Bancroft : Yes, yes, pull over. Jay Gelb : Alright, thanks for clarifying. Operator : We will go next to [indiscernible] with JPMorgan. Evan Greenberg : Remember, it was a renewal rights deal really for the personal behind net worth personal lines business of the Fireman\u2019s Fund and in addition to the renewal rights we took the unearned portfolio of that business only. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is Sarah [indiscernible] from JPMorgan. On acquisitions, what\u2019s your pipeline for opportunities looking like and what lines or geographies are you most interested in growing through acquisitions? Evan Greenberg : Yes. We are not going to talk much about that. The pipeline \u2013 we always have a pipeline as we talk about fairly frequently. We always have a pipeline of opportunities. We pulled the trigger on a small minority of what we see. We look at things all over the world. And they are in areas where we are already endeavoring to grow organically and so acquisitions to complement our organic growth strategy. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And can you remind us how many points on the ROE, the drag from excess capital is and if you look out over the next 5 years, do you think you will have opportunities to fully deploy that? Evan Greenberg : As I just said 10 minutes ago, it\u2019s between 1.7 and 2 points on the ROE. And yes, I think as I look out over the next X number of years, we will have opportunity to deploy that. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, thanks. And then finally on the agriculture business, can you talk about your outlook for that business headed into 2015 given where commodity prices are currently? And there seems to be more sellers in that business, are you interested in growing there through acquisitions? Evan Greenberg : I won\u2019t comment on acquisitions looking forward that way or speculate about that, but we are very happy with our concentration and our market share and amount of exposure we therefore have in that business. If you looked at commodity prices today, they are below where they were last year in February and it\u2019s a February average that determines the pricing for contracts at that time. What it will be in February of this year who knows and particularly the volatility factor that\u2019s applied to average pricing in the month and what our exact spread will be by commodity product based on the forms we write. You don\u2019t know with certainty. But the theme would be that revenue would be down, what percentage, I don\u2019t know. Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thanks for the effort. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will go next to Vinay Misquith with Evercore ISI. Vinay Misquith : Hi, good morning. The first question is on the core growth in overseas general segment that was about 8.4% this quarter. And I believe there was an acquisition, so what\u2019s the core growth ex to acquisition this quarter? Phil Bancroft : That\u2019s Ita\u00fa about 6.5%. Vinay Misquith : Okay. And that seems to have slowed down a bit from the past few quarters, when you already give an outlook about the future, do you see things especially I mean in Brazil slowing down now versus the last few quarters? Phil Bancroft : No. Evan Greenberg : During the quarter, we also had \u2013 we did some re-underwriting of some business that we didn\u2019t like the looks at it. And that was in Latin America and that, and there was a one-time it\u2019s behind us. So that added about 2 point roughly impact as well. And I don\u2019t see a slowdown in our business in Brazil. And I will let John Keogh just comment a little bit about the fourth quarter pattern of growth and what we see as we go into the first quarter. John Keogh : Sure, and I will touch on it a bit earlier Vinay, which is, when you look at our fourth quarter, and when you look at our year, our growth pattern has been pretty much story of flat Europe and double-digit growth in Latin America and Asia. And that\u2019s I say double-digit growth that\u2019s with the exclusion of the contributions from the acquisitions we made in Asia and Latin America. As we think about our plans for the year ahead and look at the environment, we are looking more the same. One month into the year and right now things are really going according to plan. Vinay Misquith : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. The second question is on foreign exchange. So, this quarter probably about 5 point in the overseas general segment, given where the interest of fair exchange rates right now, so would that be sort of nearly double in 2015? Evan Greenberg : What we would say is from the end of the year \u201914 to now we have seen a deterioration that would impact our book value by about $170 million. Vinay Misquith : That\u2019s on the revenues, sorry. Phil Bancroft : He is talking revenue growth. What you saw as the FX impact in the fourth quarter, I am no genius at this, but I can imagine that same pattern year-on-year as you look at first quarter or second quarter if exchange rate stay the same we\u2019re going to see roughly the same impact. Vinay Misquith : Okay. Fair enough. And the last one if I may on the reinsurance\u2026 Phil Bancroft : That\u2019s on revenue. That\u2019s on revenue, net income. Vinay Misquith : Fair enough. Right and when you said that the revenues and expenses are fairly matched, correct? Phil Bancroft : Correct. Vinay Misquith : Okay. And\u2026 Phil Bancroft : Assets and liabilities. Vinay Misquith : Okay, great. And then on the reinsurance side, any update on your re-insurance purchases and the cost savings on that? Evan Greenberg : Well, I won\u2019t get specific by contractor, by area as you know, but you have been seeing general market commentary that both rates and terms and conditions for buyers if reinsurance have improved. And we are a major buyer in the market. We think we are pretty heads up buyers. And we have benefited from reinsurance market conditions both in terms and conditions, and in pricing. And that will flow through both to benefit our competitive profile in the marketplace and any savings will flow through to the bottom line. But I am not going to give you an exact number. Vinay Misquith : Okay. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : We will go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Charles Sebaski : Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Charles. Charles Sebaski : I was hoping to get some thoughts Evan on plans for the personal lines business with the Fireman\u2019s Fund acquisition, what\u2019s this \u2013 what\u2019s the growth potential for your guys in the U.S. in the high net worth business line? Evan Greenberg : Yeah, Charles, it is \u2013 when you add together ACE and the fund, we are \u2013 we were both very active players in the high net worth. We become clearly one of the top three players in that business. It expands our presence within distribution significantly. It enhances our underwriting insights with more data and it brings a lot of talent, a lot of very good people to the organization. So, it takes what we have been doing organically, which we built a good business and it takes two brands, and puts them together that way. There is a lot of growth potential in the business. And let me be clear ACE is a high net worth personal lines player. We have no desire and no illusions about trying to enter the traditional personal lines business in the U.S. that\u2019s not our play. The general market personal lines business, we bring nothing to the table for that. But the high net worth market is a different marketplace. The kinds of coverages they require is much broader than the general market. The kinds of limits they require is broader, the geographic area in which you service an individual customer is far broader. They are much more service oriented is the profit as the product proposition offering to a customer is it\u2019s a much more service intensive, it\u2019s less about price. They are much less price sensitive. The growth available is significant over time. And it\u2019s not simply by one high net worth writer taking the business from another, it\u2019s that a lot of high net worth potential clients reside on the books of traditional personal lines writers, who do a fabulous job serving their customers overall. But they don\u2019t really serve the proposition and needs of the high net worth customer. And the opportunity for us is in that cohort of business that exists with others. Charles Sebaski : Where do you \u2013 where is the dividing line in terms of actual net worth a policy size, for what constitutes a high net worth customer? Evan Greenberg : Are you wondering whether you qualify. Charles Sebaski : I don\u2019t qualify, but I am looking for something inspire to\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Charles, that varies by customer \u2013 by biogeography really, but it has to do with both buying behavior as well as value \u2013 total values of \u2013 to begin with your home. And well, I can give you a little more on that. I will tell you, I am going to ask one enjoyed to tell you a \u2013 a little about that and when you might be surprised maybe we well send you am app. Phil Bancroft : I think Evan is right, it really does vary combination, for us it\u2019s really a combination of the sum insured at the home. The lines of business that you purchased; are you also purchasing an excess liability and umbrella policy; do you have multiple homes with you; do you have fine art collections, etcetera. And ultimately, we would also look at the premium that that account really drives, but for us, really it\u2019s a combination of all those things. Charles Sebaski : Okay. I guess one other question on the personal lines and that should be more on the international in regard to some of the recent acquisitions in Latin America. How much opportunity is there for you guys in cross-selling life, A&H, personal lines on the international book, are those distribution points the same and do you see synergies there for that cross-sell? Evan Greenberg : Great question, love it. So, I am going to divide it into two pieces. So, I make it really simple and clear, agency derived business versus direct response marketed business. So, where we direct response market, the cross-selling opportunity where we do so much A&H direct response marketing to cross-sell specialty personal lines, a variety of products like householder\u2019s insurance, home contents and other simple products of personal lines. And simple life products like term life with what we are already doing in A&H direct response that opportunity is significant and we are doing that. On the agency front, where we write a lot of personal lines that might be automobile-related, the opportunity to cross-sell small group A&H to cross-sell SME, that is small business insurance through those same agents to the customers, the opportunity is significant. And so it varies by country and by distribution channel that we are pursuing, but that is a real focus of the organization has been and continues to be. Charles Sebaski : Thank you for the answers. Evan Greenberg : Thank you for that question. Operator : We will take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O\u2019Neill. Paul Newsome : Good morning and congratulations on the call. One quick question, did you contribute capital into the Brandywine operations or is that a reinsurance or accounting charge that we saw? Phil Bancroft : It\u2019s just an accounting charge. We have strengthened reserves by the $130 million that I mentioned, but there is no transfer of capital necessary for that. Paul Newsome : Okay. And then my more broader question, you have got in some of these foreign areas, interest rates that are getting to zero if not negative numbers in some rare cases, what does that do to your investment strategy in places where you basically get nil returns on your investments? What do you do in that situation? Phil Bancroft : Well, we haven\u2019t done anything in terms of taking additional risk. Our portfolios, primarily corporate bonds and government securities in those jurisdictions and we haven\u2019t made any plans as I say to change the structure or to take additional risk. We talk about our overall book yield continuing to drop as our portfolio rotates into those lower yields, but we have been doing a pretty good job of keeping the portfolio turn over to a minimum and keeping our book yields fairly constant. Evan Greenberg : Let me add to that, first of all, if you are saying zero rates, you are thinking of Europe. And if you think of the rest of our portfolio and other places, interest rates have actually gone up in most jurisdictions or a lot of them. So, it bounces around between the two. Secondly, as Phil was saying in Europe and in the zero rate we are more heavily corporate than government-related securities and their high-grade corporates and rates, spreads have widened. Paul Newsome : So, I guess the question I am trying to get to is there anything danger that you end up in situation where you can\u2019t match the assets and liabilities of them in the local currencies to keep yourself? Evan Greenberg : No, because we don\u2019t discount. So, when you talk about matching that would be a duration liquidity question would hardly be that, oh, so in Europe you must be discounting have to earn a certain rate on the discount and can you earn that, we don\u2019t discount our property casualty loss reserves. Phil Bancroft : And in most jurisdictions, we have to keep our assets and liabilities in currency and that will require capital. So, there is really, if you are thinking we might invest euro liabilities somewhere in some other currency that wouldn\u2019t happen. Evan Greenberg : We would never do that. Paul Newsome : Terrific. Thank you very much. Operator : We will go next to Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Just a couple of questions here on Ita\u00fa, one is there any seasonality on a quarterly basis to the premium as it comes in? And then the second part of that is Ita\u00fa sees away a lot of its premium, I am wondering if any of those reinsurance contracts have been restructured yet or if so would you anticipate those being restructured or at least declined in amount of sessions kind of come in the first quarter of \u201815? Evan Greenberg : The \u2013 I am sorry, I got to tell you, it\u2019s Ita\u00fa. Brian Meredith : Ita\u00fa, sorry. Evan Greenberg : But it\u2019s Ita\u00fa. There is some seasonality to the flow of the business, not tremendous, though the net \u2013 and that would be on the gross premiums, the net premiums vary by class. And so there may have been a little more seasonality to how they retained business. You are correct, substantial premium sessions they gross line I mean awful lot. That will continue, but there is obviously opportunities \u2013 real opportunities raised to recapture business that has been ceded and retained at net and so you will see \u2013 that, that will occur over a period of time. Brian Meredith : Okay, great. And then just a second question, I am just curious for John Keogh, terms and conditions on the primary insurance, I know reinsurance has been loosening up, are we seeing any trends in terms and conditions loosening up and it\u2019s often a way that companies try to get more competitive is through terms and conditions? John Keogh : I mean, certainly Brian in the reinsurance \u2013 as a buyer of reinsurance, we have seen that from our reinsurers, which has been to our benefit in terms of reinsurance buys over the past 12 months. On the primary side you have looking and talking to our line executives around our January renewal business. Nothing, there is some anecdotal here and there on terms and conditions. You are seeing in Europe some of the classic soft market behavior in D&O where you are getting excess carriers willing to drop down and be primary if the primary carrier doesn\u2019t cover the claim. You are seeing free reinstatements on D&O, but that\u2019s really in Europe. Otherwise, everyone has a got story here and there, but in general I think terms and conditions in the primary insurance space right now used internationally are pretty stable. John Lupica : Yes, Brian, it\u2019s John Lupica. I would concur for the North American environment it\u2019s virtually identical to it, John has just described. Terms are basically holding what I would add to that on the property side, we are seeing requests for smaller CAT deductibles occasionally. We are seeing requests for bigger limits. Nothing unusual based on the market that we are going into we have seen it before. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thank you. Good morning. I hate to nitpick, I am just curious about the core loss ratio increase in the North American P&C segment, that\u2019s only sort of soft spot that we saw in the quarter? Evan Greenberg : Sure, John Lupica? John Lupica : Yes. Thanks. So really the loss ratio Meyer was two things going on. We had a one-time benefit last year from a reserve release. And we also had another one-time adjustment that was made. When you account for those\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Due to benefit last year also. John Lupica : Benefit, thank you. When you account for those two, our current accident year loss ratio was essentially flat. We did have a bit of large loss activity, a bit more this year than last year, but I wouldn\u2019t consider that significant. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And Evan you started \u2013 you said that Asia is the most competitive geographic region in P&C, is there a difference in pricing trends between the established and the emerging insurance markets? Evan Greenberg : Yes, there is. John Keogh is mouthing something at me. I mean I don\u2019t know if he is saying, so I am going to let him talk first. John Keogh : No, I think the thing I do there is on \u2013 is retail versus wholesale. I think if you get out into Asia and certainly in London the wholesale markets where brokers are bringing business around the region whether it\u2019s into London or into Singapore that market is much, much more competitive in our observations than the mark you see on the ground as a retail underwriter in the local market. So I would contrast the wholesale and retail. Evan Greenberg : The other \u2013 and maybe to take it a step further Australia, New Zealand has a different competitive complexion than Southeast Asia and North Asia and it does vary by country. The wholesale business John is referring to is typically the large commercial risk in Asia that finds its way in. The middle market, upper middle market, small commercial within each country in emerging Asia is much more stable than the balance of that. Meyer Shields : Okay. Evan Greenberg : And when I referred to competitive price conditions, I was referring really to the larger corporate business. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Yes, thank you. A couple of questions. First is maybe for Phil, can you talk about the alternative investment return in the quarter and maybe how much it was above what you would expect to be normal? And then secondly if maybe Evan or someone else could talk about the claims environment and what you are seeing from a claims inflation standpoint does not seem to be terribly onerous or a big change, but I want to get a sense of what you are seeing out there? Phil Bancroft : I think with respect to the alternatives, they were probably about $10 million more than we expected. And then I would add to that the fund, the call activity on our bond portfolio that added another $10 million. So, in addition to that, our portfolio yield was a little bit higher than we expected. So, all of that together, I gave you last quarter a run-rate of $550 million and you can see we came in at $577 million, but that\u2019s what comprised the difference. Jay Cohen : Got it. Phil Bancroft : The claims activity, Jay, it\u2019s reasonably well behaved. It overall from inflation perspective, I see it as reasonably tame either within or below trend as we would imagine it to be. On the other side of the coin, depending on the market, there is certain competitive market behavior that drives down premium rate below what loss cost is and those are the areas that you got to pay attention to and take action. And there is of course \u2013 there is more of that today than there was a year ago and there is more of that a year ago than there was 2 years ago. I mean, that\u2019s just natural. Jay Cohen : Got it, thank you. Phil Bancroft : You got to be so vigilant and on top of portfolio management, line by line, territory by territory and just don\u2019t take your eye off of it. Jay Cohen : Got it. Thanks. Operator : We will go next to Mark Dwelle with RBC Capital Markets. Mark Dwelle : Yes, good morning. Thank you. One question, you had mentioned the impact from FX was primarily dollar strengthening, which makes perfect sense, which \u2013 from a capital standpoint, which currency payers are you the most sensitive to? Evan Greenberg : The largest impacts came from the real in Brazil, the peso, British pound, Australian dollar, the yen and the euro, they were really the top\u2026 Phil Bancroft : And he just gave it you backwards. The biggest really is euro, so we had biggest balance sheet. Evan Greenberg : Biggest balance sheet, but not as big an impact on the quarter, I was reading it impact order whichever way, but anyway those are the currencies that you would focus on to see where we stand. Mark Dwelle : Okay, that was my main question. Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Scott Frost with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Scott Frost : Thanks. In terms of capital management, we have seen some activity to retire or tender higher coupon debt and preferred issues. Is that a consideration for you or where does that fit in your capital management plan? Evan Greenberg : No, we don\u2019t have plans to do that. We find with the public debt structures that we have the prepayment penalties are so severe that it doesn\u2019t make sense for us. What we have been doing though is pre-funding debt that is maturing. So, we pre-fund the two issues so far that will mature in later this year actually and we will consider that going forward. Scott Frost : Okay, great. Thanks. Operator : We will take our final question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny Investments. Ian Gutterman : Hi, good morning Evan. I guess, my first question is on accident year margins, with pricing continued to moderate slightly, it seems in most of your \u2013 at least in most of your commercial lines, pricing is probably below where you pick loss cost trend, is there enough opportunities still in underwriting and mix and so forth to offset that or is it reasonable to think margins are more likely to receive then stay stable or expand from here? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Ian, the loss environment has been pretty benign. Ian Gutterman : Right. Evan Greenberg : Start with that. Number two, trend continues. So, when I think of the benign loss environment, I think of more short tail lines, but when I think of the casualty business, trend continues whether it\u2019s running better than you imagine, it doesn\u2019t mean its zero, there is \u2013 remains a healthy trend. So \u2013 and on the other side of the coin, there is always portfolio management opportunities and changing mix of lines of business that we accelerate, where we see good margins. So, you get all of that. But when I roll it altogether, I have said it before, you expect \u2013 it\u2019s natural to expect, look at the combined ratios that we are running. They are such world class. They are low. So, I imagine the accident year margin, the accident year combined ratios to rise over time. Ian Gutterman : Good. Got it. And is it fair to say that the lower loss trend we have seen that\u2019s emerging as reserve releases as opposed to that you are lowering your pick or have you been changing your loss trend pick as a result of the evidence you have seen over the last two years? Evan Greenberg : No, we really haven\u2019t changed our loss trend pick. I realized you could do that, but I think it\u2019s a prudent way to run a company. We write a lot of a longer tail business and even your medium, shorter tail businesses 3 to 7 years. Good news always comes early, bad news comes late, number one. Number two, people like to describe the business of underwriting with some kind of precision like it is \u2013 like you have such perfect information that you can price and you can select risk with precision and that\u2019s just not the case. And I think the guys who do better are the ones who recognize that. And so your best to remain with a more conservative, what somebody might deem a more conservative trend factor. I think it just safeguards the balance sheet. And what\u2019s the price of that? A little opportunity cost of some business in the marketplace, I am not going to worry about that. Ian Gutterman : Got it. I just want to make sure nothing changed. And then just my final question is on the energy, I guess, there could be a number of things on energy, but maybe I just focus on one, which is the investment side. It looks like you have about $2 billion in energy investments and maybe 800 is BBB and 900 is below investment grade. Can you just give a little color on what we should know about that, I guess when you hear all these stories about high-yield energy bonds that people concerned about? How much of a worry is that for you? Phil Bancroft : So, our investment portfolio is bonds, that\u2019s where the \u2013 that\u2019s where our exposure is. And it\u2019s about 5% of the portfolio, it\u2019s 3% and you see the two pieces that you are looking at, we have a third piece in the non-dollar portfolio that just isn\u2019t split by sector. So, it\u2019s about $3 billion in total. The average credit rating is BBB. It\u2019s well-diversified, there is 250 issuers, and the top holdings are in the largest integrated companies that are all investment grade. So, we have studied it. We are very comfortable with the concentration and the entire portfolio is trading over par right now. So, we are comfortable with the valuation. Ian Gutterman : Got it, got it. So, no big overweight on Canadian oilsands or anything like that? Phil Bancroft : No. Ian Gutterman : Okay, good, just making sure. Alright, thank you guys. Good luck. Helen Wilson : Alright. Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Helen Wilson : Thank you, and welcome to the ACE Limited March 31, 2015 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions including foreign exchange and integration of acquisitions, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings as well as our earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our Web site, for more information on factors that could affect these matters. This call is being webcast live and the webcast replay will be available for one month. All remarks made during the call are current at the time of the call and will not be updated to reflect subsequent material developments. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. ACE had a reasonably good start to the year with earnings per share essentially flat with the prior year. It was a difficult quarter for U.S. dollar-based multinationals. Foreign exchange impacted our revenue, earnings and book value growth in the quarter. And beyond that, we also overcame a couple of favorable items that benefited first quarter '14. After-tax operating income for the quarter was 745 million or $2.25 per share. We overcame about $0.18 of headwinds, $0.06 from FX, $0.12 from the items that benefited '14 and didn\u2019t repeat. We produced an operating return on equity of nearly 11%. Book value per share growth was up 1% in the quarter and stands at $90.81. Underlying book value per share grew 2.4%. If the dollar does not strengthen in any material way from here, we don\u2019t expect any further foreign exchange impact to book value. Our P&C combined ratio was 88.4% in the quarter, down about a half a point from prior year with total underwriting income up over 3% pre-tax. It\u2019s worth noting simply for underlying trend purposes that the positive items in '14 that I mentioned benefited the global P&C current accident year combined ratio in that year by half a point. Remember, global P&C excludes agriculture. Adjusting for those items, the global P&C current accident year combined ratio for the first quarter was essentially flat year-on-year. Phil will have more to say about the one-time items. We benefited this quarter from the '14 crop year runoff by 33 million bringing the '14 year ultimate result to an 86.5 combined ratio, a very good year. In essence, the positive crop insurance development versus last year\u2019s first quarter offset the impact of foreign exchange and the positive items in '14 to generate flat earnings per share year-on-year. We produced 551 million in investment income in the quarter. This too is a good result given record low interest rates and speaks to our strong cash flow. Phil will provide more detail on our investment portfolio and results. On a constant dollar basis, total premiums grew 2% net premiums. And excluding Agriculture, global P&C net premiums were up 5%. Foreign exchange impacted premium revenue results in the quarter by five points. In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop, grew 1%. In our large commercial business, ACE USA, net premiums declined about 2.5 due to a particularly large account booked in '14 that we chose not to renew this year. We grew over 30% in ACE Commercial Risk Services, which serves small to mid-market clients and 6% in ACE Westchester E&S, as all lines except property grew. Net premiums for our Agriculture business were down over 50% in the quarter, due in large part to the premium-sharing formula with the U.S. government. Because the '13 crop year was a difficult loss year, we received more premiums from the government as part of the profit and loss true-up in the first quarter of '14 than this year. We don\u2019t expect nearly that rate of premium declines for the remainder of the year. In ACE International where the impact of foreign exchange was most pronounced, P&C net premiums were up over 2% on a reported basis but 13% in constant dollars. Asia and Latin America had strong growth with net premiums up 14% and 50%, respectively, while premiums in Europe were up 1%. In our London market-based D&S business, premiums were up about 1.5%, again in constant dollar. There were some softness as expected in the quarter in our global A&H insurance business where net premiums grew about 3.5% globally in constant currency. Premiums for combined insurance were up 4% in our core North America business with new sales continuing to grow at a double-digit pace. We expect on a constant dollar basis, total A&H growth to accelerate each quarter as the year goes along. Net premiums written for global personal lines were up about 19%, again in constant dollars. As you saw on April 1, we closed our acquisition of the U.S. high net worth personal lines business, the Fireman's Fund and are busy integrating that business with ACE Private Risk Services, which is now one of the largest high net worth personal lines insurers in the United States. Our Asia-focused international life insurance business had a good quarter with net premiums and deposit growth of over 18% in constant currency. And finally, due to market conditions, net premiums declined 9% in our global reinsurance business. Given the impact of foreign exchange and recent acquisitions, it may be difficult for those who invest in or follow us to project our growth. Therefore, I want to provide a little assistance. From what we know now, net premium revenue growth for the full year '15 will be up mid-single digits on a published basis, which means almost 10% on a currency neutral basis. We will benefit from our growth initiatives through organic and acquisition-oriented, particularly in the U.S., Latin America and Asia. I want to now say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market condition. The underwriting environment grew modestly more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally. In general, the underlying pattern we see of large account business is more competitive than midsized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail and property more so than casualty related. In the U.S., rates for general and specialty casualty related classes were up 2%, while property rate prices declined 7%. Taking our U.S. commercial P&C business by its components and starting with our large and upper middle market retail business, the ACE USA pricing trend was pretty stable with general and specialty casualty related pricing up 2% in the quarter and varying by line. For example, large account risk management related casualty pricing was up 2.1, management and professional liability pricing was up 3.2, excess casualty was up 2.1 and foreign casualty pricing was up 1.3. Property related pricing continued to decrease at a steady pace, down 5.2%. To maintain these price levels requires discipline. For our U.S. retail business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium, was 93% in the quarter and by policy count, it was 83%. The impact from change of exposure added about 2.5 points to premium. Turning to our U.S. E&S business, casualty rates were up 1.4% in the quarter. Professional line rates were up 3.7 while property was down about 8%. Internationally, while commercial P&C insurance market conditions were again modestly more competitive, the pricing for the business we wrote was pretty stable overall. Rates were down 1% in the quarter. Asia was the most competitive region with rates down 4%, whereas pricing in Latin America and the continent was flat and UK was down 1%. For international in total, casualty rates in the quarter were down 1, property was flat and financial line rates were down 2. In our London market E&S business, rates were down 3% in the quarter. We are ameliorating the impact of pricing on our combined ratio through a combination of mix shift, targeting classes with better margin, portfolio management that informs underwriting actions including tighter individual risk selection and pricing actions in more stressed areas, as well as better marketing and new product innovation. As you know, personal lines, small commercial and A&H are approaching 40% of our company net premium. For these businesses, rates were flat to up mid-single digit depending on portfolio and territory. In the U.S., small commercial and personal lines achieved rate, including exposure growth, of 5% to 6% and internationally 1% to 2% while group A&H pricing was flat. John Lupica and Juan Andrade can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. In summary, we produced good results this quarter despite foreign exchange and remain confident in our ability to overcome these challenges as the year progresses. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil and then will be back to take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Book value per share grew 1% and tangible book value per share grew 1.8% in the quarter. Both were impacted by foreign exchange losses of 441 million, 268 million of which impacted tangible net assets. As a reminder, these losses represent a point in time mark-to-market valuation adjustment and do not affect the capital position of our foreign operating units. We match our assets and liabilities in each jurisdiction and we keep our required capital in local currencies. If and when the dollar weakens, the book value impact would be positive. Excluding unfavorable foreign currency movements, book value per share increased 2.4% and tangible book value per share increased 3%. We had a very strong operating cash flow of 1.75 billion for the quarter that benefited our investment income and contributed to the growth in our cash and invested assets, which are now 65 billion. Investment income of 551 million was about what we expected and was impacted negatively by 7 million of foreign exchange when compared with the prior year. Our strong cash flow will continue to benefit our estimated quarterly investment income run rate of approximately 550 million even with current new money rates of 2.6% versus our current book yield of 3.6%. The estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability and portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. During the quarter, we had pre-tax realized and unrealized gains of 455 million relating to the investment portfolio and a mark-to-market loss on our VA reinsurance portfolio of 57 million. Both of these were primarily due to decreasing interest rates. Our net loss reserves were up 247 million for the quarter or 1% after adjusting for foreign exchange and crop activity. The paid to incurred ratio was 109% for the quarter or 89% on a normalized basis, which takes into account prior period reserved release activity and crop loss payment activity. In the quarter, we had net positive prior period development of 83 million pre-tax principally from short tail lines. Cat losses were 40 million after-tax in the quarter primarily from a number of U.S. weather events. Evan mentioned that there are a number of favorable items that benefited last year and impact the year-on-year comparison of our operating earnings per share. North American P&C underwriting income pre-tax benefited by 25 million, 18 million after-tax from both lower excess of loss premiums ceded under our 2014 catastrophe reinsurance program and a favorable settlement related to prior year\u2019s state premium assessments. In addition, life underwriting benefited last year from a reserve release of 6 million both before and after tax. Also, the tax rate was lower in 2014 because prior period development emerged in lower tax jurisdictions. This increased our operating income in 2014 by 16 million for global P&C coming from North America. The total after-tax impact of these items was $40 million or $0.12 per share. When comparing year-on-year results for global P&C, note that last year\u2019s positive prior period development of 100 million included 42 million of positive prior period development from the resolution of a large 2003 claim in our North American P&C segment. Excluding this claim, prior period development last year would be 58 million compared to this year\u2019s 50 million. Also, prior period development in our Agriculture segment was negative 38 million last year versus positive development of 33 million this quarter. Total capital returned to shareholders during the quarter was $560 million including $340 million of share repurchases and $220 million in dividends. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take the first question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you. I have one question, I guess, about capital deployment. It looks like you know you\u2019ve stepped up pretty consistently and are buying back 350 million to 400 million a quarter, deploying about 70% of earnings. Should we be thinking about that approaching 100% of earnings at some point or do you expect that you still want to keep some capital there for M&A? Not that you don\u2019t have plenty to do that anyway, but how should we be thinking about your propensity to potentially lift that back up to 100% of earnings? Evan Greenberg : I think the way you should be thinking about it, Michael, is not to speculate. We gave some guidance in essence by our intention of share repurchases for the year and that is there\u2019s an authorization to repurchase up to 1.5 billion, but that was our stated intention, that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing. Our dividend \u2013 you see what our dividend is, so in total it shows that we\u2019re returning \u2013 our intention is to return roughly this year in that range, that 70% range. And as things go along, as we see the environment, assess the environment versus our strategy and add both together speaking to our needs for capital, we\u2019ll make future decisions and you\u2019ll know about those. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. And then one question, I guess, Phil, on the debt that you guys issued. I\u2019m guessing you mentioned prefunding some debt that\u2019s coming later this year. Should we assume that the 450 in May and the 700 or so in November that you\u2019ll just pay those off and not reissue any debt at that point? I\u2019m just trying to think about -- Phil Bancroft : Yes, that is our plan. Michael Nannizzi : Great. And then last question just on crop, it sounds like there should be no kind of catch-up impact in the second quarter from what happened here that this was just related to the settlement of a prior crop year. Is there anything other \u2013 whatever we were thinking about for the rest of the year on crop, it sounds like that shouldn\u2019t change based on what we saw in the first quarter, is that fair? Phil Bancroft : That is very fair. The first quarter is a \u2013 first of all is a small percentage of the total premium. Michael Nannizzi : Right. Phil Bancroft : And so you get that. You have this messiness depending on your profit and loss in the prior year, you have the true-up with the government. And also last year, the winter wheat season, which is a 13, 14 season, this year is the 14, 15-year season, but winter wheat across these years. We booked more the winter wheat premium last year in the 13 fourth quarter and this year we booked more in the first quarter of \u2013 and this year more of it was in the fourth quarter. So, you have the timing difference. And as we go forward, the way our accounting works, we should not have that. We should be consistent with how we did it this year. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Perfect. And then just one bigger picture question on cyber. As a topic and as an area of focus for ACE, is that an area that you see as an opportunity to have a pretty substantial impact on kind of the way that that product and vertical evolves or is it still a little too early to start really setting up a big presence there as liability start to come into focus? Thank you. Evan Greenberg : That\u2019s a good question. Look, in order for insurance to remain relevant in society, you can\u2019t simply hold onto the past. Perils are emerging as society matures and develops from science, regulation, legal, all kinds of areas that impact a globalization. As economy digitizes, as society digitizes, there are more exposures that are going to emerge and cyber risk security is one of them. And this is something that the industry to be relevant has to come to grips with and meet the needs of these exposures for clients. ACE is one of the major insurers of cyber insurance as it is today. It\u2019s a nascent area, it\u2019s small and most of the product demand is in the United States. It\u2019s not in other countries yet. We keep probing it for other places that there would be more demand for the risk, more demand for insurance for the risk. And we\u2019re committed to the line. We see lots of opportunity for it, but it\u2019s still small. Overall, the premiums globally are about $1.5 billion to $2 billion and we estimate our market share at 8% or 9% of that. So we\u2019re quite active. We\u2019re mindful of the risk environment around it and so it\u2019s kind of category of client and size of client related. You got to be mindful of that. You got to get paid properly for the risk. But with all that said, this is an area of growth for ACE. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you, Evan. Operator : The next question is from Cliff Gallant with Nomura. Cliff Gallant : Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. The question I had was just in regard to ABR Re and your investment in that and I was wondering if \u2013 we\u2019re now at a point where you can comment on what you think the opportunity might be there? Evan Greenberg : Well, the opportunity, it doesn\u2019t do third-party business. You\u2019ve seen all the material on it that\u2019s out there and it is in essence the only reinsurance business it will be accepting is ACE\u2019s business. Cliff Gallant : Will that change over time or what is the long-term plan? Evan Greenberg : No, that\u2019s not our intention. The Board of the company, we own 10% or 11% of it and we\u2019re one Board member. The Board and the management of the company may decide differently in the future but from everything I can see right now in the next number of years, that will not be the case. Cliff Gallant : Okay. Thank you, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Good morning. So I guess my first question, I guess just drilling down into the life results a little bit. Obviously 66 million reported this quarter. That compares to 76 million in the fourth. I think the press release referenced the runoff of the VA reinsurance markets as contributing to that. I guess just breaking it down a little further, how much of that sequential decline was related to reinsurance maybe versus something else in international life or U.S. A&H? Phil Bancroft : As we said, there was a $6 million item reserve release in the fourth quarter of last year. We also had the runoff of the VA and we also have had FX and the three of those together combined to be the impact of the change. Ryan Tunis : Okay, understood. And then also on the supplement, I guess you guys disclosed personal A&H operating earnings and I\u2019m guessing that\u2019s mostly U.S. combined. But this quarter, I think there was 113 million that looked in line with the year ago but it was kind of down from what looks to be kind of a low 120s run rate over the past few quarters. I\u2019m just wondering what\u2019s kind of going on there? Is there seasonality around that? Anything you can add would be helpful. Evan Greenberg : We\u2019re sitting here a little perplexed by your question and I\u2019m not sure exactly what you\u2019re focusing on. But I\u2019ll tell you what, how about if we take that offline and Phil \u2013 we don\u2019t see a sequential weakness, but Phil and Helen will take it offline with you. Ryan Tunis : No problem. I guess just one for Evan. Your comments on the smaller end of the market I think remaining somewhat less competitive than the larger and I guess we saw that this quarter, another strong growth quarter in commercial risk services. I think you said, up 30% there. I guess over the past few quarters, how has the competitive environment been evolving? Growth looks like it continues to remain robust. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes. First of all, it benefits from its size. It\u2019s not a huge business. It\u2019s in the hundreds of millions of dollars is a business for us not in the billions. It is specialty oriented more than traditional package business. In the traditional package area we\u2019re really focused only in the micro market, and that is very small companies where we see good opportunity. We\u2019ve invested more and more in this space in terms of product, in terms of I should say begin with talent. We have really in the last two years beefed up the talent in that area though we\u2019ve been investing in it with people for five or six years. And we\u2019ve expanded product significantly over the last 18 months and we\u2019ve expanded cohort of customer focus in addition to midmarket on the very smaller end of midmarket, we went right down at the micro. So those efforts \u2013 that leads to distribution and the technology we\u2019ve put in place to help facilitate that. So a lot of investment and we\u2019re benefiting from the result of that. I don\u2019t expect these kinds of growth rates will continue forever but we\u2019re getting \u2013 they are in line with our plans and they\u2019re not a surprise to us. Did I answer your question, Ryan? Ryan Tunis : I think you did, Evan. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Jay. Jay Gelb : Good morning. I just want to touch base on a couple of items. Phil, I believe you mentioned that even if the dollar doesn\u2019t strengthen further, there should be no further impact on book value from foreign exchange. Is that the same case for earnings per share as well? Phil Bancroft : No, not on a comparative basis. So the run rate you saw in this quarter might get mildly worse in the second and third quarter, just mildly. It\u2019s a reasonable run rate to use and in the fourth quarter should better, because we\u2019ve had the deterioration in the fourth quarter. I mean, we\u2019ve already experienced the deterioration in last year\u2019s fourth quarter. Jay Gelb : 4Q better meaning less of a drag than 2Q and 3Q? Phil Bancroft : Yes. Jay Gelb : Okay. Phil Bancroft : 2Q and 3Q will be right in \u2013 they\u2019re right in the range of first Q. Jay Gelb : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks. On the Agriculture business, Evan I know you mentioned that directionally premiums could be lower for the rest of the year not as much of a decline as in the first quarter. I believe Agriculture premiums for all of 2014 for net written premiums were 1.6 billion. Do you have a sense where that may shake out for the full year '15? Evan Greenberg : I think you should imagine that commodity prices are going to have a low double-digit impact; 10%, 11% range. Jay Gelb : For the full year? Evan Greenberg : Correct. Jay Gelb : And then we would take into account volume as well? Evan Greenberg : Yes, but I just took that into account to give you the impact on premium. Jay Gelb : Perfect. Thank you. The final question I had is given the severe winter weather in 1Q particularly in the northeast, I was just wondering if that was a factor at all in ACE\u2019s result and also noting that your catastrophe impact for 1Q was a lot lower than what we saw, for example, out of chub, which also has the high net worth business. Just want to get your perspective there. Evan Greenberg : Look, last year we had cat losses were a little bit elevated and this quarter, there were right in line roughly with that, a bit elevated but nothing terrible. Jay Gelb : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Good morning. Thank you for taking my call. First question on the \u2013 thanks for the color on the total premium growth for the addition of the acquisitions. Do you also see any sort of combined ratio impact from these acquisitions? Evan Greenberg : Combined ratio impact from these acquisitions, sure. Every acquisition is \u2013 Kai, every acquisition is going to have \u2013 if it has anything of size in terms of premium, it\u2019s going to produce a certain run rate of its business, it\u2019s going to have a combined ratio, it\u2019s going to mix into our total. So mathematically, you get that. If you\u2019re looking for how much it will be, well, buddy, that\u2019s another question and I\u2019m not going there. Kai Pan : But directionally, are those two acquisitions Ita\u00fa and Fireman's Fund, do they have the higher combined or lower combined ratio relative to your existing book? Evan Greenberg : In total, they will be beneficial. Kai Pan : Okay. Thanks. And then a second question, if you step back, Evan, if you look at the past three years, you produced operating ROE around 10% to 11% while P&C pricing was generally right and the cat losses have been relatively benign. So going forward, if you squeeze in the P&C pricing is decelerating, do you think the ROE going forward will decline or there are any other drivers you can pull to maintain or even improve that ROE? Evan Greenberg : Kai, you know and I said this earlier in the commentary, it\u2019s about more than placing. We are quite diversified by product area. A lot of our business is not commercial P&C and our commercial P&C is spread very well across the globe and spread around a lot of products. And our data analytics and our portfolio management and capabilities continue to improve and so our risk selection and ability to focus in areas where we see better margins with the current rate levels and our ability to shift mix that way improves. And then we have acquisitions that just are another way of contributing to that in terms of mix be it product or geography that help ameliorate movements in price. And so I think we have a lot of handles to pull and we\u2019re pulling all that we can that help to ameliorate the impact of pricing. Kai Pan : Okay, that\u2019s great. Lastly, if I may, is on the \u2013 you\u2019ve seen the recent wave in the merger acquisition in the reinsurance space. Do you think the current environment is also right for more opportunities in the industry conservation on the primary side and where ACE sit in that space? Do you see more opportunities for future acquisitions? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Well, there\u2019s a constant flow of deals. We\u2019ve said before many [Technical Difficulty] 100 deals a year globally, pull the trigger very selectively. It\u2019s got to meet our strategy and meet our standards and that kind of flow activity continues. It\u2019s driven by many things. It\u2019s driven by the P&C cycle on one hand, it\u2019s driven by economic conditions in various territories, it\u2019s driven by owner strategies of where they \u2013 what kinds of businesses they want to be in, in the future. So there are many things that drive the motivation. Of course, when you have just as you look narrowly at the P&C industry whenever you have pricing pressures and growth pressures and now you got low interest rate pressures, so earnings pressures and growth pressures, that will drive many who don\u2019t have a view of earnability [ph] to move beyond that. It has them assess the opportunities for merger acquisitions. And so you typically will see it at this kind of point in cycle and see it pick up. It wouldn\u2019t surprise me. Kai Pan : Thank you so much. Operator : The next question is from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Just a first one, is it possible to give us some color on the impact of Ita\u00fa acquisition in the overseas segment? And particularly, a little surprised that your actually premium retentions went up in the quarter given that was kind of part of the consolidated results now as well as admin expenses actually going up given the favorable impact of FX on expenses? Evan Greenberg : Yes. So Brian, what\u2019s the question? Brian Meredith : The question is what\u2019s the -- Evan Greenberg : Yes, I\u2019ll try to just break it down. Brian Meredith : Sorry, it\u2019s a long convoluted one. So the impact is why are retentions up in the overseas \u2013 premium retention up in overseas on a year-over-year basis with Ita\u00fa coming in, did that have much of an impact on it? Evan Greenberg : Yes, so on premium retention, no, that\u2019s a mix of business question. There wasn\u2019t a change of reinsurance and yes, Ita\u00fa came in but it\u2019s a big organization and there were growth in a lot of other areas. You saw personal lines growth, A&H growth and there is a lot of other small commercial in Asia and other places. So the mix of \u2013 that will bring it down. That\u2019s why you shouldn\u2019t simply imagine Ita\u00fa. And then also remember, however Ita\u00fa reinsured in the past that was based somewhat on their own net retention appetite. Now they have a different appetite. Brian Meredith : Okay. And then also just quickly, Petrobras, obviously a lot going on down there with respect to Petrobras. What\u2019s ACE\u2019s exposure to what\u2019s going on down in Brazil in Petrobras? Evan Greenberg : I was trying to get John Keogh to answer it and tell you that we\u2019re not going to comment on [indiscernible] line, our exposure but he doesn\u2019t want to. Brian, we\u2019re not going to comment on an individual situation. We\u2019re mindful of Petrobras\u2019 circumstances and obviously the impact on both growth and the construction business as well as surety exposures both their own and generally within the construction industry, and we\u2019re not \u2013 while we\u2019re alert we\u2019re not concerned. Brian Meredith : Okay. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Thomas Mitchell with Miller Tabak. Thomas Mitchell : I was wondering if you might have sort of an equivalent of year-over-year premium growth on what might be called the same-store basis that is without acquisitions. Evan Greenberg : Yes, we\u2019re not breaking that out right here. As you know our policy, once something becomes a part of the company, fundamentally we just don\u2019t start breaking down all the parts and pieces of each part of the company. And so these fold in and there you go. Thomas Mitchell : I wasn\u2019t asking about the individual pieces, I was just wondering about the impact of acquisitions on the overall total. Evan Greenberg : There are acquisitions that we\u2019ve made over the last 8 or 9 or 10 years and so are you asking me pull all those out. Thomas Mitchell : That would be very nice. Evan Greenberg : We got you, buddy. That\u2019s like I don\u2019t see the value. I know you will. Likely you\u2019re a data junkie, but we\u2019re not pulling those out. Thomas Mitchell : Okay. Separately, what either has happened or hasn\u2019t happened with the Terrorism Insurance Act? Evan Greenberg : Well, we have renewed and therefore the market is stable and it\u2019s kind of business as usual because the TRIA stock is in place, Tom. Thomas Mitchell : Okay. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Jay. Jay Cohen : Good morning. The question is on ABR Re. Will ACE be ceding additional business to ABR Re or you simply transfer stuff you have ceding to others now and move it into ABR Re? Evan Greenberg : The latter is more correct, is correct. ABR Re will simply be a following participant on our treaties \u2013 our existing pool of treaties and the intention is, is they will take a share across the board. And they will not be a leading market. We\u2019re going to maintain the discipline of the third-party reinsurers establishing terms. The marketplace establishes terms for reinsurance and ABR Re will be a capacity player. Jay Cohen : Got it. And do you pay a brokerage commission when you cede to ABR Re? Evan Greenberg : Well, we never pay a brokerage commission. The reinsurer pays a brokerage commission by the way. Jay Cohen : Got it. Is there any economic benefit for the market to having ABR there? Evan Greenberg : Is there any economic benefit to the market, not that I know of. Jay Cohen : Okay. Evan Greenberg : You mean the market generally outside of ACE, is there a benefit to them that ABR Re is there. I see a benefit to ACE\u2019s investors and I see a benefit to the investors in ABR Re and I see a benefit to ACE. I don\u2019t see a benefit to the general market. We did not create it with that in mind. Jay Cohen : Got it. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : The next question is from Charles Sebaski with Bank of Montreal. Charles Sebaski : Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Charles Sebaski : First question is on the ACE 4D that there was a press release that went out yesterday on the data analytics and kind of how that will be incorporated in your business and how that\u2019s different from how you have been doing business up until this new system or new offering on reselection has gone out? Evan Greenberg : Okay. Yes, please. John Lupica can answer that question for you. John Lupica : Great. Thanks for noticing me. The 4D is a tag-on we\u2019re using for our data analytics tool for loss predictive modeling. We view it as a great win-win, housed inside of our claim operation mainly in ESIS. ESIS is our third-party administrator and we can use these claims as well. And what it is, is in essence, as we look at claims that didn\u2019t take three months, six months and 12 months, we can identify the high risk claims for our insurers and ourselves. Again, we say it\u2019s a benefit because it has a third-party administrator benefiting our insurers in the deductible and then certainly benefiting ACE if we manage those large severe claims better into smaller numbers that avoid detaching into our layers. So we view it as a claims product for ourselves and the market, i.e. a win-win there. Does that help you? Charles Sebaski : Okay. And so for the mark, will you only be using this internally or this will be available for sort of outsourced? John Lupica : This is for clients. We\u2019re doing this as a service to clients. We used data analytics to benefit ourselves in portfolio management and risk selection and in claims management, but we do a lot of risk management business where our clients have skin in the game and this is to help them. Charles Sebaski : Okay. I guess I have another question on the cyber risk in general and I guess the question I have is for the market to kind of mature and scale, how do you guys view risk aggregation in that product, because it would seem to fall more along the lines of a war risk than a more traditional insurance risk on how aggregations could be in that product. I\u2019m just curious on how you guys think about that? Evan Greenberg : We don\u2019t particularly think of it as war risk, which is very extreme, but we think of it a little more akin to cat risk only it has different geographic boundaries. And so we do in our enterprise risk management, we do go through as we do with many of our businesses, we are mindful of aggregations. We do event planning scenarios where we imagine different kinds of events and the impact they could have on our concentrations of exposure. Therefore, what you call the PMLs with maximum losses that it could occur from a portfolio. Now admittedly, as anybody would say, it\u2019s kind of a crude exercise. We use the best brains and the best data and technology available you can find to help you with that, but there\u2019s a lot of basis risk and that therefore informs how much aggregation we\u2019re willing to take, understanding that the number is wrong. And if that helps you with it, we go through that exercise. Charles Sebaski : I guess in the thought on the enterprise risk management and the aggregation, I guess my thought is conceptually you could have a rogue hacker data breach that could theoretically hit every insurer in a portfolio regardless of the geographic circumstances. And so how do you \u2013 do you aggregate it just from a total product purposes that total cyber ag exposure will be x regardless of geographic or industry --? Evan Greenberg : No, you didn\u2019t exactly listen to me. So no, we don\u2019t see 100% PML. And you\u2019re using the word rogue hacker and rogue hacker typically will hit one or two or three. You\u2019re more concerned about something like wild virus and that will have more of a systemic to it, or bringing down of the Internet which wouldn\u2019t be a rogue hacker and that would have a systemic nature to it in terms of denial of service. So how you sell cover and then how you PML those exposures because the notion of 100% loss, no, we don\u2019t see that. There are many other factors that come into play. Charles Sebaski : I appreciate the insight. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Charles, if you want to become a cyber underwriter, we welcome you. Come on in, because you\u2019re thinking about it and you know what, we\u2019re hiring. Charles Sebaski : Thank you very much. Operator : The next question is from Al Copersino with Columbia Management. Al Copersino : Hi. Good morning. Thank you. I don\u2019t know if this is a particularly easy question to answer but thinking about U.S. commercial underwriting versus overseas commercial underwriting, we on the buy and sell side obviously focus perhaps too much, we focus a lot on pricing and maybe we focus a little bit less on loss cost trends and how expenses LAE is and things like that. But I was wondering if you could tell us what is the combined ratio where ROE or margin differential for a U.S. large case commercial business versus a overseas large case commercial business? Are the two roughly similar, because you chose where to play overseas? Evan Greenberg : God, it is such a difficult question in the sense that and I\u2019m not going to abate it, I\u2019m going to see if I can help you with it. But in the first instance, when you get to commercial P&C, the accounts are so different. So comparing one account to another but if I try to do that very crudely and I look coverage and we take similar coverage because ROEs and combined ratios will vary by type of coverage, the terms and conditions adjust to the local marketplace as well. And so for instance, we might have much tighter conditions around casualty in the United States to get to the same result than we do on the continent of Europe or in Mexico if I \u2013 just picking examples for you. And so the marketplace adjust that way. Number two, it will depend also to a degree so you get a sense of how messy it is. Once the access, there are some markets where the combined ratio on commercial P&C will be lower because the market is just a more stable marketplace. That may be cultural. They have tax of renewals. It may be that there is less influence from major global players in the reinsurance markets in that marketplace. It may be the dominance of local players \u2013 of a couple of local insurers and sort of business community in total protecting their own. There\u2019s all kinds of things that drive and affect us. So you can\u2019t really kind of put it in a neat box I think the way you\u2019re struggling to do it and I understand the question. Hopefully, I helped you a little bit. Al Copersino : You did. That\u2019s helpful. And the only reason I ask is that you all are focusing and rightly so on reminding us of the geographic and product diversification, almost 40% is non-large cave [ph] that sort of thing, so I was just curious if you could point us in that direction in terms of the relative profitability, but that was helpful. I appreciate that. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question is from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Evan Greenberg : Ian, hello? Ian Gutterman : Can you hear me? Evan Greenberg : He got bored with the last answer and went away. Ian Gutterman : Evan? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I\u2019m here. Ian Gutterman : Okay. I\u2019ve been here when most of my handsets are not working, so I switch to speaker. My first question is just a follow up on the -- Evan Greenberg : Take mobile. Ian Gutterman : Yes, I know. It might be a lose cord, who knows. The overseas growth of 11% ex-currency, this is kind of a follow up to the earlier question. Is there seasonality in the Brazil business, because if I took sort of my estimate of Brazilian premium divided by 4 and subtract that from the 11%, it looks like the core overseas low is pretty flattish. I\u2019m I close there or is there seasonality that skews that analysis? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m going to let John Keogh answer it because we\u2019re both shaking our head violent. In fact, there was actually very good growth. John Keogh : When I look at Latin America actually without the premium that we had this quarter, we had good solid double-digit growth in Latin America [indiscernible], I\u2019ll say that. I\u2019ll also say in terms of any seasonality, there\u2019s nothing in first quarter that would suggest that. Ian Gutterman : Perfect. Okay. Can you just talk a little bit about \u2013 you talked a lot about pricing in various parts of the market. Can you talk about terms and conditions and just quality of underwriting in general? Are we getting to that point in the cycle where underwriters are not wanting to give more price, so they start changing language or giving it on supplements and things like that, that tend to lead to that outcomes a few years later or are we not there yet? Evan Greenberg : Ian, we\u2019re seeing it but we\u2019re seeing it more on the margin. It\u2019s not back to the late '90s that way. But we are seeing more of things that would cause us to shake our heads and we\u2019ll see a broadening of terms and conditions in property, we\u2019re seeing marginally a broadening of terms and conditions at times in casualty and it\u2019s related. In particular, new business of any size comes to market and people have been really hungry, but we\u2019re not seeing the stupidity we\u2019ve seen in the past. Ian Gutterman : Okay, good. And then last -- Evan Greenberg : Not yet. Ian Gutterman : Not yet, exactly. Then lastly, just a little more on the M&A question from earlier -- Evan Greenberg : By the way, that\u2019s more of a U.S., UK, Australia comment. Ian Gutterman : That makes sense. Evan Greenberg : Anywhere else in the world, okay, when we talk about terms and conditions. Ian Gutterman : That makes sense, okay. And then lastly on M&A, I\u2019m just curious if you can spend a little bit more on your thoughts on what we\u2019re seeing in the industry elsewhere? I mean I see a lot of it so far has been in reinsurance and that\u2019s probably less interest to ACE, but what do you see when you look at the chessboard of what the next moves are? Do you think it remains a reinsurance gain where scale is needed there or do you think this spreads and we start to see major primary deals as well, because there\u2019s a need for more scale at this point in the cycle? Evan Greenberg : Ian, I don\u2019t see any major primary on the horizon but you know how that goes. And then tomorrow morning I get on the train and I pick up the newspaper and there it is. I\u2019m not a savant at this. But I don\u2019t see that on the horizon at the moment. I mean there are a couple of situations that pretty well known out there of larger primary that wouldn\u2019t surprise any of us including you. And that\u2019s just a question of \u2013 probably a little more of a question of when than if. Ian Gutterman : Got it. All right. Thank you all. I\u2019ll have a new phone for you for next quarter. Evan Greenberg : It may have been cyber. Ian Gutterman : Charles is hacking my phone. Evan Greenberg : Exactly. I\u2019m with you, Charles. Operator : The next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thank you. Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Meyer Shields : My impression of -- Evan Greenberg : Hello. Meyer, I lost you on my impression of. This is not these guys. This is something in the service. Meyer, are you there? Paul Newsome, are you there or did we just lose the call altogether. Operator : If the callers that were in the queue would please re-queue. Evan Greenberg : The last one, operator, that we were supposed to have was Meyer Shields. Operator : We have a question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Evan Greenberg : Okay. You saved Phil from having to sing a song. Meyer Shields : Okay. Can you hear me? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Meyer Shields : Fantastic, sorry about that. My impression of the high net worth market, first lines market in the U.S. has been it\u2019s fairly concentrated and now more so with the acquisition of Fireman\u2019s Fund. Did that have any implications for pricing or profitability the fact that one of the relatively small group of companies is now subdued [ph] within ACE? Evan Greenberg : I don\u2019t think so, Meyer. We don\u2019t view our opportunity as simply three or four players trading business back and forth. The high net worth personal lines potential marketplace is a much larger marketplace than it is today. It\u2019s being served by good companies but the traditional lines companies who don\u2019t really meet the needs both coverage and service of high net worth client base and customers. And so our real opportunity is to migrate more of those customers from where they are today to ACE and not simply chasing someone else\u2019s business. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And Phil, quick question. If we adjust net investment income for foreign exchange, you came in ahead of the sort of $550 million quarterly run rate -- Phil Bancroft : Yes, I think the run rate was 555 million. Meyer Shields : So it\u2019s just the FX -- Phil Bancroft : Right. Meyer Shields : Okay, great. Thanks so much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Helen Wilson : Operator, is there anyone left in the queue please? Operator : At this time, we have no further questions. I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to Helen Wilson for any additional or closing remarks. Helen Wilson : Okay. Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning.

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Helen Wilson : Thank you and welcome to the ACE Limited June 30, 2015 Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions, including foreign exchange, and completion and integration of acquisitions, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings as well as our earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our website for more information on factors that could affect these matters. This call is being webcast live and the webcast replay will be available for 1 month. All remarks made during the call are current at the time of the call and will not be updated to reflect subsequent material developments. Now, I would like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. ACE produced excellent second quarter results, with earnings per share essentially flat with prior year. Earnings and revenue growth were strong in spite of foreign exchange and market conditions that are growing more competitive. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $788 million, or $2.40 per share. Our annualized operating return on equity was 11.4%, a good return on shareholder capital. Underwriting results in the quarter were excellent. We produced $478 million of total P&C underwriting income, flat with prior year and up 5.5% on a constant dollar basis. The P&C combined ratio was 87.7% and the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses, was 88.4% versus 88.7% prior year. Cat losses were up relative to prior year by $44 million pre-tax, as a result of increased cat activity around the world. And positive prior period reserve development was up modestly as well. All divisions produced outstanding calendar year and current accident year results in the quarter. This was the first quarter that included the contributions of the Fireman\u2019s Fund U.S. high net worth business, which contributed to both revenue and earnings, including a $15 million non-recurring benefit to operating income. On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted operating income by $29 million. We produced $562 million investment income, up 3% in constant dollars. This is a very good result given the interest rate environment and speaks to our strong cash flow. Book value per share growth was flat in the quarter affected by the impact of a rise in interest rates on our corporate bond portfolio. Frankly, it\u2019s sustainable. I view this as a positive. The mark-to-market hit is simply a question of timing since we are essentially a buy-and-hold bond investor, while higher rates mean greater investment income over time. Phil will have more to say about the impact of Fireman\u2019s Fund on revenue and earnings, our investment portfolio, prior year\u2019s reserve development and cat losses. The big news in the quarter obviously was our announced agreement to acquire Chubb. And I must tell you I am even more excited and convinced of the potential opportunity and the fit in terms of talent and complementary capabilities. The senior leadership of both companies met for 2.5 days last week for integration planning purposes and the chemistry, the optimism, the energy and the earnestness to succeed couldn\u2019t have been better. I am awfully impressed by the sub-leadership my colleagues and I met. They are peers. We are moving quickly. We have initiated the process for teams to be engaged on integration planning that covers all businesses and functional areas of both companies. We are planning to file an S-4 by the end of the month. And following that, we\u2019ll each set the date for shareholders\u2019 votes, which should occur somewhere between the end of September and the end of October. We are preparing to file for regulatory approvals. And as we said, we expect the transaction to close in the first quarter of \u201816. Turning to revenue growth, global P&C net premiums, excluding agriculture, grew about 6.5% in the quarter or over 13% on a constant dollar basis. The assumption of the unearned premium from the in-force Fireman\u2019s Fund portfolio contributed about 6.5% to this growth and it is non-recurring. Once again, we expect global P&C premium revenue growth on a published basis for the balance of the year will be mid single-digit in spite of foreign exchange. In North America, net premiums for P&C, excluding crop and the non-recurring premiums from the Fireman\u2019s Fund transaction, grew 6% in constant dollars in both our large commercial business, ACE USA and in ACE Westchester E&S, net premiums declined about 4%. There were some one-time items in \u201814 that distorted second quarter growth, and as such, we expect premium growth in our U.S. commercial business to improve for the balance of the year. We grew over 20% in ACE commercial risk services, which serves the small to mid-market clients. Turning to our international operations, P&C net premiums in ACE International were up over 11% in constant dollars. Latin America and Asia had strong growth, with net premiums up 25% and 14% respectively, while premiums in Europe were down 1%. In our London-based E&S business, premiums were down 16% as we shed business in an increasingly competitive London wholesale market. In our A&H insurance business, net premiums were up over 4% globally in constant currency. A&H premiums internationally were up about 5%, led by Asia with growth of 17%. Premiums for combined insurance were up about 3.5%, with our North American business up nearly 6%. Net premiums for personal lines globally, excluding the non-recurring premium from Fireman\u2019s Fund, were up 46%. Our Asia-focused international life insurance business had a good quarter, with net premiums up 7.5% in constant currency. And finally, in our Global Re business, net premiums declined 6% due to market conditions. I want to now say a few more words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions. The underwriting environment continued to soften in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally. As I have been saying, the underlying pattern we have seen over the last few quarters is that large account business is more competitive than midsized, wholesale is more competitive than retail, and property more so than casualty-related. Taking our U.S. commercial P&C business by its components and starting with our large and upper middle-market retail business, ACE USA general and specialty casualty-related pricing was up 2% in the quarter and varied by line. For example, large account risk management-related casualty pricing was up less than 1%; excess casualty was up about 2.5%; foreign casualty pricing was up by 0.5%; and management and professional liability pricing was flat. Property-related pricing was down 10%, a steeper decline from prior quarter. New business activity slowed as expected and renewal retention levels are good. Both reflect market conditions and our underwriting discipline. We will not chase under-priced business. For our U.S. retail business, the renewal retention rate, as measured by premium was 89%. Turning to our U.S. E&S business, casualty rates were up less than 1% in the quarter, professional lines was up 2% while property was down about 10%. Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew more competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down two, property was down seven and financial lines were down four. Rates in both Asia and Latin America overall were down 7%, led by property, while rates on the continent in the UK were down 2%. In our London market E&S business, rates were down 8% in the quarter. For our commercial P&C business, we are ameliorating the impact of pricing on our combined ratio through a combination of mix shift, targeting classes with better margin, portfolio management that informs underwriting actions, including tighter individual risk selection and pricing actions in more stressed areas as well as better marketing and new product innovation. As you know, personal lines, small commercial and A&H, are about 40% of ACE\u2019s business. And for these lines, rates were flat to up mid single-digit depending on portfolio and territory. John Keogh, John Lupica and Juan Andrade can provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. In summary, we produced good results this quarter despite the strong dollar. As you can see given our breadth of product, customer segment, distribution and territory, we continue to capitalize on areas that represent attractive opportunities to grow profitably. With that, I will turn the call over to Phil and then we will come back and take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thanks, Evan. Book value per share grew 0.5% for the quarter and 1.4% for the year. Book value growth for the quarter was adversely impacted by rising interest rates, which resulted in realized and unrealized losses in our investment portfolio of $602 million after-tax. These losses were partially offset by favorable foreign currency movements of $103 million after-tax and realized gains of $102 million after-tax related to our variable annuity reinsurance business. Tangible book value per share declined 1.5% for the quarter and increased 0.3% for the year. In addition to net realized and unrealized losses and favorable FX for the quarter, tangible book value per share was negatively impacted by goodwill and intangibles related to the Fireman\u2019s Fund acquisition. Excluding the impact of the acquisition, tangible book value per share increased 0.5% for the quarter and 2.3% for the year. We had strong operating cash flow of $816 million that benefited net investment income. Investment income of $562 million, which was impacted negatively by $11 million of foreign exchange versus prior year, was better than expected due to higher private equity distributions and call activity in our corporate bond portfolio. Our strong cash flow will continue to benefit our estimated quarterly investment income run rate of $550 million even with current new money rates of 2.9% versus our current book yield of 3.6%. The estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability in portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our net loss reserves were up about $100 million for the quarter after adjusting for foreign exchange and the Fireman\u2019s Fund acquisition. The paid to incurred ratio was 94%. In the quarter, we had net positive prior period development of $153 million pre-tax, approximately half from long-tail lines principally from 2010 and prior years. The remainder was from short-tail lines. Cat losses were $106 million after-tax in the quarter, primarily from the number of U.S. weather events, hailstorms in Australia and floods in Chile. North American P&C net premiums written included $252 million from the transfer of the Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s business in-force at the time of the transaction. Underwriting income included $50 million from Fireman\u2019s Fund that will be non-recurring in 2016. This amount is the result of eliminating the deferred acquisition costs or DAC associated with the Fireman\u2019s Fund\u2019s business at the time of the close as part of purchase accounting. Future amortization of the DAC is also eliminated. The North American current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats and the non-recurring underwriting benefit from Fireman\u2019s Fund, was 87.9% compared with 87.3% last year. The non-recurring underwriting benefit from Fireman\u2019s Fund was partially offset by purchase accounting intangible amortization included in other income of $29 million. This produced a non-recurring net operating income benefit from the in-force business as Evan noted of $15 million. Total capital returned to shareholders during the quarter was $610 million, including $390 million of share repurchases and $220 million in dividends. The company has discontinued its share repurchase program in connection with the announced planned acquisition of Chubb. I will turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you, Phil. At this point, we would be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Evan I just had one question that you guys just came back from meeting with Chubb management for a couple of days, as far as Chubb\u2019s business, I mean obviously, expenses are higher, certainly a different brand presence in personal lines. How do you balance maintaining that brand with talking about expense synergies and looking to optimize on that front? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Michael, good question, expense synergies aren\u2019t about in some blind way, simply trying to get every dollar of efficiency in a sterile view out of it. Chubb, as ACE does each have virtues to their model and their franchise as to how they operate. The core of Chubb is an agency franchise and a smaller customer segment, more work intensive, very local. The service model, very high quality, local service in both underwriting and in claims, we are very mindful of all of that. And so when you look at \u2013 and when you take that, you can\u2019t also say, well service is simply a mindless word for a shield against inefficiency. There is a tremendous duplication of expenses between the two companies in functions where you don\u2019t need two of everything. And that varies by geography that varies by function that varies by business. And we didn\u2019t use just some arbitrary rule of thumb when we came to our target number of $650 million. It\u2019s a conservative thoughtful estimate. We went function by function, geography by geography. We have done many acquisitions before. And I don\u2019t mind telling you that we actually came up with an even higher number, but being mindful that we are going to balance culture, we are going to balance service and quality and what the franchise is about with a competitive profile of the combined companies that necessarily will operate efficiently. All of that together makes us to how we have arrived at what we think is a thoughtful target. Michael Nannizzi : Great, thanks. And then Phil, I guess one follow-up on just a numbers question, if you look at the expense ratio in North America was a little bit lower in the quarter and then there is some noise in ag. Was there anything unusual in the quarter? And I am guessing I wonder if some of the Fireman\u2019s Fund adjustments went through as a contract expense potentially, maybe some color on that? Thanks. Phil Bancroft : The \u2013 with respect to agriculture, I think Evan said a few quarters ago that we would expect a combined ratio of about 91% and we are close to that. We have changed a little bit the timing of the recognition of our premium as it relates to \u2013 I mean of the premium recognition as it relates to the government program, and we have made some additional investments in our non-MPCI P&C agriculture business. So, I would say nothing significant. Michael Nannizzi : Okay, great. And then do you have an underlying ex-Fireman\u2019s Fund adjustment like just so we can kind of square that away for the quarter? Evan Greenberg : When you say under, you mean\u2026. Michael Nannizzi : Yes, so, you have the $49 million, obviously you have the goodwill in there as well, but just to make sure that it seemed like about 130 basis points. Is that how we should... Phil Bancroft : We gave you an 87.9 ex-cat current accident year combined ratio versus last year of 87.2 with North America P&C, does that \u2013 and so that\u2019s eliminating that one-time. Michael Nannizzi : That is, okay. Phil Bancroft : Does that help you with that? Michael Nannizzi : That\u2019s the answer I needed. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Hello. Helen Wilson : Let\u2019s move to the next person operator, please. Operator : We will go to Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Evan Greenberg : Move to the next one operator, please. Operator : Go ahead, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Hello. Helen Wilson : God ahead, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Can you guys hear me? Helen Wilson : Yes. Ryan Tunis : Hey, sorry about that. So, I just wanted to ask on the Chubb International business. I think there is 3 or 4 bill premium there and I was just hoping maybe for some detail on how ACE thinks and maybe able to leverage its own international business and maybe improve the profitability there, because I think it\u2019s been somewhat of an under earner in the past relative at least in their broader personal lines? Evan Greenberg : Yes. As I am sure you know, a minority percentage of that business is personal lines actually and it\u2019s more commercial lines and specialty on some large account, but quite middle market-oriented. And Chubb is an old \u2013 has an old network and has been added for a long time. There will be a lot of efficiency we will gain between the two operations, because they are a duplication. Our plan is to integrate Chubb\u2019s international business into ACE\u2019s. So, we will have only one statutory entity in the geographies and the vast, vast majority of those will be ACE entities. Canada is an exception. We will integrate ACE into Chubb up in Canada. There are many good people in Chubb\u2019s international operations. And so along with that business, there is a marginal cost. You got to be able to service that business and you have got to be able to underwrite it, you got insight into distribution of it. There are a lot of good people who are going to bring a lot of value to ACE\u2019s international operation along with that business. We will, as I said, it\u2019s marginal cost and we will, at the same time, eliminate duplication of cost and function across geographies. In particular what we see and we can see it by specific geographies is there is real opportunity internationally given what they have built in middle-market in particular in certain territories to take advantage of that and add meaningfully to product, add meaningfully to the leverage of some of that talent to helping some other tangential territories that are around the countries, where that talent resides now. I hope that helps you with it. Ryan Tunis : Yes, that\u2019s helpful, Evan. Thanks. And then I guess my follow-up is just on U.S. personal lines and just trying to understand, obviously ACE and Chubb have different products and how do we think about with the two entities coming together, are we going to see just Chubb\u2019s product or is there a place for both products? And a broader question I guess is what\u2019s been the reaction so far from independent agents in personal lines given two of the biggest high net worth providers announced a combination? Evan Greenberg : I think around the \u2013 you can\u2019t see my colleagues shaking their heads around the room. We are puzzled by the question by the comment with all due respect of different product. They are substantially the same product. We are both covering the needs of a high net worth customer. Each of us may have a slightly different risk appetite depending on the cohort of customer. ACE may have been focused a little more on international. Chubb has capabilities in product that is very old and very deep. And so frankly, we actually see the product integration as very complementary and quite comfortable. For agents and brokers, they want to know that we are going to behave in the similar way. They want to know that we are going to covet Chubb\u2019s claims capability and service, which is simply renowned. And I can guarantee you we are going to do that. And they will be leading those efforts. And so frankly, we think for agents it brings them a superior ultimate offering. Agents want to know that we are going to maintain compensation structures and that by the way, that we are going to keep the agency, the independent agency system as a centerpiece of distribution here to the customers. And we are being loud and clear that that is without a doubt. And so I think in this case, it\u2019s good news for agents and for brokers and for customers. By the way, the two of us on one hand may appear significant in that business. On the other hand, it depends on how you define the business. The cohort of high net worth personal lines potential customers and our own estimation is north of $40 billion and it resides on the books of so many traditional personal lines carriers around the United States. And our objective is to identify those customers and make them aware of our offerings and give them product that\u2019s more appropriate to their needs for many of them than what they have today. Ryan Tunis : Okay. And from the product standpoint just wanted to confirm that broadly speaking, there is not a big difference in price point of what ACE was offering in Chubb. I guess that\u2019s more of what I was getting at? Evan Greenberg : Ryan, that really varies. It\u2019s \u2013 that varies by state, by company that is writing, by vintage of policyholder. And as you know, there is tier pricing that is employed that allows you to more finely risk rate the business. And I think that\u2019s where a lot of that noise that you might see from the outside arises and \u2013 but clear eyed and thoughtful underwriters in portfolio management know how to rationalize that and it\u2019s not as chaotic as you might imagine from the outside at all. Ryan Tunis : Thanks a lot, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, I apologize for the \u2013 we had some technical difficulties. [Operator Instructions] We will go next to Charles Sebaski with BMO Capital Markets. Evan Greenberg : Charles, can you hear us? Charles Sebaski : Hello, I can hear you. Evan Greenberg : Okay, now I can hear you. Charles Sebaski : Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Charles Sebaski : I had a question on the growth strategy with you and Chubb and I guess on the product line, I was wondering if you could give, not on the personal, but on the small commercial middle market, which products you really see as being the best position for you to be able to introduce to the Chubb distribution, where do you think the strength that you guys obviously have a very broad product offering on the commercial side. Where do you see the most natural early fits for the growth plan going forward? Evan Greenberg : Charles, we are on one hand, some of it is a little premature. I am going to give you a general feel. Some of it is a little premature and we also have plenty of competitors who listen to the phone calls and we are hardly going to hand a roadmap to everybody. But you can imagine, Chubb does a great job in traditional middle market products and some specialty products and towards industry verticals that they are such a great deep knowledge of and are great at. On the other hand, imagine the products that ACE sells, everything from environmental liability to farm and ranch to product recall, the construction and we could go on and on with a lot of product that will enhance the offerings to those verticals and also might help to expand into a few others as we go along. That\u2019s middle market, and that is distinct from small commercial, which we have each been have sort of nascent efforts towards that we will endeavor to pursue in a far more meaningful way. And I think that will present substantial opportunity. At the same time, I don\u2019t mind telling you while we have product synergies that we imagined around the world, whether it is cross-selling, which we are not probably in is about cross-selling, whether it is new product or new customer cohort, we also imagined revenue dyssynergy in the early years where we have overlap and duplication, where some agents may or brokers may think over concentration in an area, in the line of business and the customer, etcetera and any of our projections also recognize those. There is puts and calls in the early 2 years or 3 years about \u2013 between dysynergies and synergies. Revenue synergies, we imagine will be \u2013 will appear in a real way by year 3 and year 4, meaningful year 5 substantial. Charles Sebaski : Do you guys need to put on more people for the middle market product offering into that independent agency channel, I mean given Chubb\u2019s underwriters have theirs, it doesn\u2019t, you say there is no more people needed to service that model? Evan Greenberg : Not really. Not from what we \u2013 no. Charles Sebaski : Excellent. Thanks for your answers. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will go next to Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Sarah DeWitt : I wanted to follow up on the Chubb\u2019s acquisitions on the double-digit earnings accretion, what is the net assumption for net revenue synergies and where do you think there could be upside, could there \u2013 could you buy less reinsurance, could you put in some internal quarter shares, reduce the tax rate or reinvest the big portfolio? Evan Greenberg : Sarah we are not going into that detail of specifics of the sources of earnings accretion and how much is coming from revenue and how much is coming from expense. And we are certainly not going into details about reinsurance. That is actually a competitive secret that we don\u2019t \u2013 we are not going into. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, fair enough. And then I would be interested in getting your broader thoughts on industry consolidation, what inning do you think we are in, in the consolidation wave and do you think you will see more large primary insurers respond to your Chubb acquisition with big deals? Evan Greenberg : Well, I have got a pretty full plate and really I am pretty absorbed in all the things around ACE and around Chubb. I don\u2019t know what my competitors are imagining or doing at the moment. I don\u2019t know what inning we are in. I can\u2019t really opine on that. I imagine there will be more acquisition, but I have been reading lately that there will be more large acquisitions because of ACE and Chubb. When I think about it, I am not sure that\u2019s right. I can\u2019t speak with any certainty but first of all, most of my or many of my competitors are very thoughtful and they are good operators and they are good stewards. They attempt to be good stewards of shareholder money. And they have a good sense of strategy for their companies. Anybody who thinks that way, first of all is going to look at an acquisition not from a point of size, they are going to look at it at the intrinsic value due to the characteristics of that to be acquired holds. And whether it is truly value-creating in a transformative way, otherwise you don\u2019t do something large. ACE Chubb is a very unique opportunity and we took advantage of that opportunity. And I believe my Chubb colleagues who know that who are aware of the insights behind it, feel the same way about that opportunity. And so when others are thinking about transformative, well they have got to imagine, it\u2019s not simply about size, what does it bring to you. And there are too many obvious combinations when you think that way. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great. Thanks for the answer. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will go next to Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Good morning. Thank you. First question Evan, you commented on the pricing detail. Thank you so much for the details. But the pricing looks like more competitive, especially on large accounts, property and wholesale. Some of your industry peers opine that the market is now is more disciplined in terms of better data analytics and this still low interest rate environment. So, just wonder what\u2019s your take on that and do you believe the pricing competitive enough, the pricing will get any worse from here and what that to do with your underwriting margin going forward? Evan Greenberg : Kai, first of all, yes I think that pricing is going to become more competitive from here. And I think, ultimately listen that gets reflected in margins and there is no two ways about that. I described to you and have many times the levers we have to pull in ameliorating that margin impact, 40% of our business is probably not subject to cycle nearly the same way. And we have a lot of portfolio management and underwriting discipline insight and product mix and territory mix that allows us to ameliorate, but you don\u2019t eliminate that and it will have an impact on margins in due course on one hand. Number two, I think the question about cycle management and data and all of that, I think you can\u2019t paint it with a broad brush. And I think those who do are simply, they are overly simplistic in either how they think or certainly in how they describe certain areas of the business where you have broad distribution reach to get the customer, where you have more homogeneous pools of risk, lower severity-related, higher frequency-related, I think that is where there is a bit more discipline at least at this time. So, you would say more smaller commercial, more middle-market commercial, I think that is less subject though hardly immune on one hand. I think as you get up to upper middle-market, larger risk, I think you have a lot of players with a lot less data. People are buying much bigger limits, so you have a lot piling on to the same risk who just have capital and an underwriter and a dog and are chasing some volume. And there I don\u2019t see that same sort of well. The insights of analytics will ameliorate a market cycle. Kai Pan : Thank you so much. Evan Greenberg : Everybody wants to put everything into one neat sentence and how the market works on a bumper sticker. And you know what? It\u2019s a lot bigger, it\u2019s a lot farer ranging and it\u2019s a lot more dynamic and open and market and free market-oriented and messy therefore than you can fit on \u2013 in 10 easy-to-say words. Kai Pan : That\u2019s great. Second question is switching to Banco Ita\u00fa\u2019s P&C business, just wonder what\u2019s the progress of the integration over there in related to the \u2013 in particular, the economy in Brazil as well as any potential claims from the Petrobras investigation? Evan Greenberg : In a word, that\u2019s going very well. It\u2019s \u2013 and I am going to let John Keogh indulge on that. John Keogh : Sure. Yes. I will pick up \u2013 first integration piece of it is currently on our plan and our trajectory to bring it to organizations together by end of the year. We have received regulatory approval to do that as especially economy and Petrobras, it\u2019s \u2013 you all read the same thing and understand that, that investigation is widespread and growing. We are obviously keeping a very close on it as it develops and mindful of the implications of it. But having said that as we look at the current state of all we know, there is nothing we have seen in terms of claims to our business in Brazil right now that is significant or material. Now, certainly the economy is in bad shape. Nothing we are imagining in the near-term that suggests it will get better. Any implications for that right now in terms of the competitive market in Brazil is possible? It\u2019s one of the more difficult markets right now that we are operating in. And we have got good operators in the ground and understand that through a market like this before from doing a conduit like this before in Brazil and we continue to perform well there. Evan Greenberg : What we can tell you is that the Ita\u00fa ACE franchise is a very powerful franchise in the commercial P&C business in Brazil with deep relationships. And they have done a very good job of maintaining the portfolio. And at the same time, they are very good underwriters and boy they do know how to use reinsurance. There is a very hungry market down there and yet our operation because of relationships has a lot of influence and controls a lot of customer on access. So, in many cases, the road to your share of that business comes through us. Kai Pan : Thank you. Lastly, just quick number question, on the Fireman\u2019s Funds that you mentioned like a $50 million non-recurring of the component of that, the $49 million benefit is non-recurring, but the $29 million amortization. Would that be recurring? Phil Bancroft : Those components recur, but the net of the two is very small for the remainder of the year. Kai Pan : But is that the $29 million going to like going forward lasting for several years or not? Phil Bancroft : No, it would just be for the remainder of this year. Kai Pan : Okay, great. Well, thank you so much. Phil Bancroft : But you heard him, Kai, that net $15 million we had diminishes significantly as you go to the rest of the year. Kai Pan : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, good morning. A couple of questions here for you. First, Evan, we have talked about pricing, I wonder if you could give us an update on kind of what\u2019s happening with loss trend right now, maybe domestically in the U.S. and internationally commercial and personal? Evan Greenberg : Yes. The \u2013 I will ask Sean to opine a little bit on it, but it isn\u2019t any different than we saw last quarter or the quarter before. It\u2019s quite steady. And loss cost is running higher than pricing. Sean Ringsted : That\u2019s right. We are not seeing any material changes in claims frequency in the quarter or year-to-date, Brian, trends generally in line with our implementations for the current accident year. On workers\u2019 comp as a reminder that\u2019s risk management ground up, loss frequency is slightly lower in our casualty and professional lines we mentioned before, we see frequency changes up and down, but that\u2019s in line with the portfolio management and underwriting actions that Evan mentioned nothing systemic or broad-based that we are seeing there. Brian Meredith : Great, thanks. And then second question here, Evan, it\u2019s a combined company, Chubb ACE is going to generate a ton of cash flow. And if I look at Chubb and ACE\u2019s capital management strategies, they were kind of different strategies. I am just wondering once you guys have reached your kind of desired leverage with respect to debt to cap, do you see kind of the ACE strategy kind of evolving any more closer to kind of what the Chubb strategy was or do you think it will be roughly similar? Evan Greenberg : Well, I think it will evolve. I think it\u2019s \u2013 I don\u2019t see it as sort of the Chubb strategy, which was fundamentally to return all the capital you generate and maybe not have the same level of investment for growth that ACE has had. And our appetite to invest for thoughtful growth will not go away. We keep a \u2013 we keep faith that we have a franchise to build and we will continue to build and we will continue to invest in that and that\u2019s organic fundamentally. Remember, two-thirds of ACE\u2019s growth came organically prior to Chubb and one-third through acquisition. We will maintain, as Chubb has some level of prudence of capital for flexibility, for opportunity and for risk. And beyond that, I think as you said, you are going to generate a substantial amount of cash flow. And we had already been returning capital to shareholders excess of what we thought we required for the things I just enumerated. And we will continue on that track. And I think the numbers will just be larger, because the total is going to be significantly larger. Brian Meredith : I think it\u2019s very helpful. Evan Greenberg : What did you want to say? Phil Bancroft : I was just going to say I think as we have talked about it, it will be a smaller percentage. It might be a larger number in terms of the total quantum, but a smaller number relative to the total amortization, right, total capital. Evan Greenberg : Yes, sure. Does that help you, Brian? Brian Meredith : Yes, I think that\u2019s helpful. So, you are into smaller number you are meaning versus what Chubb was doing historically? Evan Greenberg : Not dollar number, he was saying percentage of the balance sheet. That\u2019s all. Brian Meredith : Got it. Helpful. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : We will go next to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : Thank you. I have two unrelated questions. The first was with regard to the global property/casualty growth profile for the rest of 2015. I believe the term we use was revenue growth. Is that consistent with earned premium growth? Phil Bancroft : Written premium growth. Jay Gelb : Written, okay, thank you. And then the second question, Evan, is with ACE buying Chubb and Chubb \u2013 I am sorry and the combined company assuming the Chubb brand in the marketplace, does that also mean that from a corporate perspective the Chubb name will be adopted, including things like the stock symbol? Evan Greenberg : Including things like what? Jay Gelb : The stock symbol. Evan Greenberg : The stock symbol? Yes, sir. Jay Gelb : Okay. So the combined company going forward will be Chubb Corp? Evan Greenberg : Well, we haven\u2019t said Corp., but it will be Chubb. It will be Chubb something. It might be Chubb Limited at the parent. We have ACE Group Holdings as intermediate holding company. It may be Chubb Group Holdings. We haven\u2019t really come to that part exactly, but you get kind of thinking about it, but the symbol will be Chubb. And we will start at the top and we will be unequivocal. Jay Gelb : Thanks for clarifying. Evan Greenberg : We are all in Jay. Operator : We will go next to Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Good morning. A couple of small ball questions. One is there any guidance on the ramp-up of Fireman\u2019s Fund related DAC amortization? Phil Bancroft : When we say ramp up, do you mean \u2013 so we have said that the DAC amortization that did not occur in the first quarter was about $50 million. And that was offset to some extent by the amortization of the intangible gets established at that point. And what I said just a little bit earlier was as you go into the out quarters of this year those two numbers are also almost equivalent and will have very little bottom line impact of the two. Meyer Shields : Right. But we should be reverting in a few changes we get in the year? Phil Bancroft : That\u2019s $50 million, it will be more than $50 million in the year, it was $50 million in the first quarter. There will be some amounts in each of the subsequent quarters, almost directly offset by the amortization of the intangible in those later quarters. As the new business emerges, we will be establishing DAC on that and then it will reestablish itself just like a normal line of business. Meyer Shields : Alright. Okay, perfect. And also there was a bit of a ramp up or I am sorry, bit of a year-over-year increase in DAC in overseas general and reinsurance, is there something we could talk about what\u2019s going on? Evan Greenberg : How about we take that one offline with you? Phil Bancroft : Are you talking about the DAC amortization of those two? Meyer Shields : Yes. The policy acquisition cost ratio. Phil Bancroft : Okay. I will take that offline. Meyer Shields : Okay, thanks. Operator : We will go next to Larry Greenberg with Janney. Larry Greenberg : Hi, good morning. I am sorry to beat the dead horse on the Fireman\u2019s Fund, I just want to be sure I understand, so the \u2013 on the underwriting side of it, the full impact was the DAC, that would have flowed in the expense ratio and that would have been the only ratio other than the combined, obviously that would have been impacted am I thinking about that right? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It will be a reduction. We didn\u2019t have the DAC amortization, so it would have been reduction to acquisition costs. And at the same time, it\u2019s an increase to the other income for the amortization of the intangible. Phil Bancroft : But Larry, you said something that actually we should correct, that\u2019s not the full underwriting impact of the Fireman\u2019s Fund in the quarter, that\u2019s the one-time. There was a modest amount of ongoing and we haven\u2019t disclosed that amount. We don\u2019t do that. Larry Greenberg : Right, got it. Thank you. And then Evan just a general question on the deal, obviously there is going to be a lot of accounting noise related to the transaction. And from our standpoint, it\u2019s going to be challenging to really track the true economic returns that you will be generating. And I have always viewed you as being very focused on tangible book value and growing tangible book value. And you have been very clear on how much you believe in this transaction and the merits of the transaction and I think we could probably put together your willingness to accept the tangible book value dilution in the deal. But I guess my question is just how difficult was it for you to get over the dilution hurdle, just maybe if you could share some thoughts on that? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Actually, that\u2019s a really good question and because frankly you hit at the \u2013 maybe the nut of it for me. I had looked at this before over the years. And the tangible book value dilution stopped me in my tracks each time. I was unwilling to accept it. In June, I had a lot of time on my hands idle sitting because I broke my leg. And I would like to sit and think when I usually, pretty active guy. And actually, I spend a lot of time thinking about that. And what I realized, I came to is in my own mind, everybody sees their own judgment. In my own judgment, I was thinking incorrectly about this that actually it wasn\u2019t the question of the dilution, it was the question really of how long does it take you to get back to where you were and how much faster, therefore will tangible book value grow. And will the value creation take place from there. And by the way, that then will tie me back into book value and ROE, which I want to speak about for a minute. And what I came to in my own mind was that if the dilution, if you could come back to where you actually are right now in 3 years, then that\u2019s a period of time of enough certainty to make to get beyond three, you are a little more aspirational, you are less certain. But all else being equal, that is all the assumptions are reasonably conservative and I believe in them of how you get back to that number. Then given the value creation that goes on for many years to come and all that you are getting from it that was a price willing \u2013 I am willing to pay. And the way I think about that is how you come back to book value. Book value grows tangible, but book grows immediately mid single-digit. And while ROE is relative \u2013 it\u2019s basically flat. It\u2019s basis points dilutive out of the gate. It\u2019s basis points accretive after 3 years, but that\u2019s a head fake to me, because it\u2019s the book value now has substantially more goodwill in it. And that goodwill is of a very high quality, because it\u2019s an income producing assets and it\u2019s a great income producing asset, it\u2019s Chubb. And the quality of it, the certainty of it, the ability to grow it, that is what\u2019s meaningful. And so I think that income producing assets and I think of that as levered over that tangible book value. And you start growing mid-teens tangible book out of the gate. And so that\u2019s how I thought in total and it all linked back to me about that tangible book dilution of why you would do that. I hear people talk about ROE and that it\u2019s not ROE accretive. Well, that's because you have now you have to think a little differently. You have levered up your book value with an income producing asset, that goodwill, but you are \u2013 so your ROE is necessarily maybe not accretive, but your book value grows more quickly. So when you think of the formula of price-to-book, which is really about ROE against book value, book value grows more quickly where ROE is less accretive. And you come to the same place in a price-to-book multiple. So if that helps you, that\u2019s the total of how I thought about it. Larry Greenberg : That\u2019s great. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We will go next to Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Thanks. Good morning, Evan. I wanted to address and Larry just stole my thunder a little bit, but I wanted to address sort of the two objections I hear from people who are less optimistic about this deal from investors and analysts and why don\u2019t we just continue the tangible book theme because that\u2019s when it comes up a lot. I agree with most of what you said. I guess I would add even further I don\u2019t understood why tangible book value is a good way to look at your company. And I guess the reason I would say that is because you could have paid $80 for Chubb and you still would have sort of had intangibles, goodwill sort of a few billion dollars. And in that case, I think no one would say that is bad will, if you will, right? And so why should we assume any dollar paid above book value for Chubb is bad, right? Is it the real way to look at that is reported book value, because if you overpaid, you will have a low ROE and reported book value going forward. If you underpaid, you would have a higher ROE and reported book value going forward. So, why is tangible book value even a relevant metric for you guys in that banks where it regulates your capital? I think reported book is the better metric. Evan Greenberg : You know what, pick your poison. I think they are both good metrics. I agree with you that you are just coming around. I think what you are saying to me is the same thing that goodwill is an income-producing asset and it\u2019s a very high quality. And I think that really gets to be the question. Is it of low quality? Will it ultimately be impaired? Is it \u2013 and it\u2019s all that, that it represents and I agree with that. I also agree that when you are looking at the economics of these, you got to look through a bit the accounting and the intangible amortization to see the true wealth economic, wealth creation that is taking place. On the other side of the coin, as an operator, I will say that tangible is your most constraining factor. Everything comes off of tangible and all leverage, your most constraining is tangible. And we are a balance sheet business and you can only pay claims out of tangible capital. And by the way, regulatory and rating agency is about tangible capital. That\u2019s your ticket to operate and to grow and flexibility. And so you can\u2019t ignore tangible, but I recognize how you are thinking, which is simply from a financial perspective and industrial perspective rather than an operating perspective if you got to think both. So, I don\u2019t disagree with you, but I think you need to be balanced here, Ian. And also, I think where people are coming from about the tangible, it\u2019s \u2013 if you could say I am growing at mid-teens, it\u2019s telling you that, that goodwill, which is so much bigger on the balance sheet, that is a \u2013 it is a levered asset that is income producing and that\u2019s what you have to square the circle against those who then talk about ROE, but it\u2019s then again as I said versus a book value that grows more quickly. Ian Gutterman : Agreed. And then the other one I have heard bunches, very few people seem to want to give credit for future revenue synergies just because historically for most companies that tends not to materialize as much as cost synergies, but the way I hear you talk about it and even in the slides in the release suggesting that the revenue synergies could be in the same ballpark as the cost synergies by year five. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about how confident you are in achieving that year five number? And what the risk are, because I think people are kind of being a little too dismissive of that. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Listen, I understand the cynicism around it. And frankly, when I look at these things, often I am very cynical about them. The notion of well, we will just cross-sell a lot is frankly I think it\u2019s generally wishful thinking. It doesn\u2019t happen the same way. When we talk about introducing more product to begin with by the way, it\u2019s not simply that we are going to cross-sell to the existing customer who bought three, they are now going to buy four. No, I don\u2019t see it that way. I see that here is the substantial distribution with a brand name that we will have access to and those agents and brokers that we don\u2019t have big relationship with, they have dose cohorts of risk on their books now. They have those customers now. And as Chubb is able to introduce more products, we will write more business from those agents that I feel confident about. Number two, I do think there is a certain amount of cross-sell. And I think it\u2019s because the products are offered more in a menu of \u2013 in either a menu or a package and I think we can broaden that up. I think they are buying. It\u2019s not a nice to have. They are buying it now from someone else and Chubb will be able to offer that. Number three, I think the markets we are going to drop down into in customer segment or go up to and broaden our product offering in the middle-market, upper middle-market in USA, I think is extremely real. I think the problem is when you talk about this, you are not going to do it out-of-the-box year one when you are integrating and you are setting things up. I think you have to be willing to give it an amount of time. The first three years is really about the expense synergies we are going to recognize, but I can tell you as we all sat down last week even to talk about what the future could look like, where our minds were, our Chubb colleagues were \u2013 their minds were in the same place. And they recognize the same opportunities and we are both silver operators. We are all about execution, recognizing that strategy is only 10%. The rest is about executing. And we all pride ourselves on execution and we are all pretty conservative. And so are we all wrong? I don\u2019t think so. I don\u2019t think so at all. So, I actually do think one plus one together is going to equal much more than the two separately. And by the way without being dismissive, disrespectful, anything, I believe that Chubb, a great company has underinvested in the last number of years. And that growth, a portion of that growth comes from sort of correcting for that. Ian Gutterman : Got it. So, bottom line, you\u2026. Evan Greenberg : This will be a religious discussion, Ian. It\u2019s a faith until you see it and\u2026. Ian Gutterman : Right, right. But you don\u2019t view that as a stretch goal if I ask you in 2020, did you get several billion of incremental premium? That\u2019s not a stretch goal that\u2019s something you think is readily twofold? Evan Greenberg : I do. We didn\u2019t put stretch goals in this. We pitched it up the middle. Ian Gutterman : Perfect. Alright, thank you. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Helen Wilson : Operator, we have time for just one last question to ask questions please. Operator : Our final question \u2013 we will go to our final question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Most of my questions were answered. Just one maybe for Phil, so can give us some range of premium contribution from Fireman\u2019s Fund for the next several quarters just for modeling purposes? Phil Bancroft : What I can tell you is that in the quarter, so the non-recurring \u2013 I mean, the recurring business in the quarter was a premium level in the neighborhood of $120 million. Jay Cohen : Very helpful. Evan Greenberg : Jay, that\u2019s going to spur questions from people of, wow, something happened, where is the Fireman\u2019s Fund volume? We are not going to go into this, except what we are going to say is, we, as part of this transaction, we purchased reinsurance, quota share reinsurance. And so that will square the circle for those who will say the recurring volume appears low to us. Nothing happened. There is not some problem or any of that, okay. Jay Cohen : Got it. Evan Greenberg : But we are not going to go into detail, of course, about the reinsurance. Jay Cohen : Now, fair enough. This is helpful. I appreciate that. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Helen Wilson : Okay, thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : And that concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the number, ACE had a great quarter, with record earnings, record underwriting results and good revenue growth in constant dollars. After-tax operating income of $897 million or $2.74 per share was driven by P&C underwriting income of almost $600 million. Foreign exchange continued to the cast the shadow in the quarter, impacting our premium revenue, income and book value. Book value declined 1.5% due to FX and financial market volatility in both equity and fixed income markets. Our annualized operating return on equity was about 13%, an excellent return on shareholder capital. Year-to-date we have produced over $2.4 billion or $7.38 per share in operating income, which is essentially flat with prior year, in spite of about $85 million in foreign exchange headwind. Strong underwriting gains and 6.5% premium revenue growth in constant dollars contributed to these results. Returning to the quarter, underwriting results were again simply excellent, total P&C underwriting income growth was driven by strong underlying current accident year results, positive prior period reserve development and relatively low catastrophe losses. The P&C combined ratio was 85.9 and the P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding cat was 89.2 versus 89.8 prior year, so an improvement. All P&C divisions produced outstanding calendar year and current accident year results in the quarter. We are about two months into the conversion of the Fireman\u2019s Fund business case paper. We are on track and in fact, ahead of plan. As of today, both business retention and financial performance are ahead of our original projections. The retention rate is measured by premium is 87%. The business we are not converting is in line with our expectations, because it either does not meet our business profile or in our judgment is under priced. If you would like more color during the Q&A, Juan Andrade has prepared to answer your questions. We produced $549 million in investment income, down about 3% on a reported basis and 1% in constant dollars, very good result given the interest rate, equity market environment and adverse FX movement. We continue to benefit from strong operating cash flow. Turning to revenue growth, global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture grew nearly 8% in the quarter in constant dollars, foreign exchange negatively impacted global P&C by 7.5 points, nearly equal to our underlying growth. In North America, net premiums for P&C excluding crop grew 11% and our large commercial business ACE USA net premiums grew just over 2% and our two wholesale E&S businesses, ACE Bermuda and ACE Westchester, net premiums grew about 4.5% and 2.5%, respectively. We grew 11.5% in Ace Commercial Risk Services, which serves small to mid-market clients for specialty products. Premiums in our U.S. Personal Lines business were up 86%, driven by the addition of the Fireman's Fund business. Excluding Fireman's Fund, our high net worth personal lines business grew 14%, our highest growth rate of the year as we are also benefiting from increased submission activity and new business from over 300 Fireman's Fund agents newly licensed with ACE. Premiums in our agriculture business declined 3.5% is expected, due to lower commodity prices and fund selection. The crop business is in good shape and from what we see today it appears it will be an average crop year in terms of profit and loss. Turning to our international operations, P&C net premiums in ACE International were up 9% in constant dollars, driven by Latin America with strong growth of 22%, premiums in Asia-Pacific were up 8%, while premiums in Europe were down 1% and our London-based E&S business, premiums were down 12% as we continue to shed business in the London wholesale market. In our A&H Insurance business net premiums were up about 6% globally in constant currency. A&H premiums internationally were up about 5.5%, led by Asia with growth of 15%. Premiums for combined insurance were up about 5%. Net premiums written for International Personal Lines were up 18% on a constant dollar basis. In our Asia Focused International Life Insurance business, premiums were up almost 9% in constant currency. And finally in our Global Re business, net premiums declined 9.5% due to market conditions. I want to now say a few words about current commercial P&C market conditions. The underwriting environment continued to grow more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business globally. With some exceptions, price declines accelerated modestly. They were varied by class of business and geography. All of the themes we\u2019ve been saying in previous quarters remain true. Large account business, particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsized. Wholesale is more competitive than retail and property more so than casualty related. For our U.S. commercial P&C business, general and specialty casualty related pricing was flat in the quarter. Management, professional liability pricing was down a 0.5% and property related pricing was down 9%. New business writings in North America were down year-on-year as one would expect but it varies by class depending on the rates in terms we could secure. So in fact new business was up in certain targeted classes including specialty small commercial, personal lines, professional lines and A&H. Renewal retention levels are holding up well. For our U.S. retail business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 96%. Internationally, commercial P&C insurance market conditions also grew incrementally more competitive. Again, for the business we wrote, casualty rates were down 3%, property was down 7% and financial lines rates were down 1%. Generally speaking, pricing is not keeping pace with loss cost trends. They would vary by lines in geography. We continue to execute strategies to ameliorate to the extent possible the impact of pricing on our combined ratio through a combination of mix shift, targeting classes with better margin, portfolio management that informs underwriting actions, including tighter individual risk selection and pricing actions in more stressed areas. John Keogh, John Lupica and Juan Andrade could provide further color on market conditions and pricing trends. While the main event to talk about today in quarters to come, I\u2019m sure is our merger with Chubb. I want to fill you in on where we stand. We\u2019re on track with obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals in order to close hopefully early in the first quarter of \u201816 as we had announced. We received necessary U.S. Antitrust Clearance. As you all saw and we expect to announce an overwhelmingly positive response from both companies\u2019 shareholders following tomorrow\u2019s extraordinary general meetings that will be held by each company. Although the voting continues, based on the 80% of these shareholders who have cast their votes today -- to-date, approval of all Chubb related proposals is running in the very high 90s. We're making very good progress in our integration planning process. Things are moving very well with executives on both sides, working in teams to represent all lines of business and support areas around the world addressing leadership, organizational structure, roles and responsibilities and resource requirements. We are also establishing teams to work on future growth initiatives. Chemistry between both sides is excellent. Communication is good and we are building a detailed roadmap for integration that will allow us to hit the ground running when we close. We are learning more about each other. And I think the admiration for each of the people business and culture has only grown stronger. By way of a few examples, ACE people starting with me have a greater and growing appreciation with Chubb\u2019s renowned global claims and risk engineering capabilities, its U.S. branch and agency distribution system and its training capabilities. Chubb people have a greater appreciation for ACE\u2019s product breadth, global operations, risk appetite and insights and speed at which we move. Senior leadership is also working separately as a team to help facilitate cultural integration. Lastly, I will tell you that the reception we received from the agent and broker community, as well as from our customers has been very supportive, very positive. For example, members of our senior management team from both ACE and from Chubb, including me, were intended in attendance two weeks that the Council of Insurance Agents & Brokers, or CIAB meeting in Colorado Springs, it was an energy and an optimism in the room among our teams that signal to our important distribution partners how excited we all are about our two companies coming together. They all recognize the complementary nature of our companies. Frankly the more we know and the more we learn about each other, the more bullish we are on the value creation opportunities we can create for our customers, our business partners, our employees, and our shareholders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then will come back and take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. In the quarter investment income of $549 million benefited from our strong cash flow, private equity distributions and call activity from our corporate bonds. Year-to-date cash flow has essentially offset the impact of FX on our cash invested assets, which are down $140 million on a reported basis and up $1.2 billion in constant dollars. Our average new money rate is 2.9%, versus our current book yield of 3.6%. For the past 12 months, our operating cash flow was $4 billion. As I said on previous calls, our strong cash flow has offset the impact of lower reinvestment rates and we expect this trend to continue. Our cash flow for the third quarter was $808 million. There are number of factors that impact the variability in investment income including the level of interest rates, prepayment speeds on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. We currently expect our quarterly investment income run rate to be $540 million. Net realized and unrealized losses were $1.16 billion after-tax. This included losses of $309 million in our investment portfolio, primarily due to widening of credit spreads on our corporate bonds, a $313 million loss from the mark-to-market impact on our variable annuity reinsurance business, and a $548 million impact on book value from foreign exchange. FX impacted tangible book by $345 million. Our investments remain in an unrealized gain position of $1.3 billion after-tax. Since September 30, we have recovered a substantial portion of these marks almost $450 million, including a positive mark on investment portfolio of $200 million. Our net loss reserves were up to $212 million adjusted for foreign exchange and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 94%. We had positive prior period development of $210 million pre-tax, with about one-quarter from short-tail lines and three-quarter recorded from long-tail lines from accident years 2010 and prior. This included $76 million of adverse development for legacy environmental liability exposures in our Brandywine run-off of operation, which is included in our North American segment. As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our asbestos review in the fourth. The prior period development also included the positive impact from the release of $79 million from an individual legacy liability case reserve in our Overseas General and Global Re segments. Pre-tax catastrophe losses of $72 million came from a number of worldwide investments and events, including $22 million from the explosion in Tianjin, $5 billion from the Chile earthquake and the balance of other events, including U.S. flooding and Asian typhoons. In the quarter the Fireman's Fund business made a one-time contribution of three-quarters of a point to the improvement in the combined ratio due to the underwriting gain from the portfolio assumption. However, note the Fireman's Fund contributed only $20 million to operating income with underwriting gain substantially offset by purchase accounting. On the other hand, foreign exchange negatively impacted operating income by $36 million. As you can see on page 4 of the supplement, our A&H constant dollar operating income was down $6 million compared to last year's quarter. We had positive reserve development of $8 million in last year\u2019s quarter and negative development of $5 million this quarter. Excluding development, earnings growth was 6.1%. This business continues to perform very well. Also on page four of the supplement, you will see life operating income is down $8 million. This is principally due to the runoff of the VA reinsurance book. We are finalizing our plans for our $5.3 billion debt issuance in connection with the Chubb acquisition. We will make an announcement in the near future. I'll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Cliff Gallant with Nomura International. Cliff Gallant : Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Cliff Gallant : Great. Two questions. The first one was in -- and thank you, Phil for the $22 million loss number for the Tianjin loss. So, I was curious. When we see events like that in the news from an insurance claim perspective, how should we think about what losses like that? How does it differ from an event that we might see in the U.S.? And then my second question that I just -- was really sort of the -- you volunteered one and ready to speak about the conversion rates of the high net worth business at Fireman\u2019s house, I would love to hear a more detail about it, how was the approach different between -- how Fireman\u2019s was running and you guys are? And are there any lessons there that will be applicable as you integrate another high net worth business? Kevin Shearan : Yeah. So, your first question, I don\u2019t know how to answer your first question because I don't know what you're asking really so. Can you be more specific or rephrase it? I mean, it\u2019s a man-made natural. It\u2019s a man-made disaster that occurred in an urban center. The only difference I\u2019d say really between that loss occurring in China that anywhere else has to do with the regulatory environment and how you enforce the accumulation of toxic chemicals or other combustibles in an area like that. And so the risk management generally, an infrastructure of a more developing country versus developed country. But other than that, if that\u2019s what you are getting at there is an answer, but other than that I\u2019m not sure I understand the nature of the question. Cliff Gallant : That is a good answer. I appreciate that. Kevin Shearan : Again, on personal lines before we dive into it, what would you like to know? Cliff Gallant : Well, what is the conversion rate of the business of Fireman\u2019s today? What downs have you had, has there been any surprises? And again, are the lessons applicable that you will apply when you look at the Chubb book? Kevin Shearan : Yeah. Before Evan gets into that with you, I want to make sure you understand something about the Chubb book versus the Fireman\u2019s Fund. In the Fireman's Fund, it is a conversion. We are literally, having to convert the customer from the policy they had with Fireman's Fund, the statutory paper to ACE\u2019s paper. We did not buy the insurance company. We bought the renewal rights to the business. When you put Chubb and ACE together, there is going to be no conversion. They will -- the customers will remain on the paper they were on. With that, let me turn it over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Thanks Kevin. Cliff, what I would say really to start is a couple of things. I would reinforce the fact that our premium retention is running at roughly around 87%, which is really better than the expectations then we had when we did this deal. Secondly, and as Evan mentioned, when we look at the total return aspect of the underwriting income from this business, it is also running better than what we expected. I think in the six or so months as we close this deal back on April 1st, we've been able to successfully integrate over 500 new colleagues from the Fireman's Fund. We are very pleased with the talent and the skill that they have brought. We\u2019ve created two new centers one in O'Fallon, Missouri and one in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, that are really deepened our ability to provide even better claim service, even better operation servicing capabilities to our customers. In addition to that, we have also on-boarded about 357 new Fireman's Fund agents that were not appointed with ACE prior to all of this. Those agents were associated with roughly over 400 storefronts and that has generated some of the very positive momentum we're seeing in the quarter from a new business standpoint as well. So all of that so far so good. We have received tremendous support from our distribution, both the fund distribution, as well as the ACE distribution and all of this, and is frankly, one of the reasons why we are seeing the retention rates where they are. Regarding the business that that we are not retaining, as Evan pointed out, there is really a couple of specific reasons for that. One of those is really some of that business is not meet our target client strategy, meaning that it\u2019s truly not high net worth business, so we are doing some selective re-underwriting their. I would say second category is business that we don't believe is adequately priced for the exposure particularly in some cap prone area. So, therefore, you see some of the business that we are not retaining, which again, all of that has been built into our models and really has been contemplated into financials. Cliff Gallant : Okay. All right. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Thanks. Just on the North America P&C business, the expense -- it looks you get about 210 bps of improvement year-over-year about two-thirds of that was expenses in acquisition in particular and second quarter in a row that that's been down year-over-year? Is there something changing there, reinsurance or some other attribute that's driving that acquisition ratio down or is that not something that we should think is should continue? Evan Greenberg : Well, it\u2019s going to continue. It\u2019s going to continue for a period of time. We have a mix of business change and we do have selectively in that mix of business more reinsurance and the biggest impact to all of that has to do with Fireman's Fund business that we picked up. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. Okay. Okay. And so that -- and on the other third being the underlying loss ratio, is it fair to assume that that\u2019s weather or lack of weather or is that potentially some mix shift as well? Evan Greenberg : Well, you see current accident, there is -- you see current accident year ex cat. So you understand how it looks without cat losses within it. We told you that there was some improvement due to the Fireman's Fund and when you adjust for that you can see how the loss ratio is very stable on year-to-year. Michael Nannizzi : Okay. So on apples-to-apples if you were to control for those shifts then pretty stable that\u2019s? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Sure. Michael Nannizzi : Yeah. Okay. And then, I also saw you -- ACE recently purchased\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I\u2019ll let you know, let me just say one thing is you know what\u2019s, it\u2019s up a little bit, that\u2019s a combination on one hand, you got price and trend and on another hand, you got mix changes and I do expect overtime, all things equal. You expect the loss ratios to rise a bit. Michael Nannizzi : Got it. Great. And then last, CoverHound, the company mentioned that it had taken a stake or in their release that ACE has taken stake in that company? Can you talk about and I think -- if I remember, the release mentioned some business through Fireman's Fund or that was being placed? Can you talk about like strategically what benefit that provided and is there also some opportunity with the new Chubb book to leverage that relationship as well? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. No. I am not going to talk much about it, the only thing I tell you is, I think in your mind you linked Novato, California with San Francisco, California linked Fireman's Fund and CoverHound, because we didn't put any linkage, but there is no linkage between Fireman's Fund and CoverHound. We are not doing any personal lines business with CoverHound and we have -- we really have no plans to. We like CoverHound. We like what we see in terms of their technology and their development and their algorithms to match customer to the right insurer. And they\u2019re very thoughtful people and stay tuned as to what more over time we may do with CoverHound. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re very welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Credit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. I guess my first question is just on the life segment. Obviously, you\u2019ve had this headwind from the VA run-off, I guess the last couple of years. But it sounds like international life insurance growth still remains pretty strong. I\u2019m just wondering if there is any visibility on where you might and when you might see that crossover, where growth from either USA, A&H, international life might be enough to kind of offset that headwind? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. That\u2019s a really -- that\u2019s a good question. And we look at that over time. The international life business was in a loss making position because it was green field and we were continuing to invest to grow it to build it because building distribution, agency distribution is costly. So we kept plowing into it. And it crossed over last year, this year into a positive earnings position. Its earnings over the next year, two and three will accelerate significantly and will overcome that number. Our projections are over the next five years so it has to happen year-by-year but that it will be a meaningful -- international life will become a meaningful contributor to ACE\u2019s earnings. Ryan Tunis : And I guess just to try by meaningful $100 million, more than that or \u2026 Evan Greenberg : To be meaningful in ACE, it has to have 100 -- it has to be in the 100 -- you have to have hundreds of millions to be meaningful to ACE. Ryan Tunis : Okay. Understood. And then I guess my second one was, I guess, just on professional lines in combining the two companies. And whether it\u2019s right or not, I think we think about Chubb as writing more primary layer professional lines business, ACE writing a little bit more access in large case. And I guess, how do you think about the opportunity longer-term integrating those two businesses? And is that the type of process that could cause near-term disruption because of any customer overlap? Evan Greenberg : No, not that much, very little. As we look at it, I think, you got it partially right. I mean, we look at it this way. Chubb is so strong in middle-market and small customer professional lines business. And there, of course, it's not shared and layered business, you're right in it, ground-up. In the shared and layered, the large account business, ACE is a very meaningful primary writer, as well as an excess writer, as well as an individual DIC writer, which is major on site A coverage, Chubb, as well writes in the large account space. We don't see an overlap by the way when we -- to the degree we are able to look at our concentrations of customer. We don't see an overlap that gives us concern and we don't see an overlap of significance. Ryan Tunis : Okay. That's helpful. Evan Greenberg : The franchise balanced between the two, one is more large account brokerage oriented, one is more agency and middle-market oriented, though they\u2019re both in each of the space that way and it\u2019s just going to enhance it. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Got it, Evan Greenberg : Is that Ryan? Ryan Tunis : Yeah. That\u2019s it. Thanks, Evan. I appreciate it. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Josh Stirling with Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling : Hi. Good morning and thank you for taking the call. So Evan, I was hoping I could start with the big picture question of strategy if you don\u2019t mind. I know you take a long-term view of the business. And I\u2019m wondering if you can walk us long-term how you are thinking about growth. I mean if we look back the past decade you\u2019ve organically had a lot of products, you done both on acquisitions, entered new markets and you took advantage more recently of a hardening market to accelerate the topline. But now the market softening and you\u2019ve got Chubb to digest, I\u2019m wondering how we should think about growth as we look out to next five or 10 years. And looking at the portfolio today, given all you build, what do you think of long-term run rate for growth would be, either the number you are shooting for internally or what we should think of as a sustainable target? Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. I\u2019m not putting out a long-term growth target but I\u2019m going to give you a picture. And I appreciate the horizon you are taking of 5, 10 years and ideal just within the five year period right now. We are already putting together teams to focus on what we see as meaningful growth opportunities, target opportunities. Chubb has approximately 4,500 agents in the United States because of the deep relationship with it. Chubb has industry verticals in the middle-market with deep product capability based on insights they have into those customers cohort. They have done a lot of study and a lot of work on, very thoughtful. Our ability to add and we can see it a middle-market oriented specialty products to the Chubb core portfolio to enhance industry verticals, grow them to enhance general market customer. Those customers in many instances in the products were contemplating together were already buying those products. And in many cases, those agents are already selling those products. It is not doing it for Chubb or that agent is not selling it to that customer, someone else is. And we see a whole lineup of that on one hand. Number two, the small commercial space is an area of very big marketplace, and it's an area that ACE\u2019s has been endeavoring along in a specialty way. Chubb has been contemplating, and Chubb brings traditional product capability that ACE doesn't have. ACE brings specialty product capability and some technology that Chubb doesn't have. And Chubb bring distribution that is awesome to be able to move into that space. We see a very large opportunity that way. And two other things on the U.S., when we think about it. In the upper middle-market area, ACE doesn't have a good traditional product offering in commercial auto and risk transfer comp. Chubb brings us capability in that area that will enhance our presence. Now, you have to be mindful of underwriting cycle and sometimes it will be a greater opportunity than others and it is one of the death valleys that are a few of them of the insurance industry, so we have to be very careful. I make those comments, so you understand we are well informed about all that, we are underwriters. But that is a real opportunity for us to begin tiptoeing into. In the personal lines area, stay tuned. That\u2019s a $41 billion, we can tell marketplace and we\u2019ll have between us somewhere around $5 billion of that. There are a lot of customers out there who are not buying high net worth product, though they have the need of the coverage\u2019s and the services that are provided. It\u2019s a long-term to grow that and get them out of the traditional writers that they are with, into something, into a product that more meets their needs and they are not really price conscious. They just don\u2019t focus on it. But the stay tuned is also about masterpieces. It\u2019s been a leader in the industry, in that industry. It really set the course. And it maybe time in a reasonable period of time to reveal masterpiece 2.0 and that's on our radar screen. When you get internationally, ACE has endeavored along both in brokerage and agency distribution as you know. We've grown both large commercial and we have grown middle-market commercial business on the continent in the U.K., modestly in those and in Latin America and Asia. Chubb colleagues that we will be adding bring us a lot more capability to add resource and industry verticals and product to our distribution on and to our -- and to bring enhanced distribution and to enhance our presence in that market. And we see it in a meaningful way and there are three or four or five countries right now on our radar screen that were building plans to move into. So I think the growth will start to show. You know, it takes time to put in place. I think it will find a way, without gaining it in anyway to reveal to show you the progress. It won\u2019t be right away. And -- but I think over the medium term, you look out couple of years, you\u2019re going to see meaningful additional revenue streams that the two of us as one company will be able to get that the two of us independently would never get. And over five years, I think it\u2019s going to be very meaningful revenue that will throw off we\u2019re underwriters, we\u2019re looking for margin. It will throw off meaningful margin. Josh Stirling : That\u2019s great. That\u2019s great Evan. Thanks for being so comprehensive. If I switch here just briefly, sort of the other side of the coin, integration and sort of operating risk management, sometimes good deals sort of flounder from lack of attention of details once you close [Technical Difficulty] but ultimately, I'm wondering as you think about the history of the industry, you think about other deals that went sideways. What are the big risks for integration and leveraging franchise that you guys are aware of and that you are sort of managing around it to try to avoid them? Evan Greenberg : I can't point with specificity to what I -- knowing what the failures are. I don\u2019t know them intimately of others. I can give you my own sense of it though. And that is that somehow you make a large acquisition and when it closes, it's like victory. I did it, we\u2019re done. Frankly, from the day we announced or I should say the day after we announced it, we dove right into what it\u2019s going to take to integrate with deepened integration planning. Really it is about detail. It\u2019s about understanding and causing all your colleagues to understand and everyone to conceptualize and then bring it down to a fundamental day-to-day action plan that you can execute, what are your expectations as to the true resource required, what is the organizational structure look like and who are the right people for it. And what is the right cost to improve that kind of a business or that kind of a service organization. And it has been and it is a drains-up exercise that we are going through. You want to get it done reasonably quickly. You can't linger on it where you\u2019re internally focused too much. And then you got to get on from the day you close with the implementation of it. And you can't lose your appetite or your passion for the detail of it. And we\u2019re looking at the detail all the time. And everyone is as we plan it and we know we've got short time so we have to begin executing. And that execution takes time. And it takes you -- when you run the cycle, it takes you two years to get -- to get other than mop up done. And you have been -- you have to be relentless. You can't lose your focus. You can't get bored with it. You got to know what has to happen and you've got -- and it takes leadership to lead people. It\u2019s a long march and you\u2019ve got to lead them from the beginning to the very end and you got to be intimate with it. And at the same time, you've got to -- you've got to in parallel well, create for your organization the vision of why you're doing it because you're doing it for the greater good, you're doing for the efficiency, you're doing it to be competitive, you\u2019re doing it so you can invest and you\u2019ve got to leading to it and show it because in parallel, you've got to move on growth opportunities and show the positive. At the same time, you're working on what is a difficult process of integration. And it takes a wide bench of managers and the managers or the team that has to leave it. And that team is inclusive. It's not we and they. Very quickly it is not ACE and Chubb, it is just Chubb. And it is all of us and it's getting people\u2019s mental mind around that that you are -- that that\u2019s what you\u2019re doing with, we are all colleagues, let\u2019s just get it done together. That\u2019s the whole deal. Josh Stirling : Okay. Thanks for the color. And good luck for the next quarter\u2019s job. Evan Greenberg : Got it. Operator : We will take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : Good morning. I want to follow up on that common, Evan, on the high net worth market. I just want to clarify, are you sizing the high net worth personal lines market at around $40 billion, of which the commodities Chubb would have $5 billion currently? Evan Greenberg : Go ahead, Juan. Juan Andrade : Yes. So Jay, thanks for that. Evan Greenberg : You may correct me. Juan Andrade : The U.S. personal lines market is roughly about $250 billion. I think the last estimate that was out there from Conning and a few others estimates high net worth to be roughly in the $80 billion range. What we\u2019re referring to in the $40 billion range is really a sweet spot in our target clients so what we\u2019d like to go after. And so when we think about our true client strategy of being high net worth, ultra high net worth customers that\u2019s really how we\u2019re sizing that market. Jay Gelb : Okay. Juan, why would the target market be half to the total? Juan Andrade : Well, these sort of\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Isn\u2019t that big enough for you? Jay Gelb : Okay. Evan Greenberg : You can\u2019t see on that. How about when we get close to that target, well the advice was about the other projects. Juan Andrade : Okay, Jay. These are approximate numbers and you know the way that does some of the firms out there, the consulting firms etcetera and the research firms identify high net worth is not exactly the way we do it. So for instance, Conning and a lot of the folks out there will define anything over a $1 million in value. Our homes typically are over $2 billion and $3 billion in value and higher. So we do identify subset of that high net worth market. That\u2019s really what we\u2019re looking at. Jay Gelb : All right. That\u2019s helpful. Then I guess more for Phil. Phil Bancroft : Don\u2019t worry, you meet our target customers. Jay Gelb : Actually I am and he is a homeowner\u2019s customer. I don\u2019t think many are asking. It might not be your target market though. With regard to the share buyback story\u2026 Phil Bancroft : Buddy, you always are, go ahead. Jay Gelb : With regard to the share buybacks, can you kind of clarify what the plan is for 2016, after the merger closes? And then what are you thinking about in terms of share buybacks as a percentage of annual earnings going forward? Phil Bancroft : Yes. What we\u2019ve said is that for '16 we expect no buybacks and when it gets to '17, we will let you know, right. We will see how the capital develops and we will make that decision as we go into '17 historically. Jay Gelb : Historically ACE standalone? Phil Bancroft : Buybacks are not the first thing on our mind. Jay Gelb : Okay. I mean, historically ACE has repurchased around equivalent of half of annual operating earnings and Chubb was higher, is that half level a potential starting point? Phil Bancroft : What are you calling historic? Jay Gelb : 2014. Phil Bancroft : I will take the last 12 years buddy and I don\u2019t think you would come to that number. Jay Gelb : All right. And then the last one if I can try on this one. So the ACE\u2019s effective tax rate in the low-teens, Chubb is in the mid-20s including the benefit for Chubb of a big municipal bond portfolio. Is it -- putting those two things together in year one after the transaction, is it then reasonable to expect that new ACE Chubb would have a higher tax rate than ACE on a standalone basis? Phil Bancroft : That\u2019s the way we planned it, right. We said that we don\u2019t expect to see -- we don\u2019t expect what we haven\u2019t built into our plans any changes to the reinsurance. As you know that our view has been this deal stands up without that and so that\u2019s the way we\u2019re going forward. Jay Gelb : That\u2019s what I thought too. Thank you. Phil Bancroft : No material reinsurance. Operator : And we will take our next question from Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Sarah DeWitt : Hi, good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Sarah DeWitt : Just a follow-up on the tax question. I would think there would be a substantial opportunity that\u2019s putting some internal quota share insurance and came from meaningful savings on the tax side as well. Could you just elaborate on why that would be the case? Phil Bancroft : No, we are not going any further with that line of thinking, but if you want to elaborate on why you think there is that opportunity, we\u2019re listening. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. Yeah. I think it\u2019s -- I would have think it would be like you\u2019d leave any money on the table, I think that would be a meaningful additional revenue treatment in addition to the strategic sense of the deal. Okay. And then just moving on\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I think you -- Sara, I think you are not thinking of it the right way, not the way we think about it. We don\u2019t do internal reinsurance for tax planning purposes and we never have. We do it for capital management purposes and we do it around how we manage our risk exposures and where we pool capital and therefore, pool risk so that we can manage volatility and we can manage our capital exposures that are spread around the world to be able to take the risks we take locally. So if you think that way about it and you put your head around that, I think then that leads you to a whole other line of thinking and I think you then understand why we are not going to expand on that on the call. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. Fair enough. And then just the unfavorable development in the A&H business. Could you just elaborate on what drove that and how we should be thinking about the run rate life earnings going forward? Evan Greenberg : Well, I think the A&H, we had a positive prior period development last year and so we just can\u2019t project reserve development. This year, 6 million bucks, it was noise and there's nothing systemic and it was in a portfolio where we just saw that it\u2019s quite profitable portfolio. But the loss ratio was running a little bit higher in there than we had estimated. And so we adjusted for it and just raised it. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. Great. Thanks for the answers. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Vinay Misquith with Sterne, Agee CRT. Vinay Misquith : Hi. Good morning. The first question is on other soft issues with integration. I'm sure you are doing a lot with the details. But just a big question on the cultural integration. Evan, it would be helpful to hear from you as to your own experiences and what's being done on a firm wide basis to integrate two very different cultures? Evan Greenberg : I have to tell you, the more we get in and look, and the more we work together, the more in my mind and I think in mind of my colleagues and I believe in the mind of our Chubb colleagues, those who've been working together. The cultural differences, there are far more cultural similarities than cultural differences. And I think the differences have to do a lot with simply speed and have to do with -- in some areas, what we consider what management responsibilities or supervisory level response plays, how broad are your responsibilities. I don't think -- I think what\u2019s so similar is our striving to execute with excellence. Our striving -- we both put a lot of pride on technical excellence, whether it is in underwriting or in claims, or in product, or an actuarial or an accounting. I think you find -- and that\u2019s one of the things we are seeing. Each one comes to the table and has sniffed the other one out as to, how are you about, how detailed are you and how deeply do you think about it. And I think we find that the similarities are gratifying. When we listen to each other's objectives and what you concentrate on and focus on to execute your plans, what's important to you. Speaking very similar ways, when we think about opportunities, we see it in a similar way. Chubb is an older company and has some of the attributes that we admire of an older company that is more mature in some ways in its processes and capabilities. I shout out -- I shout out claims to some degree with more training and development and some areas like that. ACE has invested more in technology. I don\u2019t mind saying that. As an example, we\u2019re both deep into data analytics. Culture requires -- now to answer your question directly, it requires leadership and management to be extremely visible in the behaviors and exhibiting the behaviors that they expect of everyone else. It\u2019s not just what you say, it's how you do it. People watch your actions and then they listen to the exact words you use, not your description of culture but how you live the culture. That is true of the senior most leadership and how we all display it. That then is emulated by the leaders of the next level and on down and it cascades. And that we are all vigilant to reinforce that is important. Yes, at the same time, we have groups working on what I\u2019ll call the more mechanical ends of it, of language that we use in common, so that we know what each other saying of being clear of here some of the behaviors that we all admire and should accelerate, what our brand identity is together. And so we give ourselves a name of -- a meaning behind the name of Chubb. Those are all things that we\u2019re paying attention to and that will happen here. But finally, culture is also built on shared experiences in my experience. And that is the more people work together and have shared experience together, that\u2019s what builds a common team spirit between yourselves. That\u2019s how you take from what starts out as a little more sterile to absolute familiarity and where people really are one because they've gone through it together and you can't short-circuit that. You can try to help it to happen and create those experiences. That will happen over time and you pay attention and you be patient about that part. Vinay Misquith : Okay. That's helpful. The second question is on the small commercial initiative. My thoughts or my views about small commercial, is that it\u2019s more of a low-touch business versus maybe the middle market to the higher end which is more high-touch? And that does small commercial is driven by technology. So could you help me understand how long do you think you would take to build up your technology? And what sort of investment do you think it would entail for you to be a meaningful player in small commercial? Kevin Shearan : Stay tuned, Vinay. We\u2019re not going any further with the roadmap. Vinay Misquith : Okay. All right. Thank you. Kevin Shearan : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jay Cohen with Bank of America. Jay Cohen : Yes. Thank you. Lot of my questions have been asked. One other question, so I think you talked about a run rate of $540 million for investment income. I believe last quarter was $550 million, although the new money rates still the same at 2.9%. So what -- it\u2019s not a big number but what changed in the interim? Evan Greenberg : We have to make estimates of calls and private equity distributions. And in our view, the portfolio is turning over to the new money rate even with the additional cash flow. Phil Bancroft : FX too. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. We have FX as well and we had at this quarter, the rates, the dollar\u2026. Jay Cohen : Got it. Make sense. Evan Greenberg : Dollar is strengthened more too, Jay. Jay Cohen : Got it. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Hi. Thank you. At my first, I just wanted to clarify. I believe you said that you hope to close the deal on early first quarter. And if I recall last call, you just have first quarter. Was I -- was I not listening closely enough last quarter or is that a change? Evan Greenberg : Ian, it\u2019s like Kremlin watches. There is no change, okay. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Evan Greenberg : No change. You have set the -- we\u2019re not worried about it. Yes, first quarter. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Okay. Just that you obviously got through some approvals already, so I don\u2019t know if that got things up. Okay. So, I also wanted to ask on the personal lines just to understand a little bit better the difference between how you go to market with Chubb and the Fireman\u2019s deal? So if I understood the way you were saying it under Fireman's essentially that name doesn't exist anymore, right. So you\u2019re just going to market that we think when they were new it becomes ACE and if you're going to have two separate papers in the market going forward. It\u2019s obviously, I mean, I just know what I shop before right. You get four or five names that got shown to you. It\u2019s now like you can get 20 like standard market personal auto. So, how in the agent\u2019s mind, are they going to have two, are they going to have representative from ACE and representative from Chubb that they are going to deal with? How do you -- not confuse the agents, I guess, what I\u2019m trying to get at if they are going to have two separate plans? Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s really -- Ian, it\u2019s very simple. They are going to have one Chubb person call on them. I\u2019m going to ask you a question about your homeowners insurance now. Here is your test buddy. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Evan Greenberg : You have an insurance company that you bought it from. Do you know the statutory company name on the paper, the actual statutory company name? So for instance, you buy from Chubb, you could be buying -- you are buying federal paper most of the time, do you know it\u2019s federal, where do you buy Chubb? Ian Gutterman : Understood. Okay. Evan Greenberg : So in this case, there is going to be under the Chubb brand umbrella multiple statutory entities. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Evan Greenberg : And so if you\u2019re the other statutory, if you bought from Chubb, you\u2019re going to still have Chubb. And there is going to be one Chubb representative calling on your agent who servicing you. I hope you are going to be one of our clients. Ian Gutterman : I already have though. Evan Greenberg : And so the underlying paper won't change, it may still say it's American as an example. Ian Gutterman : Okay. Evan Greenberg : Or say federal, that's the only thing we\u2019re saying, you have to distinguish the statutory, that\u2019s it. Ian Gutterman : I understood. Okay. I want to make sure you won\u2019t go in the market with Chubb was going to\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Oh, no, no. We have a month on month. Ian Gutterman : I think it\u2019s one handed base, got it. Okay, that\u2019s why it\u2019s already that. Okay. Got it. Evan Greenberg : What you got. You\u2019ve had two where there has been an emotional and intellectual test year that you're concerned about us right now. Ian Gutterman : I do. I have in Chubb clients. So I want to make sure you are not going to take away might not -- backup from me. Evan Greenberg : Your file is on Juan\u2019s desk. Ian Gutterman : Evan just lastly, you mentioned the asbestos usual analysis in Q4. Just give any changes you're seeing in the environment. We we've seen, I think from others charge continued to pick a little bit, it sounds like there is a little bit of increase sort of the typical increase in defense costs, maybe I don\u2019t know worse maybe or getting more real needs, there was these people are living longer. Anything, any color you can provide on, is it sort of business as usual or is it feel like things are gotten a little worst? Evan Greenberg : I think it\u2019s business as usual in what remains just a hostile environment. The liabilities are long-dated and they are in run-off, but we don't see any -- we don't see change to the environment. The legal environment has been hostile for years and that remains the mortality tables and means of longer has been baked into the thinking in that environment. You\u2019re right that that is something we've been living with. It\u2019s a dynamic. The plaintiffs going to more peripheral industries and defendants, whether it\u2019s pump manufacturers or those who make flooring has been going for a number of years. So, which end up with in development is really case specific as the cases ultimately develop and settle which is claims work much more than it\u2019s actuarial work. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Okay. Okay. Great. And that\u2019s all I had. I will let ask one off take it. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Thanks. Helen Wilson : Operator we will take question from one more person today. Operator : Excellent. And we will go next to Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thank you. So, Evan, just a quick question here. Last quarter I think you mentioned that even with the FX you expect to see mid-single digit revenue growth in the P&C business to year-end. It doesn't look like that\u2019s achievable. What\u2019s changed? Evan Greenberg : FX. Brian Meredith : Is FX just worse and you\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Yeah. FX is just worst and that\u2019s primarily, Asia and Latin America economically are a little slower. And you see some softness there, but that impacted us in the third quarter on the margin but marginally. It was more FX, was worse than, we took another leg down, the dollar took another leg up and you saw that. And that was not in our forecast, that was not in what we had forecasted, we did not anticipate that, that is how we would. Brian Meredith : Great. And then next question, what are the regulatory approval do you still need to close the Chubb transaction, Chubb major ones? Evan Greenberg : Well, we need, sure, we need and -- we need Insurance Department approvals. Brian Meredith : Okay. [Indiscernible] Joe Wayland : Different countries. Evan Greenberg : Six or seven, Joe is, go ahead. Joe Wayland : Yeah. We need approvals from six or seven state insurance departments and we need approvals from about same number of foreign regulators as well. Brian Meredith : Okay. And then last question, Evan, so ACE is known as a very efficient operator out there, as one of the big insurance company. I am just curious when you look at Chubb what disciplines and what area do you think you could make the more efficient, are there area that you kind of identified? Evan Greenberg : Not so much merger synergies but more what Chubb does. Phil Bancroft : I don\u2019t know enough yet, I can tell you one thing that what I -- they are thoughtful underwriters, thoughtful leaders, that way and how they think about their domain and their business, and we have seen that. And they have been very, they are thoughtful and how they manage claims and a lot of expertise. I doubt we are going lend a lot of benefit to their fundamental underwriting thinking. I think there will be colleagues and it will be on the margin that we will each find it. I think some of our rigors and process around enterprise risk management, and how we think about it and how we think about concentrations of exposure, and how we think about using our own capital and industry capital to manage that. I think they will -- I think that putting the two together we will gain from that. I think we will both gain from the insights overtime. It\u2019s not like throw the switch into the data and analytics of the two of us in that regard. I think that ACE, Chubb has deep distribution knowledge and experience in agency that will help us, help ACE. On the other side of the coin ACE has very broad distribution capabilities and experience in other channels of distribution, including direct response and we have technology in those areas that I think will overtime we will mix and match for each other, and help improve our overall distribution management. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Thank you. Helen Wilson : That\u2019s all the time we have today. So thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the\u2026 Operator : And this does conclude today\u2019s conference call. Thank you again for your participation and have a wonderful day.",

Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. This is our first quarterly earnings report for the combined company, the new Chubb. As you know, we closed the merger of the Chubb Corporation during the quarter, the largest P&C insurance transaction ever done. Our earnings for the quarter were very good, while our premium revenue results were somewhat impacted by market conditions, foreign exchange and the merger, and I will explain. On a reported basis, after-tax operating income for the quarter was over $1 billion or $2.26 per share, compared to $2.25 per share prior year. Since we closed on January 14, our reported results are missing two weeks of legacy Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, when adjusted for that two-week stub period, operating income was, in fact, $2.29 per share as compared to $2.25 last year, quite good. When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the underlying health of the company, it's more insightful for you and relevant if we compare the new Chubb, excluding purchase accounting and one-time merger-related items that distort underwriting, to the 2015-year first quarter, as if we were one company since January 1, 2015. As an operator, this is the way I look at our results. Therefore, on pro forma apples-to-apples basis, the new Chubb produced simply excellent underwriting results, highlighted by a calendar year P&C combined ratio of 88.9% and $720 million of P&C underwriting income. That was up 23% from prior-year first quarter. The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 88.8%. Pre-tax cat losses of $258 million in the quarter were lower than pro forma prior year by $57 million. Positive prior-period reserve development of $247 million pre-tax was up $55 million versus prior year. Both global P&C, which excludes agriculture, and our agriculture business produced excellent calendar year and accident year underwriting results. Net investment income for the full quarter was $812 million, again on a pro forma basis. This is a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates, and it was right in line with our expectations. Book value per share was up 10% in the quarter and stands at $98.85, while per-share tangible book value declined as expected, reflecting the dilution from the acquisition. If the acquisition had closed December 31 \u2013 so, again, on a pro forma basis \u2013 tangible book grew 4%. Our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 10.2%. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value, as well as prior-period reserve development and cat. Turning to revenue growth for the quarter, on a pro forma basis, global P&C net premiums written, which excludes agriculture, were down 1% in constant dollars or $65 million. Foreign exchange impacted premium revenue results in the quarter by about 4 points. Renewal retention rates were very good, so the impact to growth was mostly new-business related. As expected, market conditions have grown more competitive around the globe, and that impacted us. I will speak about that later. With the acquisition closing mid-January, there were also many merger-related activities in the fourth quarter and January/February, with employees focused on executing integration and learning the new organization. However, we are moving past this and will continue to do so. We had improved new-business growth in March and then April. Momentum is building, and to the extent premium revenue was impacted by the integration, we are expecting improved growth. Let me give you some more detail of our pro forma premium revenue results by major division, beginning with North America. For all of North America, including our commercial P&C business, agriculture and personal lines, net premiums written were down about 1.8% in the quarter. Let me break that down. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market and small commercial enterprises, net premiums were down 2%. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was a solid 87%. Renewal pricing was flat in the quarter, and both exposure growth and rates were essentially flat. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%, financial lines pricing was up about 2%, and property-related pricing was down 1%. New business writings were down 4% year-on-year. In our businesses serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we collectively call Major Accounts & Specialty, net premiums were down 5%. For our retail broker distributed Major Accounts business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was a very strong 91.5%. Pricing for the business we wrote overall was down 1%. General and specialty casualty related pricing was down about 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down 2%. And property-related pricing was down about 4.5%. New business writings were down 32% year-on-year, impacted by market conditions, plus merger-related focus, particularly again in January/February. New business activity in this division has, in fact, improved in March and April. Our North America personal lines business had a reasonably good quarter, with net premiums up 7.5% in constant dollars. Excluding the impact of Fireman's Fund, growth was over 3%. Rates were up 1%, and exposure change was a positive 3.7%. Net premiums for our agriculture business were down 27% in the quarter, primarily due to the premium gain/loss sharing formulas with the U.S. government for the 2015 crop year, which, by the way, was an excellent underwriting year. In fact, as we begin this year's growing season, and as far as we can tell, we have gained market share, and the number of farms we will be insuring may very well be at an all-time high. Turning to our international business, results were pretty good, and in fact better than we planned. Net premiums written for our global retail P&C business were up in the quarter nearly 4% in constant dollars. Growth varied depending on territory and product. Asia Pacific was up 6%, Latin America was up 4%, and Europe was up 2%. From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, which was a bit slower than expected. A&H grew 3%, and personal lines grew a strong 12%. In our London market-based E&S \u2013 Excess and Surplus lines business \u2013 premiums were down 12% due totally to market conditions. Just as an FYI, as contemplated by us when we initially planned the merger, in 2016 and 2017 we plan to shed or shrink net written premiums in certain portfolios, simply because we cannot earn adequate underwriting returns or because we want to reduce net cat-related exposures. These actions will benefit both the returns and the risk/reward profile of the company. We will update you periodically as to the impact this has on our net written premium growth rates. This will be in addition to the business-as-usual underwriting actions we take as market conditions warrant. Concerning market conditions, we are seeing a really great response from agents, brokers and customers all over the world and in all regions of the U.S. about the new Chubb. On the one hand, for agents, the combination of our commitment to the independent agency system, the service levels and attention they are experiencing, and the new products and capabilities we are and plan to bring to them are creating a lot of excitement and goodwill. For brokers and large-account clients, the size and quality of our balance sheet, our enhanced global capabilities (both service- and product-related), our consistency and focus in contrast to the problems they are experiencing with others, are all attracting more opportunity and our pipeline is building. I might add, the continuity of the employees our agents and brokers are working with at the local, regional and home office levels is both confidence-building and much valued by both our agents and brokers. This includes our outstanding claims and loss control organization, which hasn't missed a beat in terms of responsiveness. The pricing environment continues to grow incrementally more competitive, particularly in shorter tail lines. And, again, it really varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized, wholesale is more competitive than retail, and property is certainly more competitive than casualty-related, though casualty pricing in the main is not keeping pace with loss cost trends. None of this is a surprise. During the quarter, for our large middle-market commercial business, pricing was marginally better than we had anticipated, and for Major Accounts, about in line with expectations. John Keogh, John Lupica, Juan Andrade, and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter and current market conditions and pricing trends. On another subject, namely integration-related savings and the one-time costs associated with realizing them, as we continue to do our work, we are providing an update to our initial disclosures regarding value creation and efficiencies. In terms of integration-related savings, we are now projecting to exceed our original target of $650 million, or $610 million at current foreign exchange rates, and expect an annualized run rate of approximately $750 million by year-end 2018. Total one-time costs related to the merger are expected to be $811 million and consist of one-time expenses of $525 million directly attributable to achieving the $750 million savings and other one-time expenses of $286 million related to the merger, such as transaction costs, branding and employee retention costs. In addition, as a result of the merger, by the fourth quarter we are also now projecting an improvement to our annualized investment income run rate of $100 million to $120 million in what we would otherwise earn as we improve investment portfolio management. Phil will have more to say, including the timing by year for achieving integration-related savings and the related costs, as well as the timing for achieving the improved investment income run rate and how you should think about that. We are on track with all of our integration plans, including organization structure, process, people, technology, and growth initiatives, which are at a very early stage. Integration is going as expected, including cultural integration, which is going well. As we've said from the beginning, you don't just wave a wand and put two strong cultures together. It takes some time. It's a process that you pay attention to, that you care about and that you lead. While there are some differences between our two cultures, they are not profound. We are far more alike than different. As we focus on day-to-day business activities, we are breeding familiarity and knitting ourselves together at every level of the company. All employees, starting with leadership, are invested and paying attention. Our organization is stable, and in fact it is doing well. Our people are more and more engaged and focused on serving clients, writing business, and overall value creation. Again, client retention is excellent and customer and distribution partner reception in the marketplace has been outstanding. In sum, we're off to a really good start, and the value creation that will come from our company is greater than we imagined when we announced the acquisition. With that, I'm going to turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and we're going to take your questions. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Evan. This is our first quarter as the new Chubb, and we're starting out in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities around the globe, with total capital exceeding $59 billion. Our loss reserves are conservative and in great shape. We have a $99 billion portfolio of cash and investments that's highly-rated and liquid, and we're generating substantial positive cash flow. Adjusted net investment income was $767 million in the quarter. This was within our expectations when factoring in the 14 days of investment income prior to the close of the acquisition on January 14, which amounts to approximately $45 million. As Evan noted, we've analyzed the investment portfolio and believe that through more active management we can raise the run rate of investment income higher than it otherwise would have been by approximately $100 million to $120 million annually without taking any significant additional risk. We plan to maintain a high level of quality with our AA rating and keep duration at approximately four years. This increase in investment income, together with future operating cash flow, will help to offset the natural impact of reinvestment at lower new-money rates. Our current book yield on the portfolio is 3.4% and new money rates are 2.5%. Before the improvements in investment portfolio management, we would have expected quarterly investment income to be in the range of $790 million to $810 million. Now, with the improvements, we expect quarterly investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $840 million for the balance of the year. As a reminder, the estimated investment income run rate is subject to variability in portfolio rates, call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $952 million pre-tax and include a $846 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates; a $244 million mark-to-market loss on our VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates; and a $350 million gain from FX. Before you ask, hedge fund investments represent less than 0.5% of our portfolio. They have never been a significant part of our strategy. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a little over $1 billion, and $1.3 billion when adjusted for the 14-day stub period and one-time merger-related costs. Tangible book value per share was down 25.5%, reflecting the expected dilution of 29% at the acquisition close, offset by our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned. Net loss reserves increased $21.4 billion for the quarter, largely due to the Chubb acquisition. On a pro forma basis, loss reserves increased $125 million, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior-period development, the ratio was 92%. Cat losses for the quarter were $258 million pre-tax, primarily from U.S. weather events. Prior- period reserve development was positive $247 million pre-tax, and comprised $135 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2010 and prior, and $112 million from short-tail lines. The positive short-tail development includes $41 million relating to agriculture for the settlement of the 2015 crop year. Our Life segment earnings were negatively impacted by $9 million after-tax of unfavorable claim reserve development in our U.S. combined insurance operations and the run-off of our VA reinsurance book. Our press release includes a table showing our expectations for the amount and timing of the recognition of integration savings and one-time integration expenses over the 2016, 2017 and 2018 years. We also include the annualized run rate for savings we will achieve by the end of each year. For 2016, we expect the expenses to be weighted more heavily to the first half of the year and the savings to be weighted to the second half. Our tax rate on operating income from the quarter is 16.5%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges. For example, the first quarter tax rate is at the low end of the range due to the timing of the integration savings, which again are weighted to the second half of the year, and front-end purchase accounting amortization. As additional color, embedded in our annual effective tax rate estimate is the impact of our higher debt leverage. As part of the transaction, we have an intercompany loan that benefits our tax expense by $19 million in the quarter. We are comfortable that the loan will not be affected by the recent treasury guidelines. The combination of our internal and external financing of the Chubb acquisition favorably impacts the annual effective tax rate by approximately 2 points, which is contemplated in the range that I noted. Lastly, I'll point out that we have added some disclosures this quarter as highlighted in our 8-K filing last week. We now show our North America Personal Lines business as a separate segment, and we're providing premium information for the regions of our Overseas General Insurance segment. We plan to provide a global line of business written premium chart in the second quarter. We have also provided pro forma underwriting information for 2016 and 2015 that shows 2016 without purchase accounting adjustments related to the Chubb transaction, and includes the 14 days of January before the acquisition closing for comparative purposes. As a reminder, when estimating our net written premium growth for the second quarter, last year's quarter included $252 million of one-time benefit from Fireman's Fund that will not repeat. Therefore, when Evan referenced improved net written premium growth that we expect in the second quarter, that growth is over a 2015 base that does not include the one-time Fireman's Fund benefit. I'll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. And we will go first to Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. Thank you. First question is on the expected merger synergy about \u2013 raised to $750 million. And also the pace of the realization seems faster than originally anticipated. So, could you give more detail about so why it's bigger now, and what's the difference from what you'd previously anticipated, as well as the pace of it? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, first of all, the pace of it, you already have. We gave you a chart that shows you, by year, the annualized and the realized of the expenses, I don't think anybody gives you that. And so you have that clarity already. The $750 million \u2013 the increase, it doesn't come from one place. It comes from actually many places. As we've simply done more ground-up detailed work, it comes from operations all over the world, and it's more focused in support operations and back-room than it is in any front-room activities. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Outside these merger synergy and increased investment income, are there other areas you think there could potential opportunities for the combined entity? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. We will update you periodically if anything materially emerges beyond that. I think the real ultimate benefits, which take time, and which are really the vision of it, is revenue-related growth synergies, and those are at a very, very early stage, but we're already beginning to see benefits there in terms of the increased product capabilities we bring to customers at distribution. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Then to just follow up on that, potential revenue growth opportunities, could you talk a little bit more about sort of three specific area in terms of high net worth and also middle market commercial lines, as well as international opportunities? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. In high net worth, what did you want me to tell you? Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Just wondering, like, is that how the integration has been, and because we recently heard some of the competitors essentially hiring likely Chubb people, try to start a business there. Do you see potential lose of business, and what's the area of growth from current levels? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, when we did the merger, we imagined \u2013 it doesn't take a lot of imagination, in fact, to imagine that as a result of putting three of the four major players in high net worth together, that you would ultimately breed additional competitors in that space. And I've said that from the beginning, and that is a healthy thing. The market needs choice, number one. Number two, the \u2013 it isn't about the roughly $10 billion high-net-worth market, or $8 billion or whatever it is, that exists today. It's about the market that we imagine is in the $30 billion or $40 billion range of those who require or really need a richer product that is rich in service, rich in coverage, rich in benefits, and more about service and benefits than it is about price. And those individuals who have a lifestyle and assets to protect are insured in more standard lines companies right now. And the long-term play is to attract them and serve them in the high-net-worth market. So that's the real play. What I'd say about competition is pretty simple. To step up to the standards and the level that Chubb represents, which is the gold standard of the business, requires years of investment and attention. You don't build something like this overnight. The capabilities you have to bring in terms of service capabilities, both risk and engineering services to individual customers, and the claims service capabilities, and the richness of the coverages, and the ability to service them all over the globe. Well, I'll tell you what, that's not an easy lift, and you win these customers one by one, and the average premiums can vary anywhere from $5,000 to a couple of $100,000. It's hard work. So to anybody entering the space, it is a good business. And if you do it right, it takes a lot of patience, a lot of capital, and good luck. And by the way, we'll put the welcome mat out for you. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's good. When do you expect those revenue growth opportunity will emerge materially to the income statement? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I'm not speculating on the period. But what I did say is, you would \u2013 I did say initially, and I hold to that, that we expect for all the efforts we're doing right now that are revenue-related, they will really begin to show in a material way by year three. Though we're already seeing it in cross-sell around the organization as we bring more specialty and our large account capabilities to the middle market and agency distribution that we have. And we will, as we have something meaningful to say about that, update you as we go along. And that I don't expect as a year three, I expect that's a year one, two, and three. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Great. Well, thank you so much for the answers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning. Evan, I guess my question is just on new business in North America. It sounds like that was more of an issue this quarter potentially than retention. Just wanting a little more detail on what was driving the softness there, it sounds like earlier in Q1. And what's allowed things to improve more recently? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Sure. Ryan, you see, or you heard me say it, it was more large account than it was in the middle market area, though middle-market new business was down about 4%. Large account was down around 30%. January was a much tougher month in terms of new business than February, and March was better, and April was better than March as we go forward. So we know a combination of things as we look at it. Definitely there was \u2013 it was a more competitive environment in January. And January is always a competitive month relative to other months. Matter of fact, if \u2013 I have to tell you, the softer part of cycle, you're better off to try to write your new business in the off months of a quarter. January is tough, April can be tough, March/April, and June/July is like January, the way people go after it. And they have some growth objectives that they want to achieve. So, there was some impact from that, and we see that. But in the fourth quarter, we had a lot of people \u2013 we focused for six months very intensely on planning the merger. And there were sort of 11th-hour jitters of people as we come up to close and everybody is focused on to a degree of the integration and the structure and who am I working for and what is my job. And then the integration itself, all the planning of that, just takes time, and it's some time away from working on new business. And January, and to a degree February, is impacted by your activities in the fourth quarter, which is November/December. And then we close the middle of January, so everybody then has to execute. And there is just a mountain of execution when you take it by function, by area of business, by geography, all over the world. And I'm very proud about how we've executed, because people have done it \u2013 it's been in a \u2013 there haven't been a lot of surprises, everybody's known what to do, and it's gone very smoothly. And then people have been \u2013 spent a lot of time getting to know each other, and getting to know what the capabilities were and learning the products of each other before you can take it out to market. And we could really begin to feel that start to take hold in February, move into March, and as it moves into April it just keeps on building. So, maybe that gives you a little sense. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Yeah. That's very helpful. Thanks. And then my follow up is just on small commercial. I'm just hoping you could a little bit more about the opportunity there, now that you've brought out more detail on it, I think, from a product standpoint earlier in the quarter. And just how important is the small commercial initiative overall to your revenue synergy outlook over the next few years? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : As is characteristic of, I suppose, of our organization and of me, I'm not going to do a lot of talking about something that we're building and planning. I'm hardly going to stick a roadmap out there. And we let results and activities speak. But we have all the parts and ingredients, we have the sticks to rub together and make fire. And we have the distribution, we have the data and the know-how, and we have the insight, we have the focus, we have the resource that we're putting attention to, we have the roadmap for technology and we're coming. And we are building right now, and focused on building \u2013 we already had, between the organizations, a nascent, what I call a nascent small commercial business, modest, very modest in size, and specialty-oriented. And that continues. Those efforts continue, and they have a reasonably aggressive plan in action \u2013 a set of actions to achieve results in 2016. But that's not the main event for us. This is an $80 billion marketplace, and we intend over the next number of years to grow \u2013 to be a meaningful player. I might say, a little like I said about high net worth, you really have to \u2013 it takes time to build capabilities, to build all the services and product know-how, to have the right insights into pricing, and to execute, because it's work-intensive. The average premium sizes are small, it's high transaction volume, and you've got to win over and wire up the distribution, and we are focused on all of that. And so, over the next few years, I expect that to grow and be a meaningful contributor to our business, and as it's appropriate, we will update you more specifically. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks for the answers... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Don't look for much out of me in 2016. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks. And appreciate the good new disclosure and information on the merger you guys gave. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): First question, Evan, I guess is on the Personal Lines, on international. The growth was strong there. And curious what parts or regions you're seeing and how the brand change, I guess, is working on international. Obviously, the Chubb brand I think has better name recognition in the U.S. than it might internationally. And curious about how the international Personal Lines is going. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, the brand change had no impact on our revenue growth in the quarter. The growth is pretty broad-based. It came from both specialty and traditional. It came from a wide range of geographies, from Mexico to Malaysia to Europe, where we do a lot of specialty, so broad-based. In Mexico it's automobile and small commercial-related, but automobile in particular. In Malaysia it's auto and, again, specialty and small commercial-related. We write cell phone insurance out in Asia, and that had nice growth. In Europe we write cell phone-related insurance, and that had really nice growth. So, it isn't from one place nor one geography, and it isn't traditional versus specialty, it's broad-based. But it's very \u2013 when I say broad-based, we're very targeted and focused about where we choose to do Personal Lines and how we choose to do it. It's easy to put on a lot of revenue in that business. It's not easy to do it and make a decent margin. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): What's the opportunity on the high-net-worth business on the international front, as opposed to how \u2013 the size of the business in the U.S.? Is that a meaningful focus for you guys now, or... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It's a focus. Meaningful? It's nothing like the United States. And it's not going to \u2013 I don't think of it in terms of \u2013 if I think of the U.S. as high net worth is a meaningful business, I don't think of international high net worth that way. I think of it as a good business. It's a very good business and a good opportunity. But it's really focused in a limited number of territories. UK, Australia, maybe a little bit on the continent, that's the majority of it. The balance is small pockets of high net worth, and that's mostly serviced by us out of our London operation. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks. And just one final one, and maybe it's for Phil. On the tangible book value calculation that you guys do, the tangible \u2013 the goodwill is done net of tax... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes it is. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): ...which I think is different than how you did it before. Just trying to understand how that \u2013 to expect to flow through going forward? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It would definitely be done net of tax. Goodwill and other intangibles would be reflected net of tax in our calculation of what tangible book value represents. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And will that tax basis off the goodwill, will it be fluctuating over time or going down, or is that kind of \u2013 it seemed like the goodwill, in historic, kind of stayed flat. So I'm just wondering if that's something that's going to change. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It should not. It would decrease in relation to the amortization of the intangibles. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thank you very much for the answers, guys Operator : From Barclays, we go next to Jay Gelb. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I was hoping you could expand a bit more on the opportunity to gain market share resulting from several of the other large global commercial insurers facing some dislocation, in terms of the brokers looking to have stable capacity for their customers? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I've talked about this a little bit in the past. And so I'm going to \u2013 I'll talk a little more about it. The first thing I'll tell you is, is it's a double-edged sword and you got to be careful. On one hand, as I said the last time, when there's a wounded animal loose, be careful. Stay out of the way and don't try to corner it. On the other hand, look, we represent \u2013 and that's what I tried to say in my commentary \u2013 we represent a very attractive market, an alternative for large accounts seeking a deep balance sheet, great underwriting expertise, as you know, great reputation for service, global capability, broad product offering and services. There are \u2013 and by the way, which has become more and more the play in large account business, your technology, your ability to deliver in a way that the service standards are met, the service expectations are met \u2013 and those standards of service have only risen, the expectations have only risen over the last decade, in the last five years and three years. People expect great data, great information in a very rapid way, self-served way where they can serve themselves. We have that technology. Very few have that. Our ability to move money, our ability to service self-insureds, our ability to risk engineer, our ability to provide primary casualty coverages, including professional lines, all over the world, and service claims, very few can do that. And we have been stable in terms of our capacity offering and our approach to underwriting and/or pricing. Sometimes the market moves closer to us, when the market is more disciplined in terms of underwriting. Sometimes the market moves further away from us because others are willing to sell something at a price we consider too cheap or at terms we consider too broad. So, on one hand, we're in a market where it's competitive and some things are being sold at prices that are below costs we think are reasonable. On the other hand, there is this pull and desire for stability and certainty and familiarity, and that is drawing more towards us. So I can tell you, we just came back from RIMS. All of us there, I have not seen a reception towards our company in \u2013 towards this company, I don't think I've ever seen the reception like I saw at RIMS. We were really popular kids on campus. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: All right. Thanks for that. And then for Phil, should we still think about, in terms of share buybacks, no activity for 2016, but perhaps more likely in 2017? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We have no plans at this point for buybacks, and we'll keep you posted as we go, as we see how our capital develops. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next comes from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you very much. Just a couple of questions, if I could, quickly on Personal Lines within the overseas segment. You mentioned the growth there. What does the profitability look like in that book? Is it closer to the segment overall, or is it closer to what you generate in the North America personalized business? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I am hardly going there. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Okay, well then back to the U.S. Do you think that in that book, that you have an opportunity to grow at these levels of profitability? I mean, is there still enough room in that high-net-worth segment, either because of your consolidation really or because of the expansion of that market, for you to grow consistently? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. And, Michael, on international, the profitability meets our hurdle rates, and it meets our underwriting standards or we wouldn't be doing it. But I'm hardly going to put a roadmap out to others. On the domestic and margin, there's been questions to us of, well, now that you're so dominant in that business, we assume you're now going to now, in a sense, be predatory, take advantage, raise prices, et cetera. Increase margins. I think there's a na\u00efvet\u00e9 about all of that, and I think that's wrong. Our approach is to earn an adequate risk-adjusted return in the business. The business does that reasonably well today. There is a lot of risk in the business. The business is regulated. You have to file your rates, and they have to be just \u2013 they have to be actuarially justified, and we do that. And that adds a complexity, but adds a stability as well. Secondly, we want to win customers by offering a great service at a fair price, and hardly do we want to try to push it where we make our money simply on \u2013 try to make more money on the cohort we have, rather than grow the cohort, if we're making an adequate risk-adjusted. So, with all of that, what I'd say to you is, we see stability as we look forward in the margins in the business, and we don't consider that we're making excessive returns. On a risk-adjusted basis, we are not. We're making reasonable returns. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Got it. And then, is there a material difference between legacy Chubb's acquisition cost in sort of the personalized business versus legacy ACE's? And is that something \u2013 if there is, is that an opportunity for the combined company? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There is not. Agents are \u2013 they are very efficient when it comes to acquisition cost, and they are a great market leveler, and they are highly intelligent. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: All right. Great. Thank you very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Thank you. Operator : Up next is Vinay Misquith of Sterne Agee CRT. Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT : Hi, good morning. The first question is on the premium growth. There was a modest 1% premium decline this quarter, I guess because of competition and some integration. And curious, Evan, if you could parse out what was the bigger impact, and when do you think the drag from the integration will recede? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Vinay, I think I just have gone on about that for the last 20 minutes. And I think my commentary said it. So, I can't \u2013 if you're looking for a point estimate, a numeric estimate of what was specifically integration-related versus market-related, I can't give you that. Nobody knows that. Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT : Okay, sure. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But I can tell you that the market \u2013 market discipline, for those who are disciplined in underwriting, absolutely is having an impact on growth rate, and you could see that as you look at players who have reported. And that definitely has an impact on us. And you know there were times, and I've said this, I've been very clear, that there are times that revenue is for vanity, and revenue growth is for vanity, and it's best you take your eye off of that. And there are pockets of the business, many pockets of the business where I and my colleagues think that it's not an overly attractive market, and you better discriminate very carefully on what you choose to write and how you choose to write it, if you want to maintain underwriting margins. And that's our first objective. So I will shed revenue without a tear in any class, in any line of business, where we can't make an underwriting profit, period. And you know that about us. The retention rates were very high. And that to me shows me the market reaction towards us and the demand for business from Chubb, from doing business with Chubb, by both distribution and customers, and the good work of our people. When I look at the pattern of new business and how it came in, and where it came in, and the timing of it, it's very clear to me that the integration \u2013 and in discussions with our people \u2013 that the integration had an impact. And when I look at how we're moving month-to-month, I can see that beginning to recede. And people really getting on without getting out there and driving for it. So I see a combination of both impacting it. I can't do anything about the market, and that will be what it will be. But I can tell you, getting the organization focused, that is something we can do something about. And we're all focused on that. Everyone is out there. We've been to many regions, to many offices, working with our people and helping them to get on the front foot, and I feel really good about the energy level and the focus of the organization that is taking hold. And to the extent that that impacts revenue growth, you can look forward to improved results as we go forward. Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT : No, that's helpful. The second question is for Phil. And first of all, thank you so much for the expanded disclosure. That's really helpful and is helping all of the sell-side with these \u2013 our numbers. From the expense synergies, how much of that was actually realized in the first quarter? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, the actual accounting saved in the first quarter was $29 million. Vinay Misquith - Sterne Agee CRT : And that's helpful. Thank you. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Okay. Operator : And from UBS, we go next to Brian Meredith. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes, thanks. Just two quick numbers questions, and one other one just quickly. So, Phil, on the $100 million to $120 million of additional investment income, what's the after-tax number? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Let see. Let's call it $75 million on the low end of the range. So $100 million translates into $75 million. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Terrific. And then second question, exposure to couple of earthquakes we've seen recently, and some of the activity in Texas? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. We will have losses from the activity in Texas, from the earthquake in Latin America, from the earthquake in Japan. From the two earthquakes, from what we know at the moment, our losses will relatively modest. Nothing outsized. And from the losses in Texas, normal spring losses, you expect these kinds of losses in the springtime. It's the volatility of weather. More tornado-related activities, severe storm related, flooding, hail, all occurs, as we know, in the second quarter. And so this kind of activity, so far to date, what we're seeing is not producing losses beyond what we would imagine or expect. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then last question, Evan, you struck this relationship with Suning and, hopefully, I'm pronouncing that correctly, in the quarter. Could you give us \u2013 elaborate a little bit on what the potential is there for that relationship, how quickly you expect it to ramp up? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. I expect it to ramp up and begin showing \u2013 potentially, you don't know with certainty, but potentially \u2013 real premium revenue in 2017. It is direct response marketing in all its forms, digital, phone-based, predominantly of simple accident-, travel- and credit-related products, maybe some small commercial; householder's-type products to serve the customer base of Suning, that is approximately 130 million people that are active users of Suning. Suning has about 1,500 \u2013 thereabouts, I'm sure I have the number wrong, but thousands of stores throughout the country, and then they have a very large, very active online business. They serve financial needs of over 30 million customers, and we will be active \u2013 and do it in a digital way, and we will be actively marketing to those. The cooperation \u2013 it's one thing to sign one of these. It's another thing that actually operationalize. And we're just beginning the operational phase. And this is something that the real meaningful benefit will come over a few years. But Suning, in very early days, is showing to be a very active and cooperative partner and is giving us a lot of access to data, a lot of encouragement in terms of use of their distribution, and is very welcoming with building the business, and I'm grateful for that effort. So, this could be \u2013 we're cautiously optimistic this could be a great venture. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : And it's on your paper or Ho Tai's paper? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, this is on our paper. It's on Chubb. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Great. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We've got 100% of this. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Perfect. Operator : We'll go next to Josh Stirling of Sanford Bernstein. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Hi, good morning. Thank you for taking the call. So, listen, I just wanted to touch a bit more on growth from more of a long-term perspective. Obviously, we all think of you as a growth company, but with the moving pieces of the market and integration, it was obviously a flat quarter. When you, Evan, look across the portfolio and look a couple of years out, what kind of long-term organic growth rates do you guys think are potential? And I think this is an important question for us, because it's hard to figure out from the outside, given all the different growth businesses you have at legacy ACE \u2013 and in combination with, obviously, the legacy Chubb opportunity. And I would really love to get a sense of what you're shooting for, and what you think may be able to get through the cycle, kind of long-term underlying organic growth potential might be? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah. So, I'm going to answer \u2013 give you two answers. First, you didn't define growth the way I define growth. And the way, therefore, we define growth \u2013 a growth company for us. A growth company in this business is growth in book value and tangible book value. That's how you define growth in a risk business. Not revenue growth, which is an overly simplistic way. Ultimately, you have to gain revenue growth as well. So I reject that notion of what's a growth company. Number two, we will \u2013 we don't give guidance. And so I'm not going to start giving guidance about revenue growth. But I will say this to you. I firmly believe that whatever the growth rate was projected \u2013 and at ACE, we do long-term \u2013 at ACE, we did long-term five-year plans. We would roll forward every year. And we had a projection of what we thought our growth rates would be over a coming five-year period. I have a sense of what Chubb, legacy Chubb, would have thought of its growth potential over a two-year to three-year period and what they would have seen. I do firmly believe that when you sum those two together, the two together will have greater growth than the two would \u2013 the sum of the two separately would. There is little doubt of that in my mind. How significant? We have ranges internally from what we think might be conservative to what we think might be more aggressive, but when I pitch it up the middle, I think it will be meaningful. And I did say that I thought that by the fifth year, it would come into the billions of dollars range, and multiples of billions, and I believe that, from what it otherwise would be. While that's not a \u2013 what you wanted as an answer from me specifically, I hope that gives you some insight. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Sure. Sure. We'll take it and work with what we can. If I just were to ask you more tactically, managing risk through the soft market is a major focus for a lot of investors. Could you walk us through a little bit of your sort of tactical playbook as you think about maintaining margins through the next three years or four years? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, maintaining margins is about underwriting, and it's about underwriting selection, and it's about your portfolio. What I love is the balance of business in this company. By geography, when I look at opportunities through Asia, when I look at opportunities in Latin America, when I look at opportunities through the United States, and I just look geographically, I see \u2013 and in Europe \u2013 I see so much room to move, where there are some territories and some lines of business that, you know, to maintain margin you need to shrink. I see other areas where we have the capabilities, we have the presence, and it's about execution to grow in those areas. And when you have the data we have and the knowledge we have, putting that to work, it is a job of execution at that point. When I look at our spread of business by type of business, by customer, from large segment where it's obviously \u2013 except for the dislocation of others that put some wind at your back, it's obviously the more difficult area to grow. And in fact, you're going to go sideways or shrink in many areas of that business if you're going to maintain underwriting discipline. But I then look on the other side of the coin at the middle market, and the capabilities we have in that area, and our reputation and our relationships and our ability to drive more product and grow that more quickly, that just gives me a lot of optimism. I look at our A&H business around the world. I look at our personal lines business, both in the United States and outside the U.S., and potential in that area, I add it all up. And there are areas where you apply the gas and then areas where you apply the brake. And we know how to do that quite well. And as I said, I will never get baited into revenue growth to maintain margins. And when my guys are feeling a little bad because they have to shed business to maintain margin, I got to tell you what, I suck it up and I cheerlead it, because it's the right thing to do. Josh Stirling - Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. LLC: Great. Thanks, and good luck. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Thank you. Good luck to you, too. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning, and congratulations on a strong first quarter at the new Chubb. I just wanted to drill down on the expense savings. How much do you expect to drop to the bottom line? My sense is legacy Chubb was somewhat underinvested in, so are the expense savings net of any reinvestment, or how much could that be? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. We haven't figured in \u2013 that's not net of reinvestment. And Sarah, you have a natural growth \u2013 I'm not going to give you any point estimate number. You have a \u2013 but I'll give you a way I think about it, and \u2013 two ways. One, you have a natural growth rate of expenses based on your invested base of businesses, and you can see that, you see how ACE has been disciplined in expense and Chubb was disciplined in expense. So the overall organization is disciplined that way. You then have some investments you make in new businesses. So, small commercial, as an example, or maybe you're expanding your cyber business or other businesses, and those will take investments. And then on the other side of the coin, we're \u2013 if we talk about legacy Chubb as being starved in some ways \u2013 and I think that's right \u2013 on one hand, it's technology. And so you invest in technology, but there you have a cash spend, but you then capitalize and amortize over many years. So that impact will not be, as you would imagine, sort of $1 of expense and $1 drops to the bottom. But you got a cash flow, and then you have an amortization of it. So those are what draws away from expense saved. And from the direct \u2013 coming directly all to the bottom. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then on the reserve... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I didn't help you worksheet manage it that much better, I got it. But we each live in our own hell. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : No, no. That's helpful insight, though. And then on the reserve releases, that was higher than I would have expected. Could you just talk about the difference... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : What did you expect? Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : A little bit lower than the pro forma year-ago. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : How did you do your number? Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : It was not that scientific, I will tell you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I thought so. I'm sorry, I just had to do that. It was like, well, what do you think, how'd you do it? Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : More directional. But could you just elaborate, are there differences between the reserve processes at legacy Chubb and legacy ACE? For example, does one company let the reserves season for longer, or does one company take them down quicker, historically? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yeah, there was \u2013 the one thing I'm going to say, and then I'm going to ask a colleague of mine to give you a little more insight into it, there was not a change in reserving process, the way of thinking about reserve at either legacy Chubb or legacy ACE, that produced this. There was consistency. And I'm going to ask Sean Ringsted to now just give you a little more. Sean Ringsted - Executive Vice President, Chief Risk Officer & Chief Actuary, Chubb, Ltd.: Morning, Sarah. I think, just by way of background, as we went into the integration we found a lot of similarities between the companies, as opposed to differences, and the differences are very much at the margin. Both companies have robust processes, we've got really good teams of actuaries and good control environments, and the methods and the assumptions in the reserving methodology are pretty consistent across like products. And I think too, and you've heard Evan emphasize this on prior calls, we \u2013 both legacy companies have a conservative approach, especially to long-tail casualty lines. There are some differences, I'd put those at the margin. Clearly, our process in terms of timing and frequency of studies would be different, our reserving platforms are different, but we're working to converge those processes and expect to have that done in 2017. So I think you'll find far more similarities in the respective processes, and we're going to enjoy continuing those in the future. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. And we have time for just one more person to ask questions, please. Operator : Thank you. And we'll take our final question from Jay Cohen of Bank of America. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Great. Just two questions, I think they're relatively quick. First for Phil, the interest expense on an ongoing basis, where will that land? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's in our interest expense in the corporate segment. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, I mean what's the number? Is the first quarter a good number to use going forward? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is. It's a complete number. All right, you know what... Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...I would do \u2013 there's 14 days of the interest expense that we didn't put into operating income, so I would just gross that up, the one-sixth of the quarter that wasn't there. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's what I figured, I wanted to check that. Thank you. And then secondly, on the investment income, the pick-up you talked about, what changes to the portfolio are you making to achieve that higher run-rate of investment income? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, we've had extensive discussions with our outside managers who have a real deep expertise in asset allocation and municipal and corporate credit research, and our analysis shows that we can restructure the portfolio within securities and sectors that enhance the yield and diversify the holdings. And I just want to re-emphasize that those actions are not going to alter the risk profile of the portfolio, we'll keep the overall credit rating at AA. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Phil, is part of the benefit that Chubb had a big muni portfolio? The tax structure of the overall company, was it a bit different? Can that be restructured a bit, or is that really not... Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : I think... Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : ...part of the game plan? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : ...over time, I think we can more actively manage the municipal portfolio, but that'll take time, as a lot of that is long-dated. So that's certainly part of it, to change from a really high-rated long-term hold strategy to more active management in the muni portfolio. But not... Unknown Speaker : Your question was, as a percentage of the total portfolio. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We don't expect that to change. Unknown Speaker : Right. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks for the answers. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President - Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: Okay. Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you, and good day. Operator : This concludes today's presentation. Thank you all for your participation. Operator : Thank you for calling.",

Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introductions, I'd like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please, go ahead. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2016 second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions and integration of acquisitions including our acquisition of the Chubb Corporation, and potential synergies, savings and commercial and investment benefits we may realize. All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings, as well as our earnings press release and financial supplements which are available on our website, at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. During today's report, our management will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our second quarter 2016 earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers we had a pretty good quarter, though we were impacted by the higher level of industry insured cat events globally, 25 of them by our account. After-tax operating income for the quarter was just over $1 billion or $2.25 per share compared to $2.40 per share prior year. For illustrative purposes, excluding cat losses, operating income was $2.91 per share, up 7% over prior year and for six months up 11% demonstrating our excellent underlying operating results which are in line with our expectations and I think depict the accretive nature of our merger. As I did last quarter when discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility into the health of the company, I will compare our results as the new Chubb, excluding the purchase accounting and one-time merger-related items in 2016 that distort underwriting to the 2015 year prior quarter as if we were one company back then or put simply as if. So you know as a manager this is how I look at our results. So, to begin, the P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 91.2% and an as if, which again excludes merger-related items, 90.2%, a really good result that included $311 million in after-tax cat losses from a broad range of events globally. As we recently announced, our cat losses in the quarter were about $100 million above what we had contemplated on a pre-tax basis, but they are in line with our insurance and reinsurance exposures globally. It's worth noting that the level of industry cat losses while elevated when compared to the recent past appear in line with longer-term historical results. The P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophe losses, was 88.9% in the quarter versus 88% as if we were one company last year. Last year has the one-time benefit from the Fireman's Fund transaction and excluding that our year-over-year current accident year combined ratio was essentially flat. Both our North American and international insurance operations had very good calendar and current accident year results. Again, on an as if basis, positive prior period reserve development of $301 million pre-tax was down $35 million versus prior year. Adjusted net investment income for the full quarter was $816 million, a good result given the continued impact of foreign exchange and low interest rates and very modestly below our expectations and guidance to you. Progress, repositioning our portfolio which will result in additional investment income as we discussed last quarter, is on track. Book value per share was up 2.7% in the quarter and stands at $101.56. For the year, per share book value was up over 13%, our annualized operating ROE is circa 10% year-to-date. Phil will have more to say about the investment portfolio, tangible book value, as well as prior period reserve development in cats. Turning to premium revenue, total P&C net premiums in the quarter on a constant dollar basis declined 4.7% on an as if basis. Excluding the previously disclosed one-time benefit from the portfolio transfer of Fireman's Fund business last year, total P&C net premiums were down about 1.5%. Commercial P&C net premiums written for North America were flat. International retail P&C was up 1.5%. International wholesale P&C was down 7% and Global Re was down 13%. Net premiums written for North America personal lives were down about 20%, or 5% excluding the one-time Fireman's Fund premium benefit last year. Excluding all of Fireman's Fund, so just imagining legacy ACE and Chubb personal lines, normalized premiums were in fact up. Given the softer market conditions and the underwriting actions we took due to the consolidation of our two companies, I consider our commercial P&C revenue results this quarter to be reasonably in line with our expectations. As I mentioned on recent calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards or risk appetite, that would reduce our net premium. These underwriting actions, which include either canceling or reinsuring that business, will improve our risk/reward profile and will continue this year and into 2017. In addition, we are choosing to utilize a greater level of reinsurance in certain classes. Altogether, these actions impacted net premium growth in the quarter by about 1.5 points. On the flip side of the coin, the strength of the combined organization, including cross-selling and the introduction of our total product portfolio to an expanded distribution base is beginning to show, and this contributed about 1.5 points of net premium growth in the quarter or about 13% of our North America retail commercial P&C new business growth. I'm going to give you some more detail on our revenue results and pricing by major division, beginning with North America. In our retail commercial P&C business that serves the middle market, net premiums were up 1.2%, with a renewal retention rate as measured by premium of 89.3%. The market continued to gradually soften. Overall renewal pricing was up about 0.5% in the quarter. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 0.9%, with workers comp down over 2% and general liability down 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was up 1% and property-related pricing was down 0.5%. Terms and conditions are generally holding, though we are noticing some erosion around the margins. New business writings for our middle market business were up 2% year-on-year. In our business serving large corporate customers and specialty E&S markets, what we call major accounts and specialty, net premiums were down just under 1%, with major accounts down 1% and Westchester E&S up 0.5%. For our retail major accounts business, the renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 90.6%. We are continuing to experience downward pressure on pricing; however, for lead layers, both primary and excess, where capabilities make a real difference, and there are only a few of us who can stand up to that, pricing conditions are less competitive than straight excess layers, where it's simply about capacity. Terms are conditions are generally holding in the major accounts customer segment. Pricing for the business we wrote was down 2.5%. General and specialty casualty-related pricing was up 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about 2.5%, particularly large account D&O, and property-related pricing was down 10%. New business writings on a gross premium basis were up in the quarter about 23%, driven largely by risk management, primary and lead excess, environmental liability and cash flow property, which by the way has very little net premium associated with it. The new business growth is a combination of flight to quality and a few major competitors exiting or reducing their exposures. In our North America personal lines business, normalized premiums were up about one point for the combined ACE and Chubb book of business, excluding Fireman's Fund. Overall rates were up 1.3% and exposure change was a positive 3.4%. Retentions remained quite strong, driven by the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at over 95%. For the legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio, retentions were lower at 72%, driven by rate and non-renewal actions as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper and some producers and customers choose instead to move to a cheaper, and in our judgment underpriced, option. These are a continuation of the actions we have taken since the start of the conversion last summer. Looking forward, and for your information, effective July 1, we have purchased additional reinsurance protection for our North America personal lines business. This will have an annualized impact on net written premium of approximately $250 million. We obtained excellent terms and judge the risk management and financial benefits to be clearly in the interest of the company, resulting in an improved net retained risk/reward profile. Net premiums for our agriculture business were down just over 1% in the quarter due to commodity prices, offset by growth in exposure. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, as I mentioned earlier, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up in the quarter, 1.5% in constant dollar. While in our London market-based excess and surplus lines business, premiums were down 7%, due entirely to market conditions. Growth in our international retail business varied depending on territory and product. Asia Pacific was up 7%. Latin America was down 5%, mostly due to commercial P&C market conditions and personal lines in Brazil. Excluding Brazil, Latin America grew 1%. And Europe was flat, with the continent up 4% and the U.K. down 4%. From a product perspective, commercial P&C net premiums grew just over 1%, while personal lines grew 2%. It's worth noting we have chosen to exit the legacy Chubb Brazil high net worth auto business due to underwriting and took actions on this earlier in the year. Excluding that impact, our international personal lines business grew 5%. Overall renewal pricing, so for the business we wrote, for our international commercial P&C business was down 3%, consistent with our expectations and a stable, in fact slower, rate of decline relative to the 15-year. Property prices were down 5%, casualty was down 3% and financial lines were down 2%. Terms and conditions were largely in line with previous quarters. In our global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were up over 3% in the quarter, including 5% growth in our combined insurance operations in North America. As I mentioned before, while early days, we are beginning to see tangible revenue growth as a result of the power of the new Chubb. We have very focused, deliberate efforts underway around the globe to promote both account cross-selling and product introduction to expanded distribution. We have specific targets and objectives, internal programs to educate colleagues about each other's products and services, and promotional campaigns. Some areas where you've seen early cross-selling success include environmental, healthcare, professional lines, workers comp, specialty casualty, transportation and agriculture, to name a few. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends as well as examples of how the power of the firm is contributing to cross-selling success. Before I close, we remain on track with all of our integration plans and activities. We are meeting our milestones in terms of integration savings, support function expectations, underwriting and claims initiatives and growth initiatives. Our outstanding claims in risk engineering organization has not missed a beat during the integration, especially in light of the increased level of cats and continue to distinguish the firm in serving both our commercial and personal policyholders. Our people are continuing to knit themselves together and coalesce into one unified culture. In fact, most of our people are spending far less time on integration-related process and procedures and more and more of their time focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. With all that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then we'll come back and take your questions. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you, Evan. We've completed the second quarter as a new Chubb and reached two milestones. Our total capital position now exceeds $60 billion and our cash and invested assets now exceed $100 billion. During the quarter, S&P reaffirmed our AA rating and upgraded our outlook from negative to stable and A.M. Best reaffirmed our A++ rating with a stable outlook and removed their Under Review designation. Adjusted investment income of $816 million for the quarter was slightly lower than our expectation because of lower than estimated private equity distributions. As Evan mentioned and as we discussed last quarter, we're on track to reposition the portfolio to enhanced returns without taking significant additional risk. However, based on the decline in investment deals during the second quarter, we are now expecting consolidated adjusted investment income to be in the range of $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter which compares to our most recent guidance of $830 million. This is subject to volatility in investment yields, prepayments in our mortgage-backed portfolio, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our portfolio continues to have an average AA rating and a duration of approximately four years. Our current book yield is 3.4% and new money rates are 2.3%. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $830 million pre-tax and include $933 million gain from the investment portfolio, primarily from the decline in interest rates, a $159 million mark-to-market loss on the VA portfolio, also primarily from the decline in interest rates and a $59 million gain from FX. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.1 billion. Tangible book value per share was up 6.1% reflecting our strong earnings and the net realized and unrealized gains I just mentioned. Net loss reserves increased $269 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Adjusted for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 89%. As we announced, our catastrophe losses in the second quarter, net of reinsurance, were $390 million pre-tax or $311 million after-tax. Of the pre-tax total, $320 million was from natural catastrophes in North America, and $70 million was from events outside North America. We've included more details of where these losses were incurred in our supplement. Prior period reserve development was positive $301 million pre-tax and comprised $205 million from long-tail lines, principally from 2011 and prior, and $96 million from short-tail lines. Our tax rate on operating income for the quarter is 16.7%, which is in the range of the expected annual effective tax rate of 16% to 18%. Quarterly tax rates will vary based on where our income emerges. I'll turn the call back over to Helen. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : And we'll take our first question from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning, and thank you. Thanks for all the details on the top line growth. Just wanted to focus on the North American personal P&C insurance. If you're excluding the Fireman's Fund one-time transfer, the overall premium like pro forma is down 5%. I was just wondering is that including sort of the, rather than the transfer for the legacy Fireman's Fund business as you re-underwrite that business and how long will it last? Because you've surely lost some and I just wonder at which point we could reach an inflection point on that? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Kai, I think I answered most of your question in my commentary, because I've said the Fireman's Fund ran a 72% retention rate. That's what impacted that 5% and excluding it we were up 1% and I gave you pricing and exposure numbers. The 72% was due to a couple of things. Non-renewal actions, we actually non-renewed a certain percentage of the portfolio and pricing action we took as we convert to the legacy Chubb/ACE pricing. When we take an expiring policy on Fireman's Fund paper and literally convert it to ACE or Chubb paper on our pricing, there is a very meaningful pricing differential in the majority of cases and that also impacted renewal retention rates. There are customers and producers who chose a cheaper option, and by the way, an awful lot of that was contemplated when we actually determined to make the purchase of the Fireman's Fund portfolio. So you have those things. This will continue through the third quarter and in the fourth quarter while it'll continue, it's on a far diminished basis and we expect a substantially higher renewal retention rate because it's on business that's on legacy ACE paper. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's great. And then the second question on the integration expense savings side. How much of the $275 million you guided for the 2016 was saved in the second quarter? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It's about $67 million. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: $67 million, okay. Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: And then just looking forward, you have these cost savings, by my calculation if you lump them all into the underwriting results, probably come to anywhere between 1 point to 2.5 points of your... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That was your first mistake. You just counted them all into the underwriting. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. So let me rephrase it. I'll just say will these cost savings be enough to overcome the pricing pressure in order for you to maintain that or improve the margin going forward? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you know, that's a forward-looking statement and that's guessing everything that you can imagine about terms and conditions in pricing and renewal retention rates as we go forward. So that's guessing at market conditions. I think it's better to say that \u2013 by the way, the cost savings show up in operating expense line, they show up in the claims line, the portion that is UA (23:43) related, they show up in the acquisition line. So they show up in three different categories. What it is safe to say is, the expense savings will ameliorate any deterioration in underwriting margins. Whether it offsets it, we'll see how future years look. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, lastly if I may, is there any sort of impact from potential near-term and long-term impact from Brexit? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : There is no near-term, and look, the long-term is going to depend on what's negotiated between the U.K. and the EU, which we don't know. You're all familiar with the term passporting and that would be the biggest impact to us, and in which case if passporting is not negotiated we will have a separate European sub which would have some capital implications. The exact amount I can't tell you, but we'll be able to handle it easily, and it'd have a modest amount of personnel impact as well. Not dramatic. I don't foresee a substantial impact, but let's wait and see what's negotiated. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Nannizzi of Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Just following up on that a bit if I could, Evan, on the personal lines business, it sounds like then the comparisons by year-over-year basis get a little bit easier as the year progresses. There isn't a distortion like we saw in the second quarter. I just want to try to understand if that's exactly right and also how we should be thinking about the net impact on underwriting from the change in reinsurance. Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The change in reinsurance will improve the expense ratio in particular, and I'd say that. I'm not going to give the numbers. The third quarter will have less impact than the second quarter, because we don't have the one-time, and the one-time, the underwriting benefit, we had some in the third quarter and some in the fourth quarter last year as you recall. But it was much larger in the first quarter than in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. So you get that, we had that positive pickup that wouldn't repeat in 2016 from Fireman's Fund and we disclosed that to you. And so you have those numbers, and you know those. The renewal conversion will have less of an impact in the third quarter than in the second quarter, but it'll still have an impact. And the fourth quarter will be dramatically less. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Okay, thanks for that. And then you mentioned Fireman's Fund as far as conversion. Can you talk a little bit about for the legacy ACE clients on the personal lines side? I'm guessing the premium also there will be higher than it was, maybe that's not true but I'm assuming it is. So maybe you could help on that. But has that impacted retention? And then for legacy Chubb agents, has there been any change in commission structure or are their commissions across legacy ACE and Chubb similar? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Okay. So the first part of your question I'm going to answer quickly and then I'm going to turn it over to Paul Krump. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : But remember, a legacy ACE customer is renewed on legacy ACE paper. They remain. And a legacy Chubb customer is renewed on legacy Chubb paper. All new business is written on legacy Chubb, rates, terms and paper. Paul? Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.: Sure, Evan. And maybe just to put a sharper point on that because we do see a little bit of account rounding coming in on ACE paper as well, so somebody might be buying an excess policy above their homeowners and automobile. So there is a small amount of \"new\" business coming on to ACE paper, but that's from account rounding and it's not truly a new customer. You mentioned commissions. There's been really no change in the commission structure whatsoever. Our agents enjoy good commissions and our GSC program is alive and well. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And so do you plan on then maintaining the two separate platforms, so legacy ACE \u2013 so that will continue in perpetuity for legacy ACE insureds? Or is it anticipated at some point you'll have one product, one brand? Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.: For the foreseeable future, we'll have the two platforms. Evan has mentioned in previous calls that we're always looking for new product and we're kicking around how we can improve the current masterpiece, which is really the Cadillac of products out there. And over time we will work on that, and I would foresee at that point that there would be a conversion. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Ryan Tunis of Credit Suisse. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess just to follow up on the reinsurance discussion. We were curious, does the increase in the reinsurance spend allow for a broader strategic growth opportunity? Or does it really just improve the risk profile and profitability of the existing book? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : It does both. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Any interest in elaborating further? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. I guess my other follow-up for Evan is just on where we are I guess in terms of tangible book. I noticed tangible equity's grown about $1.6 billion since March, and I think Evan has said in the past that one of his goals with this deal is to get tangible book value, I know it's per share, back to where it was prior to the deal. But we were just wondering, how important is it to get the tangible book value per share back to where it was prior to the deal before considering further deployment of capital, either through M&A or buyback? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Ryan, we're on track to do that. Our own projections when we originally did the deal was, from memory, 3.5 years, or under 3.5 years. Our updated projections hold us right on track with that, and growing tangible is important to us. That's a balance sheet, quality of balance sheet question to us. You can pay claims out of tangible capital and it's your most constraining factor financially, is tangible. So growth in tangible is important to us. On the other side of the coin, we will generate, depending on if, you can't predict conditions, you can't predict losses precisely, but our own projections, if they hold, we will generate capital flexibility as well. So I think that's about as far as I want to go with that. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. So, it's safe to say that if at some point you were comfortable with the risk profile and the rating agencies were comfortable with the risk profile of the business, you'd potentially be willing to extend that 3.5-year goal out further if there were an accretive opportunity? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No. I am not willing to extend that 3.5-year goal out further. No. That's a misunderstanding. We can achieve that 3.5-year goal and at the same time, we will generate surplus capital. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And capital flexibility. Remember, I called out (32:39) capital flexibility. We like having capital flexibility. That's a good thing, and we're in the risk business and we're also a growth company in terms of book value. We like having capital flexibility on our balance sheet. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. That makes a lot of sense. Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Sarah DeWitt of JPMorgan. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Congratulations on a good quarter. I was just wondering, first, if you could just elaborate a bit more on the cross-selling opportunities. I appreciate the marks, but if you could give some specific examples I think that would be really helpful. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Great. And thank you, Sarah. I'm going to actually ask John Keogh to elaborate on those, and John Lupica or Paul Krump or Juan Andrade may want to pile in. John W. Keogh - Executive Vice Chairman & Chief Operating Officer : Sure, and, Sarah, it's John Keogh. Listen, there's a bunch of examples I can give you, and Evan mentioned where we're seeing it in terms of the products. Maybe I'll give you one which I think kind of speaks to the strength of the two companies coming together in a piece of business we wrote this quarter that was worth a couple of million dollars of premium. And it was a relationship that legacy Chubb had, a very strong relationship going back for a number of years through their D&O position as a lead D&O carrier, and also in excess liability. The client is in the nursing home business, a large nursing home chain, legacy Chubb had chosen to stay out of the medical liability business over the years. Legacy ACE, we've been in that business for a long time, know it well, have done well in it. Knowing the client well, knowing the producer well, we went and had a conversation about their coverage for medical liability. Given the relationship they enjoyed with legacy Chubb, they were more than happy to talk to us about that, and that resulted in us writing them medical liability for a couple of million dollars of premium that I think we probably would not have written but for the two companies coming together. John Joseph Lupica - Vice Chairman, Chubb Limited / Chubb Group; President, North America Major Accounts and Specialty Insurance : Sarah, this is John Lupica. If I can just say from a branch and regional office standpoint, it's awesome to see this company come together. We have 48 branches that are really learning from one another and the momentum we're picking up is just terrific. We have policies in place with dual declination, so people get to see each other's opportunities. So we know each other's appetite. The product that ACE is bringing to the table is terrific. The capabilities Chubb's bringing to the table is awesome. One example is we have a large risk management business out of a satellite office that came from an agent that wasn't even appointed on the ACE producer list. And this agent had a house account that was introduced to the ACE risk management team and our ESIS claims team. We took a small, single specialty line that Chubb had written on the financial lines and turned that into a $6.5 million relationship by being able to write the comp, GL, auto and claims, all on a clash flow basis. Again, from an office we didn't have presence in and an agent we didn't have licensed, just terrific. Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.: I'll probably add just a little bit. As I watch that people travel together and understand each other's appetite, Evan calls it knitting the organization together, we're seeing every day in the middle market lots of opportunities. I heard about one this week out in Chicago where we were traveling to an agent that was appointed by legacy Chubb and just wanted to meet some of the legacy ACE underwriters, and they walked away with a $221,000 account just because they did not understand ACE's appetite obviously from the past. But we're very excited about the opportunity to learn more, and just in the course of the last two days resulted in a $221,000 account. Juan C. Andrade - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, Overseas General Insurance, Chubb Ltd.: Sarah, and this is Juan Andrade speaking for the international side. I think our theme is very much the same where particularly in places like Continental Europe, the U.K. and Asia Pacific, we've been very successful in cross-selling legacy ACE's property products into legacy Chubb's casualty portfolio. In addition to that, also bringing in legacy ACE's cyber products into the legacy Chubb financial lines portfolio. And probably the last example I would give has to do with our large account multinational business where now with the legacy Chubb workers compensation capability in the U.S., we're able to better round our multinational products for those companies. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You got a mouthful there, Sarah. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Great. Thanks for the color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. On page eight of the supplement, it shows total commercial P&C on a constant dollar basis being down just 0.5%. I was trying to get some perspective on how that result compares to your expectations at this point in the integration? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Pretty much in line with our expectation. I gave you the color that we were down around 1.5%, we had an impact of about 1.5% negative growth due to actions we took related to the combined portfolio as we did the merger. And that is around underwriting actions that we had contemplated, either non-renewal or purchasing reinsurance protections. And that is in line \u2013 additionally we did, because the market is soft, we did also take some underwriting actions a little bit above what we might have and related around reinsurance as well where we judge the risk/reward. So, altogether, and that's what I said in the commentary, it makes good sense to me. Our renewal retention rates have remained very high, very good. And I've got to tell you, you look at the middle market business at 89.5%, that's high. That's a very good renewal retention rate which in the middle market commercial business in the United States today, the pattern is everyone who's responsible is trying to hold on to their renewals and there is less drive for new business. Among those who really do have the data, have the presence, have good underwriting, there is a bunch of smaller wannabes who are doing some crazy things to, and I think fairly desperate things, to show growth and write new business. That's just normal stuff, nothing to do with the integration. And in our large account business, we ran over a 90% retention rate. Excellent. So what do you have? A high retention rate in the commercial businesses with good underwriting, underwriting action that we have taken to improve risk/reward that we contemplated, and some actions that we took that impact net premium but improve our risk/reward based on soft market conditions. Feeling pretty good to me. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's great. Thanks, Evan. And then I had a couple of quick ones for Phil. So, for the net investment income of $820 million to $830 million in the third quarter, would that have any impact on quarters beyond that as well? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In the last call we talked about a range of $820 million to $840 million, and we saw that as a view over the rest of the year and thinking that in the second quarter we'd be closer to the lower end of that range and in the fourth quarter we'd be closer to the higher end of that range. At this point we've said, look, we really can't foresee what interest rates are going to do much beyond the third quarter, so we've decided to limit our guidance to the $820 million to $830 million for the third quarter alone. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. And then finally on debt-to-capital, it's already down to 22% taking into account AOCI which had a gain in the second quarter. Can you remind us what your goals are relative to financial leverage? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Our leverage at this point is fine. From a rating agency standpoint, from any measure, our leverage is fine. I expect that as we continue to grow our capital base, just naturally that will decrease, but we're within our range. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the middle markets business. (42:28) and they were commenting that they thought that the new Chubb was expanding terms and conditions and the types of customers you take on in a fairly significant way. But I guess the question is, is that true? And if it is, if you could talk to the extent that that's happening in the market? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, we'll talk a little bit about it but we're not going to give a roadmap to everybody out there. Paul, go ahead. Paul J. Krump - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, North America Commercial and Personal Insurance, Chubb Ltd.: Yes, Paul, I would unpack that a little bit. You really have two thoughts going there. One is appetite, and I would suggest to you that the two companies have come together and have very complementary appetites. Legacy ACE is bringing a lot of skill in areas that legacy Chubb didn't have. For example, cyber or environmental. And we are certainly cross-selling and taking advantage of those new skills. So, yes, there's been an absolute increase in the Chubb appetite if you think about legacy Chubb in the middle market space. So accident and health would be another one where we are cross-selling. If you are talking about terms and conditions, I think Evan said it in his remarks, that we're seeing a slight erosion around the margin, in particular around cat. Flood, we're seeing people lower deductibles for the same premiums or increasing the sub-limits around quake. We are resisting that as best we possibly can. We are not in the business of under-pricing exposure, so we're trying to be as disciplined as we possibly can in this marketplace. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : And then I have sort of an unrelated question, but a broader one. Obviously, you put two big companies together and you have an executive leave because there's only one slot. Do you think we're pretty much through the period of time where we're going to see continuous headlines like we have in the past from people leaving and going else \u2013 is that process largely finished? More of a headline risk I guess that we sort of suffered through, wondering if you think we're done with that? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, you know, frankly, the words you're choosing to use, I don't even relate to most of those. So it's too much time and gossip. We have lost, since the acquisition was announced on the legacy Chubb side, so in over a year, we lost at middle level ranks, 60 people. We lost about 30 to 35 people we didn't want to lose. Now, that grinds on me, however that is out of 31,000 people around the world, that is not a very big number, and word exodus of people, large numbers of this or that, I don't even relate to that. The stability is tremendous and the depth of talent here is great. And somebody steps out, now I'll tell you what, there is someone else eager to take that opportunity and move along. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : That's fair enough. Sorry for the poor choice of words, but thank you for the comments. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, what can I tell you, but I take it personally. This is personal. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Thanks, again. Operator : We'll take our next question from Charles Sebaski of BMO Capital Markets. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Good morning. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I have a follow-up on the cross-selling and the example that was given that was really helpful I think on the nursing home and the medical liability. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We'll be ready for you, Charles, when you get there. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Wanted to get a little deeper on how that works internally. So you have different underwriters that have different background and the products that are so large. So how does the Chubb D&O underwriter and the medical liability underwriter get together to understand \u2013 how does that work internally to put those pieces together to realize or recognize that opportunity is there? Or is that on the agent or broker to kind of piece that together? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : I don't know. It's both. First of all, that's the management job to begin with. A, it's organization structure and then it is management activity. So product lines that you take the medical liability area. The person in charge of medical liability is now in charge of our whole medical practice group, and we know that there has been legacy Chubb had a large appetite on the property side for that business, it had a great practice. And so those people become part of a common unit and they begin that unit at underwriting, at the underwriting side and they put together lists of common risks where everyone would play. And then that moves down to our underwriters in the regions who understand that and they're caused to come together in that practice group, and then their movement into the branches where we have salespeople and agent relationship people who get educated. And the underwriters go out with them and they visit producers that have that business in those portfolios of it, and then management feedback because if you can't count it, it ain't worth doing, and so you've got targets and objectives, both financial and non-financial. In the beginning, it's non-financial, because it's activity-related. It's related around internal activities of how people organize and how they're educating each other and how they're doing discovery. And then that turns into an offering and then you start moving that into submissions, and then those submissions move into quotes and then those quotes move into bound business and you are measuring that. Now you have entered our life. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thanks. And I guess one other question, more industry-based. It seems like there's growing appetite in the marketplace of people looking to get into trade credit and political risk. Curious if that's your take on what's going on in the market and any commentary on what's going on in those product lines where that may be the case, knowing that that's something you guys have done for a long time. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : First of all, it's not new. There have been people entering this for the last five years, you've seen more entering the marketplace there; a lot of wannabes, small facilities, one underwriter and a little bit of capital, and not a real franchise. You see more people trying to enter now only because \u2013 listen, they're scratching for business. They don't want to shrink their \u2013 they think growth and just the top line equals strength. They want to show more franchise capabilities, so they begin entering the market. Just look at the world today and imagine to yourself, which I think is the background of your question. Is this a brilliant time to enter the trade credit or political risk business? Interest rates at record lows, $11 trillion in negative rates, invested in negative spreads. You have real rates, you have a world awash in capital, tremendous amount of misallocation of capital. And with all that you have a world growing below trend economically and slowing down more, protectionism growing and geopolitical risk everywhere. Sounds like a brilliant time to get into that business, by the way, where rates are at a \u2013 not a record low, but are certainly at a low point. I wish them a lot of luck, because that's all they've got going for them. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you very much for the answers. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Hi. Thanks. First, can I just get a clarification? Phil, when you talked about the $67 million of cost saves achieved, was that cumulative or was that just for the quarter? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : That's the amount realized from an accounting standpoint in the second quarter. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay, so the year-to-date then is closer to about $100 million? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes, that's right. We had about $40 million in the first quarter. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. Okay. And then just one quick clarification on the personal lines reinsurance, I assume that's a quota share for that size of premium? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That's about as far as I'm going to go. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Fair enough. And then just a bigger picture question... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We don't talk about our reinsurance. Those are privately negotiated and I know people \u2013 there are others who will talk about their reinsurance placements as a matter of practice, Ian, so I'm not trying to be rude. As a matter of practice, we just don't talk about it. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : No, that's all right. That's okay. I was just trying to take a better guess on the modeling side, if I need to adjust cat loads or anything like that. And then just a bigger picture... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : That was an intelligent thought right there, by the way; very intelligent thought. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : I tried. Then my bigger picture question, I thought I'd give you a platform if you want to use it. Following up on the Brexit question and what we're having here with the election, the world seems to be turning more anti-trade, anti-globalization. Chubb is obviously a big global insurance company. What ramifications are there if the world does go that way, and just what sort of things do you think about and worry about if we continue down this protectionist, populist path? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You know, Ian, that is the right question. The United States is a leader in the democratic, liberal-minded free world. We have a responsibility in that leadership. And we have been absent from the stage of late. We, as a country, recognize the price we seem to pay for that leadership. But we hardly recognize the benefits, that are enormous, that we gain as a country because the world is hardwired, since World War II, to advantage the United States. And the benefits to our economy and GDP and the benefits in terms of stability, where \u2013 economies don't flourish but with stability and predictability. And so it's worrisome. And the growing protectionism is worrisome. And the only way you move past that is with leadership, and it's political leadership. Central banks can't help you with this. And protectionism, we all get what that does. At the end of the day, it's beggar-thy-neighbor and the pie grows smaller. The pie doesn't grow bigger. And if you want to feed those who are disadvantaged and you want to provide them opportunities and you want a more prosperous world, you need to be able to afford it. And the only way is through growth. And growth in trade and growth in global trade, where each can bring and use its comparative advantage, that has served the world well. And the way we're vilifying it and somehow re-trading on the past and characterizing it that trade has been evil and has damaged our country and has damaged the world is just so misguided. And then to add to that, that immigration is somehow our enemy is, again, misguided populism and feeding on the suffering of those who may vote. So you get where I stand clearly. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Well said. Well said. So just as a follow-up, does it change your appetite at all for \u2013 when you're looking at maybe possible acquisitions overseas or putting more capital to grow certain countries, do you hesitate in certain parts of the world now? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Well, Ian, I hesitate wherever it's hostile. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Yes. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And I give it thought. And obviously you go where you think the opportunity is. And if the opportunity looks more hostile, you're going to hesitate, you're going to wait, you're not going to rush. Even if you think longer-term, it's like, well, am I in a hurry right now, or do I have a year or two to wait? And you see lots of places around the world that way, as economic growth slows, insurance growth slows. That's the way it is, and so you adjust accordingly. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. Appreciate the thoughts, thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : And we go next to Larry Greenberg of Janney. Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Hi. Good morning. I was going to try to push you a little bit further on the reinsurance, but I get the sense that's probably not a good idea. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes, you got it. I mean, you can push, but you're not going to get anywhere. Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Let me just \u2013 so just from a modeling standpoint, since you gave me the opening. So we've got premiums going down and we've got the expense ratio going down. It seems under normal conditions the premium decline would more than offset the expense ratio decline. And I know we get into questions of is this tail coverage, is this more attritional loss coverage, but is there anything you could help us with in that equation? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, we each have our own hell to live in, and the only thing I could tell you is, is that we think we're pretty good analysts. We think we understand our business pretty well, and we are thoughtful when we make trades and transactions, and we plan for the long-term, not just short-term opportunistic. And we understand how to measure risk/reward. We're fiduciaries of shareholder money, and we're going to exercise that fiduciary responsibility carefully. And so when we make any trades or any transactions like that we do all the analysis. And as I said earlier, the risk/reward is in our benefit. Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Great. That's helpful. And then, just reconciling... Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Didn't help your model, I know that. Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : No, no. Not at all, but that's okay. So you said that cats in the quarter were $100 million or so higher than you would have contemplated before. And you also said that industry-wide, cats were kind of in line with history but above near-term recent performance. So I'm just trying to reconcile, you know, that $100 million and looking forward and I know that personal lines reinsurance thing is going to change this a little bit. But was your cat assumption too low relative to history and would you adjust that at all at this point? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, I don't think so. And (60:29) what the companies and the two companies' historic averages are so they each have a different basis and remember I was looking at \u2013 I gave a worldwide average of industry that way. So you know you've got a little bit of chalk and cheese there when you're thinking about that, but where I link them is directionally when I look at the industry losses, even though they were more elevated, but historic \u2013 and I look at our share of them and relative to our share of business, et cetera, they didn't throw me at all. It made good sense to me, number one. Number two, you saw the Global Re , actually had a part of cat losses in the quarter. And you know, they've been relatively quiet. They sell cat excess, we have for many, many years. And so, you know, you get the natural volatility of reinsurance that way, your reinsurance portfolio and they've done very well, by the way, and that business of ours. And so they contributed $50 million or $60 million to that increase. And it was above what they would have expected, but it's cat excess, so, what do you know. If I look at what we would have anticipated in the quarter, legacy ACE by itself would have been about five points of earned premium in the quarter would have been an expected \u2013 the two companies together now, about 5.75 points of earned premium. So the volatility signature hasn't really changed. So anyway, maybe that gives you a little color around it. Larry Greenberg - Janney Montgomery Scott LLC : Helpful. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Josh Shanker of Deutsche Bank. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Good morning, everyone. As we get to the back half of the year, both companies do their asbestos analyses. I'm wondering if you have any thoughts on different procedures or a different approach or a concept of merging those two, sort of, processes together as we go through that. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, one company is under a statutory order and that is the Brandywine which is runoff. And so the State of Pennsylvania has an external review while we do our own internal and we do our own internal annually anyway. And legacy Chubb has done an annual review and we're bringing those two together. And by the way, it's on the margin what the differences are between the two in approach. Very, very similar, but it's a unified team that will \u2013 management team that will oversight the two together. That's it. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: And the seasonality, that's a 3Q situation for everyone? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : No, it's a fourth quarter. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Fourth quarter. Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : We do environmental in the third quarter, asbestos in the fourth quarter. Unknown Speaker : That's right. Josh D. Shanker - Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. All my other questions are answered. Operator : And we turn next to Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Thanks, Evan. A couple of questions here. First one, last quarter you talked a little bit about small commercial opportunity in the U.S. I noticed this quarter U.K., Ireland, a new product, some other stuff in Europe. Can you talk about what the SME opportunity is for you guys now that the combined Chubb here in Europe? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Juan, you want to just touch on it? Juan C. Andrade - Executive Vice President, Chubb Group & President, Overseas General Insurance, Chubb Ltd.: Sure. So, Brian, I think for us, the SME opportunity outside of the United States is also pretty significant. If you look at just the number of enterprises that are out there that really would fall into that category, there's a significant amount of premium. We've had an ongoing strategy in legacy ACE, I would say over the last six years, to really target that space. And initially we started in developing markets, particularly in Asia and Latin America, and frankly we've been pretty successful in growing that business profitably. The emerging markets business is simpler. Basically small property-type packages, some liability, et cetera. In the U.K. and in Continental Europe with the distribution that legacy Chubb is bringing, we're now expanding some of those capabilities as well. And that's probably what you have seen in maybe some of the press releases that you may have been referring to is the fact that we're rolling out new product and new capability especially around specialty products. Small D&O, small environmental, that sort of thing, really to target the smaller enterprises in the U.K. and the continent. Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : And that gets around packages, traditional packages, we're adding specialty coverages to them. We're after industry verticals the same way we do in the U.S. But understand that these are small premiums per policy. And so to move the stick and really grow a volume takes years of patience. So, it's not something we're going to discuss every quarter. And it's one of those things that we'll polish it in the basement and we'll march out with it. It's looking pretty good there. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. And then one other quick question here for you, Evan, another topic with the elections here coming up. Tort environment, what are your kind of thoughts on the tort environment? We've got a new Supreme Court Justice that's going to have to be put in place here. Are you seeing anything that anywhere is alarmist right now with respect to trend in the tort environment in the U.S.? What are your thoughts going forward? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : The tort environment is reasonably stable. There are hostile trends. There are rulings that we have noticed over the last year or two years, particularly in labor and labor-related liability, depending on the state because it's state-based, not Federal, workers comp, and which is again labor-related and that more in the main. On the other side of the coin, the Federal Courts and particularly the Supreme Court has been pretty friendly in its rulings more favorable for corporate. And when you look at class actions and security class actions-related rulings, those have been favorable. Look, you look forward, depending on who's elected, we could see a more liberal turn to the courts. And think that would ultimately be hostile to tort and for insurance. Brian Robert Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Thanks. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: And we have time for just one more person to ask question, please. Operator : And we'll take that final question from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Evan, can you explain why the actions you're taking on legacy Fireman's Fund wouldn't necessarily work in Brazil, leading to the decision to sort of exit that high net worth market? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Say that again, excuse me. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. You talked about how you're exiting the high net worth personal lines market in Brazil. And I'm wondering why the same sort of actions that you're taking on Fireman's Fund \u2013 on legacy Fireman's Fund business aren't applicable there? Evan G. Greenberg - Chairman & Chief Executive Officer : Yes. Sure. It's the automobile business. If you look at structurally how Brazil works, there's two or three very large players who dominate the marketplace. And number one \u2013 and they have such an advantage in terms of distribution, claims management, data, et cetera. And high net worth auto in Brazil is code word for simply very high valued automobiles, and by the way, a lot of sports cars. You may not know this, but I think the second city in the world with the greatest number of Ferraris is S\u00e3o Paulo, and that's just a parlor statistic for you. And the ability to be able to price that business, manage it well and have a business that is of a large enough size because the definition of high net worth in Brazil relative to high net worth, say in the United States, is so different. In the U.S., a fraction of our portfolio is automobile. Most of it is homeowners, jewelry, art, furnishings, it's a much broader portfolio. Auto is a minority portion of it. You get to Brazil, there is no high valued homeowners per se, and insuring all the rest, very tiny market. So it's the reverse. You end up with an automobile portfolio that is very, in a sense, anti-selected and hard to manage and that you don't get paid for and you don't have the benefits of all the rest. So there is an underwriting tutorial, Meyer, 101. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yes. That's helpful and I did not know that about the Ferraris. In the aggregate, I guess this is a question for Phil, was there an FX impact to EPS in the quarter? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. It was about $6 million to underwriting and $10 million to bottom line. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. And then is there a run rate for the other income that we can anticipate? Philip V. Bancroft - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. I think what I'll do, if you don't mind, we take that offline and I'll take you through the documents that we've put out that show the amortization of the intangibles and all of that, right? So we can help you with that. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : And with no further questions in the queue, I'd like to turn the conference back over to Helen Wilson for any additional or closing remarks. Helen Wilson - Senior Vice President, Investor Relations, Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : And this does conclude today's presentation. Thank you all for your participation.",

Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company and investment portfolio performance, pricing and business mix, economic and insurance market conditions and integration of acquisitions including our acquisition of the Chubb Corporation, and potential synergies, savings and commercial and investment benefits we may realize. All of these statements are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings, as well as our earnings press release and financial supplements which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. During today's report, our management will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our third quarter 2016 earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Good morning. Chubb had an excellent quarter with record operating earnings per share, excellent core underwriting results and premium revenue growth in line with our expectations. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.4 billion were $2.88 per share compared to $2.74 per share prior year, again demonstrating in my judgment the accretive nature of our merger. As I have done in the last two quarters when discussing our underwriting results and premium growth and to give you greater visibility to the health of the company, I will compare our results to the 2015 prior quarter as if we were one company back then and exclude the effects of purchase accounting, again this is how, as a manager, I look at the company's performance. The P&C combined ratio for the quarter was a published 86% and excluding purchase accounting 85.5%. That compares to an 85% last year as if we were one company back then. There are three components to that. Catastrophe losses were up over prior year to $144 million pre-tax versus an exceptionally low $101 million last year. Second, positive prior period reserve development of $349 million pre-tax was down $40 million versus prior year. So that leads to the P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding cat losses of 88.4% versus 88.9% last year benefiting in particular from a reduced expense ratio. Both our North American and international insurance operations had excellent calendar and current accident year results. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $830 million, a very good result, particularly given the record low interest rate environment. Investment income was at the top of the guidance we gave you. We have made good progress repositioning our portfolio in ways we have discussed on past calls. And this has in fact contributed to the quarter's results. Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer, is prepared to make a few comments on the portfolio. If you like, just ask him. Book and tangible book value per share were up 2.4% and 5.5% respectively. And our annualized operating ROE for the quarter was 12%, a really good result. Phil will have more to say about tangible book prior period reserve development and cat. Turning to premium revenue, total P&C net premiums in the quarter were on a constant dollar basis declined 3.5%. Foreign exchange had a one point impact. As I have discussed on our previous calls, when we were planning the merger, we contemplated underwriting actions in certain portfolios not meeting our standards or exceeding our risk appetite. These actions which include either canceling or re-insuring certain business reduce our premium, but improve our risk reward profile. The impact from these actions will continue for the balance of this year and 2017 though at a reduced level and will dissipate as the year goes along. If we normalize for these underwriting actions including the purchase of additional reinsurance, total P&C net premiums in the quarter grew over just 1% in constant dollars, a 4.5 point difference. The additional reinsurance accounts for 3.6 point of that 4.5 point difference with business cancellations representing the balance. Keep in mind, the additional reinsurance had an outsized impact this quarter because of the one-time unearned premium transfer in personal lines. I want to say a few words about current commercial P&C insurance market conditions globally. Pricing environment continue to grow more competitive in the quarter for our commercial P&C business and varied depending on the territory, line of business, and size of risk. As noted in prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. And wholesale is more competitive than retail. Certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia, and Brazil, by example, were particularly competitive while the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly but continuing to soften nonetheless. Globally, new business is harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business; both rate and increasingly terms and conditions, particularly when it comes to large account business. Retention of renewals is a high priority. Our renewal retentions are excellent and I will give you some details shortly. Rate movement varied by territory and market segment, but in general, fluctuated in a reasonably tight range. For example, renewal pricing for the business we wrote ranged from flat in our U.S. middle market business to down 2% in our U.S. major accounts business to down 3% and our international retail commercial P&C operations. Globally, general and specialty casualty related pricing ranged from down or 0.5% to down 2.5%. Financial lines pricing range from flat to down 3% and property related pricing range from down 1% to down 5%. Now, with all of that as context, let me give you some detail on our revenue results. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 2.5%. Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance we purchased and for the underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at just over 90%. And new business writings were up about 1.5%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were down about 16%. The additional reinsurance we purchased had a 16.5 point impact, and the Fireman's Fund had a 3 point impact. Therefore, growth was over 3% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Overall, North America personal lines rates were up 1.5% and exposure change added about 3%. Retention remained quite strong for the legacy Chubb and legacy ACE portfolios at 94% and 95% respectively. The legacy Fireman's Fund portfolio as we continue to convert the business to Chubb paper, retention was 75%. The impact of the Fireman's Fund conversion is diminishing and will be virtually gone by first quarter. Net premiums for our agriculture business were up over 15% in the quarter. While still early, from what we can see today, based on yield forecasts and commodity prices, this is shaping up to be a very good year for crop insurance results. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were down in the quarter 1% in constant dollar, and up about 1.5% when normalized with the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. While in our London market based E&S and surplus lines business, premiums were down 4%, were flat when normalized for underwriting actions. The renewal retention rate for our international commercial P&C business was 84% in the quarter, actually right in line with historic averages, and new business writings were down 2%. International by line of business commercial P&C net premiums declined 3% but were flat excluding the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions, while personal lines grew 3% on the same basis. Our global A&H business, net premiums written in constant dollars were flat in the quarter and up 1% adjusted for the underwriting-related portfolio actions. We expect improved growth in our A&H business in the fourth quarter. Meanwhile, our combined insurance operations in North America grew 4% in the quarter. Again, in sum, total company P&C net premiums in the quarter on a normalized basis grew just over 1% in constant dollar. While market conditions globally are competitive, I expect as we progress through future quarters and the impact of the merger continues to fade, given the compelling power and capabilities of the new Chubb, we will produce faster growth in the near future. In particular, we are building on the tremendous potential of our middle market businesses both domestic and international with both traditional core package and specialty product. We also have greater growth potential in our A&H and personal lines business. To the large account and upper middle markets, the power of one Chubb is compelling, as we combine product and expertise to bring total solutions to clients. It is a real differentiator and will provide more opportunity in spite of soft market conditions. We are already seeing evidence of this potential growth. We estimate that our efforts to promote new areas of coverage to midmarket and large account producers and account cross-selling in all of our businesses around the globe contributed about $88 million to our company's new business growth in the quarter, or 16% of North America's new business and 5% of international's new business. We are also on the front foot with new products in digital distribution. For example, we recently began to introduce our small commercial business owner's package policy, the so-called BOP, during the quarter. What began as a small pilot with 12 agents in one state, has now been rolled out methodically to several hundred agents and we were approved to write business in 43 states. We are executing a disciplined plan and currently have capabilities to write some 500 industry classes of business. We have proven and deep expertise. Our package includes broad coverage for property and liability exposures and is complemented by workers' comp, commercial auto, and financial lines products. Technology and data are a differentiator for us. Our business package can be quoted and issued by an agent online in as little as four minutes with minimal questions. We expect 80% of our packaged plans won't require underwriter intervention with an eventual goal to be 90% plus. We also recently launched a cyber risk product specifically designed for micro-businesses via digital distribution through CoverHound as part of their new commercial insurance solutions for micro-size small businesses. We will soon add to that a miscellaneous professional liability product and a business owner's P&C package all featuring strength through processing from quote to issue. A number of Chubb's existing micro-insurance products are scheduled to be redesigned for digital distribution on the CoverHound platform and other web-based producers in the near future. Just stay tuned. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends as well as examples of how our expanded capabilities are benefiting the company. Before I close, we are in good shape with our integration plans and activities. We are ahead of schedule in terms of both realized and annualized savings as you can see from the updated table in the press release. And in fact, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of 2018 to $800 million, up from $750 million. Finally, our outstanding claims and risk engineering organization is performing at an especially high level as tested recently with a number of cats including Hurricane Matthew in the U.S. Let's remember, outstanding claims service is what this organization is all about. Speaking of Hurricane Matthew, while early days and from everything we know, we project our cat losses from this event to be circa $200 million pre-tax. With that, I will turn the call over to Phil, then we are going to come back and take your questions. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong. Our loss reserves remain conservative. We have $102 billion portfolio of cash and high-quality investments that are well rated and liquid and we are generating substantial capital and positive cash flow. Operating cash flow for the quarter was $1.7 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 5.5% in the quarter. You will remember that at the close of our merger, the initial dilution to our tangible book value per share was 29%. As of the end of the third quarter, our year-to-date dilution has been reduced to 16%, an improvement of 13 percentage points in three quarters. Of course, that includes five points of benefit in unrealized gains because of lower interest rates. In the quarter, investment income of $830 million was at the top end of our estimated range and benefited from strong cash flow and from the changes we are making to the management of our portfolio. There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income including the level of interest rates, prepayment speeds on our mortgages, corporate bond call activity, private equity distributions and foreign exchange. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains at $820 million to $830 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $264 million pre-tax and include a $307 million gain from the investment portfolio primarily from a narrowing of credit spreads, a $44 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio primarily from the improvement to equity markets and a $95 million loss from FX. Our investments are in unrealized gain position of $2.5 billion after-tax. Net loss reserves increased $315 million for the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 90%. We had positive prior period development of $349 million pre-tax or $252 million after-tax with about 20% from short-tail lines and 80% from long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2010 and prior. This included $52 million of adverse development for legacy environmental liability exposures which are now included in our corporate segment. As a reminder, we conduct our environmental review in the third quarter and our asbestos review in the fourth quarter. Our catastrophe losses in the third quarter net of reinsurance were $144 million pre-tax or $107 million after-tax principally from U.S. weather related events. During the quarter, we purchased additional reinsurance that reduced our net written premiums by $260 million. $200 million related to personal lines, the remainder related principally to commercial lines. The $200 million personal lines reinsurance premium included $128 million of one-time unearned premium reserve transfers which impact net written premiums for the third quarter only. Excluding the one-time transfers, the annual impact of personal lines of this new treaty is expected to be approximately $280 million. As we have mentioned, we are increasing our estimate of integration related savings. There is no increase in our integration and merger-related expenses. Our tax rate of 18.4% is slightly higher than our normal range due to a higher tax rate on our positive prior period development because of the jurisdictions in which the development occurred. I will turn the call back over to Helen. Helen Wilson - Chubb Limited : Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : We'll go first to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Good morning. And thank you. The first question on the capital management and you generate in the first nine months $3.5 billion of operating income. You recovered more than one third of the tangible book dilution and debt leverage is towards the low 20% and you've purchased additional reinsurance, I'd assume, that would limit some of the earnings volatility. And also you said market is more competitive. So how do you think your current excess capital position and the potential buyback in 2017 and beyond? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, Kai, it's early days. We are pleased with building our capital position. It's in line with our own expectations. Capital management, we pay an awfully good dividend. We understand the potential for share repurchase and that always fits into our overall thinking when we look at all of our options and what we will do with our capital. Stay tuned. We are not in a hurry. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's good. And then thank you for all the details on the sort of new products. I just wonder what's the reaction from your distribution networks including the middle market about this new products and also if you're worried about sort of too much concentration in terms of a like a carriers from \u2013 more from the high net worth perspective. Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: For the small commercial that we just launched and that's in line with our plans as we told you from the very beginning and it's a book of business that we'll build over. It takes years to do. That's right in line and that goes to agents. And we've just begun really rolling out a real way and that will continue as our technology and product comes online into the middle of next year when it will be fully operational. But as far as agent reactions, very good and I'm going to turn it over for two moment \u2013 for a moment to Paul Krump who will give you a little more sense of the feedback we are getting in the marketplace. Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Sure, Evan. I'd say that the agent feedback has been very positive. The new organization really hasn't missed the beat in terms of service to both agents and clients. I think the agents have been extremely complementary, how focused team is on finding solutions to our risk exposures. Just one quick example. We were all recently at the CIAB and we ran into an agent who had a Fortune 500 CEO who had a personal lines risk and \u2013 but it included both the cattle and a horse ranch. And I would tell you that in the past legacy Chubb would have absolutely struggled to figure out a solution to that. And today, we were able to put that together in a very seamless way and our new capabilities in that area are unmatched and they'll only become crisper and better as we go along. So we are very excited about that. As respect to the piece about some concentration, yeah, I would suggest to you that some of the agents have been a little concerned about the concentration. We have seen that more so and if anything in how they have moved some of the Fireman's Fund business. We expected that in the retention and that has shown up. You have to remember that that Fireman's Fund book was a conversion and we anticipated that there would be more price dislocation on the Fireman's Fund and that, as Evan said it in his remarks, will dissipate as we go forward. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Kai, the market reaction to the small commercial has been very good. As we have begun to roll that out. You know the legacy Chubb brand name with agency distribution and the relationships are so deep and as we bring additional product to market, they \u2013 the reception and the goodwill couldn't be better. And I would remind you on the dislocation question. Sure, the concentration issue is an element with producers. Look at our renewal retention rate. We are holding the business and we are in fact writing the business. So while that tension and that dynamic is there, as Paul started saying to you, our capabilities are beginning to improve that we could do farm and ranch and do high net worth together starts opening up a whole another market dimension that others can't follow. And we have other product and technology plans on the drawing board that over the next two years will start \u2013 will roll out and continue to differentiate us. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Great. Thank you so much. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: You're welcome. Operator : Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Hey, thanks. Good morning. I guess my first question is on the repositioning and investment portfolio and I guess if you guys could just talk a little bit more about the changes there \u2013 made there so far. And I guess potentially if there is an opportunity to even do more there, I guess, just looking at average yield on invested assets has been flat over the past few quarters? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, well, when you say that I'm going to turn it over to Tim Boroughs but when you say that that's in the face of the declining reinvestment yield. Timothy Alan Boroughs - Chubb Ltd.: Right. So Ryan, at this point we fully integrated the legacy Chubb portfolio with our investment process and operating platforms. So that's taking place. The assets have been placed with several of our managers with whom we share a long history of success. We have been working with these teams to implement strategic and tactical changes to the taxable, municipal and our international portfolios to improve risk-adjusted returns. In addition, earlier this year, I think this is important, we shifted most of our equity portfolio into the upper tier of the BBB sector of the high yield bond market which had the impact of reducing overall portfolio volatility. This sector has returned over 14% this year versus a gain in stocks of about 7%. The result of all these adjustments have produced additional net investment income of over $120 million annually above what the portfolio's run rate would have been since the time of acquisition. This has been accomplished with a better balance to our asset allocation, overall reduction in portfolio volatility while we have maintained an average rating of AA. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess just a follow-up on the additional reinsurance and the merger-related underwriting actions. And I know Evan pointed out that most of the action, if not all the action, so far has been taken on books that were planned at the beginning in the deal. But I'm just curious how dynamic that process still is. And if whether or not you are still finding books in areas where there are sizable opportunities, I guess, to improve either the volatility profile or the loss ratio profile of the business? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Thanks for the question. No, we have been through the portfolio, and we \u2013 by the spring, so early in the second quarter, we had finished going through everything together. And we understood exactly where it either wasn't meeting our return expectations or where we had individual risk accumulations that would exceed our guidelines and appetite or we had aggregate risk accumulations concentrations that would exceed our appetite. So that's all done and we put in place our plans to either fix or get off of business or secure additional reinsurance. Let me go a step further, though, because I think there is this question out there also, well, risk reward ratio and how do you think about that? And how do you as investors judge that? First of all, I don't believe you can judge that, we can judge that, but you can't accept that how our ultimate results turn out. And I think we have a track record that speaks to pretty good underwriting and reinsurance as part of the underwriting process. We don't give away premium easily. Why would we do that? You ask yourself that question. We wouldn't. Reinsurance and the way we look at things is not an expense. But it's rather a risk management and a capital management tool. We have very well-established use and guidelines in process to determine and manage our risk tolerances, our appetite for individual per risk volatility as an example. Our accumulations of how much we would take in anyone geography among our various products as they clash from a single event that might occur. We have very sound capabilities to analyze the alternatives. The alternatives, do we retain the risk, do we reinsure it, and if we're going to reinsure it, what's the best reinsurance structure and the pricing alternatives? We can evaluate reinsurance pricing versus what we think a risk is worth. We can then track the results, gross and net and adjust as facts and circumstance both company and market change over time. So it's a very thoughtful process that we go through. And frankly the question you ask yourself if you are me in the very beginning when you do something a merger like this is do you worry about the optics of the premium revenue or do you just do what you know is the right thing to do to manage the business to give the optimal return on a risk-adjusted basis. And for me, it's a no-brainer. You just do that. And anyway, thank you for the question and I answered more than you asked. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): That's helpful and I guess just one follow-up, Evan, is I mean clearly we have seen the cost in the NPW growth. I mean when you look at the results thus far, to what extent are we seeing the benefit of this? I mean do you look at this and think that all the underwriting actions and reinsurance you have done have improved results so far? Or do you think that's largely just still on the come. In other words, the benefit hasn't really played out at all on what you have reported? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, look, you can't measure with absolute precision. But what I will tell you is this. The actions you take are on a written basis and then that earns in over a period of time; generally a one-year period of time. So the results will \u2013 of that will emerge over time. It ameliorates margin pressure you get from rate reduction and trend, loss trend that occurs on your book of business. It ameliorates your results due to \u2013 you know from a single catastrophe or a series of catastrophes when they occur. It ameliorates your results in frequency of large losses if you have limited your per risk net because you don't think you are getting paid for that excess layer or have the spread of risk worth taking the volatility. And so you judge it over a period of time. But I think you are liking our underwriting results and it's all part of that. Ryan J. Tunis - Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC (Broker): Thanks so much. That's more than I need. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You are welcome. Operator : Elyse Greenspan... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: (34:26). Operator : Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. First kind of high level question. We have a specter of inflation picking up next year. We have seen some of your peers report spinning reserve releases. Evan, do you think that it will reach a point where the industries start potentially taking more prices to get ahead of what could potentially be a painful inflection point in terms of inflation? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, let me just clarify one thing. Did you say inflation is taking off next year? Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : I said there is a specter that maybe inflation could pick up when we get to next year. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, I think they just hang that ghost out there and it just hung there the last few years. Everybody looks at it and says maybe it's coming. Look, loss trend hasn't \u2013 it's not like there is no loss trend. There is inflation in claims. It varies by class. But it isn't like it has disappeared. It continues and you see it in certain classes where it rears its head and then in other classes it's there, it just is a bit more benign. Pricing is flat or down and it's interesting to me the way I listen to people talk about the market because they will say, well, see the market is not softening because the rate of decline of prices has ameliorated. Well, that's almost \u2013 that's mindless to me. The rate is still going down, just going down at a slower rate. That's still softening. And even if it's flat, it doesn't keep trade \u2013 pace with loss cost trend. So eventually, it's going to show up in results. When? I can't say with any specificity. And you know at that point when it shows up does that mean a market turns? It's a lot of capital. And there is a hunger for a rate of return. Even the insurance industry giving a mid-single digit ROE which is miserable on a risk-adjusted basis to me; that is attractive to many where there is trillions of dollars sitting in negative returns right now and just hungry for yield. And if they can get absolute yield of 2%, 3%, 4%, 5% on an absolute, forget risk adjusted basis, they are interested. So you just continue to see more capital coming into the business. So I am not imagining and I don't run our company, I can tell you, we don't build a strategy based on a market turn. We base it on the market we see. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a couple of numbers questions for Phil. How much of the integration savings came into the numbers in the third quarter? Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: So third quarter actual realized savings from an accounting standpoint were $102 million and that would bring \u2013 so it was $28 million in the first quarter, you'll remember, $72 million in the second quarter and $102 million in the third quarter, bringing the year-to-date total to $202 million. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then what was the FX impact on EPS in the quarter? Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: It was $10 million. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Did we take care of your worksheet? Operator : Michael Nannizzi, Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks so much. I guess you spoke a bit about developments on the commercial side in terms of the policy in small commercial. Can you talk a little bit about investments you have made on the personal lines side and maybe either new products or new geographies or further integration of those previously three separate brands? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. We are making investments in the area and this is only a certain number of months, but they will roll out as we go along. So let me give you a little more color. We, first of all, have reorganized ourselves between all the disciplines, between actuarial, underwriting, marketing and sales where we can in a faster and more practical way react to each region in the United States which each one behaves a little differently where the States behave differently in terms of both competitive behavior and what we see from a financial profit and loss perspective of pricing. Number two, we are right now in the middle of making investments and executing on actions around what will ultimately come out in the next \u2013 I'm not going to predict the month precisely, but we're going to start rolling out a digital experience around our high net worth business where customers will be able to interact with us and procure service and actually manage coverage in a more digital way. Foundational technology, there is a need to make large investment to update and be state-of-the-art in our foundational technology around underwriting and claims, claims we've already done it and we will be investing in the underwriting side and plans are afoot to do that. In product, Paul began to tell you one of the initiatives that we're already engaged in and that will emerge and that is the high net worth. There is a large segment to that population that has farm and ranch exposure. And you can't \u2013 typically you can't get it all from one carrier. We have the capability with our farm and ranch capabilities, as well as our high net worth capabilities. We are putting them together. We have already been piloting where we will be able to serve that segment and that distinguishes us from anybody else, one-stop shop. Coverages around cyber liability, which on a personal basis and particularly for high net worth, is a new exposure. We've rolled out product to address that area before anyone else in the market did. And so you know we are \u2013 this is not something where you throw a switch. I mean I said from the beginning it would take a couple years but we have a lot underway. Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Great. Thanks. And then maybe just a quick one for Phil just on the reserve development, and we have seen some sort of divergent trends from other folks so far this year particularly this earnings season around development. Just curious if we will be able to get a little bit of color on whether the development came from legacy ACE or legacy Chubb and if the trends have been different from the two legacy books and how we should think about the standardization of those two as we go forward. Thanks. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Let me start with \u2013 I will turn it over to Paul in a second, let me just start with \u2013 in general, this cycle was primarily related to the casualty book. I mean the most weight in our studies were casualty. But we also had some personalized development that I'll ask Paul to talk about. Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, yeah, thanks. Thank you both. As Evan has mentioned on previous calls, we are integrating our actuarial process for all lines. And in doing so, we are bringing together much more credible data than previously available in the personal lines space as we've got the three big portfolios. And that data just caused us to increase our expectation slightly on the legacy ACE personal lines book. In particular, the homeowners and personal access lines were increased ever so slightly. Again, that's on the legacy ACE book, it's not in the personal auto. I suspect I know what you are pointing towards and it's not the auto. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And then remember, it's on a base of a couple of, few billion dollars actually \u2013 $0.9 billion base (43:48). Michael Nannizzi - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Thank you. I guess a follow-up on the new initiatives with the BOP and small cyber in commercial. If we are taking a couple of years out, what's \u2013 how large of a component of the book to this part of the business be? Can these small policies, small risk component be a material component of the overall commercial business? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yes. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. Fair enough. We had another one on cross-sell and how the cross-sell opportunity set is with these small policies and personal line and then the A&H business. I guess I'm thinking in the U.S. Is A&H a differentiator in the Chubb, the larger personal lines book that you have now and are those pieces integrated or am I thinking about that wrong? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No, you are thinking right. And I am going to start with an answer to you and then I wanted to take your question even a little broader and I'm going to ask Paul and John to talk a little bit about middle market cross-selling and what's going on in upper middle market. But let me take your A&H and by the way on small commercial when you ask could it be material? I am going to repeat to you one thing I have said before. First of all, it's about a $90 billion market in the United States. Number two, average premiums though keep in mind a couple thousand dollars. So it takes \u2013 you've got to write a lot of customers to build to cast a real shadow. In a number of years \u2013 in a few years, I expect that this will be a book of business with a B on the end of it, okay. That's what I mean by significant. When you talk about A&H, it's in two pieces. First, in the combined, we do a worksite marketing and we have great technology and we now have quietly built over $100 million of business that is growing quickly where we are doing supplemental A&H products not traditional health. Sort of like the same thing that you would see Allstate or Aflac doing. We are competing very well in that business. We have now introduced it to the Chubb independent agency distribution system right alongside our P&C offerings. And because most of the agents have an employee benefits division, and so we can come in where it is 50 to a couple of hundred lives, that's a sweet spot for us, and with technology and enrollers offer supplemental health products such as accident insurance, dread disease, hospital cash, et cetera, and that is a real initiative that we think has legs that over a number of years is going to grow substantial business. Secondly, through our corporate A&H division as part of our major accounts and our middle market, traditional travel accident insurance and global business travel to corporations where they pay for the insurance for employees, we are \u2013 that is a real initiative for us and it is part of our cross-selling along with a whole host of other products that I'm going to ask John to start talking about and Paul and just give you a better sense of that cross-selling. John W. Keogh - Chubb Ltd.: Sure. Thanks, Evan. And, Charles, yes, to Evan's earlier point, we've really focused on our cross-selling into our existing customer base and agency books. And also we call strength of the organization where we've added resources and distribution. I will remind you that with the Chubb, we've picked up 48 branch offices that are just terrific assets for us. Some of the things that we are selling is clearly the specialty product that ACE brought to the table, things like environmental. Things like global programs, a broader access appetite, deeper financial lines, cyber, international, construction, transactional risk. These are all specialty plays that our branch operation is just doing a wonderful job at distributing and getting to our relationships and adding that cross-sell. A couple quick examples on the upper middle market side. We had a global digital company where the Chubb organization had a small specialty product. This client needed a worldwide program from domestic casualty to international casualty and to the new ACE products with the Chubb relationship and the Chubb team and this organization holds together the rate in excess of $3 million deal. So, there's a number of those examples I can run you through, but it just brings to life one example where the organization has brought together additional capabilities. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And I want to add one thing about that account and that was beyond the capabilities \u2013 it took the capabilities of both organizations. The product set that legacy Chubb brought and that legacy ACE brought by themselves, each one was hardly enough to win the day. The two together, there was no one who stood up to us in the competition. It was fascinating. Paul? Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Maybe just another quick example, because I think John did a great job outlining it. Going back to the strength of the organization an agent friend of mine told me a story where one of our clients in the personal lines world runs a business. It's in the healthcare industry. And this prospect of his was very anxious to get a Chubb quote. He explained to them that he didn't think that this risk was within Chubb's appetite. But he also admitted to the client prospect that, in fact, now that legacy Chubb has changed to new Chubb that the appetite has shifted as well because the legacy ACE was bringing on so many more capabilities and skills. So he approached us. And he was shocked that within days we put together a very competitive program. The underwriter that he knew helped guide his colleague through the relationship and we wrote the account with several hundred thousand dollars. So that in itself is personally very satisfying for me. But what also is very satisfying is that this agent has really turned on to Chubb right now and their submission activities increased nicely. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I really appreciate all the answers. I guess just one final, if I could ask, might be helpful for us is on the personal lines business, I know there's a lot of work on re-underwriting and reinsurance. If possible, if we could get some PIFF data, potentially over time help us understand the trend of the book quarter-over-quarter would be appreciated. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We will note that. Charles Joseph Sebaski - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. The 12% operating ROE in the quarter was very strong and you still have about another point of expense savings to realize. So is the 13% ROE about the way to view the right run rate for the company or was there lower than average losses this quarter, some seasonality in the business? Just trying to get a sense of the ROE profile for the new company? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, well, I think that's a \u2013 maybe a simplistic way, it's just still a mathematical way of looking at it. You've got to figure all the other factors. So you just loaded additional expense on top, let's see what happens to rate and trend and losses and mix of business and all the rest. I'm not projecting. I don't give guidance. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Thanks. And then the underlying... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You are welcome. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : ...the underlying combined ratio in the quarter remains steady despite your comments about market conditions. What's driving that and you view that as sustainable? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Not giving you guidance. On the other side of the coin, I feel pretty confident in our underwriting \u2013 in our ability to produce superior results relative to the industry. Our mix of business, our underwriting discipline, our willingness to shed business, to reinsure business, not to grow where it doesn't make sense and to grow where it does make sense, our global reach and our balance of businesses by geography, by country where we selectively determine to write each line of coverage, not mindlessly across the globe, but selectively decide which country to write which business in, our mix between middle market, small, and large commercial, our mix between specialty and traditional. The fact in major accounts business where we have superior capability, so it's not simply about the cheapest price per shared and layered but that you bought the franchise and therefore it's our ability and primary casualty to be able to pay your claims, to be able to issue the paper all around the globe, collect the money and move the cash flow, pay the taxes for you and then write all the excess coverages. Our ability to write multiple coverages on you on a global basis and not simply one coverage, I think, all that goes into those results, Sarah. Sarah E. DeWitt - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. Thanks for the answers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill. J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. I've got a couple of unrelated questions. The first one is \u2013 I cover a lot of regionals which is, I guess, my problem. But they are all telling me that they are going after the high net worth personalized business. I think some of this maybe they are not really going up to really targeting your affluent as opposed to affluent, but it's hard for me to tell exactly how far up the scale they are going towards Chubb's business. So the question really is are you seeing those folks and are they indeed trying to take the incremental customer out of that truly high net worth marketplace? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We are seeing the competition in one or two in the mass affluent space, creeping into the lower end of high net worth. It's a price play, offer a cheaper price. Having the broad coverages and the service capability, that's what it's really about. And so people are going to compete simply on price but not the same quality of product and service and that's the game. That's fine. You will always have that. And as I have said from the beginning, we expect that with the merger, there would naturally be others who would come into the space. It makes sense. It ought to happen. That doesn't disturb us. But your ability to actually become a true high net worth player requires a lot of investment, a lot of patience, and because you've got to build a hell of a capability and service and you've got to be able to follow your customers where they have exposure. And by the way, you've got to have a balance sheet and appetite for greater volatility or risk because high net worth behaves like a commercial account, not a traditional personal lines account. J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Great. And my other question which is completely unrelated. We have the impact from the Department of Labor coming up in April of next year. And there are some folks, I think, are very smart like the folks at Milliman that think that the \u2013 essentially you're going to again end up with very few 1035 exchanges and the retentions for in-force annuity books will just sort of skyrocket. You have a life reinsurance business haven't had an issue with it or seen much impact out of lately but if you saw a large increase in retentions in that in-force book, would that have a material impact positive or negative on your results? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: This is variable annuity business, not fixed annuity business. You realize that. J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Yeah. I think that the thought is actually the variable annuity business will also \u2013 because a lot of those features are in the money will become un-transferable because they will have to explicitly estimate those \u2013 the value of those derivatives to the customer and it's very hard to swap them into something else if they are in the money. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. We will have to take that off-line with you but I would say this. We study the lapses in the annuitization rates on a regular basis. We react to the changes as we see them. You realize we write an XOL (58:54) book, an excess of loss book. That has been in run-off since 2007. Our lapses have been running to date better. They have been running lower, in fact, than we \u2013 than originally imagined and we watch those annuitization rates pretty carefully. J. Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Fantastic. Thank you very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Evan, one sort of big picture question in light of the quarter's reflection of pricing trends and sort of the overall economy. Are you more or less optimistic about the revenue synergies from the combination of ACE and Chubb than you were 6 months to 12 months ago? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, I am the same about the revenue synergies between ACE and Chubb, absolutely the same. What I can't speak about is, yes, the capabilities and our ability to bring those capabilities and differentiate whether it's new product and absolute like small commercial or bringing product to customer through \u2013 in middle market or in large account. I am absolutely right where I was about that. What I can't tell you is how much joy you get at any one moment for it depending on market conditions. And you know I expected a competitive market and we certainly got one. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And remember this, which is very interesting to me. I told you that really you can't be Pollyannish about it that. In the beginning we would take some actions that would have dis-synergies, I hate the word \u2013 give me a better word where we would cancel some business, we would reinsure some business. So you'd reduce some premium revenue that growth initiatives would occur over a number of years and I said a three-year to five-year period to show a meaningful difference. We are keeping track of it. At the same time, you are going to have on your basic book of business. You are going to have a certain lapse pattern and a certain new business pattern and if you are a disciplined underwriter that pattern is going to vary depending on the market conditions. Then you add the two together and there you go. But what I know \u2013 there you go as your ultimate growth rate, but what I know is we can measure the power of the integration from a revenue point of view and be able to track how one plus one is better than the two by themselves in any market condition. Are you following me? Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: I do. Yes, that's very helpful. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Okay. You are welcome. Did you have another question, Meyer? Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Just a very quick one in terms of the reinsurance purchasing. Is there any \u2013 I don't know guidance is the wrong word but ball-park you can give in terms of how the ceding commissions compare to the acquisition expenses? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: How the ceding commission compares to what? Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: The acquisition expenses on a gross basis. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, sure. The ceding commission is better than the acquisition expense. Otherwise, I didn't even cover my operating expense. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Let alone are you giving me a margin for my good business I'm giving you. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Perfect. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes. Thank you. I think about the environment and just as you are really emerging as this mammoth global company, two of your competitors are clearly pulling back. And I am wondering if you are seeing that in the number of submissions you are getting? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We are not only seeing it in the number of submissions we are getting in that \u2013 particularly in that large account business but we are seeing it in the writings. John Lupica. John Joseph Lupica - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, absolutely, thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And then Juan Andrade. John Joseph Lupica - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, Jay, there is no question in that global casualty business where we have invested a bunch of resource and time and people over the last 7 years to 10 years delivering a terrific product and being consistent with our pricing and our offerings. We are absolutely seeing opportunity from a couple of our competitors stumbling a bit. We are seeing more submissions and we are seeing more new business come into the portfolio at adequate rates. I remind you, we compare our new business to our renewal business and the adequacy is on par to our portfolio. So that is one area when Evan noted our new business was up that we're definitely seeing new business increasing. It's all global casualty risk manager business. And that would include lead layer umbrella; that would include global property fronts and lead layer financial lines in there as well. Juan C. Andrade - Chubb Ltd.: On the international side, Jay, I would add the same thing. We are really seeing more opportunity here as some of our competitors stumble particularly on the service side. We are seeing more risk managers coming to as we \u2013 the large brokers looking for essentially the franchise opportunities that Evan described given our multinational capability. So we see it in our pipeline but we also see it in our new business particularly in places like Continental Europe. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And, Jay, the factor on the other side that stops us from writing all of it depends on is the market condition. They will come to us if they want the service now, are you willing to pay us the price we want? And in an awful lot of instances they are bringing in the risk and it's at a price that the expiring price is at a discount to what we think it's worth. And there you go. There's the bid/ask and whether we are going to write it or not. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. The other question on the auto side. Obviously, there was some noise on the personal auto side, all the stock seemed to go down on some of those days. Our suspicion is that personal auto is a very small part of your business. Can you talk about how big that business is for you? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Paul Krump is actually looking for his statistics at the moment. But, yeah \u2013 and our combined ratio is behaving pretty well. It's not a huge book for us. Paul? Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Just to level set again it is not a lead line for us in personal lines. I mean we generally write automobile only along with our other coverages for our customers. In addition our auto product really appeals to customers looking for much broader coverage and service particularly when it comes to vehicle repair and especially around safety systems. So I would tell you that we are just not the best source for confirming standard market auto trends. Our premium is much more skewed towards the homeowners and we have far more cars typically than we have drivers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We do see \u2013 and we have seen for a while what some others in the market have seen and that is there is a \u2013 particularly there's been an upward trend in severity. Look, the kinds of cars that our drivers drive are more valuable cars. The technology continues to evolve both in the materials used to manufacture the cars and the computerization, the digitalization of automobiles. And so that drives severity and we have seen that severity increase over a period of time we have been taking rate and we are making an underwriting profit in auto. And by the way, the volumes \u2013 look at page seven of the supplement you get the total \u2013 you get the volumes on a global basis. Jay Arman Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Well, such is my experience because you write my house but you don't insure my crappy car, so... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. You are a friend, so I'll just withhold my comment \u2013 my report to you. You have teenagers in the house? I don't want them. Operator : Ian Gutterman, Balyasny. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Hi. Thank you. I guess I have a comment, first, maybe building off the last comment there is I am looking forward to the new digitization in high net worth because the current Chubb website for homeowners feels like something out of the 1990s, so I'm hoping for something more customer friendly. So my first question on the cost saves. It looked like the incremental $50 million if I just compare the chart to the old chart, pretty much all comes in 2016, so it's basically already done or about to be done. A, is that accurate? And, B, can you give us a little color on sort of what's been done year-to-date and sort of where we see it? Is it expense ratio in the segments? Is it corporate? Is it LAE? Is there a way for us to sort of identify it, I guess, in our models or is it too broad-based? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No, there is \u2013 I'll make that part short. There's no way for you to identify it. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You will not be able to. Number two, you'll identify it in the overall as you watch the expense ratio... Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Right. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: ... and we can also identify to you in the loss ratio what percentage change in LAE exists then on \u2013 so we are tracking the savings. By the way, we track it in a very buttoned up mathematical way. It comes through finance and accounting. It's got controls around it. It can be audited both externally and by internal audit. And so we don't put out these numbers without real governance and control around it all and that's how we manage to it anyway. So it's all for real. And then what you have on the other side is what counterbalance is any investments you have that you make that will increase expense for normal inflation and expenses. So, we kind of track between the two pieces. Your question about the $50 million, no, it's not in 2016, it's in 2017 and 2018. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. I have to go back and look at that again. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And if you want, Phil, I think we are going to expand on that. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: I was just going to say that's right, it was across the years, the $50 million increase. And you can just compare to the first quarter disclosure, you'll see it. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Right. Before you had \u2013 so now you have $310 million of actual achieved in 2016 before you had $270 million \u2013 $275 million. That's why I'm saying it's mostly in 2016. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Well, the realized was, I think, the $800 million is the annualized. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Is the annualized. Look at the annualized again. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, yeah. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. I will follow up off-line that one. So... Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: We definitely did accelerate what we would have expected in 2016. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: But you will see that the additional $50 million is spread across the years. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. And then just to follow up on the small commercial effort. I guess, Evan, can you help me understand sort of, I guess, what I am struggling with there, right, is that business is obviously as you said it's very low ticket, very sticky. It doesn't change carriers a lot and it's very dependent on sort of the experience with the CSR almost as much or more certain with the customer. What sort of your edge going to be? Is it going to be a new take-on service centers? Is it going to be a new take-on front-end quoting to make the CSRs want to do business with you instead of someone else? What sort of the hook, I guess? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: So the hook is a couple. First of all, in the agency, they are predisposed to grow their business with Chubb. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: The market concentration of this business when you think of the guys who are \u2013 that you would think of are the ones who are leading brands in it. Well, in aggregate, they have 20% market share of a $90 billion market. So it's incredibly spread. And there's a lot of carriers in there that frankly the agents, if you take the relationship and their \u2013 with Chubb they want to grow that relationship and they have more confidence in that. So you start with that. Number two, our technology and our ability to quote find an issue and a four-minute to do it and that you don't touch? That's something that is a great differentiator to CSRs. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And then that we will offer the total product package plus specialties wrapped around it that others don't have is a differentiator. So I think when you add all three together over time, we will grind this out and this is not a passing game where you make a 50 yard gain in one play. This is a grind it out foot by foot, yard by yard. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Well, that's surprising \u2013 that's what I was actually going to ask. Thanks a lot. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And that's great. That's what we are in the business of. We are all not trying to get out of the business tomorrow. We are here for a long time building a company and this is part of the effort. So it's not something like what's the update every quarter? How it's looking? Come on, you measure it over years. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. So is it a by agency approach? I mean you are trying to win over agents and get book roles one at a time or is it canopy to get it (1:13:30) Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No, you go agent by agent, you love book roles, but that's again, that's like a short pass. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : That's what I'm wondering. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You go yard by yard and sure you would love book roles and maybe you'll get some of those, but you're taking a policy by policy. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Very good. Perfect, all right. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Helen Wilson - Chubb Limited : We have time for just one more person to ask questions. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Remember, we don't have second careers around here. That's all we do. We've got all day for this. Operator : Brian Meredith, UBS. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yes. Thanks. Just a couple quick ones here for you. Evan, just looking at the global reinsurance business, big decline in premiums. Is that all just market related or are you seeing some customers shying away from you now that you're just a much bigger primary player and what is the outlook for that business for you guys? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No, there is nothing related to \u2013 we have been a big primary player for a long time. There is nothing related to that, Brian. It is truly market. Our reinsurance folks, we liberated them a long time ago from volume. You will do the right thing to earn an underwriting profit or you will walk away from the business. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And that's \u2013 all that's a reflection of and look, it's a little like the E&S business. In reinsurance, you have to be prepared in the way we run reinsurance, everybody a little differently. Where it has more volatility to it based on the market signature, you will have moments where you handle (1:15:15) the moments when you may grow very quickly and then you've got to be willing and prepared that on the other side there's volatility and you just shut like mad if you have to if your intent is to earn an underwriting profit. Wholesale E&S is next like that and it expands \u2013 the market expands or shrinks depending on market conditions. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. And then my next question for you, Evan, can you tell a little bit about what you are doing efforts to roll out the Chubb brand particularly in the personal lines side in some of your emerging markets platform that ACE used to have? Or it has, sorry. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, we are focused in just a couple of geographies around the world. We are focused in the U.K. There is a business and it has been a good business and we are putting more effort and more investment into that U.K. business and Juan is exploring a couple of places on the continent in a thoughtful way where there is opportunity we believe. And beyond that, we are in Australia and \u2013 where we have a portfolio and are growing that. Other than that, it's where our customers emanating out of the U.S. or one of those markets may in fact have a property or an exposure in another country, then we have a Lloyd's platform that is used to be able to quote an issue that alongside their U.S. policy because they have a home in Mexico or they have a home in Colombia. So we can serve it on a global basis. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: The notion of expanding high net worth into a whole lot of countries, if you understand the market environment in those countries and the actual consumer behavior, there is \u2013 as we know it, there is not a high net worth market to be pursued in most markets of the world. That's just a fact. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. And it is more and more rolling out the Chubb brand in some of those emerging markets, does that kind of carry weight in areas like China and some other areas? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, it does carry weight. And we are pushing \u2013 I would say this, the ACE brand was a bigger brand in China, as an example. The Chubb brand \u2013 the conversion to the Chubb brand is \u2013 it gets the halo of what was the ACE brand because it's based on personal relationship more than anything. In the other markets of the world, the Chubb brand, ACE brand we are promoting the brand and building it. And I think it's very well received. And I \u2013 there is a tremendous brand equity in that Chubb name. And it just has a distinguishing brand image in terms of service and claims like no other insurance company I know. And that is an asset. And that is an asset that we will promote that we will burnish that we are fiduciaries of and we will protect. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You are welcome Helen Wilson - Chubb Limited : Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation.

Then, we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now, it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Chubb had a very good quarter that contributed to an excellent year, in both financial and non-financial results. We set big agenda for ourselves and accomplished most all of what we set out to achieve. Financially, we produced record annual operating earnings per share, world-class combined ratios, strong book and tangible book value growth and a good operating ROE. We accomplished these results despite elevated catastrophe losses and soft P&C market conditions globally. Operationally, we completed the largest merger in insurance history and managed a transformational companywide global integration effort all while staying focused on our core business of underwriting and servicing customers and distribution partners, retaining our commercial and personal lines customers at or above all time high. We launch new products, and entirely new businesses, made investments in our people, technologies and capabilities, began to harness the complementary strengths of the organization, cross selling and other revenue initiatives. We achieved or exceeded substantially all of the financial and non-financial targets we established when we initiated the merger. After-tax operating income for the quarter was 1.3 billion or 2.72 per share, compared to 2.38 per share up over 14%. For the year, net operating income was over 4.7 billion or $10.12 per share, up about 3.5% and illustrating the accretive nature of the merger. Earnings in the quarter included one-time 113 million pre-tax benefit related to the harmonization of our U.S. retirement programs. Phil will have more to say about the retirement program changes and both one-time and ongoing income benefits they will produce. As a reminder, when discussing our underwriting results and premium growth, I will compare our results to the 15 year as if we were one company back then and excluding the effects of purchase accounting from the 16 year underwriting results. That is how I look at it and I think that gives you the clearest view of operations. Our combined ratios for the quarter and year were simply excellent. Beginning with the quarter, the P&C combined ratio was 87.6%. That compares to an 87.3% last year as if we were one company back then. Included in that combined ratio were about 100 million more of Cat losses and slightly less positive prior period reserve development than prior year. Therefore, the P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding Cat losses was outstanding at 87.1% versus 88.6% prior year. Driven by both our core global P&C business, which produced very good results and our crop insurance business, which had a simply outstanding quarter due to a very strong crop underwriting year. Crop insurance underwriting income in the quarter was up 128 million over prior year quarter. The current accident year also benefited from reduce expense ratio about half a point. For the year, powered by 3.2 billion underwriting income, the combine ratio was 88%, compared to 87.5% last year and that\u2019s with about 211 million more in Cat losses and pretty flat year-on-year prior period reserve development, which again speaks to the quality and underlying strength of our underwriting product portfolio construction. Net investment income for the quarter was 845 million, which was above the top of the guidance we gave you last quarter. For the year, net investment income was 3.3 billion about equal to underwriting income and an excellent result given the interest rate environment, which was at historic lows for most of the year until the sudden rise following the election. In the quarter, I was encourage by what I hope is the beginning of the shift towards a greater fiscal related stimulus policy in the U.S. including tax reform, reduced business regulation and increased infrastructure investment in place of an over-reliance on monitory policy, which in my judgment has more than run its course. However, given continued overreliance on cheap money and excessive liquidity in Europe and Japan in particular coupled with lack luster global economic growth, the world is not coordinated. And one impact of that is a stronger dollar. Chubb's strong earnings lead to a very good operating ROE of 11% for the quarter and 10.5% for the year. Keep in mind, every 100 basis points of investment portfolio yield for Chubb is equal to approximately 175 basis points of ROE. Book and tangible book value growth in the quarter was negatively impacted by the sharp rise in interest rates and to a lesser extent the dollar. There were a number of offsetting positive items that all together met net book and tangible book were relatively flat a very good result. For the year, book value per share increased about 15.5% and tangible book value per share decreased 16% both as a result of the merger. However, it is worth noting that from the merger closing on January 14 to year-end, book value per share increased 7.5% and tangible book value per share increased over 13%. We are ahead of where we expected to be in both per share and tangible book value growth with the later now down 16% versus an initial 29% at the time of the merger closing and on-track to hit pre-transaction levels in three and a quarter years. For those who like to micro analyze, it was three and quarter when we announced the merger in July of 2015 and we lost three months due to the dramatic rise in interest rates in the fourth quarter and its mark-to-market impact on book value. However, by the end of the quarter and now we are back to where we started. Phil will have more to say about investment income, change to VA portfolio, tangible book value prior period reserve development and Cat. For the quarter, premium revenue was in-line with what we experienced during the year. In fact, a little bit better. The same themes prevail, strong retentions of business, less new business due to market conditions, modestly more new business due to cross-selling and the strength of the organization and a revenue penalty due in large part to merger related underwriting actions including the purchase of additional reinsurance. The impact from this last item will ameliorate as we move through 2017. For the year, P&C net premiums and global P&C net premiums, which exclude agriculture were both down 1% in constant dollars, excluding merger related underwriting actions. For the quarter, P&C net premiums on the same basis were essentially flat while global P&C net premiums were up over 1%. The commercial P&C insurance market globally is soft and conditions vary depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. Rates are generally flat or declining depending on class of business, size of customer and territory. Terms of conditions have been softening a bit in a number of classes. On the other hand, there are a few stress classes here and there where we are achieving rates. As noted in prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered is more competitive than midsize. Though middle market is becoming more competitive, particularly in the U.S. and Europe. As companies stress about growth and reach more aggressively. Wholesale is again more competitive than retail. Certain markets are notably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, Australia and Brazil by example are particularly competitive, while in the U.S. and Continental Europe competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly, but softening nonetheless. Claims inflation has been lower than historical averages in recent years, but hardly non-existed. And as pricing hasn\u2019t kept pace, industry combined ratios are coming under pressure. At the same time, as you have noticed loss cost inflation has increased in certain classes professional lines and automobile in the U.S. come to mind. As I mentioned earlier, natural catastrophe losses were up last year, it was the sixth costliest year on record for Cat, but not enough the impact the oversupply of industry capital. The industry capital base continues to expand from a combination of retained earnings and new investors. So globally, new business remains harder to come by. It is a hungry market and competition is fierce for new business. On the other hand, speaking for our company, our total capabilities in terms of product, ability to serve different insurance customers, our deep distribution strength and extensive geographic reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is simply outstanding and we are just getting started. Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segments. Renewal pricing overall range from flat and our U.S. middle market business to down 2% in both our U.S. major accounts and international retail commercial P&C businesses. In North America, retail general and specialty casualty-related pricing range from flat to down 1.5%. Financial lines pricing range from flat to down 2% and property related pricing range from down 1.5% to down 5%. Internationally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing range from up 3% to down 3%. Financial lines pricing range from flat to down 3% and property related pricing range from down 1% to down 5%. Now, with that as context, let me give you some detail on our revenue results for the quarter. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were down about 5%. Normalizing for the impact of the additional reinsurance, we purchased and for the underwriting actions we took, net premiums were down 2.5%. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was quite good at over 89% with middle market at 88% and major accounts at 92%. Overall, new business writings for North America commercial lines were down about 8%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were down almost 5%. The additional reinsurance we purchased had a 6.5 point impact, and the Fireman\u2019s Fund had about a 0.5 point impact. Therefore, growth was 2.2% for the combined Chubb and ACE portfolios. Rates were up two exposure changes added about 3.5. Retention remained quite strong for the Chubb and ACE portfolios at about 95%. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up five in the quarter in constant dollar and up over 7.5 when normalized through the additional reinsurance and underwriting actions. However, it is worth noting that we benefited in our international business from a $48 million one-time premium increase that will not repeat. Growth in international was lead by Latin America with net premiums up over 10, followed by the continent of Europe, Asia and the UK with growth of 7.5, 6.5 and 2.5 respectively. In our London market, based CNS business premiums were flat. As I said earlier, our agriculture business had a great year, highlighted by a combined ratio of about 74%. This is a Cat like business and therefore it has certain volatility to it by its nature. Its weather exposed, with weather impacting crop yields and commodity prices. We have experienced both sides of volatility, years with great growing seasons and others with drought. This has been and continues to be a good business for Chubb. In sum, while market conditions globally are competitive I expect as we progress through 2017 and the impact of the merger continues to fade and the compelling power and capabilities of the organization gain more momentum matched against the long list of opportunities in front of us, we will produce faster growth. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends. I want to say a few words about integration. Among the noteworthy accomplishments of last year, was the integration of two large companies realizing substantial efficiencies while remaining outward facing and managing and growing our business in all aspects. While more work remains, a substantial portion of the heavy lifting is moving behind us and we'll continue as 2017 progresses. From underwriting to claims, to real-estate and IT, to finance and HR, our operational integration has been detailed and all encompassing and we are ahead of schedule in all areas. As for cultural integration, there is a strong sense of unity in placing growing in the company. Through shared experience small and large, they are knitting ourselves together and breeding familiarity. And that in time creates trust, loyalty, friendship and a one team spirit. We don't overly talk about and contemplate our culture, except to the extent we all need to be on the same page with clarity and comfort. Instead, we prefer to simply live our culture. In terms of financial measures while early days at the end of one year we are on-track or ahead of the objectives underpinning the merger. These include expense savings, operating EPS, ROE and as I noted earlier per share book and tangible book value. Where we said the merger would be immediately accretive to earnings and book value per share, we are ahead of our own internal projections. As well as what we would likely have been on our plans as a standalone ACE Limited company. Broadly speaking, we are in a time of uncertainty, economically and geopolitically. On the one hand, the world is a tense place, marked by growing nationalism and populism that are feeding protection as sentiment. This is a global phenomenon. I might add, while early days I am concerned about our own country\u2019s potential trade and security posture. On the other hand, in the U.S., the monetary and fiscal changes afoot around tax, regulation of business, infrastructure and higher interest rates are real positive for business, jobs and the economy if implemented in a way that doesn\u2019t exacerbate budget deficits. Finally, we are a country of immigrants; our country\u2019s openness to immigration is fundamental to our identity and history as a nation and vital to our future prosperity. I am 100% for the security of citizens, but at the same time America is the land of the free and we are beacon in place of refuge that those seeking a better and safer life to themselves and their families. Shutting our doors to immigration is a mistake. Despite or challenging environment, Chubb is a company built to outperform, I have never been more confident in our people and capabilities and I am optimistic and simply energized when I think about our company\u2019s future both 2017 and beyond. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil, and then I\u2019ll be back to take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thanks Evan. We have come to our first year of the merger with excellent and stable ratings, a strong balance sheet and substantial of capital generating capabilities. Our operating cash flow was 1.5 billion for the quarter and 5.3 billion for the year. In the quarter, investment income was 845 million, which was higher than our previously expected range of 820 million to 830 million, 8 million was due to a one-time positive merger related adjustments. We also had increased call activity on our corporate bond portfolio and we are benefiting from the changes we have made to the management of our portfolio. Where there are always a number of factors that impact the variability and investment income, we are raising our expectation for our quarterly investment income run rate to range of 830 million to 840 million. Net realized and unrealized losses after tax for the quarter were 1 billion comprising a 1.3 billion loss from our investment portfolio, primarily from rising interest rates and a foreign currency loss of 300 million. These were partially offset by 275 million gains from our VA reinsurance portfolio also from rising interest rates and 350 million favorable adjusted related to our retiree plans. Net loss reserves decrease 687 million for the quarter on a constant dollar basis. This reflects the favorable impact of the agriculture book of 339 million. Favorable PPD of 238 million and 60 million of amortization of the fair value liability adjustment established in purchase accounting. On an \u201cAs If\u201d and constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased 1.2 billion for the year adjusted for the items discussed above. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 99% for the quarter and 92% for the year both also adjusted for items discussed above. We had positive prior period development of $238 million pre-tax or $208 million after tax with 56% from short-tail lines and 44% from 44% from long-tail lines principally from accident years 2010 and prior. This included $78 million pre-tax of adverse development for legacy asbestoses exposures, which are now included in corporate. Our catastrophe losses in the fourth quarter net of reinsurance were $268 million pre-tax or $222 million after tax. Ag losses included a $190 million from Hurricane Matthew and $60 million from the New Zealand earthquake. During the fourth quarter of 2016, the company harmonized and amended several U.S. retirement programs to create a unified retirement savings program. In 2020, the company will transition a traditional defined benefit pension program that had been in effect for certain employees to define contribution program. Additionally, after 2025 the company plans to eliminate a subsidized U.S. retiree healthcare plan that had been in place for certain employees. The U.S. pension and retiree healthcare plan changes favorably impacted book value by $322 million reflecting a more favorable - decrease in benefit obligations. Net income and operating income were favorably impacted by the one-time $113 million pre-tax benefit related to the harmonization of the U.S. pension plans. This item is excluded from the P&C combined ratio. On an annualized basis, the company expects to continue to recognize a benefit of $100 million pre-tax or $65 million after tax each year for the next five years relating to the harmonization after which the benefit continues in a range of $50 million to $80 million pre-tax depending on interest rates at the time. Life underwriting income includes the unfavorable impact of an adjustment made to the long-term benefit ratio used in determining operating income associated with the company's variable annuity reinsurance business. During the quarter, the company determined that certain assumptions, primarily long-term interest rates, underlying the long-term benefit ratio should be updated. This adjusted resulted in a pre-tax and after tax operating charge of $17 million. Since we carry the overall GMIB reserves at fair value, this adjustment represents a shift between operating income and realized gains and does not impact book value. The company expects a similar incremental impact to underwriting income and realized gains in future quarters, which will total an approximate $60 million reduction in operating income and a corresponding realized gain in 2017. During the quarter, premium growth was negatively impacted by merger related underwriting actions including additional reinsurance of $206 million bringing the total for the year to $650 million and impacting growth by 2.3%. Our integration efforts are either on-track or ahead of schedule as Evan said. Total integration related savings realized in the quarter and for the year were 123 million and 325 million respectively. Annual run rate savings of 800 million by the end of 2018 are on-track. Total revenue synergies produced in the quarter and for the year were 83 million and 297 million respectively. For some additional color, revenue synergies for the quarter related to our North America retail P&C business represented 14% of our new business. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Ryan Tunis, Credit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Hey thanks, good morning. My first question just on the pension. Is the 100 million that you expecting to recognize over the next five years or so additive to the $800 million expense save guide you have given in the past? Philip Bancroft : Yes, it is. The $800 does not include the incremental benefit from the past. Ryan Tunis : Okay. Understood. And then I guess just going back to Evan\u2019s discussion about the positive impact on ROE from higher interest rates. And just thinking about how to balance, how to think about balancing underwriting returns, ROE and growth, I guess due this next cycle. If you have got higher interest rate, lower tax rates, arguably more competition. I mean should we be more focused ROE is the metrics are pricing around or should we continue to be thinking about kind of underlying combined ratios that are sub-90? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : I think, with the exception of your final comment, I think you should be focused on underwriting combined ratio. And we look at underwriting independent of investment income. We underwrite around here to an acceptable combined ratio. And yes, we do look at senior most levels in terms of capital management; we do look at how much capital each business draws and at certain combined ratio hurdles, what kind of ROE we\u2019ll produce. And that sort of sets to a degree targets that we establish for our businesses that combined ratios we don\u2019t want exceeding. If that helps you. Ryan Tunis : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, I\u2019ll get back in the queue. Operator : Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning. I was hoping first to get some, in terms of the potential for corporate tax reform in the U.S.I know Chubb is in a little bit of a different position given your split domicile. But how do you just high level see tax reform impacting Chubb and when you think about the potential for tax reform, do you think it gets competed away, meaning if a company is operating at a higher tax rate, they can potential push for lower prices as they manage their book to a certain ROE? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I\u2019m going to answer your first part first. Anybody who runs a decent business, they don\u2019t run their business based on tax. Tax does not drive how you make your fundamental decisions and how you operate a business. I have worked in more than one company and I have never, that kind of conversation is never entered into how we think about our business. So we think about underwriters, underwriting which is what we do for living and combined ratios, there is hardly does tax ever enter the discussion. As to the first part of your question for our U.S. sourced business, look our U.S. business represents over 60% of our company's business. And our U.S. sourced business has the tax rate in the 20%. Tax reform is important to us and it's important to our country. And as the U.S. economy would improve at my judge over tax reform that would benefit the insurance industry, because that would mean faster economic growth and faster economic growth means more exposure, more exposure means faster growth for insurance. So I am in favor of tax reform. Right now, they are discussing, as you know it's a long way before we have tax reform and we are at very early stages. What Republic and Congress has put on the table so far revolves around border adjustment. How border adjustment will be interpreted for financial services is not yet clear. And in fact to those who are writing tax policy who we are very engaged with it is not clear to them. When it comes to insurance, the question on the table right now revolves around two, reserves, how reserves will be treated, number two in particular, how reinsurance will be treated. In my judgment border adjustment tax, reinsurance is clearly an export of risk. You're exporting risk and you don't know the profit and loss so that risk ahs ultimately been earned through. It is hardly an importing of capital. So I would expect that would be treated in a reasonable way in tax policy and that would be the advantage of the U.S. We are taking the advantage of the world balance sheet where insurance has benefited corporate America and consumer America just greatly over the years. Elyse Greenspan : Okay thank you. Last quarter on your call, you alluded to some initiatives on the small commercial side. Can you just talk to the receptivity from agents in that business? I know it's still early days, but any kind of takeaways from kind of the fourth quarter and into 2017? Evan Greenberg : It's very early days. And we'll talk about it a little bit. But I'm measuring this so that at least we stay on would be swear on perspective. I'm measuring this over years given the nature of it. These are relatively small policies and it takes a long time to build something. Paul Krump love to tell the stories. I know he is from the Mid West and I'm going to turn it over to him for a moment. Paul Krump : Well thank you Evan. Elyse thanks for the question. Small commercial I think we very much on-track but again as Evan said I can't overemphasize. But this is what building this over years, but to your direct question, the receptivity by the agents and brokers has been outstanding. First of all, they love the platter of products that we are bringing into bear. They know and they have seen what we are building for the CSR\u2019s so that it\u2019s easy to do business with us. There are some really strong competitors in this space, but this is a very fragmented marketplace and we are beginning welcomed and it\u2019s just going to take some time to continue to build it. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. And just one last question if I may. As you alluded to Evan in your comments about the prospects for higher inflation. As the industry deals with inflation, I think its some people start to think about potential reserve picks to be tested on some of the longer tail lines. Now that the company has been merged for about, a year and you have gone through both the legacy company reserves. Can we just get high level of view about the condition that you have in the fixed and some of your longer tail lines, as we think about potential inflationary trends picking up from here? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It\u2019s very simple. The last number of years, most recent past inflation has been benign, lost cost inflation has been benign. But both companies have continued to use historic trend factors and we have done that right through our current year in our casualty related lines that\u2019s what matters. And so with that, I think we are comfortable if we return to a higher loss trend. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Charles Sebaski, BMO Capital Markets. Charles Sebaski : Good morning. The first question is on the North America retail, I think Phil mentioned 14% of the new business synergies are from that. Just hoping to get a little bit more clarity on where the synergies are coming from and if that includes the A&H within that synergy line or how you are thinking about that? Evan Greenberg : Sure it does. Let\u2019s see. Who would like to take this? John. John Lupica : Sure. I\u2019ll take a crack. So thank you for the question Charles. In terms of that cross-sell coming from all forms of synergies mainly in our specialty lines. The great hallmark of Chubb was in the phenomenal distribution and the agency network, ACE brings a lot of specialty products. So we have been spending the better part of the year making sure that product breadth is getting introduced into that agency of course and into our core customer base. So specialties like environmental, like A&H that we are selling, builders risks, all through the industry verticals, it is driving that cross-sell. In addition, the strength of the organization where we are bringing our core product to a new distribution of course we are measuring that as well. So between growth initiatives, specialties, strength of the organization, we really do see the power of the group coming together. Charles Sebaski : Okay. I guess on a broader base on product line. Evan, a lot of the rate commentary you gave seem to be that a lot of lines are reasonably managed in a couple of points plus or minus. Are there any lines that give you pause, I have seen some stuff recently that there has been some pullouts of political risk. Is there areas where things are just, maybe needing to take a step back or the market is not where you think it should be rational, reasonable? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Charles sure. There is not lines of business where we need to step back, because we see trouble underwriting. We will see that. We are really on top of it and vigilant about that. We always look for early signs. Obviously, with the merger, there are businesses that weren't meeting our standards that we have cancelled and - some we cancelled put them in run-off and I have spoken about that. Beyond that, I think the message is pretty simple. We don't like a lot of the market pricing for new business. And so we are willing to take the new business penalty. The numbers I gave you were the numbers - the rates and the rate movement was for our renewal portfolio. And we measure relativity of the new business pricing against our renewal rates. And our new business pricing is very similar to our renewal pricing. But to be able to achieve that we have to be willing to write less business, we are seeing more submissions. The first quarter our submission activity was up substantially, but the amount that we will right is down and that reflects the competitive market conditions where we are just simply not going to dumb stuff for growth. Charles Sebaski : Okay. And as just finally, I think at the very beginning Evan you made a comment that you said you have accomplished most of the things that you wanted to with the merger and integration of Chubb. Curious on what may not have gotten to par. Evan Greenberg : I didn't want to use the word everything, so I thought that would just sound a little arrogant. And we always are vein hopeful about things. When I step back I got it tell you and really look at it. It's always a little crap on the margin, but we have accomplished what we set out to achieve in the year. Our revenue growth was a little less than I wanted it to be, but when look at it, sure in the early part of the year there was market distracts - there was internal distractions emerging, but we expected that. It was the market itself I think just given the nature of competition, we didn't write as much new as I would like to have written. But okay, that's it. Don't worry about it. Charles Sebaski : Thank you very much for the answers. Evan Greenberg : And we lost a handful of people, we wish we hadn't lost. But we planned; we knew we were going to lose people we didn't want to lose. We lost far fewer of those, but still each of them breaks your heart. Charles Sebaski : Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from [indiscernible] Barclays. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. With regard to the comment that growth should improve looking ahead. Does that mean we should expect positive growth in North America commercial and personal lines? Evan Greenberg : Yes. For 2017 in total, I expect that that\u2019s what we are going to see that\u2019s our objective. And remember there is going to be - so I just give you a little more color. The re-underwriting, the underwriting actions we took due to the merger break into two pieces, business that we cancel and that runoff will have an impact through the year. So that impact will diminish. The additional reinsurance we purchased that will have an impact fundamentally in the first half of the year and should be about gone by the end of the mid-year. And then, we have underlying actions that we already see the power building in our core business or core middle market in our A&H business, specialty casualty areas. I expect in our large account business more of a slight to safety and quality, which we are seeing in our risk management and our multinational business. I expect our industry verticals and the power of that to produce the better result or high net-worth business. The two legacy companies together with the core portfolio will do better. And I expect specialty, personalized, internationally and small middle market around the world to contribute. And A&H I said that I mean that globally. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Evan you just mentioned [FICO] (Ph) safety and quality, there has been a number of large global property casualty insurers facing ongoing turmoil. Can you update us your thoughts in terms of what that means for Chubb? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Chubb is a steady as she goes going from strength-to-strength. Our product offering has never been broader and beyond that our ability to coordinate all of the skills of the organization and bring it to bear for a customers, honest to god it\u2019s never been more compelling. The technology that we have to service the large account business and bring total solution, but manage it through the customer. We are really distinguishing ourselves, our service and our service reputation in both underwriting and claims is a breath of fresh air for most who have experienced some of those companies that are having issues. We have been very predictive going steady for our customers and for those who might be interested in trying us out. That\u2019s what they want. They want predictability and steadiness of both breadth of product offerings, because we offer as broad or broader product offering than any other competitor to our customers from risk management to access casualty to professional lines, to environmental, to their international needs around the world. And very few can do that and we do it in a very steady predictable way, we are not changing year-to-year in our appetite or in how we approach the underwriting of that business. That has just caused us to gain more customers, we continue to first of January was very good for us that way. We are gaining more customers; we are gaining more who are taking a look at us. Particularly as they are more uncomfortable with where they have been. And it's easy to see why they were uncomfortable. Some of those companies appeared to be wrong. Unidentified Analyst : Interesting. And my final question is on asbestos trends, a number of other large companies with legacy asbestos exposures have had to raise the reserve estimates this year. Chubb didn't, I believe, can you discuss that? Evan Greenberg : No, no, we have raised our reserve estimates; we did take a charge this quarter. The net amount was about $87 million I believe. $78 million. And that was a net of both branding wide taking a bit higher charge and we put the federal reserves on a life basis. And they had some favorable development. The two of them together produce the 78 million. But we are not seeing importantly a change in trends in asbestos. It was very case specific for us. The one place where we have seen a bit of an increase in cost is in defensive cases. We are defending cases rigorously and the cost of the defending those has been more inflated. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you for the answers. Evan Greenberg : And we recognize that in our reserves. Operator : Our next question comes from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan. Sarah DeWitt : Hi good morning. Talk about inflation picking up in an earlier question. But there is a difference between general U.S. inflation and insurance claims inflation. I was wondering if you just talk about your outlook for the factors that drive claims inflation under the new administration and Congress. And if you could also just elaborate on your comment at professional lines claims inflation was picking up. Evan Greenberg : Yes, professional lines claims inflation is an obvious that everybody can see who book into business its public information. I will come back to it. Look, Congress and the new administration all speculation. I have no idea and you have no idea. Its one thing they have in agenda, but what are you actually going to pass and how long is it going to take to accomplish. And then what will be its impact ultimately well that's pretty far down the road. So we don't speculate and in our lost text, we don't speculate. Insurance inflation is about parts and labor. It's about legal cost, medical expense and that is up to what we called social inflation. And those cost inputs are different than general inflation as I'm sure you know. When it comes to professional lines, there have been more security class action suites, there were number of sources of that. And in particular, and we have noticed that in claims reporting and development. How many of those notices turned on to actual claims and what are the size of those claims. The severity has been fairly constant. It\u2019s been an increase in frequency this year. And we are vigilant about that. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. Great. Thank you. And then secondly, if interest rates go up, do you think that benefit get competed away by the market? Evan Greenberg : You know to a degree. You have always seen that. There are companies who cash flow underwrite and underwrite to total return, they usually are great underwriting companies, I have never noticed that they are. And then good companies remain more disciplined about that and don\u2019t compete it away. So, it\u2019s a chaotic world. You will see all varieties. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. First question Evan you mentioned about the given pricing pressure, the industry combined ratio is under pressure. So if you look at Chubb, actually you are underlying combined ratio has remained largely stable. I was just wondering, can you see your underwriting actions or the more realized expense savings from the merger could overcome the pricing pressure to maintain or improve the margin in the coming years? Evan Greenberg : What I see is that it will ameliorate a rise in combined ratio. Expense ratio will ameliorate a rise in loss ratio, the merger expense benefits. The underwriting actions we taken and portfolio management and mix of business will also ameliorate loss ratio. But does it eliminate it? No. And overtime, I expect naturally if the market remains as it is and I think the market you see is the market you get. I think it various by line of business et cetera, the dynamics but in total, I expect that it rises. We have certain lines of business like agriculture, like high net-worth, like A&H that really aren\u2019t subject to that at all. You have other businesses like middle market commercial and traditional business that is less impacted by that. So the mix of the portfolio and how we have selected our portfolio and constructed it and the geographies in which we conduct different businesses have a way of ameliorating. But each individual line by itself has this pressure of loss ratio in a market where rate is flat or down and trend continues. And of course, we are of the market. What I am confident about is that we will continue to distinguish ourselves and outperform. Kai Pan : Okay. Thank you. And my second question is on the capital management, the Board recently authorized $1 billion programs through 2017. I just wondered when they discussed at this topic, how do you allocate that the size of the buyback relative to your $5 billion annual earnings and relative to your dividends, as well as potential growth and acquisition opportunities? Evan Greenberg : Well, if you know. First of all, look at earnings on an after tax basis and we have dividend policy that we payout roughly 30% we say it took a 30% in dividends. We then look at opportunity both internal growth and potential external opportunities to grow over a period of time and capital flexibility. And so through that discussion, we determine what a comfortable target is for company need and then what remains is how we determine what to return to shareholders. Then we have a discussion of what is the best for the return to shareholders. Its dividend related, is it one-time dividend or is it share repurchase, and that's how we come to it. Kai Pan : Okay great. Well thanks so much. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Nannizzi with Goldman Sachs. Michael Nannizzi : Thanks so much. Just I want to get a little clarification Evan you were talking about growth and you talked a little bit about reinsurance changes in the 2016 and the fourth quarter. So do your comments imply that you expect growth on a gross basis than just to step out of the whole reinsurance conversation? Evan Greenberg : Yes, but we also have business and we have been very transparent with you about that. Business portfolios that in the merger when we pull the companies together and went through the business we said there are business portfolios that are not meeting or standards we have talked about some of those and that we cancelled those. Well those when you cancelled them you are eliminating gross as well as net. So you got to keep that in mind. Michael Nannizzi : Okay got it. And then just quick on the Ag book. So the last couple of years have been below and well below at sort of 80 to 90 range. Just trying to think about that business, and the last couple of years have been both below the range especially the last one 2016 being that. How should we be thinking about whether it's your use of reinsurance in this line or what the profitability should look like, should we get back to that more normal level, or it\u2019s just a good starting point to think about what that business should be able to contribute? Evan Greenberg : I think you guys have short memory. This year was a very good year. Last year was a good year, but not that far off the normal trend by the way, it was a good year but not that far off. And we look over it 10, 15 and 20 year. We put the business on level, because there were things that impact loss ratio in the current year that didn't impact 20 years ago, because prices have changed, yields per acre and how seed and fertilizer behaves changed to the positive in that, growing seasons have changed a bit because of weather. So we actually consider all of that and put on level that come the historic combined ratio. And that historic that you cite of that 89,90 is where we have remain. And that's why we are saying to you, I don't wait for a bad year to say, this I will say it in a good year. It\u2019s a Cat like business and it has a volatility to it and so you measure it over a period of time. But, I think it\u2019s not excessive, we get a reasonable risk adjusted return on that business and I think we have very clear competitive advantages in our franchise, that just put us light years ahead of, fundamentally, anyone else in that business. Particularly around our analytics, our deep distribution and spread of business, our knowledge and insight of data and people with experience that go back so many years. And we have a cost advantage and a technology advantage that is very hard barrier to leap. Michael Nannizzi : Great. Thanks for that. And then maybe if I could sneak in one last one on maybe for Phil on the legacy Chubb municipal bond portfolio. How are you thinking about that? Do you expect to sell that down or just reinvest once those bonds mature? And just Evan, one more clarification, I don\u2019t have a short memory, I have a bad memory, that\u2019s totally. Philip Bancroft : So if you look at any portfolio, it\u2019s very highly graded at AA, 80% of its graded AA or higher. It earns a pretty attractive book yield, it\u2019s over 3.3% and it\u2019s got a duration of about 4.8 years. And I guess what we see now, I mean we talk about the changes of interest rates and the impact that may have on our choice to hold that portfolio, we are running scenarios at different tax rates to determine the impact on the portfolio. The ultimate allocation will depend not only on a tax rate, but also relative value of the municipals to the other possibilities in the portfolio. So we are evaluating it, we will look at it in light of the tax developments that emerged over the next months. Michael Nannizzi : Thank you so much for the answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Newsome, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I was hoping you could just run me through the accounting through the negative combined ratio in the Ag business, just so that of we know what went on there, because it\u2019s a little strange to have a negative combined ratio for a quarter. Evan Greenberg : Yes. We are not going to run you through it. But Phil will take, if you want to get more detail, take it offline. But it\u2019s pretty simple. In this business, remember it\u2019s a public private sector sharing program, this is a Federal Government Sponsored Program. So there is a very clear formula that you follow, because the government takes a certain amount of the risks and both individual risks and excessive loss protections that they provide. And so depending on the actual year and how it comes out, you apply the formula of how you share with the government. In this quarter, you have to give premium to the government. Therefore, your earned based goes down substantially and that\u2019s how you end up with the negative combined ratio. They take premium, they take a certain amount of losses and so it\u2019s the denominator that is driving that. You are following me? Paul Newsome : I am. That\u2019s getting me where I want to go. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Thank you. Yes just looking at I guess the U.S. business as North American businesses. You did say in personalize side was that the accident year loss ratio excluding tax did jump up this quarter relative to the past four relative to the past seven. I'm wondering if there is any kind a unusual items in there whether a large loss activity. And then similarly in the commercial business again North America that accident year ratio ex-Cat wasn't quite as bigger jump, but it did go up from where it had been and I am wondering what is happening there as well. Evan Greenberg : Yes, I'm going to ask Paul Krump to talk about one of them the personal lines. And then I want to make a comments to you. And then I am going to have John Lupica just talk about the commercial lines what happened one-on-one. Paul Krump : Well thanks for question Jay as Evan said I am a bit of a storyteller. So let me just backup here a second. The 2016 fourth quarter combined ratio for PRS is 82.1 excluding Cats and PPD. That compares to 80.9 in the fourth quarter of 2015, so up a little bit. However, the fourth quarter of 2015 underwriting income benefited by $18 million from back holiday related to the purchase of prior funds. So if we reduced the 2015 underwriting income by that one-time adjustment, we actually end up with an 82.4 current accident year combined ratio ex-Cat and PPD compared to the 82.1 that we had. So all up you actually saw on a combined ratio basis is 0.3 point improvement in the current accident year's combined ratio obviously mainly due to the expense ratio is often to the synergies and impacting the new reinsurance agreement that Evan just touched on numerous response. So the lost ratio was up a little bit. And as you said it was due to some losses and they were the non-Cat weather area, in particular we saw some more water damage claims and some burst pipes. But as Evan also said in his earlier comments that's a bit of noise. The reinsurance business goes up or down a little bit quarter-by-quarter. Jay Cohen : Yeah that's helpful Paul. Evan Greenberg : And John, actually the opposite. John Lupica : Yes Jay and thanks. On the commercial side, for both Paul and I are all in North America that the year-over-year change is really just the fact that our 2015 current accident year have a fewer amount and lower large losses than we saw in 2016. I wouldn't say 2016 was above average I would just say 2015 was probably below average and that's really the change. Evan Greenberg : Yes and it make sense to you Jay? Jay Cohen : Yes. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : And I just want to - I have read a number of that analysts early reports and talking about this questions. And I don't want to make comment about that. We had simply an outstanding quarter, our calendar year combined ratio reflects all the good and all the bad. i.e. there were more Cats, there was flat PPD. We had outstanding crop we had excellent global P&C results. Looking at the business as sort of well but for this, well but for that, except for one-time items like the pension benefit, which is fair is misleading in my mind, because all these businesses are ongoing businesses and it makes contribution. We are in the risk business, and there you are going to see noise always from one quarter to another quarter. We didn\u2019t reach in our current accident year reserving, whatsoever, and how we post loss ratios, we didn\u2019t suddenly grow optimistic and I remind you that we are conservative in how we manage our business. We recognize bad quickly and we are very slow to recognize good. So as you look at the individual pieces, I wanted to give you a bigger perspective on it. Jay Cohen : Got it. Operator : Our next question comes from Ian Gutterman, Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Hi. Thank you. First, a quick numbers one and then a question reserves. So could you just clarify that the 60 million in VA. Is that just for 2017 or is that sort of recurring thing well into the future? Philip Bancroft : It will go into the future. I mean, unless we change our view of interest rates or change other assumptions. But based on what we feel now that would be a continuing adjustment. Ian Gutterman : Got it. Thank you. And Evan just to flush out a little bit more sort of what is going on in the industry and where things maybe heading on reserves and so forth. I was hoping we could flush out a little bit more I think you alluded earlier. But, specifically the topic of adverse development coverage, whether they be just people buying a little bit of protection for align that they are a little nervous about to some of these gigantic unprecedented deals. It seems ADCs are back and away we haven\u2019t seen an almost 20 years now. And last time when they were prevalent, it seems to be a pretty good tale, right? I mean the buyers where the smart ones and the sellers where the dumb ones. And does it feel like that\u2019s happening again this time? And maybe a better way to ask this, would you guys sell an adverse development cover to anybody right now? Evan Greenberg : I am not in that business. What you see is soft versus the hard part of the cycle. People, as you get into, some are better underwriters and more disciplined in a competitive environment and they are to in this business than others are. And some are aggressive to growth and they sell very broad covers and they sell them at cheap prices and they don\u2019t have the command and control in underwriting and so they get surprise. And you put those two things together and now and again, there is a derivative business for garbage collectors, who come around new collection. And they collect the garbage out of portfolios and that\u2019s what you got here. I am not a buyer nor a seller. I can\u2019t imagine that we would be in a position where it would make sense for us to give up a substantial percentage of our loss reserve asset and its future income. Because we didn\u2019t have the risk management and the control and knowledge of our business that we would have to that will be so unsecure, we have to give up on our portfolio that way. Shrink our balance sheet that way. It makes no sense to me and for us how we run our business, but you seen it, this is a business that has grown over the years. There are couple of guys have been pretty good at and they have done a pretty good job. So not everyone I would say gets burned at it. But it is, this is an industry if you look at the ROE of the industry. And the mean is poor and there are both sides of that mean are those who outperform, on the other side those who underperform. And the ones who underperform they generate a lot of garbage and so the garbage collectors come around. Ian Gutterman : Very apt analogy. Thank you Evan. Helen Wilson : We have time for just one more person to ask question. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith : Hey thanks a couple of questions for you. first one Evan I'm just curious, are you at the point in the Chub integration where you are kind a comfortable enough that if something else comes up that you think you have got the not only the financial capacity but the management capacity to absorb a small mid-sized acquisition. Evan Greenberg : I want you to know, I am looking at room full of colleagues will absolutely taking out [indiscernible]. You know what, we are focused on integrating and getting the power of the promise of all of the capability against - matched against the opportunities that this organization has right now. and I'm going to leave it at that except to say we have management bandwidth. Brian Meredith : Okay great. And then my second question is just the VA volatility is almost like a nonsense. Is there any opportunity potentially to get rid of that at some point. Are you think you just going to stuck with it forever? Evan Greenberg : No, but the VA and we are going to do this in 2017. We are going to split the life business into three pieces that you could see. Our international life earnings in total - I don't know the exact number. like $27 million this year and will grow they ought to grow substantially in 2017 and that's for our international life insurances. Our combined underwriting income for the combined insurance company that's in the life division that part of it produces good earnings. And you will see those pieces. The VA was producing [indiscernible] at one point about $100 million, $150 million or $160 million year of operating income. It's come down to about $120 million or $130 million. and now it's coming down to like $60 million going forward. And keep in mind this is that it hasn't produced good income for us, but with obviously the book value volatility that has gone with after the market. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. Helen Wilson : Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day.",

Welcome to the Chubb Limited First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I'll turn the conference over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Wilson : Thank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2017 First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, investment income, pricing and business mix, economic and market conditions and integration of our Chubb Corporation acquisition and potential synergies and benefits. All of these are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please refer to our most recent SEC filings and earnings press release and financial supplements, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings release and financial supplement, which are available at investors.chubb.com. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg: Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb had a very good start to the year with strong results. After-tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.48 per share compared to $2.26 per share the prior year, up nearly 10%. As a reminder, we closed the acquisition on January 14 last year, so our 2016 first quarter results excluded two weeks of Chubb earnings. For comparison purposes, adding those 14 days back into the last year's first quarter, operating income per share this quarter was up 8%. When discussing our underwriting results and premium growth, I will occasionally use the term \"as if\" to compare our results to last year's first quarter as if we were one company for the entire quarter and excluding merger-related accounting and underwriting actions. I expect, as the year progresses, we will reduce the need to reference \"as if\" for quarterly year-on-year results comparisons. Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent at 87.5%. That compares to 90% last year or 88.9% as if we were one company for the full quarter. Total P&C underwriting income of $783 million was up 28% or about 9% as if. The underlying current accident year combined ratio, excluding cat losses was simply outstanding at 88% and better than last year, driven by a strong performance in our core global P&C business in particular. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $836 million, in line with the guidance we gave you last quarter and up 9% over prior year or 3% if we include the investment income for the 14 day stub period. Chubb's strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of circa [ph] 10% for the quarter, while book and tangible book value per share were up 1.7% and 3.1%, respectively. From post-merger closing to this March 31, book value per share has increased over 9.5% and tangible book has increased about 16%. Bill will have more to say about investment income, tangible book value, and cats, and prior period reserve development. For the quarter premium revenue growth was about in line with our expectations and what we described last quarter. The same themes prevailed; strong retentions of business, growth in new business over last year's first quarter, but constrained nonetheless due to market conditions, a contribution of new business from cross-selling and the strength of the organization, and a reduction in revenue due to merger-related underwriting actions, including the purchase of additional reinsurance. As a reminder, the impact from these last items, which this quarter amount to about 3% of P&C net premium, should ameliorate as we move through the year. For the quarter, P&C net premiums were up about 13.5% in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had a 0.5 point impact. On an as-if basis, P&C net premiums were up over 2%. The commercial P&C insurance market is soft globally. And conditions vary depending on the territory, line of business and size of risk. Rates are flat or declining, depending on class of business, size of customer and territory. The rate of decline is slowing, because pricing in many classes has reached or is reaching unprofitable levels.  On the other hand, there are a few stress classes where we're able to achieve or hold rate. Market terms and conditions continued to soften in a number of classes. At the same time we are discussing rate and term movement, keep in mind, that for the industry, claim inflation is hardly nonexistent and pricing hasn't kept pace, contributing further to industry combined ratios under pressure. And as you have noticed, in fact, loss cost inflation has increased in certain classes while overall reserve adequacy is starting to come under pressure. As noted in prior quarters, large account business, particularly shared and layered, is more competitive than mid-sized. But middle market is incrementally more competitive, particularly in the U.S. and Europe as companies stress about growth and reach more aggressively. Wholesale again is certainly more competitive than retail. Again, like last quarter, certain markets are noticeably more competitive than others. London, Bermuda, and Brazil by example are particularly competitive. While in the U.S. and Continental Europe, competition is a little less ferocious and a bit more orderly but soft or softening nonetheless. Globally, new business remains harder to come by in what simply can be characterized as a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some degree where the power of the organization is brought to bear for a client or producer. Also, our total capabilities in terms of product, ability to serve many different types of insurance customers, our deep distribution strength, and extensive geographic reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional and, by the way, will only improve with time. Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segment. Renewal pricing was down about a 0.5% in our U.S. middle market business, with exposure change a positive 0.5%. In our U.S. major accounts business, renewal pricing was down about 1.5%, with exposure change a positive 1.2%. In our international retail Commercial P&C business, pricing was down 2%. By major class of business, beginning with North America retail, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down about 1%. Financial lines pricing was down about a 0.5% and property-related pricing was down about 3.5%. Internationally, general and specialty casualty-related pricing was down 1%, financial lines pricing was down 1%, and property-related pricing was down 2%. Now with that as context, let me give you some more detail on our revenue results for the quarter. In our North America Commercial P&C business, net premiums were up over 19%. Normalizing for the 14 days in January and the impact of merger-related underwriting actions, net premiums were flat. The renewal retention rate as measured by premium was 88.5%, with middle market and small commercial at about 87% and major accounts at nearly 94%. It is worth mentioning that while the overall market is competitive, there are a few classes, such as property and casualty coverage for real estate-related risks, where one or two companies simply for volume, defy any logic and are writing at terms that will produce very large underwriting losses in the future. In these instances, we just walk away. On the other hand, where there is a flight to quality advantage and the strength of our firm stands out, such as in our risk management business, renewal retention can be as high as 100%. Overall, new business writings for North America commercial lines were up 16% over first quarter 2016. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 13%. On an as-if basis, and excluding the 5 point impact of additional reinsurance, growth was about 6.5%. Rates were up over 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remained quite strong at over 95%. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for international retail P&C business were up 10.5% in the quarter in constant dollars or nearly 6% as if. Growth for our global A&H business was up more than 5% in constant dollars or 1.5% as if, made up of 4.5% in North America, which includes combined insurance and our group A&H business, and about 1.5% in international. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. I want to say a few words about integration. Operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on track or ahead of schedule. Integration-related savings are directly contributing to our margins in the face of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends while giving us room to invest in our competitive profile, including our technology, talent, product expansion, and future operating efficiency. Total integration-related savings impacted our combined ratio by about two points. In closing, there is a combination of strength and stability in our company that is highly attractive to our distribution partners and customers. Our people are intently focused on execution of strategies. We have a lot of energy in the organization right now and a great deal of optimism and passion. Personally, I am confident in our people and capabilities and in our prospects near and long term. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we're going to come back and take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Chubb's overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we continued to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $460 million to shareholders, including $320 million in dividends and $140 million of shares repurchased. Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased $200 million. We also paid off $500 million of debt that matured in the quarter. Our $1 billion of 2007 hybrid notes converted to a floating rate earlier this month, which at current rates will reduce our 2017 interest expense by over $30 million. Investment income was $836 million and was within our expectations. While there are always a number of factors that impact the variability of investment income, we expect our quarterly run rate to remain in a range of $830 million to $840 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $360 million, primarily from our investment portfolio and principally due to decreases in interest rates. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on book value of $118 million and a small unfavorable impact on operating income of $3 million. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1 billion. Net loss reserves decreased $191 million for the quarter on a constant dollar basis. This primarily reflects a seasonal decrease in our crop reserves, favorable prior period reserve development in the quarter, and the amortization of the fair value liability adjustment established in purchase accounting. After adjusting for these items, net loss reserves increased by $319 million. The paid to incurred ratio in the quarter was 91% after adjusting for the items noted above. We had positive prior period development of $231 million pretax or $155 million after tax. This included $41 million pretax of adverse development related to the change in the Ogden discount rate in the UK, which impacted our casualty related exposures.  We also had favorable development of $79 million related to the 2016 crop year loss estimates. The remaining favorable development was split evenly between short-tail and long-tail lines with the long-tail coming from accident years 2013 and prior. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were $206 million or $164 million after tax compared to $258 million or $204 million after tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily from North America weather events and Cyclone Debbie in Australia. During the quarter, P&C premium growth was negatively impacted by incremental merger-related underwriting actions and additional reinsurance of $187 million, impacting growth by 3%. In addition, the alignment of accounting policies related to the timing of recognizing premiums in 2016 for certain of Chubb Corp's foreign subsidiaries adversely impacted the quarter by an additional $73 million or 1.1%. When considering these items, P&C premium growth was 2.2%. As Evan mentioned, our integration efforts are either on track or ahead of schedule. Total incremental integration-related savings realized in the quarter were $124 million, leading to total cumulative realized savings of $449 million. On an annualized run rate basis, savings through March are $710 million. The operating income tax rate for the quarter is 14%, which is below our expected range of 16% to 18%, primarily due to a tax benefit related to our employee benefit programs, including the required adoption of new accounting guidance on stock compensation. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll have our first question from Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Good morning and thank you. First question on the cost savings side, does it contribute two points to your P&C combined ratio, I just wondered, do you see potential upside to the $800 million target and how much of that will flow through bottom line versus reinvestment? Evan G. Greenberg: Upside to the $800 million. We are right now ahead of schedule in our realization of the $800 million on both an annualized and realized basis. We're thoughtfully reviewing where we are. And we will update our views about expense savings we will realize, both annualized and realized, at the end of the second quarter when we do the second quarter call. At that time, I expect we will upsize the $800 million. But beyond that, I'm not going to give you any guidance. Kai Pan : And how much would that flow through to the bottom line? Evan G. Greenberg: We're not, you know what, Kai, we're not going there. A substantial portion will flow through the bottom line. It's offset by natural rises in our operating expenses. We're a very efficient company. As you've noticed over the years, we control expenses well, but you still have natural inflation and expense. Then we have investments we're making in the company, technology in particular, though I note that it seems that there is a misunderstanding about how that works. Those are capitalized expenses. You have a timing question. And we hardly -- like anybody, we hardly lay out a model of here's how our -- here's the detail of how our expenses look. So you'll figure that for yourself. Kai Pan : Okay, great. My follow-up question is, if we step back, look at your earning growth potential, we see your combined ratio is very good and already very good and premium gross profit is limited given the pricing environment and buyback could help EPS a little bit, probably a couple of points. What do you see could drive the EPS higher from here? And what do you see as a sort of earnings power for this franchise? Evan G. Greenberg: Well, I'm quite bullish about the earning power for the franchise. Margins, as you saw this quarter, are -- the loss ratios naturally rise as you're in a pricing environment that is soft and you have loss cost inflation. And that's ameliorated for us by both portfolio management, choices we can make in terms of where we grow our business, because we have far greater optionality in that regard, which helps to mix loss ratio. And then as you know, we have substantial expense improvements that help margins.  Secondly, the organization did grow. The underlying -- when you account for the underwriting noise due to the merger and the accounting, underneath it all, we did grow. And that growth was pretty broad-based. And in spite of the world we see, I see momentum. And our -- what we can do internally, the part we control, I see that part only improving and momentum building as time goes on, particularly in that middle market and small commercial business and pockets around the world. Our A&H business and our large account business, which had frankly quite good growth. If you look at our risk management business this quarter, it stood out because of flight to quality and capability and stability that Chubb presents that frankly is a standout. And so -- and then you look at our Personal Lines business that actually showed underlying growth in the quarter. I am quite bullish overtime about our capability to produce wealth creation. Kai Pan : Great, well thank you so much for all the answers. Evan G. Greenberg: You are welcome. Operator : Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. I first had a question, the cat losses screened pretty low this quarter just given the size of the industry losses that we saw in the U.S. So I was wondering if you can comment just on your exposure and did the rate of reinsurance that you guys purchased last year, did that help to alleviate some of the cat losses in the quarter? And so when we think about Chubb, is your kind of quarterly cat loss load lower now than it would have been for each of the legacy companies? Evan G. Greenberg: No, the additional reinsurance that we have purchased really didn't have an impact on ameliorating cat loss in the quarter. We set our appetite on cat losses as a percentage of capital in particular. And frankly, the cat losses in the quarter, it's geographic, it's where they hit. And they happened to hit where we had less concentration. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. And then can you provide, I mean your opening commentary, you spoke about higher inflation for the industry. Can you give a little bit more color by line, where you're seeing greater inflation? And what prior periods would you potentially compare the inflationary levels we're seeing today within the property and casualty industry? Evan G. Greenberg: Yes, I'm not going to go on that part. But look, you can see it pretty simply, you see it. Anything with wheels on it has inflation. That doesn't take a genius. And on Professional Lines, I would call out in particular, where D&O is experiencing more inflation and you're seeing it in security class action, in particular merger-related objection, in particular employment practices liability, in particular there is inflation. And you don't just see it in the United States. You see it on other geographies around the world, such as Australia, such as security class action beginning in Europe and the UK. You're seeing more of that. So those are two examples for you. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then just, Phil, on the Ogden charge in the quarter, did that hit both overseas gen and reinsurance? Philip Bancroft : There was about $8 million in reinsurance and the remainder was in COG. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then do you have a share repurchase update as of quarter-to-date? Philip Bancroft : Year-to-date, as of yesterday, was $200 million. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you very much. Philip Bancroft : You are welcome. Operator : We'll go next to Jay Gelb, Barclays. Jay Gelb : Thanks very much. Evan, I had a couple follow-ups with regard to your annual letter. In 2017... Evan G. Greenberg: You read it, did you? Jay Gelb : With great interest. In 2017, I think I believe you said we should expect growth from Chubb in constant dollars, even while taking into account the soft market conditions. I know you touched on in your prepared remarks, but if there's any other insight you could add on that, that would be helpful? Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg: Yes. I said to you that in the last earnings call, I believe that, look, first quarter would look to a degree like fourth quarter, you'd begin to see the amelioration of some of the underwriting actions we took, etcetera. And that minus 1.9% or 2% was less than you saw in prior quarters. Secondly, the normalized for all that, and I hate as if and I hate noise, you want it just as published. And we're getting there. But the underlying of 2% growth is an improvement. And it's pretty broad-based to me. When I look at it by region, I look at the P&C business broken down between its various segments, between its various lines of business. And I see a building momentum in that regard, but offset by what you have to do in underwriting to maintain margins.  I'm not looking for this company to be publishing mid-90s combined ratios. And that means on various portfolios, as pricing or terms reach a point, you have to be disciplined and trade growth for underwriting discipline. I think that we're showing great restraint and great discipline in that regard of underwriting and at the same time, getting more and more after the growth opportunities that you put them all together and that you can produce combined ratios like that and grow on the underlying at 2% or greater. That's a pretty good trick to me. And I expect, as I say, in certain areas where we really see opportunity for that to continue to build momentum. Jay Gelb : That's helpful. The other area of the letter that really caught people's attention was the unfavorable comment on the insurance brokers, can you give us some insight there in terms of what issues you see as most problematic? Evan G. Greenberg: Yes, you made me win -- I won the bet because of your question. I knew, I believed this question was going to come up. Look, I want to put a little context around this, and then I want to just expand on my comments. And this is hardly some cause celeb for me. It was one comment out of a letter that commented on many things in the industry and beyond the industry.  Chubb is an agency and a brokerage company. We are not a direct writer. This is our chosen form of distribution. Now one of the reasons, one of the main reasons I am a firm believer that brokers and agents, intermediaries, provide a necessary role in the selection and market-making function in our business. And if they didn't, then frankly there wouldn't be a -- there wouldn't, long term be a place for them. In a market-based economy, if you don't really have a role that's necessary, you soon disappear. I believe it is a vital role in our business. And agents and brokers are our partners.  In brokerage, it's more ambivalent. It's by the nature of brokerage. They represent a client. In agency, they truly are an extension of us, they represent us, and they are our partners. My comments came about because I've been in this industry for over 40 years. I care about this industry and I care about its long-term health. I was referring in particular to the facilitization of business that I see, predominantly that we see, predominantly but not exclusively in the wholesale markets. And I think some of that behavior has gone beyond what is reasonable. How does it look? The broker, particularly in the wholesale area, will box up, will collect the class of business for efficiency's sake into one portfolio. Business that was placed at one -- as one-off risks, particularly smaller and midsized risks, but not exclusively. It could be just simply a class of business. But they bring it all into one place and so there's a lot of volume. And so in the first instance, it's spoken of as efficiency. But that volume is used to attract underwriters, who no one comes with clean hands, who for the sake of volume will do things to pricing and terms and conditions that aren't that prudent, that aren't sustainable, and that they otherwise wouldn't do when its one-off risk placed.  And then for the sake of efficiency, it is more efficient for the broker to place it this way, more efficient for the underwriter, in some cases, to receive it this way, but not in all cases. Compensation goes up. Price goes down, compensation goes up, what's the logic of that? And frankly, in this world today, a digital world where there is greater efficiency and greater transparency, what industry or business do we know about where prices are going down but intermediary percentage of the dollar of what's being placed goes up. And that's what's occurring in the facilitization of the business. I don't think it's advisable. I don't think it's in the long-term interest or even the medium-term interest of our business, of our industry. I don't think it's sustainable. And I say it because I care about the industry. And I think like every other industry, those who are knowledgeable of markets, who are knowledgeable of how to use technology in markets, they will notice this, and change will come, without a doubt in my mind. Jay Gelb : Thank you for that and if I could just focus on one separate issue, given your position in the industry, given the media speculation on the CEO transition that looks like it's forthcoming at AIG, any perspective you'd like to provide on that? Evan G. Greenberg: No. I wish them well. I'd like to see a healthy AIG. And I can guarantee you Chubb's ability to thrive and to execute our strategy is hardly based around a competitor stumbling or not thriving. And I'd like to see a healthy company. So I wish them well in their selection. Operator : We'll go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Yes, a couple of numbers questions. So I believe you said there was an accounting adjustment on the premiums of $73 million, I guess it was a negative, does that continue going forward or was that a one quarter issue? Philip Bancroft : It looks like it will also recur in the fourth quarter in the neighborhood of $50 million. But then second and third quarters are immaterial impacts. Jay Cohen : Okay. And then beyond this year, there's no impact? Philip Bancroft : No, that's correct. It'll all be over this year. Jay Cohen : That's helpful. And then secondly, on the administrative expenses in both U.S. personal and U.S. commercial, that number dropped quite a bit from where it had been running for the past couple of quarters. And obviously, you're recognizing some synergies, but it was a pretty notable drop off. I understand that there was a pension benefit essentially versus a year ago and I'm wondering if you could break that out, I want to see how much the number came down beyond just the pension change? Philip Bancroft : The expense savings, the incremental expense savings over the first quarter of last year was $124 million. The pension change was not included in that number. That's an additional $28 million that's been allocated to the units. Jay Cohen : And that's mostly in the U.S.? Philip Bancroft : It is mostly in the U.S. but it's spread amongst the units. Actually no, the pension change was all in the U.S., sorry. Jay Cohen : All U.S. okay, that is helpful. Thanks a lot. Operator : And next, Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : Hi, good morning, thanks for the call. We're past the -- you are past the deal with between ACE and Chubb and we have an ongoing soft market. What does that mean from a capital management perspective, would we see continued higher dividends and perhaps more stock repurchases as the benefits of the deal come through? Philip Bancroft : We've said we have an authorization of $1 billion for this year, and we have no plans beyond that. Evan G. Greenberg: No change to our playbook. Paul Newsome : Steady as she goes, okay. Evan G. Greenberg: That is right, there is -- Paul maybe to go a step further. There was no surprise to us in the landscape you just painted. There has hasn't been a change to us. It's a year since the merger, going well. The market is soft, the market was soft, the market is soft. That's exactly within our expectation. And so actually, there is no change in what we see internally and expected of ourselves. And there is no change from what we expected to the external environment. Paul Newsome : That's great. And what about the M&A outlook at this point? Again, through a good chunk of the merger integration, do you think -- should we expect to see you more active in the market? Evan G. Greenberg: No, I'm not comment -- I'm not going there. I'm not commenting on -- we have plenty to do in not only completing integration, but in unlocking the power and potential we see of this organization. And if we never do another deal, the value creation potential we have in our hands is enormous, simply enormous. And from both the product, geographic, customer perspective, God, don't lose sight. This is P&C industry is, what, about $2.5 trillion a year of business. We write about 1.5% of it, almost a rounding of it. And we have, what, something like 10 countries that we do over $400 million a year in, a hardly excessive market penetration. And the opportunities, when you put together the capabilities and knowledge of both organizations is simply stunning. And the only thing that stands in the way is you got to maintain or you got to balance it with underwriting discipline when people are doing dumb stuff. So over any period of time I look at this organization, we're going to win and we're going to outperform. And there are going to be moments in every micro market and in every product area where there's, because the world doesn't move in lockstep, where we're going to be able to just zip ahead. So in that regard, forget about M&A, stay tuned. Paul Newsome : Fantastic, I will stay tuned. Operator : We'll go next to Brian Meredith, UBS. Brian Meredith : Yeah, a couple of quick questions for you. First one, I'm just curious on the homeowner's business, how much of the growth that you're seeing right now is rate versus unit volume growth? Because I know you've been taking potential price increases on the Fireman's Fund business. Evan G. Greenberg: So we told you -- in my commentary, I told you 6.5% growth normalized and that there was three points and two points between rate and trend. So rate and trend was about 5% together, and overall, we're up 6.5%. Brian Meredith : Okay. Just unit growth, great. Evan G. Greenberg: Hold on, Paul Krump is going to expand on that. Paul J. Krump: Yes, hi Brian, it's Paul. Just a couple of thoughts there. Just wanted to note that the first quarter growth was a little bit higher than the previous run rates because there were some timing issues related to the integration and some of the impacts from ending the Fireman's Fund conversion. So, I think that the run rate is really long term I think, right now, we're seeing around 3%, 4%. Brian Meredith : Got you, great. And then, Phil, just quickly back on the administrative expenses, just to follow-up on Jay's question. So the pension's all going through the admin line right now, but still a pretty substantial decline on the year-over-year basis. Was there any shifts with respect to kind of reallocation of kind of expenses this year versus last year versus loss in administrative expenses? Philip Bancroft : It was. There was. There's about $24 million that moved from administrative expenses to ULE of our loss costs. That was just an attempt to make the policies consistent between Chubb Corp. and Legacy ACE. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Ian Gutterman, Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : I guess I was hoping you guys could expand a little bit on the comments on incipient loss cost inflation and just what drivers you're seeing in the environment. And I guess if I throw out a few, maybe to prompt a response, is this the delayed impact of more liberal judges appointed, is it the populism we've seen across the country showing up in the jury box, or is it something more close to home and to the industry meaning to say, terms and conditions have deteriorated and things that wouldn't have prompted a lawsuit, now that plans bar sees a hole they can drive through and takes you to court? Evan G. Greenberg: Yes, I'll come to that. Let me go a step further beyond Professional Lines and commercial auto. We regularly look at portfolios and it happened just last week, a group of us spent many hours doing the deep dive with our casualty folks from around the world, going through all casualty portfolios and giving updates on what we see in pricing and trend. And our updated look at trend right now, it's a -- the casualty-related trend primarily is running around 4%. And so you'll say, well, that's not 5%. And we see the same thing in comp, by the way. And so that's not 0%. And that's my point. While it's still a little tamer than what we had seen historically in the past, you take 4% that goes year-over-year-over-year-over-year and you got prices that are flat or down, well, do the math of what happens to loss ratio and what you do with risk selection, et cetera, and portfolio management or terms to alleviate, that plus expense are your anecdotes. But other than that, it does grind. When it comes to Professional Lines in your question, it is about the external environment and I'll ask maybe John Keogh and John Lupica, who both grew up in the business, to speak, maybe give you a few comments. But I would tell you this. It's not that we're seeing populism. Remember this doesn't happen on a dime or appointments of judges recently. Appointment of judges, that has occurred for the last 8 years. You've stacked a more liberal court, on one hand. But what we're also seeing is a change in the plaintiff bar environment. There are more plaintiff bar law firms, more boutique law firms who are like ambulance chasers and out to make a buck. And it's attacks on society, by the way, it's attacks on corporations and it's a problem where anything that represents any kind of bad news, that is natural exposure to any kind of business, and by the way, this is not restricted to one industry like health care or I read some of that and that's just not right. It's very broad-based. And there's not a merger that goes down where there isn't a lawsuit filed on both sides. You paid too much, you paid too little. And do these get settled? They get settled to reduce its money, but it's still money and it increases the frequency. And then security class actions around absolutely everything. And then employment practices liability, as an example, has found its way into higher-paying jobs, when it seems as part of layoffs today that, okay, another retirement benefit you get or another benefit you get is a payment from an EPS. That's the kind -- that's just what's going on. Now I'll ask my colleagues if they want to answer that. John Keogh : As you see, this is John Keogh. As usual, Evan, I mean, you've kind of covered all. I would, just for color, make the point that when I was deep into the D&O business 15 years ago, there were a handful... Evan G. Greenberg: Did you say 50 years ago? John Keogh : 15, not that bad. Feels like 50 though. 15 years ago, there were a handful of plaintiff firms that drove all the litigation, at least here in North America. Today, when you look at the list of plaintiff firms, and most of them are led by people who worked at those handful of firms who've gone out on their own, there are dozens firms today, all of whom are going to work every day with the ambition to make money and find ways to create new theories of litigation, new theories of liability against corporate America. And I think that is a fundamental change in the business that they we're witnessing in terms of the frequency of claims in the D&O business that is not, in my mind, a temporary change. It's a secular change. This is going to be with us and probably there's a dozen more firms in the next 5 years, that wouldn't surprise me, that are making a living doing this. And then outside the U.S., in Australia and UK, they see what goes on here, the lawyers. They see an opportunity. And the thing I would add that Evan did not mention is litigation funding, right? Whether it's here in the U.S. or in UK or in the Australia. Right, there are funds, right, that are attracting some serious money to fund the litigation in the D&O world, which obviously creates more both frequency and severity in this business than we've seen before. Ian Gutterman : Got it. And if I could sort of tie that in... Evan G. Greenberg: John Lupica says we've wrung it dry. John Lupica : I think you guys got it. Ian Gutterman : Just to tie that in, Evan, with your comments in the press release about the softening market. And when I think about a sort of true soft market bottom, I guess, I think more than just price, I think about terms getting worse and winning business through that. I mean, we've seen, obviously, maybe one example is a program business where a lot of people are starting to get burned and I kind of wonder if that's terms and selection. And the other is reserves, right? And just when I look at reserves, you see across most liability classes and Professional Lines a lot less IBNR than you would have seen three years ago, five years ago. Do you look at those type of signs and say, boy, it's really -- maybe it's not 1999, but it's the seventh inning or the eighth inning and all the same things are repeating and it's more than just price or is it really just we're still in that pricing stage and the rest of it doesn't worry you as much yet? Evan G. Greenberg: Ian, I have been saying for five or six quarters or more now that I've mentioned terms and conditions softening. And I have mentioned the insidious nature of that, because there's a lag before you feel the claim effect from that, that impacts both frequency and severity. We see it beginning to show up in claims around the industry. We see claims that wouldn't have been covered by wordings in the past that all of the sudden become claims now because the wordings have been broadened and we can see that in both short tail physical lines and we see it in various casualty-related classes. I think the impact of that is more in front of us, but the notion, when I say soft market, I am not simply at price, I am right on term and condition. Remember, what we do for our living is manage exposure and that's how we think about it. So wording and coverage, that's part of what drives your view of exposure. Then you're putting pricing against that. Ian Gutterman : Very helpful, thank you, I appreciate it. Operator : We'll go next to Larry Greenberg, Janney. Larry Greenberg : Not much left to cover but I'm curious, Evan, with regard to corporate tax reform. If you could talk just specifically, what impact do you think that might have on the industry and, more specifically, whether or not that could really impact insurance demand? Evan G. Greenberg: Larry, first of all, tell me what tax reform I'm commenting on, because I don't know. So I just say that so that we just keep this in perspective. I cannot... Larry Greenberg : Yes, I would just say lower tax rates. Evan G. Greenberg: I understand the general question. I can't respond with specificity, but I'd say this. We are -- we have needed tax reform for so many years, and American business requires tax reform. And if we do major tax reform, i.e. if we move to a territorial system and we lower the rates, even if we lower the rates to 25%, 20%, it's going to have a major stimulus -- and it's done the right way, it can have a major stimulative impact on our economy, not simply the cash that comes home, but the eagerness to invest. And growth, we insure growth and exposure. The faster the economy grows, the better it is for the insurance business, because exposure grows. Larry Greenberg : Okay, good enough, thank you. Operator : Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. 0Evan, I want to jump off that recent comment. Are you seeing signs yet of more new business in the U.S. from economic growth? Evan G. Greenberg: No, not really. I don't -- I think there was a -- animal spirits were obviously awakened by the policy direction of the new administration. Policy direction that I personally endorse when it comes to deregulation of business, less regulation. God, get government out of our way. When it comes to tax reform, when it comes to infrastructure, it will simply have a multiplier impact on our ability to grow efficiently the productivity in the economy. Those are great things. I think that the reality that is setting in is that stating policy and implementing policy are two different things. And it will take time to implement policy. And at the same time, I personally, and I know many were cautious about the stance we're going to take regarding trade because that can have, depending on the stance we take and the approach we take as a country, that can have a negative impact on economic growth. And I think, right now it is always natural. The moment of euphoria is passing. And I think we're at a moment where there is a sense of realism. So therefore, I am not really seeing a pickup in economic activity that -- a trend change that is impacting our business. Meyer Shields : Okay, thanks. And Phil, quick question, the $73 million accounting adjustment to premiums, did that have any impact on net or operating income in the quarter? Philip Bancroft : Very little. Meyer Shields : Thank you very much. Operator : Ryan Tunis, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Hey thanks. So, I just had a follow-up, I guess, just thinking about expenses. And I guess, thematically, and you can correct me if I'm wrong here, Evan, but is it right to think about the integration process' job is. Year one was about making the cost base more efficient and then years two and three perhaps is investing to position the enterprise for future growth? And then I think... Evan G. Greenberg: No. Ryan Tunis : That's not the right assessment? Okay. So I'd be interested... Evan G. Greenberg: No, absolutely not. The expense efficiencies that we're gaining from integration, synergies and all of that, that -- we told you how that plays out between -- we gave you a schedule and showed you how that plays out between 2016, 2017 and 2018. And that is on track or ahead of schedule. What I said to you was, on this call is, that may get -- that we're looking at that right now. We could very well upsize that and we'll talk to you about it in the second quarter.  So no, it's not like you put it in these neat packets. The investments we're making, we began making them -- ACE was making investments all along and Chubb, in some ways, was starved for investments. And we're making in -- we began and I was very clear about it. And I was clear about it to you on calls, and I was clear about it in the shareholder letter. And that is that we have been making investments and continue to make investments in expanding product, in digitizing the company and in putting in place foundational technologies that will give us greater flexibility to move in many directions, including lower cost. So no, it all goes on at once. That's more how a corporation works. Ryan Tunis : Okay, understood. So in the letter, the comments about the investments and digitalization was not really referencing an acceleration of investment, just an ongoing part of an investment cycle. Evan G. Greenberg: Yes, except that, God, a much bigger company now with more opportunities to invest in and, as I said, some who were starved for investment. So we are upsizing investment, but at the same time, given all the efficiencies we gain, we have tremendous flexibility to ameliorate margin pressure, and at the same time, invest for our competitive profile and grow this company in a competitive, sustainable way for the future, which that is our job for shareholders. Ryan Tunis : Okay, understood. And then just a quick follow-up for Phil. Could you give us an update on the revenue synergies produced as of the end of the quarter? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg: The revenue synergies, Phil. Is that 111 million? Philip Bancroft : Globally. Evan G. Greenberg: 111 million globally in the quarter. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Helen Wilson : Thank you. We have time for one more person to ask question. That comes from Sarah DeWitt, JPMorgan. Sarah DeWitt : Great, thank you. Most of my questions have been answered, but just one follow-up on your comments on Professional Lines inflation. To what extent are you concerned about the potential for inflation with no pricing power? Or do you think the industry could get pricing power if higher inflation emerged? Evan G. Greenberg: I don't really understand that question, with all due respect. The industry, it's -- we have free will. Lincoln freed us all. And so we have free will and we can react to exposure changes as we see it. Sarah DeWitt : Okay. So you don't see excess capacity and competitive pressures as preventing pricing power to offset that inflation? Evan G. Greenberg: Well, those are all factors that -- it's a marketplace. Each will determine for themselves. Ultimately, we all exist in the same world. We're all going to ultimately have the same experience. And some will play it in an intelligent way like a marketplace and some will be a little less intelligent. And I will say, what I am confident about is we have the capacity, we got the paper, we have the balance sheet, we have the data, we have the knowledge, we have the global reach, we have the claims capability and the insight in this business that is unrivaled. And so our ability to manage this business and to be attractive to customers that want Chubb. Well, that's an asset and we'll taken advantage and protect our asset. Sarah DeWitt : Okay, great. Thank you. Helen Wilson : Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : That concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Chubb had a very good quarter, we produced strong earnings that were driven by world-class underwriting and record investment income. After tax operating income for the quarter was $1.2 billion or $2.50 per share compared to two and a quarter per share prior year up 11%. For the six months of this year operating income was up 13% from 2016. Our combined ratio for the quarter was simply excellent, 88% compared to 90.2% last year. And it benefited from a substantial improvement in the expense ratio of about 1.5 point as well as lower catastrophe losses. Total P&C underwriting income of $808 million was up 20%. The current accident year combined ratio excluding catastrophe losses for the quarter was outstanding at 87.5%, again almost 1.5 points better than the last year, driven by integration of related expense savings that benefited both the expense ratio and the loss ratio. Those savings plus a loss adjustment expense reserve release mitigated a rise in the underlying current accident year loss ratio of 1.2 points. Given the market conditions and the fact that we are in a multi-year soft insurance market, these results are truly distinguishing and clearly demonstrate the benefits of our global capabilities. Our portfolio construction and underwriting management, hallmarks of our Company, they also speak to the quality and talent of my outstanding colleagues around the world, our culture of excellence and craftsmanship at all levels of the organization. Net investment income for the quarter was a record $855 million, above the guidance we gave you last quarter and up about 5% over prior year. Philip will explain why we exceeded recent guidance. Chubb\u2019s strong earnings produced a good operating ROE of about 10% for the quarter while for the six months period per share book and tangible book value have grown 4.4% and 7.6% respectively and they have increased about 12.5% and 20% since the merger closing in January of last. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period reserve development. The commercial P&C market is with a few exceptions soft globally, though conditions vary depending on territory, line of business and size of risk. Most areas of the commercial P&C market are soft and highly competitive as many companies reach for growth. As noted in the prior quarters, large account business particularly shared and layered remains very competitive, though pricing maybe beginning to bottom. On the other hand, middle market business with the exception of commercial auto continues to grow more competitive by the quarter. Wholesale remains more competitive than retail, particularly in short tail lines. In wholesale certain stressed casualty classes are beginning to get rate, not enough to produce adequate returns, but nonetheless improving. Globally new business has been hard to come-by and what simply can be described as a hungry market. Competitive new business conditions are ameliorated for us to some degree when it\u2019s about more than rate and we bring the power of the organization to bear for a client or producer. In the quarter 11% of North America retail commercials, P&Cs new business and 6% of our international new business came from cross-selling and the power of the organization. Also our total capabilities in terms of product, service reputation, ability to serve many different types of insurance customers, our deep distribution capability and extensive geography reach means our optionality or ability to capitalize on opportunity is exceptional, it will only improve with time. I will point to a few examples later. With that as backdrop, the good news is for the business we wrote the trend for pricing improved, rates were essentially flat or the rate of declines slowed in comparison to recent quarters. And in some stress classes we were able to achieve rate, such as U.S. commercial auto, Australian property and [D&O] (Ph), Mexican auto where we are large players and U.S. ENS casualty. In U.S. D&O class that needs rates as we noted on our last call, pricing for the business we wrote went flat. As we projected revenue growth for the quarter continue to trend better on both the publish basis and when adjusted for merger noise. In fact this was our best quarter since the merger in terms of growth. However, with the exception of our risk management business which had nice growth and continue to benefit from a flight to quality and capability, we wrote less new business trading new business growth for better terms and we lost business for price we weren\u2019t loosing by a few points. Our overall renewal retention in the quarter was steady and that was true among the various lines of business with the exception of one that we have discussed before, which is North America property and casualty coverage for real estate related risks. The tough class where Chubb has been leader. In the quarter, P&C net premiums written globally were flat in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had about a 0.5 percentage point impact, adjusted for merger related underwriting actions in reinsurance P&C net premiums were up over 2.5%. As a reminder the impact from these merger related items has and will continue to ameliorate as we move through the year. Rate movement for the business we wrote in the quarter varied by territory and market segments. Renewal rates were down about a 0.5% in our U.S. middle market business, with exposure change a positive 1%. In our U.S. major accounts business, renewals pricing was down about a 0.5% and exposure change with an additional negative 0.5%. In our international retail commercial P&C business pricing was down one, again overall these were the best rate results we have seen in quite a few quarters for the business we wrote. By major class of business beginning with North America, retail general and specialty casualty related pricing was down about a 0.5%. Financial lines pricing was down about a 0.5% with D&O flat and property related pricing was down one. Internationally, general and specialty casualty related pricing was down 2%. Financial lines pricing was flat and property related pricing was down 3%. The UK commercial P&C market remains highly competitive, but overall we achieved better pricing with rates mostly flat. The continent of Europe on the other hand became marginally more competitive. In Australia we achieved meaningful rate in property and DNO a rationale sign for what is a very competitive market. The balance of Asia and most of Latin America largely remain status quo in terms of pricing trend. Now with that as context, let me give you some more detail on revenue results for the quarter. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums were down 1.3%. Normalizing for merger related underwriting, net premiums were up about 1.5% and the renewal retention ratio for retail was at 88%. Overall new business writings for North America commercial lines were up about 3.5% over second quarter 2016. Again with the exception of risk management, we wrote less new business than prior year. The trade we are not happy to make, but we will take all day long to secure adequate underwriting terms. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up 2%. Excluding the six point impact of additional reinsurance growth was 8%. Rates were up 2% and exposure change added 3%. Retention remains very strong at about 95%. Turning to our overseas, general insurance operations, net premiums written for international retail P&C business were up about one and a quarter in the quarter in constant dollars and over 3% excluding underwriting action. As a few highlights, Asia-Pac, Asia-Pacific commercial P&C business was up 9% on the back of Australia and New Zealand. Japan P&C was up 12%, Latin America [A&E] (Ph) was up 11.5% and international personal lines were up over 9%. Mexico continues to be a bright spot for us, up strong double-digits overall for the quarter. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. We are in good shape with the remainder of our integration activity, operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on-track or ahead of schedule. As you saw in the press release, we have now increased the total annualized run rate savings we will achieve by the end of 2018 to $875 million, up from $800 million, which is up from the original $650 million when we announce the merger. These savings are directly contributing to our margins in the phase of declining rates and continuing loss cost trends while giving us room to invest in our competitive profile, including our technology, our talent, new lines of business and future operating efficiency. We are investing substantial sums, talent and time in positioning this Company to be a leader in a digital age, because the economy globally is digitizing. This includes our organization structure, cycle times of change, expertise and skill sets of our people, data and analytics, robotics, the front-end customer experience to the customer back-end claims experience and the very definition of the products we sell. This is not just strategy, we are quietly executing. In closing, we are operating in a highly competitive P&C market and navigating it well. There is no other Company better diversified and positioned with the breadth of capabilities, culture, talent, broad distribution and presence around the world that we have today at Chubb. We have built and are building a revenue machine. Governed however by our underwriting discipline and it gives us great confidence and optionality in uncertain times and makes us more relevant to our customers and business partners. The entire organization is intently focused on execution, we are optimistic about our ability to continue to outperform. With that, I will turn the call over to Phil and then we will back to take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thank you Evan. Chubb\u2019s overall financial position grew stronger in the quarter as we continue to generate substantial capital and positive cash flow. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business around the globe with total capital exceeding $63 billion. We grew our tangible book value per share by 4.3% in the quarter. Concerning tangible book value per share growth, you will remember that at the close of our merger the initial dilution to our tangible book value per share was 29%, since then we have reduced that dilution to about 10%. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $667 million to shareholders including $332 million in dividends and $335 million in shares repurchased. Year-to-date though June 30, our share repurchases have totaled 475 million. Investment income of $855 million was a record and was $20 million higher than our expectations. Half of that increase was due to higher than estimated private equity distributions and the other half from increased call activity in our corporate bond portfolio. Net realized and unrealized gain for the quarter was $747 million pre-tax and include a $588 million gain from the investment portfolio primarily from decreases in interest rates and gains from our private equity portfolio. We have also had $116 million gain from FX and an $80 million gain in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. Net loss reserves increased $226 million for the quarter. The pace of incurred ratio in the quarter was 99%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 95%. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $170 million pre-tax, about a $144 million after-tax. This include a $43 million pre-tax of adverse development related to our run-off non-A&E casualty exposures, which is included in corporate, and $57 million pre-tax favorable development relating to our industrial accident workers\u2019 compensation coverage from the 2016 accident year. The remaining favorable development was split 40% long tail lines principally for the 2012 and prior accident years and 60% short tail lines. Our catastrophe losses in the quarter were 200 million or a $152 million after-tax compared to $390 million or $311 million after-tax in the prior year. Catastrophe losses this quarter were primarily from U.S. weather related events. Integration realized and annualized run rate savings are ahead of expectation. Total incremental integration related savings realized in the quarter were a $105 million leading to total inception to-date realized savings of $554 million. On an annualized run rate basis, savings through June are $775 million. As Evan noted, we now expect to achieve annualized run rate savings of $875 million by the end of 2018 up from our prior estimate of $800 million. We are also expecting integration and merger related expenses to be $903 million up from our prior estimate of $809 million. As we disclosed in our press release the benefit of these integration related savings is reflected in our combined ratio. Our combined ratio in the quarter reflected the incremental impact of integration related savings of $104 million, a $45 million benefit related to the harmonization of the Company\u2019s pension and retiree healthcare plans and the release of loss adjustment expense reserves of $30 million. These favorable items was partially offset by increased spending to support growth and the impact of salary increases and inflation. We noted in the fourth quarter of 2016 that we expect the incremental annualized impact of our U.S. retirement plan harmonization to be approximately $100 million pre-tax. Through six months we have realized $80 million, the remaining $20 million is expected to be recognized in the second half of 2017. The operating income tax rate for the quarter is 16%, which is at the low end of our expected range, principally due to a higher level of catastrophe losses occurring in the U.S. we expect our annual effective tax rate to remain within 16% to 18% range for the remainder of the year. I will turn the call back over to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will go first question to Ryan Tunis, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Ryan Tunis : Hey thanks. I guess my first question was just thinking about these merger related underwriting actions in reinsurance. I guess at this point, it\u2019s a pretty substantial number and I guess the way we see it, so far it feels like it\u2019s only shown up in the form of lower net written premium, I\u2019m wondering if that\u2019s the right interpretation or there is other price if that we are seeing it, whether it\u2019s like the was the cat load lower this quarter than it would have been as you not done that. Is there a meaningful free up in capital or is it actually serving as a pretty major tailwind on like the expense ratio and a loss ratio just any help on that would be useful? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Well first of all you wouldn\u2019t be able to see it in the cat load, because we don\u2019t give guidance. So you don\u2019t actually know what our cat load is, but as an example we have told you this before, first of all you get the annualized impact of reinsurance it has to run its course. So we bought a quota share treaty last year, Northeast quota share it\u2019s also in our Qs and Ks. And we bought that and we were very clear - I\u2019m giving you one example, in third quarter last year that the trade-off of premium versus buying straight cat access on a risk reward basis made much more sense to us and that did lower our cat profile as one example. Secondly, merger related underwriting actions both for concentration exposure on a per risk or a cat basis as well as portfolio that haven\u2019t met our underwriting standards of making a reasonable underwriting return. When you look at the accident year loss ratio it is benefiting and that it is in fact flat year-on-year. That\u2019s illogical when you think about rate and trend. Mathematically, it\u2019s not possible, if you are mathematically on us. However, what ameliorates that what ameliorates it is expense savings and also underwriting actions that we have taken merger related that help to ameliorates that. I hope that answers your question. Ryan Tunis : That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess my follow-up is just on some of your commentary about the competitive environment. I think you said shared and layered remains competitive though pricing is beginning to bottom. On the other hand middle market is becoming more competitive. I guess at this point in the cycle, what do you think is driving that the economy and what do you think it\u2019s going to take for the middle market in particular I guess to reach the bottom and the new business to become more attractive? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Well, large account and shared and layered has been competitive for longer. I mean, they have been both rate and trends that\u2019s be gridding on for a few years between the wholesale market feeding it and the direct retail market and reinsurers. All participants have been involved in the competitive environment there and it has been going on. At some point, what happens? Losses start coming in, broader terms and conditions, they start catching up to pricing and combined ratios rise, you see it. It\u2019s not hiding itself. And that eventually causes rates to begin to flatten out. Not necessarily in a place to that [equip] (Ph), but the first thing I have to do start flattening out. So market wares itself out at some point. In the middle market, the middle market is always more orderly than the large account particularly shared and layered. And that began late, that has just only began in the last number of quarters to become more competitive where companies are trying to reach for growth. Economic growth is reasonably slow and companies are reaching for more growth, because they don\u2019t have another way to go and as you are seeing EPS and that will go for a little while. It is my sense. I don\u2019t see a catalyst excepted really combined ratios underwriting cash flow. So Ryan, I can\u2019t forecast the future, I sit with a crystal ball, but my sense is, it\u2019s more competitive and it will remain that way for a little while. Ryan Tunis : Okay. Fair enough. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Our next question comes from Elyse Greenspan, Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Good morning. My first question is on the premium growth. I appreciate all the color in terms of merger and the reinsurance. Evan you mentioned obviously the increase reinsurance to place last year starting in the third quarter. So when we kind of tie together your commentary about the market and how you see the business. Are we reaching the point when the third quarter of this year on an ex-currency basis, we should start to see your growth in that premium written? Evan Greenberg : You know we don\u2019t give forward guidance, but I don\u2019t see a reason why the trend that we are seeing in our underlying growth doesn\u2019t continue and merger-related underwriting actions will continue to ameliorate as the year goes along. And you are correct there was a large - last year not only did we buy it, we also did an [un-urged] (Ph) premium transfer that also impacted net written premium at that time. So you are correct it was more penalty last year. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then in terms of revenue synergies, first off if you could just get a number for the quarter? And then second, Evan I know in the past you had kind of tied your long-term view just to kind of give a ballpark figure to at least being equal to level of expenses for the deal in terms of revenue synergies. The expense saves has been increased, does your view on revenue synergies also increased, and if you can just talk high level about the revenue synergies that have come about to-date compared to your expectations? Evan Greenberg : Yes, and remember what I spoke to was a - I don\u2019t have my exact words in front of me, but that we have revenue, we would have expense saves that translated to operating income and that we would have income from additional revenue opportunities that would approach some proportional either equal or within a range. I haven\u2019t changed my view on the revenue side, we haven\u2019t really top stated that frankly to look forward in the next two or three years about that. All things being equal, the revenue synergies that we have projected remain on-track. We are growing the small commercial business, we said that would take years to occur. That is happening. We said that we would gain in middle market around the globe and small commercial around the globe. That is on-track. We have been planting the seeds for that and placing and building operations in targeted markets around the world that will feed that growth. We said cross-selling and that by really important cross-selling the strength in the organization, bringing more products to the distribution in North Americas fast middle market capabilities that we haven\u2019t shut and that is happening. We are driving that and we can measure that, whether it is cyber insurance, environment liabilities, specialty casualty, international coverages for middle market companies, we are seeing that. We can measure that. And on the other side of coin, the governor in a little it for us is underwriting, because it\u2019s a soft market with a lot of headwind and that\u2019s what governs it the other way. Sometimes you get more joy through the effort, sometimes you get less, we stay steady. Elyse Greenspan : And the number of\u2026 Evan Greenberg : And we told you that 11% to the new business and 6% of new business and I think Phil. Philip Bancroft : We have for the quarter a 110 million of gross written premiums that relates to that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, perfect. And one last question. Can just give a little bit of color on what will be adverse development within your North America personal line segment in the quarter? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I\u2019m going to give that to Paul Krump, who was waiting for you to ask that question. Paul Krump : Good morning Elyse thank you Evan. Let me unpack this a little bit for you Elyse. The second quarter PPD amounts reflects unfavorable vast development from a combination of prior period tax, wreck marine and auto liability. Let me just dispose the wreck margin quickly, because that was one single claim. When you think about of cats, that was about a third of the amount and the third was coming from auto liability. Recall Elyse that we brought together legacy ace, firemen\u2019s fund in Chubb and in doing so we have integrated the reserving processes for all three companies and we have also then brought together a far more credible data than we previously had available for automobile. And that data has caused us to increase our expectations slightly on some portions of the book. Now recall, though that this is over several actions years and just that about a third of the amount of PPD is the raise in the auto. So it\u2019s very much a de-minimums amount and I think it\u2019s important to note that that data pegs our thinking about pricing and our underwriting moving forward. Operator : We will go next to Kai Pan, Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. First question on the cost savings target and where is the - Phil can you could talk more about where the $75 million additional cost savings come from and how much you plan to reinvestment in that business, how much do you think can flow through that bottom line? Philip Bancroft : Yes well, you are already seeing it flow through the bottom line substantially and we are investing in the business as I gave you on the commentary. Where it comes from is spread broadly across the organization, its fundamentally not in the underwriting units or in sales and marketing, its more in support operations and it is personal cost related, it is outside services related, it is IT related and it\u2019s to some degree real estate related. Kai Pan : Okay. Then my second question and follow-up on the reserve side. I also had a personal eye in the North American commercial business also see a year-over-year slowing down in terms of reserve releases. Just wondering if you can provide additional sort of color on that? Evan Greenberg : Yes, it was a positive reserve release, which speaks to strength of our reserves. Our prior period reserve development has variability, it varies by quarter. It depends on the reserve studies that we do in the quarter and which we do, we study all major lines through the year and quarter-to-quarter though this variability depends on what you did study. Again our reserves are strong, the first quarter I will remind you was essentially flat with prior year, I think it was down $10 million or $15 million bucks. I can\u2019t predict the future, I don\u2019t know future trends, frequency and severity versus the inputs we use to create our reserves in any given line of business. But again, what I\u2019m very comfortable with this, our reserves are quite strong. Kai Pan : Thank you for that. And if I may just one, quick one. You see unfavorable releasing unallocated claims, handling expense contribute to the loss ratio improvements the one point. Is that one-off? Evan Greenberg : Well, it can be. Yes, we studied it every year and/or more than once a year, we look at what we put away for future claim development. And so like any other reserve, we study that and this quarter, the actual projected and what we have seen as trend versus what we are holding reserve, resulted in the release. I can tell you, last year when we did second quarter review, we also had a reserve release then on unallocated loss adjustments expense. But I can\u2019t predict the future of that, it\u2019s not like well, it\u2019s just as, you are going to harvest a reserve release in UA area, you don\u2019t know that, you can\u2019t project it. Kai Pan : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jay Gelb, Barclays. Jay Gelb : Good morning. I was hoping, you could comment on the recent favorable trends that\u2019s been identified in the slowdown, in the number of law suits being filed in state courts and whether that would have a positive trend on Chubb\u2019s loss cost inflation? Evan Greenberg : We have seen the same thing that is slowed, we read the same headlines you read and we see that out there. We haven\u2019t noticed it, particularly in our casualty loss costs development. Though, I can say that in general casualty in particular reserve releases have come from trends lower than we projected, so that is a fact. On the other hand, when you look at litigation related to directors and officers, there is no improvement in that area, and in fact frequency and severity have worsened. The article that you read refer to general litigation of nuisance suits and others in that where Americans would freely reach for a legal remedy to any misfortune that came to them, that there is a decline in that. That you don\u2019t see in directors and officers. Jay Gelb : I appreciate that. And then more broadly given all the back and forth we are seeing from the administration, on various topics. I thought, you could help us out by updating us on your views around tax and trade? Evan Greenberg : You want to get me in trouble. Don\u2019t you? My views remain as they were. For our country and for our economy to reach its full potential which it is not right now. We need tax reform, we need infrastructure, the state of infrastructure in our country is shameful, and is a competitive disadvantage and we are somehow lackadaisical about that. I can tell you, I travel around the world, you go to China, you go to other countries that are growing near economies and will grow their economies more rapidly than us, their infrastructure is far superior and that is a tax on us. Regulation, deregulating is so important. An awful lot of this requires legislation and we need an administration that is focused, that is working with Congress and we need a Congress that comes together to address these issues of our country. There is just no doubt about it. When it comes to trade, I stand firm, our country has benefited substantially, in particular NAFTA and it is a competitive advantage to our country. And that agreement is up for negotiations right now to modernize it. And I\u2019m hopeful and I believe there are so many in the administration who understand it that it is important for us to modernize it and to recognize the benefit to our citizens that all three countries gain parties to NAFTA from NAFTA. It makes a competitive North America in a global marketplace. Jay Gelb : Thanks very much. Operator : We will next to Sarah DeWitt, JP Morgan. Sarah DeWitt : Hi, good morning. I wanted to ask a question on the agriculture business. How you are looking in that business, it seems like through conditions are worsening. So any color you could give on what is going on there would be helpful? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m going to turn it over to solve it to farmer John Lupica. John Lupica : Yes thanks. Evan Greenberg : But you are obsessing in that about the western part of the Corn Belt and not the eastern part. John Lupica : Yes, Sarah thanks. It\u2019s John. So yes our early focus this year was on winter wheat and the growing conditions for the spring crop that you mentioned. Right now the winter wheat appears to be in line with our expectation, which is good news. And then the planting acreage may have dropped a little bit, but we expect that to show itself when we see the final revenue come out from the spring crops. And as for the spring crops, as you know we are in the midst of the growing season now. So we don\u2019t have final, final look at it. The weather was a bit wet early in the season, but late in the summer we have seen the Western Corn Belt get hot and dry. So we are watching that. We can certainly use some rain outlast. The Eastern Corn Belt is doing terrific, and that looks to be in better shape. So right now we are watching the pattern. There is nothing out there that leads us to believe that we wouldn\u2019t have anything about an average year. And I will just remind you, last year was just one of the best we had ever seen in this business. Sarah DeWitt : Great, thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Operator : We will go next to Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : Great, thanks. If I could start Phil with just a follow-up on [indiscernible], first that 30 million shot in PPD or is it just from the regular loss ratio and then secondly was it concentrated in any one line which is spread across all the different segments. Philip Bancroft : First of all we consider that current accident years, not in PPD. Paul would you say there was any concentration? Paul Krump : That segment North American commercial. Philip Bancroft : Yes North America commercial, but [indiscernible]. Ian Gutterman : Okay make sense. I guess as on personal lines growth the 8% sort of adjusted is a pretty strong results, obviously it sounds like a decent part of that is rate and exposure, but it seems like there are some maybe accelerating unit growth as well. Can you just talk about what is driving that, its obliviously a tough time at least on the auto side. I know it\u2019s a smaller part of the book, but for peers are you finding opportunities to take business from people or is it mostly the home driving I was just curious? Philip Bancroft : First , I would say this to you. our auto book is not a huge book, we are not a general auto market rider and we are earning in underwriting profit in automobile. We had unit growth in the quarter, we wrote double-digit number of new policies. Some of that is multiple policies on a customer and so we would say high-single thousands or mid-single thousands of new policy count. We are trying to get a handle better data on buying policies backed in customers in aggregate and making sure we have that exactly right, so I don\u2019t wanted to misspeak about that. But we are gaining grip and our growth is coming in all three areas, we are getting it from the mass affluent, we are getting it from the higher segments of high net worth, all the way up to very high net worth both number of customers, but as well their own exposures grow as they acquire more assets, homes, et cetera and we are up selling there. I\u2019m pleased with the progress we are making in personal lines, I can tell you as you get it, it\u2019s like talking about small commercial, it comes in small bites, it take a long time to effect change that really shows in numbers in a significant way, but I like the way our marketing in sales is organized in our field operations, I like how we are being able to now begin to target county-by-county of the United States, where our target market is and beginning to put in place the capabilities in the sales and agent process to be able to target those customers to go after. That\u2019s not a six months project, that\u2019s multi-year project to really shows itself, but we are doing that. I like what is going on in our branding, I like what is going on in our new product capabilities as we rollout coverages and farm and ranch and cyber and directors and officers liability, not for profit in a better way. I like what we were doing in our service in underwriting, to the very high net worth and being able to underwrite them between admitted in E&S and global in a better way and we can do even better. The game plan we have put in place, if anything we are just crystallizing or focus on it, we are operationalizing better, we have more talent that we brought into high net worth from both inside and outside the organization. We have restructured, so that we can get a better focus on individual markets and as well speed of how we may change, but at the same time, this is a filed product state-by-state, rating product changes and system changes take time. I love the future ahead of us in that line of business. Ian Gutterman : Got it, thanks. If I can ask a quick one on commercial, just you sounded a little bit, I don\u2019t know if optimism is the right word, but certainly less pessimistic on where rates are. Is it fair to say though that even if this is a sign of a bottom, we are still trailing loss trend. I\u2019m not trying to ask you for guidance. As I\u2019m looking ahead beyond this year, there is still probably pressure on margins before any improvements that you make from mix or other changes? Evan Greenberg : Absolutely Ian. Look, I would say this. What we saw in pricing? I don\u2019t if one robin and makes a spring. So I can\u2019t tell, number one. Number two, but look, I recognize it for what it is and its better than we have seen on our book in a number of quarters, number one. Number two, it was on our book of business. And the business were not writing new or that we are losing. I said it in the commentary, I\u2019m going to underline, we are not losing for a couple of points. So it is a hungry market out there. When we look at terms and conditions, we lose for terms and conditions that we find, it will go across the board that make us shake our heads that are just final irresponsible or dumb. And so we see the market continuing. On the other hand, we do even see in the market generally pricing in a number of classes bottoming. But it\u2019s at a level that absolutely will not earn and underwriting profit. Ian Gutterman : Completely understood. Thank you for the comments. Operator : We will go next to Paul Newsome, Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : Good morning. With exposure assuming to be improving broadly. How do you think we should think about the portion of exposure increases in your book of business that acts like rates versus that which is actual exposure or increases? I\u2019m just trying to think about the impact\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I know what you think. But Paul, I\u2019m curious, where do you see exposure improving? Paul Newsome : Well, maybe it\u2019s my hope that the economy improve in the U.S. Evan Greenberg : Okay. but be careful, don\u2019t witch cast here, because I\u2019m not sure you are seeing it. I don\u2019t see exposure growth improving. I see it flat and in some cases down actually than what we saw say a year ago. I think the economy is solid, but I don\u2019t think it\u2019s exciting, just kind of taking a long. The way to think about that is, there is an element and it varies by line of business. Exposure growth for instance in personal lines, a portion of the exposure growth just subsidize rate and a portion of the exposure growth is truly just a one-for-one trade-off. In commercial lines, it\u2019s a mix also. To be able to tease that out to you and give you a rule of thumb or point estimate, I can\u2019t do it, but you are correct about the elements. Paul Newsome : Fair enough. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : I realize it\u2019s not a satisfactory mathematical answer to you, but you are not on to the wrong. Paul Newsome : I can only ask. Evan Greenberg : Of course you can. And I can only try to answer. Paul Newsome : Thanks. That was it. Operator : We will go next to Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Hey, thanks. Two quick questions here. First one, I\u2019m just curious, was there any favorable or unfavorable impact from currency on operating earnings this quarter? And what do you think it\u2019s going to look like here going forward given some of the weakness of the dollar? Philip Bancroft : It was minimal, it was about $4 million on operating earnings. Brian Meredith : Okay. And if we look at where we are today, is it benefit? Philip Bancroft : I don\u2019t think there could be any substantial benefit. Let\u2019s see what happens. Evan Greenberg : You know it depends, tell us the currency, give us the basket and we will have a better idea, but it\u2019s bouncing around. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then second question, I\u2019m just curious we are hearing more and more talk about distribution changes going on in the U.S. around the small commercial side and people planning for it. When you look at the small commercial business and your entry into it, are you planning on or your thoughts on direct distribution capability? Evan Greenberg : Change is coming. I listen to a lot of loud talk these days, that I tried to say in my commentary, we are doing an awful lot, but we are going about it quite right. I think this helps better speak than a lot loud chatter. And I do think some of the talk is ahead of the reality at the moment. But with that said, change is coming. And we are not alone as in terms of carriers improving their capabilities, because of what technology brings that will lead that change. It\u2019s around data, it\u2019s around straight through process, it\u2019s around data that improves the customer experience, while at the same time improving your ability to select risk and to do it quickly i.e. in seconds and to be able to then straight through process business. It\u2019s claims on the other end, almost certain co-boarded claims that can be settled the same way. These capabilities will improve the intermediary ability to sell and service the business at a lower cost, to take that cost out it will speed the process. But at the same time those same capabilities will be delivered through new clients at the intermediary, dot-com type intermediaries, where potential customers are buying other services and products and its natural that it at that time they consider insurance, you are licensing your business your small business, you are setting up the accounting and financing of your small business. It\u2019s a time that you will consider insurance as an example, there will be many like that. You taking out a loan for your business and technology enables those other forms of distribution. The customer will buy it from a desktop, the customer will buy it from a mobile device, they will buy it any time anywhere and they will service it anytime anywhere. This is not futuristic in the sense of measuring it in years from now. It\u2019s on our door step, this is the next two years or shorter, it will be iterative, it will only get better and better and better. There won\u2019t be one winner, there will be a number of them. Brian Meredith : Okay, so you see aggregate is continuing to kind of gain share here at least have success in the U.S. Evan Greenberg : Define aggregator to me. Brian Meredith : I mean something like a continuous dot-com in the UK and the personal line side perhaps something here in the U.S. just seems like it hasn\u2019t really caught traction here in the U.S. Evan Greenberg : Well you know maybe I can see single source distribution with other financial services, I can see those who offer multiple choice, for those who simply want to shop insurance. I\u2019m agnostic, I don\u2019t see any one of them as winners, I see multiple winners, because I don\u2019t think there is one kind of consumer out there, one kind of buying behavior out there and I think there are going to be other compelling options who are you to use in terms of buying that you haven\u2019t had as a choice now to-date. That\u2019s what I say. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Operator : We will go next to Jay Cohen, Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Thank you. I just want to get an update on the life insurance business, it looks like both the earnings contribution and revenue growth is slowing there, and I\u2019m wondering if you could talk about what is happening? Philip Bancroft : Yes, the VA business are run-off, variable annuity business. We told you earlier I think it was in the fourth quarter that we adjusted our models and took our earnings and as a result put up our reserve that took down our earnings year-on-year. So quarter-on-quarter was around about $15 million to $16 million a quarter just coming off because of that change, right. And then our international life business is actually growing. You know Jay what I would do is if you look at Page 18 of this supplement, you will see that while the GAAP premium is down 3% , 3.5% the overall production in the quarter is up 8% if you include deposits and it\u2019s up 14% over the six months. So we are starting to see strong growth in the production for the overall international life book. Evan Greenberg : We would look at production more than GAAP premium. Jay Cohen : Got it. Helpful. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : This is a kind of FAS product that\u2019s being sold. Operator : Our last question comes from Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks very much for squeezing me in. Evan, can you compare the list of business within reinsurance now to two or three years ago. Is that changing? Evan Greenberg : Say that again Meyer. Meyer Shields : I\u2019m wondering whether, obviously the premium volumes in global reinsurance are coming down. So it\u2019s the mix opposite? Evan Greenberg : Well. I\u2019m just trying to add it up before I give you a complete answer, because everything has been coming down. Casualty is down, risk property is down, cat has been down. The mix is probably pretty steady, maybe it\u2019s biases a little more towards the risk lines than the cat lines. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then finally, can you just get a quick explanation of what will be adverse development in the corporate segment? Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s the run-off business, the Brandywine run-off business is in the corporate segment. Philip Bancroft : Right. So it was the business that was put into Brandywine in about 1995, there is a number of casualty lines where we had development. Evan Greenberg : We don\u2019t have a run-off division, that we sort of put things we don\u2019t like. This is the Brandywine run-off. And also Chubb had as well run-off A&E. And we study the loan, what we call LTE other than, it\u2019s other than asbestoses environmental which are third and fourth quarter. This is the other lines that would be like sexual molestation, et cetera, and it\u2019s a run-off of that and that\u2019s where charge was taken. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thanks very much. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Helen Wilson : All right. Thank you everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking you to you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day.",

Today's call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Wilson : Thank you, and welcome to our September 30, 2017, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, economic and market conditions and integration of our Chubb Corporation acquisition and potential synergies and expense savings. These are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. See our most recent SEC filings and earnings press release and financial supplements, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement, at investors.chubb.com. In particular, references to 2016 underwriting results will be on an as-if basis, which includes the Chubb Corporation's results for fiscal 2016 and excludes the impact of purchase accounting adjustments relating to the merger. Now I'd like to today's our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. It was a difficult quarter for the insurance industry and Chubb, a quarter dominated by catastrophe losses. But frankly, it's a part of the business we're in. The headlines were obviously the series of large natural cats, specifically Harvey, Irma and Maria, as well as the Mexican earthquakes while no one has certainty at the moment, the third quarter events will likely cost industry in the range of $80 billion to $100 billion-plus anyway.  For Chubb, our after tax net cat losses estimated $1.5 billion cost us about 1 quarter of earnings or about 3.5% of our September 30 tangible capital. In the aggregate, this was within our risk tolerance, and the amount of loss we would expect from these types of events. We view the loss for these events as between a 1 in 5 and 1 in 10-year industry and Chubb event on a worldwide aggregate basis. This gives you sense of how we think about risks, including basis risks in the models and significant amount of non-modeled loss that is included primarily from Harvey and likely, Maria and Irma. By the way, '17 is on track to join '05 and '11 as the third $100 billion-plus year for insured cat losses in the last 12. The events of the third quarter for Chubb were first and foremost about service and responding to our customers in their time of need. Let's remember, that's what insurance is all about, and that's why we exist. Our claims organization is large, experienced and so capable, and with a mindset to serve. They've performed admirably and at times, heroically, often sacrificing their own personal well-being in the impacted areas of Texas, Florida, Puerto Rico and Mexico to come to the aid of our customers and distribution partners and solo employees. In a spate of about 6 weeks, they responded to nearly 17,000 claims in 5 different major events. Service levels remained consistently high with over 95% of the 52,000 customer calls in North America answered in less than 5 seconds, and by a human being from our company, not a machine or third-party. As of today, over 90% of Harvey and Irma claims have been physically inspected. I should add, our loss prevention and claims organization continue to perform at the highest levels, and distinguish our company as they respond to both our Personal Lines and commercial lines customers impacted by the California wildfires, which as you know, remain an active cat.  On the prevention side, our special wildfire defense services teams have so far visited over 250 homeowners and taken active measures to protect more than half of them. By the way, when it comes to wildfire prevention services, the high net worth customers, there are a few pretenders doubting capability but with little exception. No one holds a candle to our vast network of capability. Looking beyond this quarter's catastrophe losses in the shadow it cast, it's an important story to tell about our company. Our underlying health is excellent. Excluding the cats, operating income was about $1.5 billion or $3.12 per share. Our published combined ratio was 111% because of the cats. Excluding them was 847. The current year accident basis excluding cats, the combined ratio was 88.5 compared to 88.9 last year, with the loss ratio of up over 1 point, and the expense ratio down 1.7%. Of the expense ratio last year included an adverse impact of about 0.5 percentage point from purchase accounting, the 1.25-point improvement illustrates our merger-related efficiency efforts.  Net investment income for the quarter was a record $893 million, up nearly 8% over prior year and a very strong results, which included a one-time item Phil will speak more about. In the quarter, per-share book value grew 0.5% while per-share tangible is essentially flat. Book intangible are up nearly 7.5% -- 5% and 7.5%, respectively so far for the year. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the cats and prior period development. Given the inadequacy of pricing and terms in our number of important classes around the globe and the consequent anemic industry results, along with the magnitude of year-to-date cat losses, we should be at the beginning of a firming market, and I believe we are. How extensive and broad the firming remains to be seen, and the timing will vary by geography and type of business, but pricing should and will move. While conditions vary depending on territory, line of business and size of risk, pricing overall today is to cheap and we should strive for price adequacy. Chubb is a leader, and we recognize our responsibility to insist on receiving an adequate rates for the coverage we provide. This includes educating our customers and distribution partners about the reason and need to move pricing to adequacy where it is not, so that we earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return and avoid more volatile price moves in the future if prices continue to stagnate over the road. Following years of rate decreases, properties need rate to return to adequacy. Property rates have 2 components, the catastrophe and attritional loss elements. Property cat risks should be priced to model, and today it is priced at its substantial discount to model in many instances. The attritional loss component of property is also, in many cases, inadequately priced and should return to adequacy. And by the way, even though it is inadequately priced, property cat premiums have been used by many to subsidize inadequate pricing and other classes during the recent years of lighter cat losses, a pretty dumb strategy. As I have said in the past, many classes of D&O and employment practices liability are not adequately priced. Loss frequency and severity are increasing, combined ratios have reached a point in certain classes that are simply unacceptable. Many primary and excess casualty-related losses, including U.S. commercial auto need rate. Loss cost trend while more benign in recent years has nonetheless continued while rates have moved down. Chubb's risk appetite has not changed. We have an exceptionally strong balance sheet and we're willing to deploy it where we can achieve an adequate underwriting margin. Before the third quarter's cat events and during the third quarter, like the second, we were beginning to see signs of a bit more stable pricing environment through the business we wrote. Remember though, we pay a penalty in terms of new business to achieve this result. We began to achieve rate in a few areas while rates were essentially flat where the rate of decline slowed in others. For example, in U.S. publicly traded D&O, rates went flat in the second quarter, and we're in fact, up 2% in the third. Rate movements for the business we wrote in the quarter vary by territory and market segment. In our U.S. middle-market and U.S. major accounts and specialty businesses, renewal pricing in aggregate was up about 1.5%, with exposure change an additional positive 1%. By major class of business, pricing for our risk management business is up 1.5%. General and Specialty Casualty-related pricing was up about 4%. Financial Lines pricing was flat with management liability up 2% and property-related pricing was down about 2.5%. In our international retail commercial P&C business, pricing for general special -- general and specialty casualty, Financial Lines and property-related rates were all down 2%. For our London wholesale business, property rates were up 1%, and marine, down 2% and Financial Lines, flat. Now with that as context, let me give you some color on our revenue results for the quarter, which was a stronger on both a published basis and when adjusted for merger noise. Continuing the trend from prior quarter, this was our best quarter since the merger in terms of growth and reflects a careful balance between leveraging, the power, broad capabilities of the organization and underwriting discipline where we will trade market share for an underwriting profit. For the quarter, P&C net premiums written globally were up over 4.5% in constant dollars. Adjusted for merger-related underwriting actions, they were up 4%. As a reminder, the impact from these merger-related items will continue to ameliorate as we move forward. In our North America commercial P&C business, net premiums we're down about 0.5%. Normalizing for merger-related actions, they were up 1%. The renewal retention rate for our North America commercial P&C business was steady at 92%, with major account and specialty at 94% and middle market at 88%. Overall new business writings for North America commercial were up about 1.5% over third quarter '16, with new business growth coming from major accounts, middle market, small commercial and Bermuda wholesale. In our North America Personal Lines business, net premiums written were up 18%. Excluding the 13-point impact of a onetime on a premium transfer that reduced premiums written in the prior year, growth was about 5%. Rates were up about 2%, and exposure change added 3%. Retention remains very strong at 95%. Turning to Overseas General. Net premiums written for international retail P&C were up over 2% in the quarter in constant dollars, and nearly 4% excluding merger-related actions. Latin America led the way with growth of 12% while the U.K. and Ireland had a good quarter with growth of 4%. Our Asia-focused internationalize Life Insurance business had a very strong quarter with net premiums written and deposits up 28% for the near, year-to-date growth to 18%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. We are in good shape but the remainder of our integration activities, operationally and financially, all areas of integration are on track or ahead of schedule. Lastly, we're continuing to plant seeds to capitalize on future growth opportunities around the globe. You saw, for example, our recent announcement of a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with one of Asia's most respected banks, Singapore-based DBS. At the heart of our venture is our joint ability to market and service insurance digitally to DBS customers both consumer and business. In sum, the company is in great shape and we are optimistic about the future. While it was a tough quarter for cat, again, it's the business we are in. We should be at the beginning of a firming market, and we intend to help lead in that direction. Our company is in great shape from the perspectives of risk management, growth opportunity and financial efficiency. We are investing aggressively in our future Web delivering results to shareholders today. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll come back and take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Due to the unusually high level of catastrophe losses in the quarter, we sustained an operating loss of $60 million or a $0.13 per share. Catastrophe losses totaled over $1.5 billion after-tax or $3.27 per share net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums.  Our underlying results were strong with current accident year underwriting income, excluding catastrophes, a record $839 million, up over 5.5% from the prior year. Our balance sheet remains strong, and we maintain a necessary liquidity to support our business around the globe with total capital exceeding $63 billion. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $563 million to shareholders, including $331 million in dividends and $232 million in shares repurchases. Year-to-date through September 30, our share repurchases have totaled $707 million and our program for the year remains open. Operating cash flow for the quarter was a record $1.8 billion. As Evan mentioned, book value and tangible book value per share were up 0.5% and down 0.3%, respectively. Our operating loss and capital-related actions in the quarter were offset by positive portfolio returns and favorable currency movements. Our invested assets grew by $2.2 billion or over 2% for the quarter, reflecting the favorable impact of foreign currency and positive cash flows.  Investment income of $893 million was a record and higher than expected due to a $44 million distribution from a coinvestment by Chubb with one of the company's private equity fund partners. We now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $845 million to $855 million. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $829 million pretax, and included a $680 million gain from FX and a $223 million gain from the investment portfolio, driven by a slight decline in yields and a positive return on our private equity portfolio. Our pretax catastrophe losses in the quarter, principally from Hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were $3 billion gross and $1.9 billion net of reinsurance and reinstatement premiums bigger this compared to expected that catastrophe loss for the third quarter of $330 million pretax. Additional information on catastrophe losses as the deal in our financial supplement. Net loss reserves increased over $2.3 billion for the quarter. After adjusting for cat losses, our loss reserves increased $660 million. The paid-to-incurred ratio in the quarter was 69%. Adjusting for cat losses and prior period development, the ratio was 87%.  We have positive prior period development in the quarter of $270 million pretax or $206 million after-tax. This included $77 million pretax of adverse development for our legacy environmental liability exposure versus $52 million in 2016. The remaining favorable development of $347 million was principally in long-tail lines related to accident years 2012 and prior. Overall, our favorable prior period development is down compared to last year by $79 million pretax. This is primarily due to the higher environmental charge in 2017, and the fact that 2016 included the release of an individual legacy liability case reserve of $25 million. In the fourth quarter, we expect our combined ratio to be favorable impacted by income level benefits from integration savings at a level similar to the third quarter. By year-end 2017, we will have achieved our full annualized run rate integration-related savings in accordance with the disclosed target of $875 million. As we move through 2018, the relative impact on our combined ratio will dissipate.  Merger-related underwriting actions were $87 million in the quarter. We expect this to increase modestly in the fourth quarter because it includes the impact of the accounting policy alignment we discussed on this year's first quarter conference call. The merger-related impact on premiums will be pretty substantially beginning in the first quarter of 2018. The operating income tax rate for the quarter was impacted by the high level of catastrophe losses. Excluding catastrophe losses, in excess of our expectations, the effective tax rate in the quarter was 16.5%. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate excluding the impact of the excess third quarter catastrophes to remain within the 16% to 18% range for the year. I'll turn it back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : Evan, on the pricing outlook, some argued that the industries do have plenty of excess capital and that it is a very fragmented marketplace. So what gives you comfort that this is the beginning of a firming market and the potential price increase will be sustainable? Evan Greenberg : Well, Kai, it's one thing for there to be plenty of capital, but I agree that theres. It's another thing to receive a reasonable return on the capital. And when I -- when you look at industry results, in aggregate, many the industry are not in achieving cost of capital, let alone, a reasonable risk-adjusted return. Combined ratios are under pressure. You take out cat premiums that's subsidized, that mask the underlying health, you get rate going in one direction, the trend going in the other. And so in my judgment, it has reached a point where the industry -- there is enough pressure that I think, all the responsible companies, there is a recognition of that need. And you'd like the market to be -- to behave though markets the markets and hardly, they behave always rationally. But if we were to suppose a rational and responsible industry, you'd like to not have volatility in terms of pricing and terms to customers.  You'd like it to behave in a more orderly way. And I believe all that bodes towards that direction. The other thing I'd tell you is losses were concentrated. These events weren't just evenly spread. They were concentrated in a number of important places. And those are the market -- the plumbing, the financial plumbing for insurance is global and it is connected. And I think have the loss disproportionately hit some of those centers, London as an example, drives a behavior that has an impact on many other markets at the same time. So while there's no guarantees, that's my point of view. Kai Pan : Okay, that's great. And my second question, on your revenue growth. The underlying premium growth you said is past -- since merger. And could you quantify -- so how much about is attributable to the revenue opportunities you discussed in the merger? And would a hardly market accelerate the realization of the revenue opportunities? Evan Greenberg : Well, look, I can put a dollar or a coin estimate on that. The fact is, when you look at the parts and pieces of this organization combined and the complementarity nature of the strengths of what we now have, that is 1 organization, so I'm hardly going to talk about it 2 years on -- in some artificial way of 2 organizations, it's all one. And the complementarity strands and capabilities are simply compelling from a market point of view for customers, whether it is from small commercial to middle-market to large commercial, and whether it is in the United States or it is overseas, or it is for a global customer, no one has the total capability that this organization has in terms of product and service and reputation for delivering. And we are capitalizing on that. And the fact is, where underwriters and we disciplined in underwriting and we will trade growth for underwriting discipline. And then the more the market rationalizes to a reasonable risk-adjusted price for the risk they take, the more opportunity that will create for Chubb. Thank you for the question. Operator : And we'll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Just following up a little bit, on the market outlook as well. You have insinuated there being about $100 billion of losses this quarter. Now when we look at the disclosures that we'd see to date, where obviously there's a decent size of delta between the losses that are out there and that $100 billion figure. Do we need to see $100 billion, meaning as the losses come in, both the potential and the start of what you said is a firming market -- not be there, I mean how do you view the need to see about $100 billion of losses? Evan Greenberg : Look, I think I'm not speaking a little too simplistic way. You're just putting a point estimate. So if it's 99, Elyse, what do you think? $101 billion, what do you think? -- excuse me, we're talking circa -- in the range of. And what you always see large cats, if you look back through experience, and let's say, let's take Katrina as an example. What was the initial reported loss by insurers, and what did Katrina ultimately develop to? I recall somewhere in the $30 billion range that ultimately became $42 billion to $45 billion. I think that's what you're seeing here, and I think you're going to continue to see it creep. And it happens over a period of time. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's great. And I imagine because there's estimates out there now that you can ballpark at to -- maybe $50 billion. I wasn't talking about $1 billion but in terms of pricing just when you think. . . Evan Greenberg : Well, you pick a number, I'll pick mine. Elyse Greenspan : And then what you're talking about pricing in this firmer market, how are you thinking about price specific to really property and certain pricing levels that you think are needed for Chubb to get a lot more aggressive? I mean, how has the dialogue been with been with your clients following on these events in and around the potential to push for more price? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, in the very early days when you think about the business of housings move and how the business actually works. So in October, you're really quoting late November and December business. In September, your business for October was already done. So there is a lag and it takes time, and that is just building now. The rate increase, I was very clear in my commentary, it varies by customer in the way Chubb will approach this. It doesn't -- it's not some blunt instrument -- here is how much it needs to move. Some customers to make needs to be flat. Some customers need to quote 30% because what's the adequacy? Where are you priced the model on cat, and where are you priced for attritional loss? And that both need to be adequate.  And overall for the industry, if you're large account shared and layered, you're talking double digit and it has to be. If you're talking middle-market commercial, well, the pricing is going to vary depending on the class and where you are located in the United States, or where you're located overseas. We're underwriters, and so we price to the exposure. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's helpful. And then one last for Phil on the tax side. You said 16% to 18%. That's a Q4 and a full year figure? Philip Bancroft : I was saying general on a quarterly basis, yes. We would expect to run 16% to 18%. Now if you're talking about this year, as I said, that's 16% to 18% excludes the impact of the excess cats in this quarter. So on a normal year, I would say 16% to 18%. Operator : We will take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb : Given the expectations for primary commercial insurance rates, it would seem that reinsurance rates could go up more. Could you talk about how much of its reinsurance protection Chubb already has placed for 2018? Or how much it might purchase next year relative to this year, please? Evan Greenberg : Our purchase appetite is pretty steady, Jay, and that isn't something that changes in any dramatic way. Our notion of risk and how we see risk has not changed. These cats didn't show us something else about risks that we didn't already know, and that's what I tried to speak to in the beginning, and I think that speaks with -- remember something about reinsurance. If primary gets rate, the reinsurer automatically got rate because excess pricing, when you think about cat protection, is a derivative of the premium that is collected, and that premium is a proxy for the underlying rate and exposure. And so they automatically get rate. Now you're talking about rate on rate, and how much that will be. And I can't speak to that at this moment in time, it will be pure speculation. Our treaties com up through the year and we already have -- so depending on as they come up through the year, we have treaties that will run for 6 months into '18, 3 months into '18, and 9 months into '18. It all varies. We don't have it all piled into one day. Jay Gelb : That's what I figured. My next question is on the California wildfires. Can you discuss what you think the industry total insured loss might be and then cats exposure given its market presence in high-net worth homeowners as well is the winery industry? Evan Greenberg : Sure. Look, I can't speak to the industry loss right now. My own gut feel for it is the numbers that are out there that -- have a reach around them and where -- sorts of coalescences around that $5 billion, it doesn't feel off to me. But I don't know with any certainty. And for Chubb, I'm not going to give you a number because it's too early. It's too early to estimate our lawsuit position but from all we know at the moment, the net loss appears to be in the range of our cat load for the fourth quarter. But again, it's early days. When I say what's the cat load for the fourth quarter, and I'm not going to disclose our cat load for the fourth quarter. We don't do that. But I think you have a way of doing researching into the past. Jay Gelb : Will the fourth quarter typically be less in the third quarter? Evan Greenberg : Third quarter right? It's less. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : A quick question just on the pricing one here. So history, I think, has found, particularly, in the Casualty Line and even in the Property Lines, that firming markets typically follow an increase in the kind of perception of risk in those lines of business or higher loss trends -- something is happening. Do we really have that this time around? Evan Greenberg : I think we do among a lot of prayers players, I do. Remember you had a lot of nonmodeled risk here, let's take Harvey as an example. Harvey was a rain event. It wasn't a wind event. It was a flood event. And models hardly imagine that. I think when the dust all settles and you look at Maria, the devastation in Puerto Rico, I mean it was -- it was pummeled back to the Stone Age. And the kind of business interruption exposures that can emerge from that, I think, stand up and give people to take attention. When you Irma approaching -- if Irma moves 70 miles east, you were looking at $150 billion. I think people stood up to take attention to that. The number of territories that were, in essence, correlated in single event, in single events, and then in aggregate in the events. While people understood it theoretically possible, it's another thing when it actually occurs. And it's something about human nature, that when you're taking a bet and you don't lose the bet over years, your perception of risk just has a way of moderating. Humans start to feel almost omnipotent that way. And then, as soon as it hits, isn't it amazing how people feel ? It's not just in catastrophes. It's in any kind of risk-taking. It's just the human condition. And that's what you've got going on. And that's why I started out by saying, it's not my company. And cat losses will stop you crying. This is the business we're in, this is what we do for a living. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then what do you think about the reaction of the alternative markets or capital markets? And did they put a lid on them -- any type of property pricing, pricing property, cats, those types of things? Evan Greenberg : Well, we'll see. Look, the retro market was hit very, very hard and both with impaired capital and capital that is tied up because of the big question mark of whether it's impaired or not in the ultimate loss, to Elyse's question, what we've seen reported -- but there will be a big delta between what's been reported. And when you look back a year or 2 years well with the ultimate loss is. And that capital -- a lot of capital was tied up. And how much capital comes back in and based on what kind of return will be expected, which I can guarantee, has a lot higher than to get a return, a lot higher than the rates they took in the past. Well, that's in front of us and it's a short window, because here comes January 1, and reinsurers have to make their plans about how much capacity to commit. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny. Ian Gutterman : And I have a couple of questions last couple yes. So I guess, Maria -- can you talk about more -- I think the price, that's been everyone's lowest number. I know there's a lot of different range on the industry events but nothing -- it sees for a lot of people, it's half of less of the others. And I would have thought, for a company like yours, frankly, it would've been higher just given your national account exposure. There is almost as many Home Depot's and/or Walmarts, et cetera, on Puerto Rico as New Orleans, so I guess I'm surprised we're not seeing more national account type losses I would say, if you can't open the doors. Evan Greenberg : I don't mind telling you that Chubb, fundamentally, overall our company, in the last 2 years, 3 years, we cut our exposure in the Caribbean and Puerto Rico in half or more. We didn't like pricing, we didn't like aggregations and we didn't like terms, period. Number 2, you're referring to big real estate schedules when you're using proxy of the kinds of accounts you named. And by the way, the most underpriced business is big, with the greatest basis risk and exposure is real estate schedules. And any underwriter worth half their salt understand that. So that's how I commented on based on Chubb. I can't comment that, I can't comment for you based on others. And on one hand, I scratch my head a little bit but on the other hand, what they do know is, many simply don't have good data yet. They don't know. And unlike us, they're not on the ground with people actually examining the exposure with -- through the eyes of experienced adjusters and with that kind of command and control around it. And I think there will be a surprise. I think business interruption when -- time will tell, and I could be wrong, but I think business interruption is going to be uglier at Maria than you imagined, through the obvious reasons -- electricity, ports and transportation, ability to operate. Brian Meredith : Exactly, that's why I'm worried about. I'm glad you're not on it but I'm worried that others are. On your cat look, I'm doing some very back of the envelop math, which is maybe a little bit unfair. But I think I'm wondering, so said -- I guess I'm wondering do these events make you rethink your annual cat load just -- you said this is a 1-in-5 to 1 in 10, and it also, I think [indiscernible] 330s and normal Q3, so over 10 years, that would be $3.3 billion, you had a $1.9 billion every 7 years, that's about $2.9 billion with nothing in the other years. So again, that's a little bit changes using in Q3, but do these sort of return periods make you rethink what your normal cat load should be? Evan Greenberg : No. It was actually -- and it depends -- look, are you talking AALs, or are you talking expected that in a normal year? And so there's different basis for thinking about it, number 1. And number 2, as I said, a 1 and 5 to a 1 in 10, and it fits within our expectation as we model the aggregations and what our appetite would be at various return periods based upon our losses as percentage of capital, as a percentage of earnings and as a percentage of industry as we imagine industry. These losses don't throw us. I know what you want me to square for you on this call, and I'm not falling into a math with you. I'll rapidfire back-and-forth math. Ian Gutterman : I can move on. So to build up on Brian's point about sort of a -- what -- the magnitude we might be seeing here, I guess to me, the question is 2005 versus 2011, right, and you could argue 2011, we haven't seen many quakes in a year? And some of those quakes were in places where the quakes were in the quakes maps, right? I mean those were significant surprises. And you had a tight flood, maybe that's like the wildfires being the final gut punch. And yet, all you really got was localized pricing. And I guess I'm just sort of going through sort of supply-demand and listen to all the calls so far. The companies had much bigger losses than you, none of them are as saying they're retreating. They're all saying that they are looking to maintain their net and grow their gross. So no one's pulling out. The alternative guys certainly are looking to reload. And as the models aren't changing and the rating agencies aren't changing, it doesn't necessarily seem there's more demand. So if the demand is the same, the capacity at least the same, if not more, I just struggle with outside of obviously where there's been losses, why this is in 2011 like where it makes sense should be pricing, but at the end of the day, there's just too many people who want to grow and none of the people are go and paying. Evan Greenberg : Ian, there's your thesis. I don't agree with you, and I gave you my thesis. Ian Gutterman : Nothing else you want to add to that? Evan Greenberg : I'm not going to -- I don't think I'm going to repeat myself. I'm comfortable where I am. And by the way, I'm looking at property prices already moving. I have and you can't. Now time will tell. Time will tell. I think the industry's reserve position is tighter than it was back in '11. I think the published results x cat are under a lot more pressure than they were, and I've given you all my rationale. Ian Gutterman : Well, it makes sense. We'll have to see how it plays out. Evan Greenberg : No. We don't need to debate it. We just need to get on. Hey, Ian, I'm not going to give me an answer. I can only be wrong. I told you what I imagined, I told you what -- if we can have anything to do with crafting the reality, the reality we're going to craft. Operator : And then we'll go next to Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : A couple of small ball questions, if I can. One, let me start with Phil. So the guidance that you gave for investment fee income, we've seen it straight kind of sneak up in the past couple of months. Does that anticipate a continuation of that trend, or is this based on current levels? Philip Bancroft : Well, it's a current view of our short-term rate. We update the run rate periodically, and we think that it's a -- based on the cash flow that we expect, and we do an analysis to estimate what we think our -- what we estimate as our investment income for the upcoming quarters. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Let me just add. That's this just for the fourth quarter. So for that, for higher rates to pike, it's going to take a while. So as we look forward, yes, we would anticipate some increase in rates and that will affect income as we go forward the next few quarters. Meyer Shields : Okay, that's helpful. And can you talk to the adverse development in North America personal? Philip Bancroft : Yes, [indiscernible] going well, for sure. As we had adverse PPD of $32 million, PRS in Q3, that was a -- some unfavorable loss development in homeowners, a little bit of an offset to that from the umbrella. That compares to $30 million in the third quarter of 2016. Recall here, Meyer, that we're harmonizing the 3 books of business and this is a huge portfolio. It's in the homeowners line. It's short-tail, very short-tail, and you just a little bit of movement on some of these losses. So nothing what I would [indiscernible] noise. Evan Greenberg : That's all in the prior prayer but I'm going to help you, Meyer. Okay, we saw the loss ratio in the current accident year also continue to go up in personal. So, why? I'm being your lawyer, Meyer. Philip Bancroft : That's a great question, Evan, and I don't consider that a small mall. I consider that a big bowl. The Personal Lines current accident year loss ratio excluding cats is $51.9 billion in Q3. While at 51.9, Evan, I think, you and I would agree, that's still a good number, it is 2.6 Meyer than Q3 2016 comp, which was a at 49.3, and that is [indiscernible] higher than where we target the business to run. Evan Greenberg : The causes of that elevated loss ratio were more large random fires than expected as well as an increase in water damage claims specifically versus fire.thicken given the high severity of low frequency nature of large fire losses, we anticipate random differences in the quarter-to-quarter impact. As you often say, it is our business. As I have mentioned in the past, we have been experiencing an elevated level of losses reversed pipes. We believe these water losses are on industry issue and are not isolated to us. We'll burst pipe losses typically cause us less than home fires, they're incredibly inconvenient for the homeowner and oftentimes, require them to be out of their homes for a period of time. Fortunately, no other carrier has more high-net worth home beta than us, and we have a proactive program to directly reach homeowners we've identified and more likely to have a water loss. We arm our customers with facts, and we give them practical advice in how to mitigate their chances of loss. We provide them with list of qualified professionals who can install devices such as sensors, water softeners and especially automatic shutoff valves. And of course, once these devices are installed, we provide them with the premium credits because of their improve price. So it's still early days for this proactive program. Our ages and brokers are excited about it and readily embracing it. In fact, they like being advocates for tangible tools to reduce risks and rates. This is part of the Chubb high net worth advantage that so different sheets us in the market. Meyer Shields : And final question with a little bit of dead horse-beating. But Evan, you talked about mechanic of the leadership position that you have that have been take in terms of driving equipment. Evan Greenberg : Yes. It's in some ways, a continuation of our playbook, we just can't give up. And it's how you -- it's how -- it's the command-and-control effect of underwriting management. So on one hand, it's how you -- its materials used to educate customers of why you need rate increases and riders, mathematically, the logic behind your statements and your actions. And that is to educate both the customer and your distribution partners and prepare the environment. At the same time then, it's how you train and arm your underwriters, many of whom have never been in an environment where they asked for a rate increase. They will be provided rate decreases and they're the ones on the front end. For those of you who are not in the business, and you're not, you just observe the business, this is one of the reasons why it takes time for markets to move because the way from the head to tail, to those actually have to administer it on a daily transaction-by-transaction basis, the command-and-control to get them to move takes -- can take time. We understand that and we're usually quicker. And it's getting our underwriters, therefore, and training them and helping them work alongside others who've done it before and being able to actually experience getting a rate increase and that you can do it and you can ask for it. Sounds simple? Not as simple as you might imagine. And then to reinforce that, what you do is you start changing underwriting authorities and you say I'm only giving you of no authority to quote less than x. Any if you're going to quote less the x as an increase, it has to -- it needs approval. It has to go up to manager. And you limit the number of managers who have that authority to move off of your stated instructions. And that has a way of putting discipline within an organization. So that's just an example to, the kinds of tools and how you do it and you get out there in a very granular way to drive execution of something like this. We've done it before and we know how to do that. Operator : And we'll go next to Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : I was wondering if you could talk about the tax proposals that are floating around Washington. We don't have a lot of specifics yet but you probably have some view -- and also help that could affect Chubb given the complex Chubb's tax arrangements. Evan Greenberg : Yes. I won't comment directly because -- on the proposals right now, because this is -- you've got house constructing their views of tax and details in proposals, and they look at paying for us et cetera and then Senate doing the same. But let me -- but thank you for the question. I want to make a few other comments and observations none of this that I think important at this moment. And there's been a lot of noise recently from protectionists U.S. insurers. We are seeking the upset to global insurance markets that is working well for U.S. consumers. They want to stop competition from foreign insurers who help keep rates down and they were providing the majority of the cash that is sprinklings from let's take the recent hurricanes. U.S. insurers claim they are suffering compared to foreign insurers because of tax laws. Well this is fundamentally untrue. If you look at their stock prices over the last decade, shareholders of U.S. insurers, including Berkeley and Travelers have been richly rewarded over the last decade. Just compare a cohort of U.S. insurers and foreign insurers, and you'll see dramatic difference in how much more the U.S. insurers have improved their stock prices. And when they're not running the Congress, to limit foreign competition, they are telling shareholders in the public just how well they are doing, just read their annual reports and listen to their analyst calls, it's a litany of market successes and bright futures. They also make false claims about insurance jobs moving overseas and decreasing tax revenues. In fact, look at what Chubb has done. It is invested for growth in the U.S. As return signal from a money loser into a profitable taxpaying company, securing the jobs of thousands of employees -- and we used our capital to combine Ace and Chubb, we created a powerful competitor, offering U.S. customers and their array of new products and efficiencies while rewarding shareholders of the same time. And increasing revenue and payrolls means an expanded U.S. tax base, bringing in more personal and corporate tax at all levels of government. While Chubb was investing in the U.S., what were U.S. companies, like Berkeley and Travelers' doing, complaining about decreasing market share while using their capital to buy back stock, maybe boosting their share prices as a result, but failing to make the investments that are essential for long-term growth and creating more jobs. They know that the strategy doesn't work against companies like Chubb, which are investing in innovation and growth. So they want to slow us down by changing the tax rules and protect their market share at the customers' expense. The current tax system, including the rules about affiliate REIT makes sense because it's -- recognizes the tax should be applied where the risk reside and that system has encourage global distribution of risks, which maximizes the efficient use of capital, resulting in more competition and lower premiums. But you don't have to take my word that this system works to benefit customers and not as the tax avoidance scheme, the U.S. insurers have fantasized. The OECD looked at the tax avoidance question and they would be sceptical of any industry claims. And they concluded that affiliate reinsurance has a legitimate business purpose. And the U.S. Treasury Department also concluded that affiliate REIT is an important tool, allowing insurers to lower overall costs by pulling capital. So don't be fooled by claims of the U.S. insurers were trying to hide behind the falls patriotism and trade themselves in the flag. They are not interested in lowering costs for U.S. customers. They want to blow up the system that has worked so well to keep prices competitive in the United States. Thank you, Jay for that question. Operator : And we'll take our last question from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Joshua Shanker : I wanted to dovetail a little with the Meyer asked about jumpering leadership. You guys have done a phenomenal job here, broking even in $100 billion loss last quarter. You were -- combined ratios, underlying basis are about 100 basis points better than they were three years ago. Interest rates were higher for pricing. It looks like another situation maybe for you, and maybe not the industry. Why is Chubb invested in this secret rate? Why don't let others make mistakes and allow you to capitalize on their mistakes as they come to you? Does Chubb need to be the one to demonstrate the leadership on the rates pricing? Evan Greenberg : Well, yes. I think Chubb and I think others will do as they think is in the interest of their own company. I know we'll do what's in the interest of our company. Josh, there are many -- you're looking at the broken egg in it and it's a global book you're looking at. You don't see the underlying parts and pieces as I do. And I know in the large commercial business, and I know in pockets of all of our commercial business, the different classes and the different customer segments and where we are running a combined ratio that is adequate to earn a decent risk-adjusted return and where it is not. And we have many classes that other under pressure. They may earn an underwriting profit but their combined ratios are too high. It is inadequate to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return. And by the way, as I always say, we pay a penalty in terms of growth by maintaining underwriting discipline, particularly in those classes, in any class as it approaches inadequacy. And then what you know is, trend continues, it just marches on minute by minute, day by day. And you need, if you want, you want to get out of that. You want to stay ahead of the. And what you don't want to do, and I don't want to see happen -- I care about our industry because I care about our industry's reputation and what customers don't want ultimately it's volatility in pricing. They want more predictability. And so all of that success to me, when you add it all together between opportunity, between the in between responsible behavior in an industry that is importance to the plumbing of our economy, that we behave in a responsible rational way, so prices should I need to. Helen Wilson : Thank you, everyone for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you, and good day. Operator : This does conclude today's conference. We thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

And welcome to the Chubb Limited Fourth Quarter Year End 2017 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded [Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Wilson : Thank you. And welcome to our December 31, 2017 fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix and economic and market conditions. These are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our most recent SEC filings earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our Web site at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of these non-GAAP financial measures to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related information are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available at investors.chubb.com. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we reported fourth quarter core operating income of $3.17 per share, up about 16.5% from prior year. These results were impacted positively by the U.S. tax reform law at the end of the year and negatively by the California wildfires, which included the two largest fires in California history. Those items aside, our company\u2019s results were highlighted by excellent underlying or ex-CAT underwriting performance in every division and improving commercial P&C pricing conditions in a number of our businesses globally, leading to what should be a more favorable underwriting environment in \u201918 for many of our businesses. Our premium revenue growth for the quarter, excluding merger related actions, was 3.7%. Headwinds to growth related to these actions are almost all behind us, about $150 million remains or less than 0.5% of annual net premiums. That along with the strong economy both domestic and global and with an improving pricing environment makes us quite optimistic about our growth prospects for the year ahead. Tax reform will benefit our economy and our company will benefit from both the lower corporate rate and additional exposure growth as the economy and therefore insurance exposures grow. Our quarterly operating income included a one-time $450 million tax benefit related to tax reform. And we will benefit in the future from a lower overall corporate rate. We chose to share a portion of the benefits of tax reform to make a difference in society with the contribution to the Chubb Charitable Foundation of $50 million. For the year, we produced $3.8 billion in core operating income, which was down 20% from what we would have earned with the normalized level of cat losses, and without the benefit from tax reform or about $4.8 billion. Our results led the core operating ROEs of 12% for the quarter and nearly 8% for the year. For the year, we had strong book and tangible book value per share growth of 6.5 and 8.6 respectively. In the quarter, the P&C combined ratio was 90.7 and for the year, it was 94.7 and that's with $2.7 billion in catastrophe losses. That kind of combined ratio in the face of this level of tax simply speaks to the quality of our underwriting and underlying book. And to that point, on a current accident year basis, excluding tax, the combined ratio for the year was 87.6 compared with 89 in '16 with the loss ratio up over just 0.5 point and the expense ratio down over 2 points. By the way, while it was a heavy year for cat losses, on the other hand we had an outstanding year in our agriculture business another cat like business, which I'll touch on later. Net investment income for the quarter was $873 million, up 3.5% over prior year and a good result that contributed to record net investment income for the year of $3.5 billion, up over 6%. Considering the historically low interest rate environment, this was an outstanding result. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the cats, and prior period development. On our third quarter call, I reported that we began to see signs of a bit more stable pricing environment for the business we wrote. In the fourth quarter, that positive rate movement continue and in fact, accelerated month-by-month as the quarter progressed with prices beginning to firm in a number of important classes, both property and casualty related. And that trend has continued into January. I believe we are in a transition market globally. And rates should continue to firm as the year goes along. Although, not all classes and not in all countries or territories. The current trend in terms of rate change is the best we've seen in the last few years. Renewal retention remains steady overall across the company and are quite good, but they vary by line of business during the quarter. Some areas of our business pay the price in terms of a modestly lower renewal retention level in order to maintain pricing discipline. The same with new business. Some areas of our company were up, while others suffered in terms of new business. Those areas where we suffer to what we speak -- what speak to a market in transition. Some companies are pressing for rate and in my judgment, understand they need to improve rate to exposure. While other market participants have yet to respond and are using this moment to grab under priced pressure. As I said at the beginning, P&C net premium revenue growth, excluding merger actions, was 3.7% for the quarter and that includes 1.2 points from foreign exchange. Now let me give you some specifics around growth and rate change. In our U.S. major account retail and E&S wholesale divisions, what we call major accounts and specialty. P&C net premiums excluding merger related actions were down just over 3%. For major accounts our renewal retention remained at historic highs of over 95% due in large part to our risk management portfolio where we are market leaders. For wholesale E&S, there was a reduction in renewal retention of about 2 to 3 points to the mid-70s. New business in major accounts was up 3.5%, while an E&S, it was down about 8%. The change in price we achieved for both major accounts and E&S wholesale was the best we\u2019ve seen in a number of years, and let me give you some examples of both rate and its movement during the quarter. Major account rates overall were up 1% for the quarter, improving to up 1.9 by December and they are as stronger, stronger in January depending on class. Property rates were up over 7.5% in the quarter, improving to up 10 by December. Casualty rates were essentially flat in the quarter, improving to up 1.5 in December. And public DNO rates were up 2.5 in the quarter and up 6 for December. Though overall professional lines rates for major accounts was down 0.5 point in the quarter. It was a similar story in E&S wholesale. Rates overall were up 2.7 for the quarter, improving to 4.8 in December. And again, they are as strong in January. The property rates were up 2.8 in the quarter, improving to up 6.3 in December. Casualty rates were up 3.8 in the quarter, improving to up 4.6 in December. And unlike in major accounts, financial lines rates were up 2.3 in the quarter, improving to up 5 in December. Now, let\u2019s turn to our middle market and small commercial division, where net premiums excluding merger related actions, were up 2% in the quarter. P&C lines were up 3.1 while financial lines were up 1.2. Renewal retention was reasonably steady, down about a point to 86% and exposure growth added three tenths of a point. New business growth for our mid-market business was quite strong, up 10% and the best in a while. And by the way, 50% of that growth came from cross-sell efforts. Rates excluding comp were flat, which marks the first reversal and declining rates in three years. Property rates were flat and rates for package were down about 1.5 points, while exposure related pricing for package was up almost 2 points. So there was a net positive change to renewal price for package. Causality related rates were flat and financial lines rates were up about a point. Comp rates were down about 4 points, while comp pricing related exposure was up over 2. So net pricing for comp was down 2. Pricing in January for middle market appears to have continued the trend and in some classes firmed incrementally from the fourth quarter. For example, property is now up 2 points while casualty continues to be flat. Commercial auto rates continue to accelerate, but remember, we're not a huge commercial auto writer. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written were up almost 6% in the quarter. Rates were up about 2 and exposure change added 3. Retention remains very strong at about 95% and new business was up 12% overall and up 16 for our targeted premier and signature high net worth clients. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations. Net premiums written for our international retail P&C business were up over 7%, excluding merger related actions or over 4% in constant dollars. Latin America and Asia-Pac led the way with growth of 11% and 9% respectively, while the Europe also had a good quarter with growth of 5%. The trend in pricing in the quarter was the best we have seen again in three years in both our international retail and wholesale business. First in retail. Financial lines rates were up 3, property related rates were up 2, and marine was up 2. While general and specialty casualty were down 1. For our London wholesale business, property rates were up 5 and by December up 7. Marine was up 6 and financial lines were up 1. In January, London wholesale property moved to double digit rate. Our agriculture business where we are the clear market leader had an excellent year, highlighted by a combined ratio of 74% and over $390 million of underwriting income, up 15%. As I noted last year, this is a cat like business and therefore it has a certain volatility to it by definition, as weather expose with weather impacting crop yields and commodity prices. We've experienced both sides of volatility, years with great growing seasons and others with drought. This has been and continues to be a good business for Chubb. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter and year, including current market conditions and pricing trends. In the quarter, we announced the strategic cooperation agreement with PICC, Property & Casualty Company of China, the country's largest P&C insurer. The agreement will leverage Chubb's global capabilities and supported PICC customers and other Chinese affiliated companies around the world in line with the Chinese government's drive to promote the country's going out and one belt one road initiatives. With this 10 year agreement, PICC has the ability to offer some of China's largest enterprises, many of which have complex operations in multiple foreign jurisdictions access to Chubb's leading capabilities in countries beyond their home market. I am both optimistic and confident about the year in front of us. We have positive synchronized economic growth globally, as well as the benefits of tax reform, which should produce exposure growth which is good for insurance and good for Chubb. We have the many investments we have been making to enhance our capabilities and growth potential. Like the PICC and recent DBS announcements. Our middle market and small commercial business globally represents 30% to the company, and we expect good growth in this area globally. Our global A&H and Personal Lines businesses are 35% of the company, and we expect good growth this year. We are seeing and are reasonably optimistic that we should continue to see positive momentum building for commercial P&C pricing. We would like to see it spread to more classes and more businesses that need rate, and we will do our part as industry leaders to drive that momentum. In some, we\u2019re bullish that our growth will continue to accelerate and \u201918 will be quite strong. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil, and then we\u2019ll be back to take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. We completed the year in excellent financial condition. We have a strong balance sheet with top financial strength ratings, excellent liquidity and significant capital generating capability. Despite significant catastrophic loss payments, our operating cash flow was quite strong at $1.1 billion for the quarter and $4.5 billion for the year. As Evan noted, we grew tangible book value per share by 8.6% for the year. Originally down 29% at the merger closing, tangible book value per share has recovered over 20 points. We have total capital of $64 billion. During the quarter, we returned $453 million to shareholders, including $330 million in dividends and $123 million in shares repurchase. For the year, we returned over $2.1 billion, including $1.3 billion in dividends and $830 million in share repurchases. In the quarter, investment income of $873 million was higher than our previously expected range of $845 million to $855 million due to increased call activity on our corporate bond portfolio and higher than projected private equity distributions. We now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $865 million to $875 million with an upward trajectory as the year progresses. Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter were $384 million after-tax and included a $390 million loss from foreign currency movement; a $93 million loss from the investment portfolio, primarily due to increase interest rates; and a gain of $99 million, principally from positive asset returns on our retiree benefits plan portfolio. Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $447 million and Northern California wildfires and other catastrophe losses in the quarter were $320 million as previously announced. Additionally, there was $157 million from the Southern California wildfires and a favorable adjustment of $30 million from last quarter\u2019s catastrophe events. Net loss reserves decreased $1 billion in the quarter on a constant dollar basis, primarily reflecting catastrophe loss payments and crop payments, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter. The pay to incur ratio was 120% and was impacted by these payments and by the favorable prior period development in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, the pay to incur ratio was 91%. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $158 million pre-tax or $130 million after-tax. This included $138 million pre-tax of adverse development, principally from our legacy asbestos exposures. The remaining favorable development of $296 million pre-tax was put about evenly between long tail and short tail lines. The long tail is primarily from accident years 2000 inflow and prior. The operating income tax rate for the quarter and for the year reflects the provisional income tax benefit of $415 million relating to 2017 tax reform act. This benefit comprises a $743 million benefit to book value relating to intangibles, reflecting the favorable impact of the reduced U.S. corporate tax rate on our gross deferred tax liability established at the time of the Chubb Corp acquisition. And a charge of $293 million to tangible book value, primarily reflecting the negative impact of the tax rate reduction on our gross deferred tax asset balances. We have previously announced an estimate that was in excess of $215 million. The increase in our estimate reflects a more favorable impact for the newly established excess foreign tax credits generated by the new deemed repatriation rules. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15% under the new rules. I'll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson : Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, I appreciate all the disclosure on the market. Just tying together your color and I think there\u2019s some speculation out there that maybe some of the tax reform benefit at least in the U.S. to a certain degree to get competed away. And then when you think about the outlook on the market, in some of your commentary and the rating environment. How does that play into how you think about the commercial lines environment on the pricing side playing out in 2018? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, it's right now, ideal speculation. And who knows there is no certainly. I think of few observations. Moving to the P&C, commercial P&C combined ratios. You've got to make profit to have something to compete away. So you can't and if you take out cat premiums, as well as cat losses to look at ex-cat accident year, so truly take out cat. The combined ratios of the industry on commercial P&C are very anemic. I'm hovering around 100 or over 100. And so how you're going to compete away with the tax benefit without profit, without underwriting profit, number one. Number two, the industry is hardly running some brilliant ROE. It's mid-single digit to low-single digit. And on a risk adjusted basis, that\u2019s an anemic return. Number three, the industry has had as operated at a very low interest rate environment, that is really pressured investment income. The tax benefit starts in my judgment to give some amelioration to that. And I think anyone who is rationale in thinking about this as a leader and projecting ahead is considering all these factors. Elyse Greenspan : And then when had you said, you pointed to some companies that are looking to grab share in the market and under pricing business. Is that specific to turn in line or is that just something you\u2019re observing broadly throughout the commercial lines market? Evan Greenberg : It truly varies by line of business. There is a cohort that we can identify that is by line of business and it\u2019s generally by territory or country that we know that we have our eye on. Elyse Greenspan : And then one last question, if I may\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m not going to name and shame Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : One last question, can we just get a little bit of an update on where you see loss costs broadly within your commercial lines book right now? Evan Greenberg : Loss costs have been and vary by line of business. It has been pretty steady from what I\u2019ve said in prior quarters. You\u2019re looking at primary casualty depending on the line of business that\u2019s running in that 3% that 5% range, excess is typically running in that 7% to 9% range. We\u2019ve seen a net in professional lines, particularly in DNO, the employment practices. There has been an uptake in both frequency and severity trends over the last two years, three years and that is very troublesome because it\u2019s related generally in the United States, it\u2019s a merger related objections, and on to securities class actions. And by the way, I\u2019ve noticed recently some public information release about DNO loss ratios, and they are pure loss ratios, they don\u2019t even have loss costs in it. And the interesting part about loss costs and loss adjustment costs, when you add it all up, half the costs insurance companies are paying up goes to the legal profession, to either defend or it\u2019s the trial bar settlements, hardly a benefit to corporate America or to shareholders who are supposedly agreed. Pardon me for going beyond loss costs. Operator : And we will now hear from Kai Pan with Morgan Stanley. Kai Pan : My first question is that if you look at back two years ago, when you first set up the goal for the merger, the twin drivers, one is expense savings, which you have exceeded the original target. The other one is substantial revenue growth. But the revenue growth in the past few year has been limited. So where are the revenue opportunities and how these things will play out in the next three years? Evan Greenberg : We actually -- when we look at it, revenue growth ex the merger related actions, which was planned and understood all along, we\u2019re actually very clear about it upfront. So I take a little exception to how you\u2019re characterizing it. You take that out and you look underneath it. When we imagine, when we look at the market conditions, the two companies together are doing better in growth than these two companies would have done standalone, and not as really clear to us. Secondly, we said and we put a time horizon on the growth of between that three and five year window because of the seeds we are planting and have been planting. And I just said that 3% of our business is small and middle market, and the growth in the small and middle market globally is accelerating. And in fact we had no small commercial globally between the two companies, until we've locked them together and took capabilities that both had and invested behind them and now have growing businesses, as an example. So I'll stop right there. Kai Pan : And then on the industry consolidation, recently we have seen some larger announcement. And now you are two year into the merger integration. Will you be -- how we are looking and looking for potential growth opportunities through acquisitions? Evan Greenberg : I know you didn't imagine I would answer that question. You're just trying me on\u2026 Kai Pan : All right, I tried. You can take on another question to repeat that one, so on the foreign exchange. In the past, you have said if U.S. dollar strengthening that will be hurting your book value. But now fourth quarter after U.S. dollar have been so weakening. So why there is a drag on your book value? Evan Greenberg : So the balance sheet FX impact in the quarter was a result of the U.S. dollar strengthening against most major currencies from 9/30 to 12/31; notably, the Canadian dollar, the Brazilian real, the Australian dollar. So for the quarter, we had a book value loss of $390 million. For the year, though, the dollar has weakened and we\u2019ve had a cumulative gain of $512 million. It depends where it took place, Kai. So when you're looking at the dollar, weakening is a headline and how it impacts premium revenue growth on book value, it depends where you have your assets in the fourth quarter. Kai Pan : If the dollar stays the same, would that be possibly impact for the full year results 2018? Evan Greenberg : There\u2019ll be no change. Operator : And our next question today is Sarah DeWitt with JPMorgan. Sarah DeWitt : On the revenues, now that the marks or related underwriting actions are behind you. Can you help us think about what premium growth we should be looking for given there is pricing actions, there\u2019s economy and the growth opportunities that you're seeing? Evan Greenberg : First, remember I just gave you a number of $150 million remaining, so it's not zero but it's very modest now. Secondly, we don't drive revenue growth. I gave you as much color around revenue growth as I'm going to provide. Unidentified Analyst : And then just on the pricing outlook. How high do you think you could raise prices as we look out a year or two or maybe another way to think about it. How much rate do you think you need across your book in the current environment? Evan Greenberg : I'm not going to speculate on that how much we can achieve. We're doing it in a responsible way. We're only going for rate that is required to earn a reasonable risk adjusted return, and it varies by line of business, by kind of customer cohort, and by country. So it's not a simplistic answer that way. What I would say is unlike others, you look at our total portfolio and you look at the combined ratio we\u2019re putting -- we put. And it\u2019s world class. It\u2019s the best in the industry. But that does vary by line and commercial P&C, particularly larger business and E&S business, it runs in the 90s. We have other businesses that all together mix our portfolio down into the 80s. So it varies by area and we\u2019ve had underwriting discipline. We are willing to trade and we\u2019ll continue to trade market share and growth to maintain a reasonable underwriting return. And as the market response to anemic returns and prices go up and as the market responds to an understanding that loss cost trends are something that just continue to grind away and put pressure on margins. The responsible thing to do is for both client and for companies, so you avoid volatility in the future end pricing is to raise respond by raising rates. And as that happens that increases opportunity for us and increases growth, and that\u2019s about as much as I\u2019m going to say so. Operator : And we will now go to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : I had a question regarding the comments on the acceleration of rate improvement over the course of the quarter, and then for January. I think looking at some of the comments made by brokers I got almost the opposite impression from them. So I was just curious to better understand why there may be a discrepancy between what we\u2019re hearing from brokers and what we\u2019re hearing from some of the insurers? Evan Greenberg : Well, you\u2019re going to have to go figure that out. I can\u2019t help you with that. I can only relate to the data we see. So I know our information. And if you\u2019re getting contrary information and by the way, the brokers we talk to, what we see, what they see is consistent. So I think you may be confused in some ways and not comparing apples-to-apples with type of business, insurance versus reinsurance, London versus United States or whatever. But I can\u2019t help you with your -- you live in your hell, I live in mine. Yaron Kinar : And then with regards to major accounts, I guess most of your competitors are necessarily even impacted by U.S. tax reform. So would you see the dynamic in major accounts being different over the course of the year than the dynamic in another account? Evan Greenberg : No. Yaron Kinar : And then maybe one final question. With regard to the 30% of U.S. premiums that you would see that\u2019s overseas affiliates in the past. Given tax reform, are you trading that portion of the book, or have you adjusted in any way to addressable tax reform there? Evan Greenberg : We\u2019re not really going into any detail about our capital management that is proprietary. And Phil you want to\u2026 Phil Bancroft : I would have said the same thing. We\u2019ve looked at obviously the change in the ex-U.S. tax rate as one of the most important drivers of the reduction in our tax rate. We've looked at also rates around the world where we expect our income to emerge. And we've done it all in light of our planned capital management. We operate in 54 jurisdictions where constantly being changes of tax law and we've analyzed the rules and we've thought about modifying our capital management strategies and other border transactions, but -- and other cross-border transactions. But as Evan said, we're just not prepared to provide any more color on that. And currently, the rate we've considered to all those things. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Jay Gelb : My first question is on the California wildfires. Could you perhaps provide some perspective on how large do you think the fourth quarter industry insured losses were for the wildfires? Evan Greenberg : I don't have a great handle on it. The numbers bouncing around have been -- that $9 billion and $12 billion. And I think that's probably a pretty good number, but I don't know with certainty the size of both of these fires. When I said they were the largest in history, not the insured loss which obviously will be, but that's really referring to is the geography on the third was greater than we've seen than has been seen in recorded history. So you get back past recorded history and they were both fair ones but this is as big as you've seen, so the massive we do know that. So we think probably that $9 billion to $12 billion wouldn't surprise me if it comes out there on the Northern fires. Southern fires are much smaller. They did burn in concentrations, greater affluence, though they were smaller fires. And there will be a few billion dollars anyway for the industry. Jay Gelb : Does that have implications in terms of how Chubb would position its homeowners' business in California, going forward? Evan Greenberg : The whole notion of non-modeled cat and being able to model better is, we're an underwriting company and that is just such a part of our craft. And I am more enthusiastic about that that fascinates us. So the notion of how much concentration do you really have to an event as you can define an event and what is your appetite for that, are you getting paid adequately and how you protect yourself, are all the questions we dwell on in great detail as we expand our personal lines and smaller commercial portfolios. Flood and the ability to manage flood that way is further advanced the wildfire, and can all come back on wildfire. And flood, the tools we can now use, the mapping, the analytics of portfolio and how to respond to various flood scenarios, is getting better and better. And it gives us much better confidence depending on the geography and the area that we're looking at flood concentrations. In wildfire, the tools have been good, but they were improving. And there were some new tools that are out that give you a better way to imagine wildfire and the impact on the concentrations of the portfolio. So we\u2019re all over that. The regulatory environment in California, in particular is -- you have to take it into consideration. It\u2019s difficult when it comes to being able to get a proper price for the risk you\u2019re taking and that\u2019s not to California\u2019s benefit given the values of concentration there, they need to attract insurers. But we take that into consideration when we think about our appetite in California. Jay Gelb : One last big picture one, if I could. Evan Greenberg : Does that help you? Jay Gelb : Very much, thank you. There was an announcement yesterday regarding three major companies in terms of trying to tackle their own employee health care cost. Do you any thoughts on that in terms of how perhaps Jeff could address that issue that\u2019s affecting all companies? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I think it\u2019s -- look, I only know and read what you did. I think it\u2019s a very rational and I think it\u2019s a very encouraging move they\u2019re making. First of all between them, they have a cohort of employees of 1 million. So that is a big enough group to truly major difference, and will allow you to craft a more efficient healthcare delivery. And they want to tackle the structural questions of costs related to delivery. And I think that\u2019s -- I applaud what they\u2019re doing. And we don\u2019t have -- we have 15,000 employees roughly in the U.S., we don\u2019t have anywhere near what they have. And I think they\u2019re going to start blazing that trail as great and there\u2019ll be others who will follow and I\u2019m sure in time. But I hope it starts the right kind of movement. We need reform in healthcare. And the cost, I think Mr. [Buffet] said it pretty well, it\u2019s a tapeworm that\u2019s easing way at the economy in the United States. Operator : And next participant is Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : You mentioned the cross-sell efforts. I was wondering if you could give us an update of what those -- how those efforts are going and what you expect for the coming year. Evan Greenberg : Well, I\u2019m not going to tell you about the coming year, because I don\u2019t guide on that. But I\u2019m going to let Paul Krump talk about and reflect on current cross-sell and then John Lupica will add to that. Paul Krump : As Evan mentioned, in the middle market space, we actually had 50% of our new business come from cross-sell. And so those are existing customers where we\u2019re adding additional product to what was so encouraging to me in the fourth quarter was that about a third of that cross-sell came from clients who were only purchasing professional liability lines from us. And we cross sold the package comp and auto to them. And I haven\u2019t seen that happen in years and years to that extent. So that was just incredibly encouraging. On the small side, we are cross-selling all kinds of product to customers that\u2019s being very warmly receives, because there the bulk of our competitors really only sell about product comp in auto. We\u2019re out there selling professional liability alongside of that umbrella, et cetera. We're even doing some cross selling on the personal line side where we're selling small commercial business to people that have in home businesses. So recently had a big win on a very large personal line client who got rejected in the marketplace because one of the spouses was rating Bs and selling honey at local fair, and nobody else could handle it, but Chubb. So very interesting growth story. John Lupica : Let me just add a little more color. And giving you a statistic, I will recall cross sell. We also keep track of something very interesting we call strength of the organization where we've brought the two organizations together gives us more capability. And about 10% of our new business this quarter was a result of our two organizations coming together. And we are two years in and our 48 branch offices really have a familiarity and a comfort level to one another and cross selling and driving our products and specialty services into that organization is as good as it's ever been and we're very optimistic about it in the coming years. Paul Newsome : Second question, a little bit of a follow up from Jay's in terms of lessons learned in the flood business. Do you think that Chubb and the industry can underwrite that if the government went away? And are we clear enough now to be able to underwrite flood? Evan Greenberg : I would say, I'm going to give you an answer. It's something in between. I think we clearly -- the way the NFIP has crafted today, it discourages more private sector participation and the private sector can do much more than it is doing in terms of taking on flood risk. The governments\u2019 role I would suggest would be in two areas, and one of those areas may disappear overtime but in the short in the medium term. Number one, for those who can't afford flood insurance protection, they can't afford to pay for it, but they live in a flood exposed area subsidizing -- that's a social decision, and to subsidize those people because you can't charge an actuarially sound rate. That I see as a role for government. The industry should be charging actuarially sound pricing. Number two there is a tail on flood that goes for a while beyond the industries where with all appetite. And I see the government like TRIA or like in crop insurance playing a role. But I do think that overtime given the global balance sheet and both traditional capital and alternative capital that tail risk overtime could also be displayed -- the private sector could displace the federal loan. Operator : And we will now hear from Ian Gutterman with Balyasny Asset Management. Ian Gutterman : I guess first, Evan, if I can ask about capital. If I take in sense this year around number $5 billion this year, you can certainly do a lot better than $100 million something of repurchase if you wanted to. I know you\u2019re not going to talk directly about M&A. But can you just give us some sort of sense of how to think about how you might deploy earnings over the next say two, three years as far as -- is there a target mix in your head or are we back to pre-acquisition thinking on buyback. Just how should we think about all that? Evan Greenberg : We will build capital flexibility that is a priority for this organization. I think we can generate greater returns to shareholders overtime by building -- by retaining capital, building capital flexibility and deploying it and various strategies and in areas for growth. This is a growth company. We measure growth primarily by growth and book value. To the extent that we generate capital that is in excess of the capital flexibility, we need to execute those strategies. We will do what we have a long history of doing. We will return it to shareholders through dividends and other capital management strategies, such as buyback. That\u2019s about it. So I hope that gives you a sentiment. And I\u2019m not going to put any more specifics. Ian Gutterman : Maybe if I can ask a slightly different way. Is certainly before the acquisition, there were a lot of questions about you having people wondering about and you guys having a more than normal amount of excess capital. And clearly after the deal, you had been below your probably target for capital for a little while as you rebuild. Are we back to neutral now or do you think you\u2019re still building back to the cushion you would like to have or maybe we\u2019re over that cushion? Just some sense of where the starting point is. Evan Greenberg : Ian, we\u2019ve built it. And understand that we just paid out a couple of billion dollars in cat losses here. We incurred a couple of billion -- actually a few billion, not a couple. Ian Gutterman : On tax, I guess, I wanted to try that the previous question from someone else a little bit somebody as well. Evan Greenberg : I know you\u2019re going to scratch on a subject that -- you\u2019re going to scratch on the door we aren\u2019t going to open it, but go ahead. Ian Gutterman : I guess what surprised me about \u201813 to \u201915 is I just go around the world in my head about what countries you\u2019re big in. And I think most of those that having at least of 20% tax rate other than Bermuda obviously and Switzerland, which you don\u2019t -- I don\u2019t think write that much direct businesses anymore, as a proportion any way. So I guess I\u2019m struggling to figure out if it\u2019s harder to do intercompany quota shares where -- why the tax rate went down from tax reform. I understand the U.S. rate went down, but I would have thought some of the inter-company stuff had to go up. Evan Greenberg : Ian in the balance, the U.S. rate reduction if you look at puts and calls as you\u2019re imagining, we\u2019re not going to give you the details at all of puts and calls. But if you look at the puts and calls, the reduction in the U.S. tax rate more than offset the negatives of reduction in affiliate. And by the way intercompany debt or any of the announcements you want to add in there. Ian Gutterman : And then just last one is I was wondering if you can\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I can just tell you that I trust our finance department, that all of them have done -- that the math is right, external and internal\u2026 Ian Gutterman : I just was trying to get my head around it, but\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Yes, I got that\u2026 Ian Gutterman : I was wondering if you talk a little about the outlook in Mexico, since we don\u2019t talk about that maybe as much as some of the other ones. But I know it sounds good business for you guys. And just the outlook given A, we have an election that sounds like it may go in a way that's not market friendly, and B, if the math that goes in a bad way, does that matter for the business or is it really much more orient towards domestic activity than trade. Just what things matter in Mexico going forward? Evan Greenberg : The health of the Mexican economy and that is able to continue to grow ex the energy sector as it is and in fact accelerate. NAFTA has been a great contributor to that. And Mexico is so integrated of independent on the U.S. economy. So on one hand as the U.S. economy improves so does the Mexican economy, because we are so intertwined that way. On the other hand, the NAFTA -- and NAFTA has created an environment of certainty and predictability and encourage greater investment cross-border. The NAFTA negotiations going on today and the way they're occurring and how long they are taking, creates an environment of uncertainty on the other hand and that -- potentially, it hasn't shown up yet creates the risk of instability. You said it on the political, there is the possibility of the elections results moving in a populous direction that could be more anti-foreign. And that would be bad for Mexico it would be bad for the United States. It could damage the growth of the Mexican economy. Our business is very focused on the domestic and the growth of the domestic economy. We ensure consumers and small and mid-size businesses and we ensure large Mexican corporations and multinationals doing business there. But the predominance of our business is consumer and small business oriented, which is very domestically focused. And so the health of that business and the continued growth of that and we are growing double digit in Mexico, and we are -- and it is a very -- with very stable returns. And we are investing in Mexico and we are bullish about the future of that country. And if there is in any rational world NAFTA will be concluded and we will deepen the integration in North America and I hope that rational world prevails. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Cohen with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Jay Cohen : Most of my questions were answered, just one other topic I love you to comment on. The investigations going on now into the brokerage business in the London market. Evan, do you see a role for regulators to play in that market and the distribution side? Evan Greenberg : What do you mean by role for the regulators play? It is a regulated industry. And the regulator always has a role to play in ensuring that regulation, both the weather and spirit of what it intends, is properly adhered to. And I think that\u2019s what their investigation is about. But I don\u2019t know a lot. I got to be honest with you, I don\u2019t know a lot, because we\u2019re just -- it\u2019s not focused on us and we\u2019re just not really involved in any material way. Jay Cohen : I guess the question was, do you think the regulators should be more involved with what\u2019s going on there and take may be a slightly more of the heavy handed approach given some of the changes in that market? Evan Greenberg : I am more in favor, I\u2019m always in favor of the private sector for leasing its own behavior, and to behave in what is the interest of a healthy marketplace, and that not over the line on regulators to perform that role. But where market participants and the private sector fails to address issues that may exists and I\u2019m not just going to sit here and speculate further about that, but issues that they exists in practices then it requires regulator to get involved. Now, do those exists or not, I can\u2019t really -- Jay, I\u2019m not in a position to really say. Operator : And we will now go to Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Couple of questions for you Evan, the first one just back on tax reform and maybe implications on lines of business, and the agriculture business. Would you think that maybe there is some pressure on reimbursement rates or stuff as a result of tax reform? Evan Greenberg : I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not going to speculate about that. The only thing I know is crop insurance is just so core to the U.S. farmers when they look at a farmville what\u2019s the most important thing to them, and it is the stability of crop insurance. Because what that does to give them predictability and support as they do their business and face the vagaries of weather. But I\u2019m not going to speculate on that. Brian Meredith : And my second question, Evan, is it possible to give us broadly kind of what the potential revenue opportunity is from the PICC relationship over the next five years? I know it\u2019s 10-year agreement? And also on that topic, what impacted all does it have on your [white tie] ownership? Evan Greenberg : It has zero impact on our [white tie] ownership for our 100% owned Chubb operations in China. And as far as revenue goes, it depends on how we each execute and how well we execute, and it requires both of us in that execution and to do it well. But I think the revenue opportunity is reasonably significant, I don't want to put a dollar amount on it, but it's significant when you start thinking about Chinese Multinational exposure and how that's growing and how it will continue to grow in the years to come. And the need to ensure them and think about PICC as an SOE, State Owned Enterprise, and you think about how many of their clients and how many of the Chinese multinationals to be doing our SOEs. And that is an ecosystem on to itself. And this between us gives us access and an ability to serve that ecosystem. Operator : And our next question comes from Josh Shanker with Deutsche Bank. Josh Shanker : Just I'm wondering if you could add any color on to what we're doing about the winter wheat harvest, and then are these significant drought like conditions and what that means for the agricultural business? And two given the big reserve release versus intra-year reserve change in the fourth quarter in crop. Is that a behavior on how you reserve for the business. Should we expect you be extremely conservative in the first half of the year and then true it up in the back half of the year? Evan Greenberg : First of all, we're not in the winter wheat harvest season. We're in the winter\u2026 Josh Shanker : It\u2019s the planting, I guess\u2026 Evan Greenberg : We're not in the planting season either we're in the growing season for winter wheat. So we'll start with that. Number two -- and so those are important distinctions. Number two, the draught conditions very spotty, we don't -- there is nothing we see at this moment that gives us concern with winter wheat. So I'll start with that. Number two, we have not changed any of our reserving practices around crop, and we use a historic loss ratio as we have said in the past, we say historic loss ratio. When we start a season, have no idea how it's going to play out and you never know till the fall, so you can't really move unless you have really some kind of early very clear data of significance. You can't really move off of the average until you have real clear knowledge of the present. And that doesn't occur until the fourth quarter. Josh Shanker : And the weather has not changed, but does that mean we should expect the fourth quarter in most years is going to look very different from the other three quarters? Evan Greenberg : Just look back on the years, and you\u2019ve answered your own question. Helen Wilson : Thank you. That's all the time we have today to take your questions. Thank you for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : And once again, that does conclude our call for today. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Good morning. We reported first quarter operating income of $2.34 per share, down about 5.5% from prior year. Our results were impacted by natural catastrophe losses, which were up $175 million pre-tax over prior. CATs in the quarter were concentrated in two geographic regions where we're strong. Montecito, California, an affluent community with the mudslides, and the Northeast with the winter storms. CATs aside, we had an excellent quarter, highlighted by world-class underwriting performance, strong net investment income results and good premium revenue growth in many of our businesses, particularly in the U.S. and a number of important classes, while at the same time achieving improved rate increases. Core operating income excluding CATs in prior period reserve development was $2.63 per share versus $2.50 prior year, up over 5%. Book and tangible book value were up slightly in the quarter since we were impacted by the mark from a rise in interest rates. That's actually a good thing, since it speaks to improved future investment income earning power. Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 8.7% or 9.7% with an expected level of CATs. We reported a P&C combined ratio of 90.1%, which included 5.8 points of CATs. On a current accident year basis, excluding catastrophes, the P&C combined ratio was 87.6% and an improvement over prior year. For your information, the current accident year combined ratio with an expected level of CATs, my preferred measure, was 90.7% versus 91.2% prior year. Net investment income was $877 million, up 5% over prior year. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, the catastrophes and prior period development. Turning to market conditions in the quarter, commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote continued to improve in the U.S. and most territories outside the U.S. At the same time, our renewal retention rates overall were good and new business, particularly in the U.S., was up. In some classes, customer segments and territory, we are seeing a clear direction and momentum in price firming. In others, it's more chaotic, as some companies, particularly those with experience in a class, moved for needed rate, while others less experienced were simply lacking leadership moved for growth at the expense of rate adequacy, a short-term strategy. Given the variability in rates by customer segment and territory, and to give you greater clarity into current market conditions, I'm going to provide a fair amount of pricing detail by our five major lines of business. P&C net premium revenue growth for the company was 5.8% for the quarter or 3.5% in constant dollars. And given all I know, I fully expect that growth rate to continue to improve, particularly outside the U.S., as the year goes along. In our U.S. major account retail and E&S wholesale division, what we call Major Accounts and Specialty, P&C net written premiums were up 3.5%. Excluding merger-related actions, net premiums were up 6%. As I noted last quarter, merger-related actions are now almost all behind us and of the $150 million we will take this year, $48 million, or over 30% occurred in the first quarter. For major accounts, our renewal retention in the quarter was 95%. New business in major accounts was up 14%. Let me give you some examples of both rate and its movement during the quarter in Major and Specialty. Again, for the business we wrote in major accounts, rates overall were up 1.9% for the quarter, double what we achieved in the fourth quarter, and by March, they were up 4%. Property rates were up 13% in the quarter, casualty rates and risk management primary casualty were up 1.5%, while in general and specialty casualty, rates were up over 3%, both the best in some time. In the quarter, rates for major accounts professional lines overall turned positive, the first time in some time, with primary and first access D&O rates up 2.3%; not what we want, but a move in the right direction. In E&S wholesale, rates overall were up 5% for the quarter and improving to 6% in March. Property rates were up 8% in the quarter. Casualty was up 4% and financial lines rates were up 2.5%. Now let's turn to our middle market business where P&C net written premiums were up 3.5% and financial lines premiums were down 0.5%. Overall renewal retention was 88% and new business growth for our middle market business was up 6%. Middle market P&C rates overall excluding comp were up 1%, and exposure growth added an additional 1%, the best in a number of quarters. Property was up 1%, casualty related was up 2% and package was flat. Comp rates were down about 4.5 points, while comp-related exposure was up about 3. So net pricing for middle market comp was down about 1.5. Middle market professional lines rates were up with public D&O up 6% and private, not-for-profit D&O up 1%. In middle market overall, rates in March were the strongest of the quarter in virtually every line. In our North America personal lines business, net written premiums were up 6.5% in the quarter. Rates were up 2.5%, the strongest increase in many quarters. Exposure change added an additional 3.5%. Retention remained very strong at 96.5% and we are achieving a better mix of business in personal lines, with new business and renewals skewing towards true high net worth as opposed to mass affluent. Now, turning to our Overseas General Insurance operations, net written premiums for our international retail P&C were up 8.5% or 2% in constant dollars. We fully expect growth will meaningfully accelerate from the second quarter onward. Asia-Pacific and Latin America grew 10% and 4%, respectively in the quarter, while the Continent was down 2.5% and UK was up 1.5%, all in constant dollar. In international retail, rates varied by line and region and by country within region. Overall, rates were up 1%; while not stellar, the best we've seen in a few years. Property rates were up 3% and varied between up 12% in Latin America to down 2% in the UK. Financial lines rates were up 1%, ranging between up 4% in the UK and Asia to flat on the Continent and in Latin America. Casualty rates were flat and marine was down, though it varied between up 8% in the UK to down 3% in Asia. Of the major markets in the world overall, the market that remains most disappointing is the UK in both wholesale and retail, with the exception of D&O, which is beginning to firm like it is in the U.S., Australia and a few other markets. Our global A&H business had a good quarter with net premiums up 8%, driven by our international business, which was up about 12% or almost 6% followed \u2013 in constant dollar followed by our combined insurance business in North America, which was up 8%. Meanwhile in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums and deposits were up 17% in the quarter. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. In the quarter, we announced a distribution partnership with Singapore-based Grab, the leading on-demand transportation company in Southeast Asia, with operations in 8 countries. This is another example of Chubb's efforts to advance our distribution capabilities. In closing, we're off to a very good start to the year. Our heavier CATs, catastrophe activity impacted our financial results, it's the business we're in and they have not slowed down our operational or strategic progress. We achieved better pricing and growth momentum is building in a number of important businesses. Our people are 100% focused on what we do best; underwriting, marketing, selling and servicing. Beyond our hallmark as an underwriting company, we are first in the service business and our brand is all about providing exceptional service. In that regard, in case you didn't see it, J.D. Power recently ranked Chubb number two in overall customer satisfaction for homeowners' property claims behind Amica Mutual. National Underwriter in its nationwide Risk Manager Choice Award awarded Chubb top honors as the best commercial insurance provider. Chubb was also ranked number one in commercial claims satisfaction by brokers and risk managers according to Advisen. We are grateful for the votes of confidence from our customers and distribution partners. And with that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then, we'll be back to take your questions. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong, with total capital of $66 billion. Our portfolio of cash and high-quality investments totaled $104 billion and we have capital generating power. As I'm sure Evan will tell you, we are retaining capital for risk and flexibility for future opportunities and we are extremely patient. Overall, liquidity is excellent and even with the negative portfolio mark-to-market in the quarter caused by rising interest rates, we remain in an unrealized gain position. In 2018 to date, S&P and Fitch have affirmed our group ratings with stable outlooks, and Moody's has affirmed these ratings with a positive outlook. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $332 million to shareholders in the form of dividends and paid off $300 million of debt that matured in March. We also issued $2.2 billion of debt in the European market that was used to redeem the $1 billion of floating rate hybrid securities on April 6 and we're going to repay at maturity senior debt, totaling $1.2 billion due through 2019. Net investment income for the quarter was $877 million, which was just over the top of the expected range due to increased call activity in the company's corporate bond portfolio. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate is now in the range of $875 million to $885 million, with a continuing upward trajectory throughout the year. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $550 million, which included over $500 million of catastrophe loss payments. Operating cash flow together with the proceeds from our $2.2 billion debt offering will help support the growth in investment income. Book and tangible book value per share remained essentially unchanged from last quarter as core operating income and the positive impact of foreign exchange were offset by the net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter of $586 million after tax. This amount includes an unrealized loss of $988 million from the investment portfolio due to rising interest rates, partially offset by a $310 million gain from FX and a $60 million mark-to-market gain on our VA portfolio. Pre-tax net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $380 million, as previously announced, and are further detailed in our financial supplement. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $209 million pre-tax or $166 million after tax. This included $106 million pre-tax favorable development related to the 2017 CAT events and $76 million pre-tax favorable development related to the 2017 crop year loss estimates. Our net loss reserves are in good shape and reflect our conservative reserving philosophy of reacting early to bad news and waiting to reflect good news on long tail lines until we are comfortable that the accident period has sufficiently matured. Net loss reserves were flat in the quarter and decreased by $300 million on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of the favorable prior period development and a high level of catastrophe and crop insurance payments in the quarter. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 103% in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, the ratio was 91%. Other operating expense improved $9 million from the prior year, primarily due to higher than expected income from our equity method investments that are included in core operating income. Adjusted interest expense was $169 million pre-tax in the quarter. Factoring in the new year (00:17:39) debt issued in March and the repayment of the $1 billion hybrids in April, we expect our quarterly adjusted interest expense to be approximately $165 million pre-tax per quarter for the remainder of the year. The 2017 tax reform act favorably impacted the expected range of our annual tax rate by 3 points. Our current estimate remains in the range of 13% to 15%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 12%, which was lower than our expected range, primarily due to the level of U.S. catastrophe events in the quarter. I'll turn the call back to Helen. Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : And we'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. My first question, Evan, I appreciate all the disclosure in terms of the pricing environment. As you think out from here, if we see a combination of higher interest rates and if reinsurance rates start to go down at the upcoming mid-year renewal, do you think, in your mind, can the upward momentum continue in the primary insurance market? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: I don't see the change in interest rates. Those will all take time to earn in and make any kind of meaningful difference. So imagine the duration of invested asset when you think about rise in interest rates and how it \u2013 and the time it takes to cast a meaningful shadow on investment income. So I don't see that. Secondly, the yield curve and interest rates starts speaking about inflation, so I keep that in mind. So, no, I don't see that. And in reinsurance, I think you're more thinking about CAT related, which is only a fraction of the reinsurance market, that everyone just remains obsessed about. And you've got to note that the balance of reinsurance, particularity in casualty-related, it didn't have a lot of firming to it, but it had some firming to it. And I don't see the mid-year as the big date for casualty-related reinsurance anyway. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And in your annual letter, you highlighted and spoke about the progress that you guys are making in building out your small commercial initiatives. Can you just provide us an update on where you sit today, where you see that business going? And as you guys think about potential acquisitions and deals that you might do, is this something that you see yourselves potentially building out those efforts via a deal or is the goal just continue to build that business organically? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, at this time, I just see us continuing to build that business organically. We are an extremely large player in middle market, particularly in the United States, where we're a leader in that business. We're in the top three. And that is, we have all the parts and pieces, and in fact, more than most any other company does. And it is simply in the execution of that, and we're on track as we see growth in that. And then, our small commercial activities in the U.S., on the back of our strong agency distribution and branch network, the technology we've built and are deploying, and the underwriting insights that particularly we gain out of that middle market book of business we've got and all the product we filed and put in place, that business, even though you win it, $1,500 a customer, is growing robustly, and I'm confident that that will cast a meaningful shadow over time on the company's results. And the same goes internationally. In selected markets throughout Asia and Latin America in particular, though beginning to occur in Europe, we've used the knowledge that we have within the organization, particularly gained through the merger, along with the presence, the strong presence we have around the world, and we are building distribution, and we are building product, and we are actively growing, and I got to tell you, one of the growth areas in international, major growth areas for us, along with A&H and consumer lines, is our middle market and small commercial business internationally. And we've already got a meaningful book and it's growing, and that business is robust. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you and one last question. You guys didn't buy back any stock in the quarter. The stock was obviously a bit cheaper than in the fourth quarter. Could you just update us on your view on buybacks and why you chose not to repurchase any stock in the first quarter? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You've mentioned sort of acquisitions and you've mentioned capital and buyback, and so why don't I glue all that together for you and kind of give one clear thought that maybe is on people's minds right now. Look, we are patient long-term builders and investors. Money does not burn a hole in our pocket and we retain capital for growth and risk. We've bought back now and again. But as you also noted in the shareholder letter and what we showed investors last fall, look at the return we achieved by deploying our capital intelligently for growth, organically and through acquisition, versus a look back if we had used it for buybacks. It created far greater value. And I go a step further. Like many other asset classes, P&C assets are currently pricey, and at current prices don't generally make a lot of sense. Prices paid for recent transactions may make sense to others, but they don't for us. As we've said, any transaction that we do must advance strategy in what we are doing already organically, while creating a good risk-adjusted return to shareholders, and I think our track record over the last 14 years speaks for itself in that regard. So, again, we'll have capital flexibility, but we're patient and we'll wait for a different period. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : And we will take our next question from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. I was hoping you could kind of address a big picture ROE question. I would imagine that at some point you'd like to have a very solidly double-digit ROE again. And I was wondering what you think are the \u2013 what is sort of the road map to get there over time for Chubb, given its current position and the current market environment. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Paul, I think you have to take a kind of picture view of this. First of all, on a normalized basis, we ran about a 9.7% ROE, surplus capital right now, scrubs about three quarters of a point off our ROE. So we're in double-digit on a deployed capital. Remember, if you \u2013 particularly when we did the acquisition, we have more goodwill on our balance sheet, that is income-producing asset, and that'll lower the ROE a little bit, and on a tangible basis, it accelerates, grows much more quickly. So I think you got to keep that in mind. Number two, we told you before what 100 basis points of investment income improvement in the invested asset rate does for the company. It lifts the ROE 100 to 200 basis points. So you got to keep that in mind. And I'll stop right there. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : No, those are good pieces. I'm not criticizing the current ROE. I just figure there's probably a greater ambition in the future, but thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We are ambitious. Operator : And we will take our next question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you and good morning. So, I have a question. My first question is on the margin, underlying margin in North America and personal line. If you see other major segments, have seen improvements year-over-year, North America in personal line deteriorated about 140 basis points. What's the reason behind that? Any sort of non-CAT weather behind it? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We're going to ask Paul Krump to take a shot at that. He manages that business, reports to it. Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Morning, Kai. Thanks for the question. Yeah, just to level set for the other listeners, the personal lines current accident year loss ratio excluding CATs was 53.3% in Q1. That was up slightly from 52.4% in Q1 of last year. What we experienced here in the past quarter was moderately elevated losses over expected resulting from, number one, random larger fires, but then as you say, Kai, we experienced some elevated non-CAT weather. That's really mainly water coming from burst pipes just from the cold and then a lot of downed trees that type of thing on homes and busted windows and that type of \u2013 roofs and that type of thing. So, that's really what's driving it. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Could you quantify that impact? Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Well, I did. Yeah. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. All right. So my second question... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Kai, that was the increase in the loss ratio. Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, right there. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: That's all of that, right? I just wonder is there underlying factors between pricing and the loss ratio. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You've got to put fire and water. I mean, there was no pestilence or vermin. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: All right, got it. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: (00:30:12) sometimes it's pretty simple. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Sure. Then my second question is on the loss trends and reserves. So, weather (00:30:19) trends you're seeing in the U.S. casualty lines? And if you look at your Schedule T data, it shows that your accident year loss ratio are all higher than the initial PICC in recent years. What's driving that development? And also, in 2017, if you look at the accident year loss ratio for the other liability claims made, lines, those are lower than your initial and current PICC for the 2016, like a loss PICC. So, Evan, you talked about it in your annual letter that \u2013 you talk a lot about the rising frequency of class action suits. So, why is that 2017 PICC actually improved from the prior year? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Mouthful. You've thought about this one and we're really ready for it, Kai. I'm going to ask Paul O'Connell, our Chief Actuary to take a whack at this. Paul? Paul O\u2019Connell - Chubb Ltd.: Okay. Thank you, Kai. First, I'm sure you're aware of the limitations of using Schedule T data for reserve analysis, especially for long-tail lines like other liability. The experiences is aggregated. It's an aggregation of many different product lines with different underlying characteristics, including development pattern. With respect to our recent accident year development, we analyze our reserves at a very granular level, well below the Schedule T product line. When you get down to that low level of detail, it's not surprising to see higher than expected reported losses in select portfolios early in the life of an accident year. As Phil stated in his commentary, for the most part, we react to bad news quickly and are patient and wait to react to good news only when we believe the accident year is sufficiently mature for the results to be credible. So that's what you're seeing in these product lines. Specifically, with respect to the 2017 accident year for other liability claims made, the improvement in our loss ratio is due to underwriting actions on our part. Our portfolio management has led to a shift in mix among product lines, and within a product line a shift in classes of business. So that's really what's driving it. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Evan, could you comment further on the sort of like the class action litigation suits and what's the loss cost trend there? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: To maybe give you a little \u2013 yeah, we'll comment on that, but maybe to put it in perspective in professional lines for us. And then, if not satisfied, I'll go back and embellish on it. But I'm going to ask John Keogh to maybe comment on that a little bit for you. John W. Keogh - Chubb Ltd.: Sure. Good morning, Kai. I think the first point I'd make, when you look at other claims made in liability, I think people sometimes go right to D&O as a proxy for that. There's a lot of business that makes up our financial lines book around the globe that's claims made. So, besides the fact that we have a large diversified business around the globe of D&O coverages, whether they're publicly traded, or private, or not-for-profit, that business also includes all sorts of lines of D&O coverages for our various services throughout the world, fidelity coverages, fiduciary and pension trust liability, employment practices liability, and a growing book of cyber-related coverages. And all of that is done in this big market with different at any moment in time loss cost patterns. So let me just level set from that point of view. And as you can imagine, the way we run our business and the way we manage it is really dozens of very unique portfolios of this business that we have around the globe, where there's very granular underwriting analysis, underwriting results that we track, very distinct loss development, and we also look at the reserve adequacy of all these portfolios in a very unique way. So, overall, when we look at that book of business around the globe, we feel pretty good that that business is running and performing adequately, and it's a very large and important book of business to us. However, I think to your question and to Evan's comments in his shareholder letter, that's really about some distinct areas of this portfolio, particularly in the D&O lines of business, where we are seeing some pressure, where loss costs in our opinion really are outpacing rates. And specifically, there I'd like to narrow it down to our D&O coverages for publicly traded businesses in North America, publicly traded businesses in the UK, and publicly traded business in Australia. I'd also add to that when you look at our financial institutions business and the challenges that banks and financial institutions have in terms of the regulatory and compliance environment around the globe, loss cost there are concerns to us. So I think if anything there, the underwriting actions that we need to take and the loss cost that we're observing and the rates that we need, we're pretty clear-eyed about what we need to do. Is it impacting us? Yeah, it's impacting us in our ability to grow that business. And in fact, if you look at that business in many parts of the portfolios I just mentioned, we're actually having to shrink the business because our \u2013 at least our perspective on the rate need that we have to get on that business isn't matching what others are willing to do. So, if anything, it's really been the challenge for us in terms of growing the business. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay, great. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: I'm going to add one more thing to that specifically and that is the external environment. The external environment in some jurisdictions, and I'll take the United States, is growing more difficult, a number of merger-related suits, either overpaid or didn't pay enough. Every single one has \u2013 or almost all have a suit attached to it and the money is going to lawyers. It's not going to shareholders. In many cases, there's no money involved. You look at \u2013 hashtag me, too, right now, and the growth and related suits from that, litigation funding is a growing trend and not simply for those who can't afford suits but as a class of investment. More law firms creating and chasing opportunity in the litigation space around securities related and spinning new theories. And so many of these, when you look at the size of companies and their balance sheets and you look at the size of transactions, mergers related, et cetera, the dollar values are so great that to get rid of the suits, these are nuisance suits in so many cases, and to get rid of them and rather than have to dwell on them or have them stand in the way of completing transactions, it's viewed by many corporations as nuisance money, and by the way, the legal profession knows that. And so, they know that there's a tax they can employ and that the rate of tax, if it's not too great, they can have large frequency of it and just control that severity and make a boatload of money. And that is a problem, a growing problem in this country. Thank you for the question. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much for all the answers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis of Autonomous. Please go ahead. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. I guess I wanted to take it a little bit of a different direction, but I thought the discussion in the annual letter was pretty interesting about the increase and the difficulty with dealing with non-modeled losses from a CAT standpoint. I guess looking at your expected level of CAT disclosure, I was just curious how are you thinking about the whole non-modeled angle with CATs and actually trying to project what you think you're expected level of CATs are? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, I got to tell you, in your expected level of CATs, it's virtually your modeled level of CATs. I mean, that's what you can project. When we build our loss costs, we look at historic losses. And so when we build our rates, we build them off of our experience, which is \u2013 includes CATs, whether they were modeled or non-modeled, whether they are a CAT weather event or a non-CAT weather event because it doesn't rise the PCS's level to be named a CAT. It includes all non-weather and CAT related, so it includes all of your loss cost when you project, so you don't distinguish that way. So the first thing is, that's how you think about it for rate, which I think is the most fundamental and important thing to think about. But separately, when we tend to \u2013 again, just reiterate, when we give you and \u2013 or when I think about expected CAT, it's the best I can do. It's what's expected. And so you can only take it out of your aggregation of exposure in areas that are exposed to catastrophes that have models around them and you can project the number. That's about it. Better than what you can \u2013 better than excluding CAT that's for sure where you leave the freaking revenue in the denominator, take the losses out of the numerator and therefore, boy, you look like a hero, when you're just writing a tremendous amount of CAT-exposed business and you use it to subsidize the rest of your book. That's where I take exception, pretty much (00:41:16) Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Yeah, no, understood. So, at least it sounds like in that expected CAT number, you're taking a stab at other perils like wildfire and flood, right? Even if it's difficult to model, you're still thinking about that when you come up with that expected CAT level? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. And look, we're better at managing flood model today than we were a couple of years ago. You can't model though convective storms. So you can't model a tornado when that's going to occur or how it's going to occur, but our expected level of CAT, by the way, for a period does include spring storms for the spring. I just can't tell you where exactly. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Fair enough. And then, shifting gears to actually personal lines. Obviously, we spend a lot of time talking about rate adequacy and commercial, and I guess, CATs there as well, but I guess as bigger picture, do we like the rate adequacy right now in the personal lines business? It's, I guess, just somewhere just below an 80% ex-CAT accident year combined. Is there a view that there's more \u2013 is that pricing adequate just given your view of normal catastrophe activity? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Ryan, that's a good question. Look, I would say our personal lines overall, we are \u2013 the pricing is adequate to us, and ex-auto and then with Auto. It varies by state and it varies by coverage, the adequacy. And so you've got to stay on top of this. You have to keep driving for rate or you get behind, particularly where you may not have the adequacy you want. And then, I would say it further breaks down within a state of CAT exposed versus less CAT exposed, whether you're getting enough load or not, and we're very mindful of all of that when we go for growth because we want \u2013 and maintain exposure because we want and expect adequacy. Loss cost in homeowners is not insignificant. There is an inflation in homeowners and you have to stay on top of that. In addition to rate you get an exposure adjustment with customers and unless you can control those loss costs by helping them with things like water shut off valves when pipes are breaking a lot and help them contain their loss that way, which we're driving to do to teach customers to lower their loss costs. Barring that, you've got to stay on top of it with exposure adjustment in addition to rate to maintain the overall adequacy that we have. So this is a work-intensive business that can get away from you if you don't stay on it. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : That's very thorough and helpful. Thanks so much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Meyer Shields from KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. I wanted to dig a little deeper, if I can, on the related topics of excess capital and the M&A environment. So Evan, you've given us some helpful indications of excess capital and wondering whether that \u2013 or how that takes into account past and potential future marks from rising interest rates. And then, looking forward to the M&A environment, when you talk about P&C assets being pricey, how does that factor in the potential upside to acquisitions from rising interest rates? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: How does that \u2013 say that last part again? Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: How does the pricey-ness consider the upside to potential acquisitions from their own uptick in investment income if interest rates rise? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No. We're \u2013 that's allowing the tip of the tail to wag the dog. I don't \u2013 they don't, really. Sure, we model it in, but that has a modest impact. That's an easy one for me. We're not going to over-intellectualize and try to rationalize to ourselves around here why it makes sense to pay for an acquisition that's overpriced. Just isn't going to happen. And by the way, I do notice how the more recent have gone and people are talking like it's okay, prices to book that are above what ACE paid for Chubb. Wow, let's compare the quality of assets. Now, we're at that time in the cycle. We're happy at rest. I'm going to let Phil answer that other. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Meyer, when we think about undeployed capital, we don't consider unrealized gains or losses. If we have unrealized gains and losses, we assume we'll hold the assets and they'll amortize back to par at maturity. And if we have an unrealized gain, we don't count that as something we can spend because it would be requiring us to liquidate our portfolios around the world, and we just wouldn't do that. So the calculation of undeployed capital that Evan mentioned takes about 70 basis points off of the ROE as calculated without unrealized gains and losses. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, fantastic. Thank you very much. Operator : And we will take our next question from Jay Gelb from Barclays. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. At risk of pushing my luck, I wanted to close the loop on the M&A discussion. And given Chubb's success in integrating and acquiring legacy Chubb, which is the largest deal in P&C, can you give us your perspective on whether Chubb is ready for another large acquisition? I mean, I know you mentioned pricing and things like \u2013 valuations and things like that. But operationally, is Chubb ready for another large deal? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Chubb is ready, but that hardly \u2013 A, it's ready, B, it's hardly my priority to distract the organization from doing what it's doing best, focused on executing and recognizing the potential that resides within all the parts and pieces that we have. And if this organization never does another acquisition, which is how we get up every morning to do business, that's how we imagine, the opportunity in front of our face is simply awesome, and it's just patience and time and execution, and that this organization is 100% focused on it, and that I can see and feel as I move around just the momentum building as people are just getting after it, it's energizing. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's very helpful. Separate question. It would be helpful to get your perspective on the Lloyds market, after that, that market had a pretty challenging year in 2017, including the major catastrophe events. What's your perspective on Lloyds and how is Chubb approaching that important marketplace? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. We've just through rational \u2013 because of rational underwriting and given our ability to trap the business locally and not have to wait for it to come to London, we've, over the last number of years, shrunk our presence in the London market. Can't earn an adequate return. To a large degree, a lot of the underwriters at London and in Lloyds, it's like a barroom with a bunch of drunks who want to reform and they just can't put that glass down and push away from the bar. And you hear all the talk and all the chatter, and it's in their hands to get out of their own way and do the most fundamental, underwrite the business to an adequate risk adjusted return and deploy the capital on that basis. And the notion that you have investors and that we can all opine about that will trade 3% money for a 6% return or thereabouts, that's a lousy risk-adjusted return, and ultimately is not a long-term investment thesis, period. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Crystal clear. Thanks, Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Brian Meredith of UBS. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah, thanks. Two questions here. First, Evan, you talked a lot about professional liability. I'm wondering if we could chat a little about some of the other lines. Where are we right now with respect to rate adequacy, given your large commercial E&S, and maybe your standard commercial? So, pricing that you're getting right now versus the loss cost inflation trends? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. I would say, listen, in our middle market \u2013 in our businesses, fundamentally, most all of our businesses, we're achieving a rate adequacy. Some have better adequacy than others. We have \u2013 our businesses are earning an underwriting profit. Some in our judgment ought to be earning a bit better underwriting margin and profit, and we need rate to keep it from eroding. But, overall, look, you see the numbers we're putting up, not in bad shape and reserve adequacy is there. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : So what you're implying here is that your rate you're achieving is in line with trend at this point? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: It is in a lot of classes. It's not in all classes. There's certain classes of casualty, particularly in the larger risk business where rate is not keeping pace, but we've been taking a lot of portfolio and underwriting actions to have to mitigate. And that's where you see any penalties we might pay in growth. By the way, when you look at an improvement in our loss ratio, keep in \u2013 that people note for the quarter. And by the way, it's just a quarter. There's some randomness by quarters. But keep in mind, the amount of business we shed in the last two years, it's like $1.5 billion. And when we constantly talk to you about portfolio management and shifting, and when John Keogh just told you about it about professional lines, its portfolio management and risk selection has so much to do with also helping to mitigate the impact of pressure on margin when rate is not adequate in some classes to maintain its level, given loss cost trends. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Great, great. My second question, I want to focus a little bit on the small commercial business. You've built that a lot there. You've got the small commercial marketplace. Where are you with respect to expanding your distribution in that business, putting more agents on the platform? And is there a day in the future here where we could see Chubb basically competing with \u2013 on equal footing with some of the major small commercial carriers out there? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, I'm going to let Paul Krump talk about the distribution. I'm going to tell you, we can go toe-to-toe right now with the major players on an agent by agent basis in small commercial product offering, pricing, servicing and technology. In many cases, we're ahead on the technology front. It's just a matter of now building that portfolio, but we are toe-to-toe. Paul, you want to talk about distribution (00:55:21)? Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, happily. So, thanks, Brian. Just to be very specific to you, right now, we've got 3,000 of our agents engaged on the platform. The platform is called Marketplace. So that's our small business platform where agent CSR can go right in there, write a BOP, work on the comp, the auto, and cross-sell against the financial lines, that kind of thing. So, we've got a couple thousand more agents that we're going to engage and activate. What I'd tell you is very exciting for us right now is that 80% of the business that the CSRs are putting into the Marketplace platform is being handled automatically what's called on the Street on the glass. On the glass means they don't have to pick up the phone and talk to anybody, reach \u2013 can come out of the system, so it's very intuitive system. It's very fun for them to use. The agents really like it. And that's where I think we are really going toe-to-toe with people on the technology side. Comp has picked up very, very nicely as well. So, we are looking at some areas where we think we're underrepresented when it comes to distribution and we're actively engaged in those conversations in those areas and we're open to talking to anybody that wants to bring us good profitable business. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Brian, it comes in very small bites. Again, it takes time. We're patient. We don't expect this business to cast a meaningful shadow on revenue for a period of time. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. I was just wondering about just the challenges in actually getting that distribution, that's always here in that business. You can have the product, but actually getting onto an agent platform is not always that easy. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, as you hear, we're making very substantial progress that way. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Got you. Thank you. Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: And we have time for just one more person to ask question, please. Operator : And we will take our final question from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Please go ahead. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Thank you. I'll cut to the chase, I guess. Evan, if I just follow-up on the reserve question from earlier, I think from Kai. Maybe if I ask it in a broader sense. I mean, I assume you guys look at what other people are doing and it seems like across the industry that people are putting up less IBNR. It seems like cases coming in faster across essentially most of the liability lines, whether it'd be GL, everything but comp basically, right? Do you agree with those observations? And if so, does that inform you of where we are in the underwriting cycle? That it seems like people are sort of being more aggressive and not willing to take their PICCs higher when they probably know they should and maybe that says something about why we're seeing a pickup in chasing rate. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Look, Ian, I can't speak to specific companies. We do observe and study. We're in the middle right now of looking at all the published numbers. So we haven't finished with our own internal views of some of it. What I will say is this, what's natural. Pricing was more robust a number of years ago in those accident years as they were reserved had greater margin of adequacy in them. As trend and rate roll forward, it's pretty simple. There's either \u2013 it'll vary by company. There's either less margin of adequacy or some move to inadequacy. It'll vary by company. And that seems to me to be obvious and we've all been talking about it for a period of time. So, I love you dearly, but I'm a little puzzled by the question like in the sense like, wow, there's some surprise here, going on for a while. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Well, it feels like it got worse, I guess, in the last year or two. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Ian, it just feeds on itself. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Exactly. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: So, sure. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: It's more stressed at the end of 2017 than it was at the end of 2016, than it was at the end of 2015, period. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Right. I guess the reason I say is because if you look at most companies' results other than a few outliers, most companies in their calendar year GAAP results, you wouldn't really be able to tell that, I guess, is kind of the point I'm making. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, some that is that self-graded tests. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Right, exactly. Okay. Exactly. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. I mean that's human nature and that's always been true in this business. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Fair enough. Then just one other - Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: By the lagging nature. And that's just the combination of optimism or ignorance or just plain old short-term cheating. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Exactly. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: So you can collect, check and move along. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : So one other quick one is and I'm sure you'll tell me I'm nitpicking and I probably am, but... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, it's your nature. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : ... the small commercial growth of 2%. I assume you're hoping to do better than that. And I don't know if there is anything unusual in there, maybe underwriting actions or something else. Or is that sort of where you are today and (01:01:39) accelerate that? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No, no, no. There was a quarterly anomaly in that for us. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. I was just making sure. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And we took some action. We have some professional lines business that go to that \u2013 that are in small commercial. And we had some legacy portfolios that have been moved in there and we took action on that. But if you look at the underlying BOP and comp and the P&C business, that actually grew like in a seriously robust way, like in the hundreds of percent growth. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay, that's what I was hoping to hear. Okay, just checking. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Thanks a lot. Helen M. Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC Operator : Good day, and welcome to Chubb Limited Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2018 second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company's performance and growth, pricing and business mix, digital and distribution initiatives and economic and market conditions, all of which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please see our most recent SEC filings, earnings press release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Good morning. Chubb had a very good second quarter with core operating income of $2.68 per share, up over 7% from prior year. Our results were driven by excellent underwriting and investment results. We produced strong premium revenue growth globally with contributions emerging from a number of our growth initiatives. At the same time, rates continued to firm in a number of important property and casualty related product lines. P&C underwriting income of $824 million benefited from contributions from current accident year results, and positive prior-year reserve releases. Both our P&C combined ratio of 88.4% and our current accident year combined, excluding CATs, of 88.1% were excellent. Year-over-year CAT losses were about flat. On the back of strong cash flow, net investment income of $890 million was up 4%. Book and tangible book per share were essentially flat in the quarter, impacted by the mark from a rise in interest rates and foreign exchange. Excluding the impact of interest rate on the mark which, given we're a buy and hold investor, will eventually amortize back to us over approximately a four-year period, book and tangible were up about 0.7% and 2% respectively. Our annualized core operating ROE in the second quarter was 9.8%. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CATs and prior-period development. Turning to growth in market conditions, for the company overall, P&C net premium revenue growth was 5.6% for the quarter, or 6.1% excluding Agriculture, with foreign exchange having a 1.5 point benefit. A number of growth-related initiatives that are only possible because of the capabilities created by today's Chubb contributed to our growth this quarter. And I will elaborate a bit as I go on. Commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote continued to improve in the U.S. and certain territories outside the U.S. In North America, for example, rates overall were up 3% versus 1.9% last quarter and 1% in the fourth quarter. So, the direction of momentum in price firming that we've been seeing now for several quarters continued. At the same time, our renewal retention rates were simply outstanding. In fact, across our entire North America commercial and personal P&C franchise, renewal retention, as measured by premium, was over 95%, recognition of the quality and the compelling nature of Chubb. In our U.S. major account retail and E&S wholesale division, premiums were up almost 4%. Excluding merger-related underwriting actions which are concentrated here, net premiums were up 6%. As I noted last quarter, merger-related actions are now mostly behind us, and of the approximately $150 million, over 60% have already occurred. For major accounts, our renewal retention in the quarter was over 96%, while new business was up 29%. Let me give you some examples of both rate and its movement during the quarter in major accounts. Again, for the business we wrote, rates overall were up 5.2%. That compares to 1.9% for the first quarter and 1% in the fourth quarter. Property rates in major accounts were up 21.5%. Casualty rates in risk management primary casualty were up 1%, while in U.S.-exposed general and specialty casualty, rates were up about 5%. Rates for major account professional lines were up approximately 2% with primary and first excess D&O up 2.6%, so moving in the right direction. For perspective, of our total U.S. professional lines book, which overall runs quite well, 15% represents those areas that are stressed and require corrective actions, which we have been taking, namely, certain areas of public D&O and certain classes of professional liability for financial institutions. The balance, or 85% of the book, runs well. Now, let's turn to our North American middle market and small commercial business, where net premiums were up almost 4.5%, and new business was up 26%, the best growth we've seen from this business since early 2016. In middle market and small commercial, about a quarter of the new business came from growth initiatives put in place since the merger. In middle market premium revenue growth, premium revenue grew about 3.5%. Overall renewal retention was 90%, a full 2 points better than prior quarter. Middle market P&C rates overall, excluding comp, were up 1.7%, and exposure growth added an additional 1.2%. Property rates were up about 1.5%. Casualty-related rates were up about 3%, while package was flat. Comp rates were down 4.1 points, while comp-related exposure was up about 4 points. So, the net impact for middle market comp was essentially flat. Middle market professional lines rates were up with public D&O up 6.3% and private not-for-profit D&O up over 2%. In middle market, rates in the quarter, with the exception of comp, were the strongest we have achieved in several years, continuing a positive trend. Growth in our U.S. small commercial business continued to accelerate in the quarter, albeit from a relatively small base. Net premiums were up 27%. Based on the growth velocity over the last few quarters, we expect this business by year-end to have an annual run rate of over $400 million in premium. Over the next three to five years, it should be in the multi-billion dollar range. And importantly, you wouldn't be seeing that revenue, if it wasn't for today's Chubb. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums were up 6.4% in the quarter. Adjusting for an accounting policy action, growth was closer to 3%. Retention remained very strong at over 96%. We continued to secure a better mix of business in personal lines with new business and renewals skewing towards true high net worth or affluent customers as opposed to the mass affluent, which is our target customer, given the richness of our coverage and services. We are investing to digitally enable the customer service experience in this business. For example, we introduced a mobile app that gives clients access to a variety of digitized services, including insurance ID cards; the ability to contact their agent; notifications that alert them of approaching weather events such as wildfires and hurricanes, so they can take advantage of our prevention and defense services; and an innovative Chubb at the Wheel function that tracks driver behavior and helps clients, particularly teens be better, safer drivers. We're introducing additional functionality to the app every few months and this will become even more exciting over time. Another dimension is our digital marketing to grow our personal lines business by penetrating territories, where we are underrepresented with target customers who are underserviced by mass market carriers. We have digital marketing initiatives underway to attract prospects to Chubb and to independent agents and brokers to help them build their business with leads and improve their service capabilities. These are all good examples of the company investing to distinguish itself in the marketplace. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, net premiums written for our international retail business were up 10.7% or 6% in constant dollars. As I mentioned last quarter, our growth rate outside the U.S. is increasing, and should continue to do so as the year goes along. Asia Pacific and Latin America both grew over 11% in the quarter, with foreign exchange contributing another 3% to 5%, while the Continent was up over 3%, and UK/Ireland was flat. Net premiums for our international middle market and small commercial business, which is a major initiative, given our capabilities today, grew 7% in the quarter in constant dollar on a base that's now about $700 million. Expanded distribution in product, industry expertise and technology capabilities are just some of the complementary strengths that we brought together to grow this business, which is really beginning to take hold and should continue to gain momentum. Growth, in particular, is being driven by our business in Asia and Latin America, the key focus regions for us, where net premiums were up 15% in the quarter. International A&H premiums were up 6.5% in constant dollars, driven by a 11% growth in Asia Pac, while the international personal lines growth was up 10%, driven by a standout performance in Latin America with growth of 25%. Speaking of Latin America, in the quarter, we announced a long-term distribution agreement with Citibanamex, a leading financial institution in Mexico. Under this long-term agreement, together, we will distribute, on an exclusive basis, to their customers, Chubb's non-life insurance products through 1,500 branches in a variety of digital and direct marketing channels. The agreement encompasses a broad variety of personal and commercial P&C coverages for the bank's 12 million individual customers and 400,000 small to medium enterprises. This is another example of an important business partnership made possible because of our growing digital capabilities, which were a key consideration for Citi during their due diligence of us. As for pricing conditions outside the U.S., rates in our international retail and London wholesale businesses varied by line and region, and by country within region. Overall rates were up 4%, property up 8%, financial lines up 6%, and casualty and marine flat. In total, our global A&H business had an excellent quarter with net premiums up nearly 9% or 6.1% in constant dollars. In addition to the strong contribution from international that I just mentioned, A&H net premiums grew about 8.5% in North America. Meanwhile, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums and deposits were up 19% in the quarter, and importantly, earnings grew about 170% to $25 million. John Keogh, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade and Ed Clancy can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends. In closing, we are achieving improved premium revenue growth in many of our businesses around the world. Several of which wouldn't have been possible, but for an organization that was created with so many complementary capabilities, we're continuing to achieve positive rate change momentum in a number of businesses, which is important, so that we are in an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return. Lastly, our digital capabilities are advancing in many corners of the world. We're making steady and substantial progress from signing major distribution agreements to digitally enhancing customer service to reimagining product and customer experience. The scale and the capabilities of Chubb have made our digital efforts, including the level of investment, possible. In sum, our organization is running on all cylinders, and we're optimistic about our ability to continue to perform at a high level. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong, with total capital of $64 billion. Operating cash flow in the quarter was very strong, totaling $1.65 billion. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $663 million to shareholders, including $339 million in dividends and $324 million in share repurchases. Through July 24, we have repurchased $361 million at an average price of about $132 per share. During the quarter, we also redeemed $1 billion of hybrid securities in April, and we repaid $600 million of senior debt that matured in May. Net investment income for the quarter was $890 million, slightly above our expected range due to the higher private equity distributions. Our expected quarterly investment income run rate remains in the range of $875 million to $885 million with an upward trend as the year continues. Book value per share was essentially unchanged and tangible book value per share increased 0.5% in the quarter. Both were negatively impacted by foreign exchange losses and unrealized losses on the investment portfolio caused by rising interest rates. Foreign exchange had a $457 million after-tax negative impact on book value and a $200 million after-tax negative impact on tangible book value. Realized and unrealized losses on the investment portfolio were $407 million after tax. Pre-tax net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $211 million, principally from U.S. weather-related events, and were in line with our expected level for the quarter. We had positive prior period development in the quarter of $191 million pre-tax or $158 million after tax. This included $236 million of pre-tax favorable development, $200 million of which was split approximately 70% from long tail lines, principally for 2014 and prior accident years, and 30% from short tail lines, with another $36 million related to the 2017 CAT events. The favorable development was offset by $45 million of pre-tax adverse development related to our runoff non-A&E casualty exposures, which are included in corporate. Net loss reserves increased about $200 million in the quarter, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 97% in the quarter. Adjusting for PPD, CAT losses and agriculture, the ratio was 91%. Our P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding CATs, increased 60 basis points to 88.1%, due in part to a year-over-year increase in certain large structured transactions in our North America commercial insurance business, which increased the loss ratio 1 percentage point and decreased the expense ratio 70 basis points. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.8%. As a reminder, our annual 13% to 15% range reflects the variability of where catastrophe losses and prior period development occurs. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in the range of 13% to 15%. I'll turn the call back over to Helen. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. Our first question today comes from Kai Pan of Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you very much, and good morning. So, first question on the \u2013 just following up on the professional lines, if my number is correct, you have about 10% overall premiums in U.S. professional surety. You said about 15% in distressed areas, so its overall impact probably is only less than 2% of your portfolio. I just wonder if that math is correct. And how do you feel the overall rising in turmoil, rising social inflation impact your loss PEG, as well as the action you're taking to mitigate them? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, so, Kai, first of all, I'm not sure I quite got everything you said because you said surety, and mentioned surety and profession \u2013 our professional lines book is made up of substantially E&O, D&O, our cyber businesses within there, we have surety. And surety, by the way, is a separate line for us from professional lines, so I don't know what you're mixing together, and so that's \u2013 all that math, we're going to take it offline. When it comes to the question of the \u2013 which I was really making the point that \u2013 I hear all this about other liability claims made and conflating it to D&O. And when we have talked about D&O and \u2013 public D&O and some of the issues around it, what I thought was important was to put it all in perspective for everyone that, number one, the part we're talking about is 15% of our professional lines business. By the way, other liability claims made is made up of a whole lot more than professional lines. We have environmental liability within there, and a number of other lines as well go in there. So, I was really trying to create perspective. On your question, our loss PEGs and our loss ratios that we select, and that we book, they reflect the environment as we see the environment to be. So, if there are trends in the environment around what you're calling social inflation, which is an interesting euphemism to me, all of that is reflected in the loss PEGs that we have right now and in the loss ratios that we book. Our underwriting actions that we have been taking that relate around portfolio management as well as pricing have been underway for some time within that business, and they continue, period. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. I was referring to in the merger, like a slide deck, you combined U.S. professional lines surety as a 10% overall premium. So, you didn't break down what is exactly U.S. professional lines. That's the point I was trying to make. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Surety is not within our professional lines number. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. Then, my second question is on the year-over-year increase about 130 basis points underlying combined ratio in North America commercial P&C, about 70 basis points coming from those large structured transactions. I was hoping you can explain a little bit what are those, and will the impact be like sustainable for the next three more quarters. And also the rest 60 basis point deterioration, what's behind those? Are those non-CAT losses, or other factors? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, the 60 basis points \u2013 I mean, first of all, let me take that part first, and then I want to talk about the \u2013 just a minute. The combined ratio that we run is simply world-class, it's outstanding. And at the same time, you know what the rate environment is, you know what loss cost trends are, and you have a sense of that. And so it's just straight math that we're \u2013 that you have to raise your loss ratios in areas where you're not getting rate and where loss cost trends and loss ratio continues to rise. But the margins are extremely healthy, so when I look at 0.6% in that, I think it's pretty good, especially given the work we do around underwriting, and mix change, and growing other areas more quickly that have an interesting combined ratio signature to them, to mitigate and keep it to a modest level like that. When it comes to the large transaction, let me put this in perspective for everybody. Part of major accounts, which is our risk management business \u2013 within major accounts is our risk management business. We're the largest provider of services to large corporations that self-insure their comp and casualty exposures. We provide substantial risk transfer excess coverages, and all of the services around the self-funded portions. It's a complex and it's a large business. We're the best at it and have been in it for many years. It's a core part of our franchise. By its nature, it has always had elements of lumpiness. Think about it. On one hand, large accounts which renew periodically with large premiums, we have good persistency, but you win some, you lose some now and again. By its nature, accounts also \u2013 this business also has, and these accounts have, one-off transactions. We write these just about every quarter. Some quarters, they're bigger than others. This quarter, we wrote more than usual because of a larger transaction, and that's what we disclosed. And, by the way, we disclosed it only for the purpose of telling you the impact on loss ratio and expense ratio in the quarter. Otherwise, we wouldn't have mentioned it, simply because it's part of what we normally do and write, period. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. Thank you for that. Before I let you go, I just want to say best wishes for Evan for your retirement. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Did you say best wishes for my retirement? Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Not there yet. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: I hope not. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, Kai, you're a good man. Operator : Our next question today comes from Elyse Greenspan of Wells Fargo Securities. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. My first question, I appreciate all the disclosure on the pricing environment. As we think forward from here and in the third quarter, we start to annualize when we really started to see pricing momentum on the commercial lines side next year. I guess I'm just curious for some of your thoughts on, we don't have a large CAT year this year, and in addition, if interest rates continue to rise, do you think that pricing momentum can continue to improve from the improved levels that you guys saw in the second quarter? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Elyse, first of all, pricing didn't begin to move till the fourth quarter. It really wasn't the third quarter. It was very, very modest in the third quarter. It was fourth quarter. So I think that's the first point I'd make. Secondly, look, I'm going to speak in a rational way, and markets aren't always rational. The pricing trend we see should continue, and we will continue to, as a core part of our strategy for Chubb's business, to push on that. Understand that the market remains competitive, and where it's about capacity, which is a lot of the market and a lot of the players who talk, pricing is not very interesting. It's stable to slightly up or down. But so much of the business \u2013 so much of what Chubb does is about more than capacity. They engage with Chubb because of capabilities and service quality. And then, we also have substantial portions of our business that are not subject to the same cycle, commercial cycle. In my mind, we're going to continue to insist on achieving price that is adequate to achieve a reasonable risk adjusted return in those classes where we need to. And I think we're doing a pretty good job of it, and I don't see at the moment that ameliorating. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. And then, in terms of inflation, we've also heard some discussion about Paris and international issues potentially leading to higher inflation as well. What's your just view on that one as well? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, tariffs are a complex subject. They have an interesting timing to them. I mean, first of all, many, as you know, right now are reporting earnings and people are saying already, wow, I don't see an impact to the tariffs. So many goods are purchased and contracts are signed so long in advance, and so to find its way into the stream of commerce, into the pipeline in a meaningful way, takes time, number one. Number two, what is the actual dollar amount of tariffs today, versus what's being talked about, relative to the size of the economy and relative to the size of exports and imports? It's not a large percentage. And it is on goods, mostly on goods. So the inflation impact, if it's going to occur, should be relatively modest, will occur over time, and let's see what happens in trade overall. The tariffs aren't for the purpose of simply tariffs for their own sake. They're part of a strategy to achieve what the President would say is more fair and balanced trade. We'll see what kind of outcome that leads to. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : We will now take a question from Greg Peters of Raymond James. Please go ahead. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning. In your opening comments, you talked about operating cash flow. And if we look at the consolidated financial highlights table for the first half of the year 2018, it looks like operating cash flow was up 33%. Perhaps you could provide a little more color behind that. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, I would say there's a couple of things. We had very strong cash flow from underwriting as part of our operating cash flow, and there were a lower level of tax payment. It's just a timing, but the tax payments were down substantially, which contributed substantially to the higher cash flow in the period. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: So, looking at that same table, Philip, the combined ratio was actually up for the six months 2018 versus 2017. You said the underwriting is better? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Do not mix up incurred loss and paid loss. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Right. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: So, it really is on a cash basis. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it, right. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You can take that offline, if you want to get into accounting. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. No, no, no, that's fair. You talked a little bit about the digital efforts both in your press release and your commentary. And there's a lot in the marketplace around emerging technology ideas around distribution, potential AI. And I was wondering if you could just give us an update on how you're approaching your global IT budget this year versus last year and what your view is on all these emerging distribution ideas that are coming into the marketplace. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, I'll give you what we've said publicly. We spend about $1 billion a year on IT, and that's a substantial amount of money. A very substantial \u2013 a large portion of that is in new development and \u2013 both in terms of improving legacy technology, in terms of infrastructure, for cloud-enabled and anytime-anywhere access in processing, and in terms of new front-end capabilities, including marketing, sales, analytics, data scraping, all of the things that would go into \u2013 API development, all the things that would go into connecting externally, both with platforms and directly to consumer and to enable the customer experience, because it's all about the customer experience. We are doing that on a global scale. We're doing it in Asia, Latin America, and the U.S. predominantly. And that is, we're in \u2013 we've been working at it for a number of years, and it is all part of digitizing this organization, so that it thrives in the digital age, period, just like anything has to thrive in the digital age, including you as an individual. You remain analog, you are history. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Got it. And just as a follow-up to that point, when I think about what you guys have spent in terms of stuff around the mobile technology, do you think that's going to be more relevant in personal lines than commercial lines? Or do you think mobile technology's going to have a role in the commercial lines business? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, it already does in the commercial lines business. It is personal, it is small commercial, it is micro commercial, and it's moving up into the middle market, and \u2013 whereas the large account business is more about the anytime-anywhere servicing of the business and engineering, which is important to all the constituents, from individual to large corporate, that will be revolutionized over time with IoT capabilities that are installed fundamentally everywhere, from the building to goods and transit to your home. Charles Gregory Peters - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. Thanks for the answers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : We will now take a question from Yaron Kinar of Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody. My first question relates to the North America commercial business. So, I think you'd answered Kai's question about the other factors driving the accident year loss ratio up. Do you think with the rate increases that you've achieved so far and what you see in the pipeline, are lost cost trends being more offset now by these rate increases? Should we see less of that pressure point coming from loss cost trends? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: It's going to vary by line of business. And it's all about casualty-related lines, and it will vary by line. In some lines, I think the rate of increase is enough to keep pace with loss cost trends. I think in some other areas, it's not; and in some of those, underwriting actions and how we manage portfolio will help to balance that out, and in some it won't. So it's a combination, it's a mixed bag. You can't simply generalize. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. And if you had a crystal ball that you'd be wanting to share with us... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, okay. Going to the professional liability line for a second... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Hey, buddy, if I had a crystal ball, I wouldn't be doing this. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Well, you may be doing this and enjoying it even more. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: There could be that, too. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Going to the professional liability block for a second, so you said that about 15% of it required some corrective action right now. How does that compare to where that block was a year ago? And based on the data you have in front of you today, do you expect that 15% to increase or decrease, stay relatively the same over the next year? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We expect it to decrease. And it \u2013 how I compare a year ago to today? Slightly down. And I expect next year it will be lower. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Thank you very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : We'll now take a question from Jay Gelb of Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Good morning, Jay. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Good morning. I was hoping to focus on a couple of emerging issues. The first one is on the Japan floods, which seem to be among the worst on record. Just trying to think about what the insurance and reinsurance exposure might be for Chubb there. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Right \u2013 look, it's still emerging, and we don't know with certainty, but we don't expect it to be a significant event to Chubb. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, potentially a tougher one... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: From what I hearing so far, relatively modest. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: I appreciate that. An emerging area of asbestos risk appears to be coming from talc-related exposure, including J&J having a nearly $5 billion judgment against it within the past few weeks. I'd like your perspective on whether you think this as a new area of potential asbestos risk for the industry, and perhaps what it could mean for Chubb. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: First, Jay, let me ask you a question, did your mother use baby powder on you when you were little? Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Getting very personal here. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Look, it \u2013 asbestos has had \u2013 there have been new targets of \u2013 cohorts of business every few years, so that's not a new trend or new things in the industry, number one. You look at \u2013 it could have been congoleum manufacturers who made floor tiles. It was those who made motors and small motors, as you know, and so it was determined they had asbestos. So, this gets a headline because it's big, it's baby powder. There is science right now, there's facts, as it would seem, that are both sides, so who knows? And I'm not going to speculate about it. We see what you see and read what you read, and we'll just see how the facts emerge. But there wasn't \u2013 in the grand theme, when I think around asbestos, that did not startle me. And by the way, this about baby powder has been around. This is not like it just came up in the last few months. This has been out there for a reasonably long period of time. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. So, it doesn't sound like this issue is something that's keeping you up at night. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No. I got \u2013 my brain \u2013 no, it's crowded \u2013 that's crowded out with a lot of other things. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Okay. All right. My final question, if I think about how Chubb has done kind of a soft quantification of excess capital, I'm coming up with $4 billion to $5 billion of excess capital. Should we think about how that might get deployed over some period of time, if acquisition opportunities aren't available? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: There will be \u2013 there are organic growth opportunities. We're in the risk business. There are acquisitions to complement what we do organically, and we are patient, and if we have surplus capital at a point that is beyond what we and our board feel is prudent to have for both risk and to grow the company, then we will return it to shareholders in some form. And I think you see that since the beginning of the second quarter, we've brought back approximately $360 million worth of shares at, I might say, a price of about $132. And had we bought back in the first quarter, it would have been at a higher price. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's right. Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : We now move to Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We just finished with Jay Cohen. We're going to Paul Newsome, I think. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Different Jay. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: That was Jay Gelb. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Oh, that was Jay Gelb, sorry. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : That's okay. We get confused \u2013 there's worse people I could be confused with, so. I had a question on the life earnings. We've had top line growth for some time. This quarter, we actually saw the earnings begin to pick up pretty noticeably. I'm wondering really what's behind that. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, I just want to give an overarching on that, and then let Phil add to that. We have grown this business fundamentally from dust. And we've been saying for some time that by the nature of the life business, when you're growing it, particularly agency business, you're growing distribution, and you're growing the premium pretty rapidly. And by its nature, the way the economics work in that business, you're plowing back in, and until it reaches \u2013 your in-force reaches a certain scale, that \u2013 the earnings from the in-force begin to emerge and that begins to overwhelm what you're plowing back in to keep growing the business. And so we said that it was hitting a point of maturity, and that you'd begin to see earnings emerge, and that is exactly what is taking place. It didn't surprise us. Go ahead, Phil. Go ahead. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: The only thing I'd add to that is that we had very strong growth in Asia Pac, and we saw higher investment income because we've begun to grow the assets under management. So, I think the point that Evan makes together with that is what's creating the growth. In addition, our combined North America group also has some earnings momentum. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: But what I mentioned in my commentary was the international life business. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Yes, I'm talking about the overall life. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Got it. Thanks. Operator : We now take a question from Paul Newsome of Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Good morning. A couple of questions. One, I wanted to briefly revisit the sort of sustainability of price increases. I think, in the first quarter, Chubb was suggesting that, sort of, month by month, you were seeing modest acceleration, and that gave us a lot of confidence that as we get into the second quarter, we'd see even more. Has that sort of month by month improvement in the pricing environment continued through the second quarter? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, well, June was the best month of the quarter. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : So, that's good news. And then, my second question is a little bit more broad. I've got some smaller companies and such that are arguing that technology has changed such that a lot of the outsourced technology is just as good as the larger companies can produce on their own, which suggests that for the bigger companies, that the benefits of scale have reduced because of changes in the technology over time. Do you think that that's true, or have any view on that topic? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, yeah. First of all, whether you build the technology or you buy it \u2013 and most of it you're buying, but you're not buying, like, simply something ready-made out of a box. You're buying different components of technology, and you're putting them together to make them work. And by the way, whether you build it or you buy it, it costs money. And so how much do you have that you can afford to spend? And by the way, on what scale can you do it? Across how many geographies, how many customer areas and product areas can you do it? And then, data. Who's got data? And by the way, your ability to acquire data, and your ability to \u2013 again, tools, put in place tools that can help you gain insight into that data. I think, well, if you don't have scale, sure, you have a strategy, and sure, you can thrive, whether it's analog or it's digital, but you get to a certain size and I'll tell you what, scale matters. Jon Paul Newsome - Sandler O'Neill & Partners LP : Terrific. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : We will now take a question from Ian Gutterman of Balyasny. Please go ahead. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Hi. Thank you. A couple of mine were asked, but let's go to some other ones. Evan, the Citi deal you mentioned in Mexico, can you just give us \u2013 I know you mentioned the number of branches and so forth, but can you give us some perspective, would this be one of your top three relationships in Mexico or some other way to give us a sense of the magnitude of this. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, I can tell you pretty clearly it's our largest single relationship in Mexico. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Ian, the way to put it, Chubb is the second largest non-life writer now in Mexico. We were number seven only a few years ago. We have a, what continues to be good growth business, and with \u2013 that is stable with good combined ratios. It's an agency-driven business, and brokerage and direct marketing. We have, like, 62 branches across the country. We have thousands of agents. And that's the predominant source of the business. Now, what we've added is a substantial relationship that will complement that, open up a whole new channels of opportunity for us. With our product set, we're the second largest auto writer in the country, as an example. They have many auto customers. We write small commercial. We write surety, we write accident and health, we write middle market commercial. All of that will now also be offered through their branches, and through digital and direct marketing to their customers. So, it adds another dimension to what is a great business. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : That sounds great. And is there opportunity to do something similar on the A&H side? Obviously, a lot of this is direct marketed as well. Or is that a different channel, or is there opportunity to do that over time too? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: In the Citibanamex? Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Yeah. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Oh, it includes all of our accident and health. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay, I'm sorry. I thought you said... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: That will be distributed \u2013 that's distributed digitally, that's distributed with \u2013 digital. Most digital, by the way, you start the transactions digitally, and in many instances, you complete them with a phone call \u2013 with a phone. They want to talk... Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Right, right, right. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: ...whether it's small commercial or it's whatever. So you're mixing and matching direct channels plus through their branches. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Got it. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: So, all of our accident and health is actually a core product area in the strategy with Citibanamex. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Perfect. And just one on the large account business, the major accounts. And I guess, normally, I'd be very happy to hear very high retention, very strong new business. I guess my one question is, if we could dive a little deeper and just sort of where that's coming from, and I guess my concern is, given emerging loss trends in liability and, to some extent, professional, maybe I can make a case that large accounts \u2013 and just given some of the outsized jury awards and stuff we're seeing, maybe it's a good time to, frankly, be pruning a large account book and being a little bit more careful on who you're willing to insure at this point. Can you give us some sense of how you're managing that with still being able to grow and keep our retention? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, we're not \u2013 I think you're conflating a whole bunch of different things in there. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Casualty loss trends have been behaving pretty well. And Paul O'Connell could give a little bit on that, but what we see is frequency trends have actually been down, and severity trends have been reasonably modest. So, we haven't seen some pickup adversely in casualty. We have \u2013 we talked about public D&O, and I'll just put that to the side. The one thing you should know and remember, what I said is, this quarter our U.S. exposed large account casualty, we've got 5 points of rate. We're pressing on rate and terms. By the way, you write excess casualty in large account business, it's about attachment point. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Right. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: I know the terms is much or more than it is about simply price or rate. We're underwriters. We measure this all the time. And we have a \u2013 with all that said, in our underwriting discipline, by the way, we're presented an awful lot of business to write that we just don't win, we don't have a chance to win because of terms and rates. You offer me a book of business that I know versus a business I don't know, so renewal retention, a customer I know and that I have on the books is the better customer. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : For sure. For sure. I guess my premise was, it seems like we're seeing social inflation start to pick up, yeah. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: It's sort of like, if we don't like the rate, if we can't make an underwriting profit, and we don't like the rate, we're walking away. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Oh, of course, understood, absolutely, absolutely. I was just thinking more \u2013 the reason I was asking more on the large account side was, it seems like we're seeing this pickup in sort of nine-figure jury awards nationwide. And again, I know a lot is anecdotal, but it does seem like there's a pickup, and I would've thought large account would be the place where there'd be the most concern just because of the limits involved for the small to mid. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: We're not \u2013 what you're seeing anecdotally, we're not seeing on a portfolio basis. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Okay. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And we write large \u2013 and I'm trying to relate to it. We write large limit \u2013 high limit excess out of Bermuda, and that's behaving reasonably well, although (56:45) it has a long tail. We're writing in our U.S. casualty business, in our excess in particular, because you're not talking primary now. We write within the first $100 million of limit, and typically we're putting out $15 million to $25 million net, so you don't have huge limits exposed to those great one-offs. And then, by the way, what you see as a jury award and what you see as ultimate settlement, it's even \u2013 keep that in mind, too, Ian. Ian J. Gutterman - Balyasny Asset Management LP : Understood, agreed. All right. Thank you, appreciate it. Operator : We will now take a question from Meyer Shields of KBW. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Thanks. Good morning. Just a brief question, administrative expenses on a year-over-year basis grew more than in the first quarter, and I was hoping that you could talk a little bit about what's driving that. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Nothing, nothing in particular. Just normal operations, and then I assume you adjusted for foreign exchange, when you did that. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Yeah, to the best of my ability. Okay. Second question, can you talk a little bit about workers' compensation in the United States? I mean, we're seeing rate decreases, but generally improving profitability. So, I was just hoping for some insights in terms of like the macro picture. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Well, the macro picture, you have record low unemployment, which actually can play \u2013 cut both ways on workers' comp. You have less experienced workers on the job, so you have to be careful. We've been seeing frequency up until now, frequency of loss has been down. Severity has been reasonably tame. And so overall loss cost trends have been good in comp. I think you have to \u2013 in my own mind, the market is reacting to that, the insurers, and comp has become more competitive. And I think you have to be careful that you're not too aggressive, you overshoot the market. That's the bigger picture for me. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: And we have time for just one more person to ask questions, please. Operator : We will take this question from Brian Meredith of UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Thanks. Just a couple quick ones here for you. First, crop or agricultural insurance domestically in the U.S., obviously a big drop in corn prices, soybean prices, given the tariffs. How far away from the kind of threshold are we \u2013 where we're going to see some loss to that business or profitability be meaningfully impacted? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, Brian, I'll make two comments. First, the condition of the crop \u2013 and I can speak to Chubb's book only, given our \u2013 where I know our concentrations are, the corn crop \u2013 it's too early on soybeans \u2013 the corn crop, which is our number one crop, is in as good a condition as, or better than last year and the last five-year average. Number two, the price drop, corn was at $3.66, I believe, yesterday. I don't watch this too closely. And I think February contracts were like \u2013 when we priced were like in the $3.80 range, so it's within deductibles. So you're not at that threshold as you'd say. When you look at soybeans, the average that farmers buy on our book is about 20% deductible. Corn they buy a little less, closer to 15%. And you're \u2013 at this moment where soybeans was, which was $8 and change, you're right around or within the deductibles. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. That's helpful. Thanks. And then just two quick numbers questions for Phil. Phil, other income looked a little odd this quarter. Anything unusual there? And then also on interest expense, same question. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, so on other income, we had higher than expected PE income, where we own greater than 3%. So, when we have a partial ownership that's bigger than 3%, we include that in other income, and that was higher than we expected. We also had higher income on our investment, our insurance investment in China. And then, last year, we had a one-off capital charge in Switzerland. And all that drove the change year-to-year in other income. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: And then with interest expense, as we've said in the past, we have interest expense that includes both fixed and variable components, and the higher-than-expected expense in this quarter related to the variable component. We had more interest expense paid on collateral that we hold for clients, and we also had a higher usage of various facilities that we use to manage our cash around the world. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : So, is that $177 million number a good run rate number or is there... Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: I would use a range of $170 million to $175 million. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Excellent. Thanks. Appreciate it. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you, and good day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Operator : Good day and welcome to the Chubb Ltd. Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being recorded For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Helen Wilson, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you and welcome to our September 30, 2018, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company's performance and growth, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results may differ materially. Please see our most recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Good morning. As a global insurer we experienced an active quarter for natural catastrophes around the world, but hardly on the same scale as the industry's record-breaking CAT events from the prior-year quarter. As you saw from the numbers, Chubb reported core operating income of $2.41 per share; excluding CATs and prior reserve development, we earned $2.82 per share, which compares to $2.68 prior year on the same basis, up over 5%. Overall, it was a good quarter for the company, highlighted by excellent underwriting results and strong investment income. Premium revenue growth was good in U.S. commercial P&C and particularly strong in our international P&C business, personal and commercial, as we benefited from a number of our growth initiatives. On the other hand, growth in our U.S. personal lines business was impacted by the onetime accounting action we described last quarter, which distorts the year-over-year comparison. P&C underwriting income of $669 million benefited from contributions from current accident year results and positive prior-year reserve releases. Our published P&C combined ratio was 90.9% which included 6 points of CAT. On a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the combined ratio was 88.2% versus 88.5% prior year; simply world-class. For your information, the current accident year combined ratio with an expected level of CATs was 92.8% versus 93% prior year. Net investment income of $883 million was driven by strong positive cash flow and higher reinvestment rates, which are beginning to benefit from an improving interest rate environment. Book and tangible book value per share were up about 0.5% and 1.3%, respectively, and were unfavorably impacted by FX. Phil will have more to say about book value, investment income, CATs, and prior-period development. Turning to growth and market conditions; for the company overall, Global P&C net premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, was 4% for the quarter in constant dollars. Foreign exchange had a negative impact on growth of about 0.5%. Excluding merger-related actions, growth was actually 4.5% in constant dollars. Merger-related actions are virtually behind us now. Commercial P&C pricing for the business we wrote overall was similar to what we saw in the second quarter, and in fact better in many lines. As a general statement, pricing in the U.S. in particular was not keeping pace with loss cost trends in a number of important longer tail classes. All things being equal, this puts pressure on margins and serves as a natural governor on growth. For our company, this pressure is ameliorated to some degree in those lines by our ongoing underwriting portfolio actions and, overall, by our mix of business, i.e., we're emphasizing growth in other areas. In North America, rates overall were up about 2.5%, down marginally from last quarter's 3%. The difference was almost entirely a result of mix of business. At the same time, retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses, with the renewal retention as measured by premium, over 90%. Beginning with our major account retail and E&S wholesale division, premiums were up over 3.5%. Excluding merger-related underwriting actions, which are concentrated in this division, net premiums were up about 5.5%. Again, merger-related actions are now behind us with only about $20 million left for the fourth quarter. For major accounts, our renewal retention, as measured by premium in the quarter, was 92.7%. And for the business we wrote in major, rates overall were up 2%. The rate of increase for several important long-tail lines was higher than prior quarter, including casualty, management liability, and risk management; while the rate of increase for property was lower than the last few quarters. In our North America middle market and small commercial business, premiums overall were up over 3.5% in the quarter. Excluding financial lines, where growth was essentially flat due to underwriting actions, premiums were up nearly 5%. New business was up almost 14%, with a quarter of that coming from growth initiatives. Renewal retention in our middle market business was 90%. Middle market P&C rates, excluding comp, were up 2%, the strongest quarter again in several years and continuing a positive trend; while exposure growth added an additional 1%. In our U.S. small commercial business, premium revenue continued to accelerate in the quarter, with net premiums up 30%. Over 3,700 Chubb agents are now actively using our small business platform and took advantage of our broadening appetite to submit over 34,000 opportunities to us in the quarter. Over time, this will become an important business. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums were up 2% in the quarter. Growth was 2.7%, and in line with our expectations and the prior quarter's after adjusting for onetime accounting actions which we discussed on last quarter's call. Retention remains very strong at 96%. Of note, the personal lines loss ratio was up due to elevated loss cost both non-CAT weather and non-weather-related water and fire losses. Pricing was up 2.7% in the quarter, the strongest rate increase quarter for homeowners in a number of years. We are taking and will continue to take underwriting and pricing actions which, over a reasonable period of time, will bring our loss ratio back in line. In our North America agriculture business, yields for the crop year look very good based on what we know today. We cannot yet predict prices, but they appear to be in the range of deductibles. Our crop insurance business is a great franchise where we are the clear leaders. Crop insurance is a part of the agriculture economy and farmers need this coverage and buy it every year; the same as other businesses buy insurance. Our ability to select and underwrite risk, pay claims, and service customers year after year through our nationwide network of offices is simply unrivaled. We have 5,600 agents and 450 employees producing this business. Turning to our Overseas General Insurance operations; as I mentioned at the opening, we experienced excellent growth this quarter in our international P&C business. Net premiums written for our international retail division were up over 8% in constant dollar. And FX then had a negative impact of 1.8 points. This compares favorably to growth of 6% last quarter and year-to-date growth of 5%. So we are experiencing good momentum. Asia Pacific and Latin America contributed growth of 11.5% and 10%, respectively, while the Continent was up over 3.5%, and UK/Ireland was up about 1.5%. Net premiums for our commercial P&C lines overall in international retail were up over 11% in the quarter; while premiums for middle market and small commercial, another growth initiative we have been discussing, grew 13% in the quarter, led by Asia and Latin America, the key focus regions for us where net premiums were up 19%. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up about 6% in the quarter. International personal lines premiums were up over 7.5% in constant dollar driven by double-digit growth, again in both Latin America and Asia. As for pricing conditions outside the U.S., rates in our international retail and London wholesale business is varied by line and region, and by country within region. We have so many classes and so many territories. Overall rate increases were in line with last quarter, up 3% in our retail division, and up 4% in our wholesale business. Our global A&H division in total had a reasonable quarter with premiums up 4.5% in constant dollar. In our international A&H business, premiums were up 4%, led by Asia Pacific with growth of 8.5%; while premiums in North America grew 6.5%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade, and Ed Clancy can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. In summary, it was a good quarter for Chubb. Business activity is brisk. We have received over 1 million new business submissions year-to-date in the U.S., a record for our company, and up 12% over last year. Our people are optimistic and focused on serving their customers and distribution partners. The compelling nature of our franchise, our broad product lineup, our distinguished service reputation, our expansive distribution capabilities, and our geographic presence gives us great confidence in our future earning power and our ability to outperform. As our industry-leading combined ratios clearly illustrate, we are trading some growth for underwriting profitability. At the same time, because of our global presence and the expanded capabilities of Chubb today, we have many areas of opportunity to take advantage of without sacrificing underwriting discipline from our unrivaled large account franchise to our small commercial and middle market businesses globally, our international personal lines, global A&H and Asia-based life insurance businesses, all of which are growing more rapidly and are not subject to current commercial P&C pricing conditions, varies by area. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then, we'll be back to take your questions. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remains strong with total capital of $64 billion. Operating cash flow in the quarter was $1.7 billion. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $716 million to shareholders, including $337 million in dividends and $379 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date, through October 23rd, we have returned $1.8 billion to shareholders, including $1 billion in dividends and $760 million in repurchases. We also paid off $100 million of debt that matured in the quarter. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $883 million, compared to $893 million in last year's quarter. Last year included a one-off gain of $44 million. Given the rising interest rate environment and in anticipation of a steepening yield curve, we have shortened the duration of our fixed income portfolio from 4.2 to 3.9 years. This in effect helps immunize the portfolio against the mark-to-market impact from rising interest rates. In addition, as rates rise, we will reinvest the portfolio at a faster rate. To that point, as you saw in the supplement, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased year-to-date from 2.9% at December 31st to 3.5% at September 30th. Our current book yield is 3.5% and, therefore, the increased yield will eliminate downward pressure on investment income. To improve the efficiency of our global cash management, we maintain a cash pooling program. Our local legal entities around the world deposit excess cash into this pool or borrow cash from the pool to minimize our global cash balances and to avoid disturbing local investment portfolio. The cost of borrowing is included in interest expense, and the interest earned on deposits is included in investment income. The use of this program will be reduced during the fourth quarter based on current needs, resulting in offsetting declines in both interest income and corresponding interest expense of approximately $10 million to $15 million. As a result, we now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be in the range of $875 million to $885 million, which reflects this reduction in interest. We also have investment activity that's included in other income from our private equity funds where we own greater than 3%. These returns have some variability quarter to quarter. This quarter, other income included $21 million pre-tax related to these investments. We expect our run rate on these investments to be $10 million pre-tax, again, as part of other income. So putting everything together, we should add to the investment income range the estimated $10 million in other income from private equity returns and $10 million in lower interest expense, for total income to the company from investment-related activities of $895 million to $905 million. Turning to book value, in the quarter, book and tangible book value per share increased 0.4% and 1.3%, respectively. Both were unfavorably impacted by foreign exchange losses of $425 million after-tax; $252 million of which impacted the tangible net assets. As a result of our shorter duration and the diversified nature of the portfolio, there was no significant change to book value this quarter for mark-to-market changes in the investment portfolio. The mark-to-market on our fixed income portfolio was an unrealized loss of $135 million after-tax, offset by other realized gains of $154 million after-tax, principally related to the valuation of the underlying investments in our private equity funds. For the year, rising interest rates have resulted in realized and unrealized losses of $1.3 billion after-tax. Excluding the mark on investments, book and tangible book value per share increased 3.3% and 6.9%, respectively, reflecting strong underlying results, strong net investment income and positive cash flow. Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 8.7%. As a reminder, Chubb records the change in the fair value mark on its private equity funds as realized gains. So, therefore, it is not included in core operating income. Other companies record the impact of the mark as part of their investment income. This quarter, we had after-tax gains of $144 million, which would increase our core operating EPS by $0.31 per share and our annualized core operating ROE to 9.8%. For the year, after-tax gains of $269 million would increase our core operating EPS by $0.57 per share and our annualized core operating ROE to 9.8%, compared to the reported ROE of 9.1%. Net catastrophe losses for quarter were $450 million pre-tax or $372 million after-tax as previously announced and as are further detailed in the financial supplement. We had positive prior-period development in the quarter of $243 million pre-tax. This included $65 million of net adverse development related to the homeowners' lines where losses trended higher than expected; and $54 million of adverse development related to our legacy environmental exposure. The remaining favorable development of $362 million comprises 85% long-tail lines, principally from accident years prior to 2014 and 15% short-tail lines. Net loss reserves increased $269 million in the quarter, adjusting for foreign exchange. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 93% in the quarter. Adjusting for PPD and CAT losses, the ratio was 86%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.1%. As we continued to evaluate the impact of U.S. tax reform, the final amount of the provisional tax benefit recognized may increase or decrease, as new regulations are set to be issued in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect our annual effective tax rate to be in a range of 13% to 15%. With that, I'll turn the call back to Helen. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. At this point we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : We'll take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Hi, good morning. My first question; Evan, I appreciate all the comments on the pricing view. As we're now in the fourth quarter, starting to annualize when we saw some of the rate increases last year, seems like a pretty stable environment in the third quarter. Do you think the industry \u2013 I know overall there's a lot of business lines will be able to continue to push for a stable level of rate as we annualize the losses that we saw last year. And when you're giving the pricing color, another commercial lines insurer did point to potentially looking to higher interest rates as a reason to maybe push for less price. Could you just comment if you're seeing a reliance on interest rates in the pricing decisions of other companies in the market? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, Elyse, I can't look into the minds of others, so I'm not sure what they're thinking. But when I'm looking at the fourth quarter right now, I'm not seeing any change really in pricing momentum. The one variable you always have in the fourth quarter is, people who really want to puff up their chest about how they grew. They chase volume always \u2013 and this is just the way it works \u2013 in the fourth quarter to try to meet budgets and all that stuff. And so you always see some more desperate noise around getting business in the fourth quarter that you don't see the same way in other quarters. Interesting. But I've seen no change to that pattern. But with that said, we see the same pattern of rate movement so far in the fourth quarter that we saw in the third, with more casualty-related lines getting rate, with the exception of Middle Market comp, and property because you're now rate-on-rate slowing down. And that's kind of the pattern, as we've been seeing it. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Okay. And then in terms of the homeowners business, you alluded to taking more price and looking to improve the margins there. So, is it that you guys expect the level, I guess, of non-CAT losses, the fire and water that we saw in quarter, kind of taking price for that and that might continue, and was that also a driver of the adverse development? Could we just get a little bit more color on what's going on within the homeowners' book? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Sure. Yeah. I'm going to turn it over to Paul Krump, but I'm going to make this one general statement and it will be redundant a little bit to what he says. But we've been \u2013 this is a trend we've been talking about for a while. And it's a trend; it's not simply a one off, one quarter or one or two quarters. We've been seeing this movement in loss ratio and talking about it for two years now. And with that, let me turn it over to Paul. Paul J. Krump - Chubb Ltd.: Thanks, Evan. Thanks, Elyse. I kind of anticipated the question. So I've got a little bit of a fulsome answer here. So the current accident year ex-CAT ratio, loss ratio for PRS is up 5.7 points in Q3 2018 versus last year's Q3. So, as Evan mentioned, the deterioration is driven more by larger water and non-CAT weather and fire losses in the homeowners' line. We've experienced an increased frequency and severity throughout the year which, frankly, as you noted, has been seeping in for last two years. We don't think we're alone in the industry here, Elyse, in experiencing this elevated loss activity, and we're not dismissing it as simple, normal volatility. Recognize we have a portfolio of homeowners and the amount of rate needed to achieve adequacy varies by region and cohort from no rate increase required to something more substantial. We're already surgically addressing this issue by zip code, age of home, construction, size of property, supporting ancillary lines of business and the type of dwelling our insured owns. Variations matter between home, say, versus condo or co-op. And, of course, we're doing this within the confines of a very highly-regulated business. Along with already taking more rate where needed, we're addressing the issue with underwriting actions including predicting and preventing losses. We don't believe that simply passing on rate increases will win the day. That said, I've been involved in overseeing this book for a good portion of the last 15 years, so allow me to add my perspective, as I hear way too much misinformation about the high net-worth market and PRS in particular. First, for us, this is a homeowners issue and while homeowners is half our book of PRS business, it is not the entire PRS portfolio; the other lines are performing well. Second, we're seasoned insurance professionals and have served the high net-worth category for over 30 years. Over those years, environmental and societal changes have caused spikes or elevation in the homeowners' loss ratio from time to time, and we have addressed them while growing our book. This is our business; we're very proud to serve our customers and our world-class claims service is the bedrock of our customer value proposition. As an example, J.D. Power recently recognized this exceptional service by ranking us one of only two carriers to earn their prestigious five Power Circles rating for property claims satisfaction. We will continue to enhance our reputation and improve our loss ratio while growing the PRS book. Growth will continue to skew towards those clients who appreciate our broad coverages and first-class services. This past quarter, our new PRS business volume was up 7% over Q3 2017. Make no mistake, we're not resting on our laurels, and we will continue to blaze new trails and invest more than anyone in the high net-worth business. Four quick examples. One, on the product front, we have recently launched coverage for customers with in-home businesses, cyber coverage, farm and ranch coverage for our clients with a penchant for the outdoors, global coverages, and enhanced travel accident coverages. We are also working on what I'll call slim down offerings for those prospects who desire a little less coverage and service in exchange for a premium savings. Two, on the digital front, we're working to enable the full client experience to be done digitally. Specifically within our customer portal, we have recently added ePolicy, eBilling, eSignature, personalized risk inspection reports, loss mitigation enrollment, as well as mobile apps for items like Auto ID Cards and another to monitor and promote safer drivers. We just added biometric login to make the process even easier, and we are just getting started. We will continue to expand our digital capabilities. Three, on the predict and prevent front, we are using the thermographic scanners, water detection shut-off valves, arborists, art experts, our in-house risk engineers and, of course, our well-known Wildfire Defense Services to assist our clients and mitigate losses, all while making ourselves more relevant to our customers, independent agents and brokers, and furnishing the Chubb brand. Fourth, in speaking of our producers, we are supporting them on the sales front by arming them with hundreds of warm leads and aiding them in writing in specific ZIP codes where profitable new business resides. In summary, the past few years of wildfires, floods, hurricanes, hail storms, tornadoes, mudslides, and water damage have intensified losses and made many agents and their clients take serious notice of who is insuring them. This backdrop is causing our homeowners line to experience margin compression, but longer term, this spells opportunity for Chubb as well as our agents and brokers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: More than you ever wanted to know, Elyse. Elyse B. Greenspan - Wells Fargo Securities LLC : Yes, that was very helpful. Thank you very much. I appreciate the color. Operator : And we will take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Thank you. Thank you. Evan, I guess my first question is when you talked about U.S. commercial lines pricing, you said, yeah, things are kind of in line, maybe a little better in casualty than last quarter; but pricing is still below loss trend. I'm just curious, where do we need to get to in order to see margin stability here, and do you think we can get there? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Look, it varies by line of business, so you really \u2013 you can't sort of make a general statement. And this is what I mean : there were some lines \u2013 in E&S casualty as an example, and I'm going to turn it over to our Chief Actuary in a second, to give you more color, but I want to give you a certain perspective. You can listen to commentary that says rate right now equals loss cost trend. So there's no erosion in combined ratio. Well, you could be listening to that about certain E&S casualty lines that happen to be running 110% or 120% combined ratio. Now, there's a head fake around that statement. Right? When you hear it. There are other lines of business where, frankly, we're getting 1% in those casualty lines, and it is adequate because we're earning a reasonable underwriting profit there and we don't see a lot of loss cost trend. So, it really varies around the lot. But to give you a more general picture of all this, let me turn it over to Paul O'Connell. Paul O\u2019Connell - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, Evan. Brian, the issue on loss cost trend, first of all, our loss cost trend impacts, obviously, our reserve base as well as our current accident year loss ratios. If we start with the loss reserve base, I'm confident that our current reserves are adequate. As Evan pointed out, we have many different products, classes, and territories so that trends do vary. But if we focus a high level look on long-tail lines, we are seeing a continuation of the broadly-favorable trends in the prior accident year development. There are a few exceptions in select product lines, particularly those where we observed elevated frequency in the last few years. On our more recent accident years, or recent year loss ratios, the trend is putting pressure on margins in our casualty business. And again as Evan pointed out, the combination of rate and exposure isn't keeping pace with loss cost trend in many product lines, so all else equal there is potential for compression in our margins. Despite the margin compression though, all our lines are producing an underwriting profit. And the compression in margin is also less than what the pure rate and trend math would suggest, since one has to consider the impact of underwriting actions, particularly our portfolio management process, as well as how the favorable prior-year trends are flowing through our current year projections. Some high-level views on the U.S. operations for some of the casualty lines are as follows : so for workers' comp, rate has been flat to declining, our loss cost trends are exceeding exposure change, however, the continued favorable development on the prior accident year has tempered the compression that we're seeing on a year-over-year basis, that one would expect given the rate activity. On the liability lines, again, a very broad mix of coverages and attachment points, we are seeing neutral to negative impact as loss cost trend is close to or exceeds current rate changes. So there has been some recent activity in rate that does show some promise. And then, there are also pockets of our portfolio where we are experiencing rate and exposure in excess of loss trend. In other areas, margin compression is tempered by favorable development and underwriting actions as well. And then finally, on financial lines, again, also a very broad mix of products, so recent issues have been concentrated in select D&O product lines and classes; and there, loss trend is running higher than rate. So the majority of the portfolio, putting aside certainly the select D&O classes, is generating an underwriting profit and trends in rate have improved. Loss cost trends, while elevated, appear to have plateaued in these challenging classes. John Keogh was going to provide a little bit more color about the financial lines. John W. Keogh - Chubb Ltd.: Sure. As Paul noted, we've been observing in many classes our D&O business where rates simply aren't keeping pace with loss cost trends. And I guess we're now doing surprise interviews and we're finding more and more instances where our underwriters are not finding instances where rates are adequate to the exposure that we're looking at. So this has led to, as a result, shrinking our business. And, in my view, I think it's a pretty good example of good underwriting, and that is trading growth for adequate pricing. So, in fact, if you look at our North American (sic) [America] Commercial P&C business year-to-date, that business has grown 3.6%. However, within that business is our substantial financial lines business. That business has actually shrunk 3.5% year-to-date. So if you look at North America Commercial P&C without the financial lines business, we're actually up a 5.5%. So, again, an instance where we are trading because of inadequate rates to loss cost trends in that business. As respect to the actual loss cost trends in D&O, we've been talking about this for a better part of the year, and here we're seeing an increased frequency really starting in 2016 of suits against boards and directors. If you look at security class actions, they're running roughly in the last two years double historical averages. And there's a lot of drivers behind that, but the three that I would note that are the biggest drivers that we observe, one would be merger objection cases. This is where in a majority of merger transactions, there's a suit against the board, whether you're a seller or a buyer. It leads to a D&O suit. We've seen that drop a little bit in frequency as Delaware courts have taken a bit of a tougher stance against these claims, but it's definitely a problem. Emerging plaintiff bars. There's firms out there that didn't exist 10 years ago that are finding this is a great opportunity to make money. And so, here, we're seeing innovation. I'll call it creative series of liability in terms of suits being against the boards and the management teams. And then, lastly, a driver that we're observing, I'll call event-driven litigation against boards. So imagine the traditional general liability and property claims. Think of mass tort, a dam bursting and people being hurt, a cyber breach where you get property claims, you get liability claims. Well, guess what, more often than not today, you also get allegations and claims being brought against management and boards of directors. So there's the loss cost trends that we observe. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Great. Wow. Very thorough. And just can I have a follow-up here. Talk a little bit about the agricultural crop business here. I know you said that we'll see how pricing comes out as far as how the profitability of that gets (00:37:22) for the year, because yields look like they're pretty good. I guess maybe just talk about the business more from a strategic perspective, how it fits within the whole Chubb franchise. And then, if I look at the profitability of that business, it's been quite attractive the last couple years. Do you think you're earning excess profits in that business right now or is that kind of where the margin's profitability should be? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: I'm going to turn it over in one second to John Lupica, but I'm going to take the last part of that question for a moment. He's going to talk to you about average combined ratios for the last decade. And there's, of course, a range of deviation around that like any line of business, but particularly a line of business that has a catastrophe element to it. And I think that's the way you have to think about it. I don't think there's this question of excess versus inadequate. I would disabuse of that, but let me turn it over to John. John Joseph Lupica - Chubb Ltd.: Thanks, Brian, for the question. Chubb, via our legacy companies, we've been involved in the crop business for well over 30 years now. And as you know, we purchased 100% of the rain and hail franchise in December of 2010. And the franchise has been and continues to be the leading writer and brand in the crop insurance space. Rain and hail is part of the ag community with our 10 regional offices housing our 450-plus ag-only employees around the country. Our multi-peril crop insurance policies are a vital part of the chain of commerce for farmers. As a tried and true revenue protection product, our farmers are able to use these policies as collateral when they're financing machinery, seed and fertilizer for the season. The financial security of the revenue product is just one critical reason for the purchase. Based on market data that we have, 86% of all eligible acres in North America utilize crop insurance due to its proven worth. Again, rain and hail is the leading rider, with 20% of the crop market. We insure over 125,000 farmers farming 65 million net acres and growing 125 different crops. And our 10-year combined ratio has been an industry-leading 88%. We believe we can outperform the average due to a number of key differentiators in a business that really has, as you know, fixed-base pricing. And that's our brand and longevity in the market. Our service component and technology where we delivered to the agent to help process the business, and in claims where the efficient handling and quick payment of the claims are really critical. We have a national footprint that gives us the scale and spread of risk. We have 2,600 agencies represented by 5,600 agents that are appointed and we train every year on the marketplace. We talked about 10 regional leaders who are the best in the business. On the data side, we have modeling capabilities on over 2.1 million farm fields that we have decades of data; and our leadership, who spent their careers in this business. All of this has led rain and hail to outperform the market. So in a simple answer, yeah, we understand the crop business. We get the CAT-like volatility it brings and we manage to that. And we absolutely believe it's a core contributor to the Chubb organization. So hope that helps. Brian Meredith - UBS Securities LLC : Very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you. Thank you, and good morning. You gave a very comprehensive answer to Elyse's question on personal line, but I do have a follow-up. Evan, you mentioned you want to get the core loss ratio back in line, and do you mean that you're going back to the 51% levels back in two years ago and how long will it take you to get there? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, I'm not giving you a point estimate, but you're in the range. And it will take \u2013 look, it will take a little while. It could take 18 months or thereabouts, because you got \u2013 this is a filed product, you got to keep filing rate increases. You put them in on renewal. It takes time to earn in. And then in the meantime, we are taking other underwriting action regarding coverage, how we offer coverage, who we offer it to, where we offer it \u2013 we're refining some of that right now, based on what we know \u2013 and our use of reinsurance. So, all of that will play, Kai. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. The other question I have is on the Chubb's EPS growth potential. If you look at top line premium growth, underlying had been sort of mid-single digit, 4% to 5%; and your margin is excellent, so probably \u2013 which also means probably less room for further improvement there. And then on net investment income, you've been growing mid-single digit as well. So, your earnings is growing mid-single digits. If you add on top of that you're buying back $1 billion, that's about a 1% to 2% of the shares, so EPS is going to grow like mid-single digits; is that right way to think about your growth potential? And other driver could accelerate that growth? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, your math is pretty good. The thing I'd add to that is, I think with a combination of our own underwriting discipline and the freedom that we have to grow in other areas when there are certain areas under stress because of our geographic and product reach and the customer segments and distribution. The freedom that gives us. When I add that and I add an interest rate environment that, frankly, is improving from our perspective and what I think is a yield curve that's going to steepen, I might, over a reasonable period of time, play a little more about the earning power that will come out of the investment side. That's as far as I'm going to go, Kai, because I don't engage in \u2013 I don't give guidance and this is a guidance discussion. And so, I'm being friendly and patient. Kai Pan - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC: Thank you so much. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Cohen from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Yes, thank you. I guess just one quick comment related to Kai's question, the other leverage you may have is \u2013 you have acknowledged you have excess capital so at some point deploying that capital one way or another could add to growth, I would think. But my question is... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: That's very true, Jay, but it's opportunistic. And I can't predict. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : No, absolutely. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: The only thing I'll tell you is is, you go into a difficult environment, the more difficult the environment gets, I'm thinking from a macroeconomic or financial or political, that's when opportunities rear their heads. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : We've seen that historically. So, my question was on Overseas General. There was a \u2013 you look at this year, there's just been a notable acceleration in the premium growth, and you talked about some of the drivers. I'm wondering if you can drill down a little bit more and talk about what you think going forward will be the key areas of growth for that business. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yes. I'm going to do that. But what I'm going to do first is hand it to Juan Andrade, who runs that business, and let him speak a little about it. And then we'll come back and have a short chat. Juan C. Andrade - Chubb Ltd.: Great. Thanks, Jay. As Evan said in his opening comments, our international business is continuing to grow very well in the third quarter and the growth was driven by international retail operations which grew over 8% in constant dollars. London wholesale operations also grew close to 6%. We're seeing the growth accelerate as we continue to implement our strategies and leverage the power of today's Chubb through our expanded distribution, our product capabilities, and our customer segmentation. Our diversified platform in terms of geography, our branches within that geography, our product, our distribution, continues to be a competitive advantage and a key growth driver for us. We saw growth across all of our major lines of business, with commercial P&C leading the growth at 11% in constant dollars. As Evan mentioned, our small commercial and middle market businesses grew 13% with Asia and Latin America contributing with growth of 19%. Personal lines also had very good growth. The investments we have made in technology, product, customer segmentation, and traditional bancassurance and digital distribution are paying off. Our strongest growth continues to come from the emerging markets of Asia and Latin America as a result of our focus on customer segmentation, our consumer lines, and our expanded agency, bancassurance, and growing digital capabilities. In the quarter, Asia grew over 11%, and Latin America 10% in constant dollars. This is consistent with the double-digit growth we experienced last quarter. Our focus on the emerging middle class with targeted product offerings through a multi-channel distribution approach, along with our focus on small commercial, mid-size companies, and offering them a wide product range from technologically advanced front-end systems and accessing them through a wide distribution platform, enabled by our significant branch impressions, has been the backbone of our growth. Australia and Mexico are two examples of these regions of countries that continue to produce excellent results given the product and technology capabilities we have built and deployed and the distribution relationships that we have expanded. We have a well-diversified product and distribution platform, geographic reach, and outstanding management teams. In addition, our underwriting discipline has also paid off, as we have been able to react fast to changing market conditions, while competitors focus on their internal profitability issues. In addition to Asia and Latin America, we also saw meaningful growth contributions from developed markets of Japan and Europe. Jay A. Cohen - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Very helpful. Thank you, Juan. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome, Jay. Will we it will continue? Well, you see momentum building. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. Just for Evan, your comment was that you're confident you'll be able to continue to outperform. In your view, does outperform \u2013 and I'm assuming that's other competitors in the industry, do you think margin stability over the next, I don't know, X amount of years, X amount of quarters, is going be enough to outperform, or do you think you need margins to expand? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Or need what, need the margins to expand? Is that what was the question? Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Yeah. Yeah. So in other words, when you think about what will make Chubb outperform fundamentally... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: When I think about our performance, I think \u2013 when I look at the combined ratios of this company, and I look at the size and scale of this organization, and I look at the breadth of it, geographically, and the customers we serve, and what we do, and you add all of that relevance together to add \u2013 to take the size of what this company is, and what we are producing as earnings, and the combined ratio because it's an underwriting company in the risk business, I think the company outperforms. I think it is outperforming. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Got it. And just wanted to maybe hear you opine a little bit on catastrophes. I think year-to-date we're already through I think the level that you thought was a normalized CAT load. And it doesn't seem like numerically there's been a normal CAT year, but I know that things have been kind of tricky. So, how should we \u2013 how are you thinking about this year from a CAT standpoint, and why are there more than $1 billion of CATs just three quarters in? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. I think it's an elevated CAT year, for sure. I think the math speaks. You can't be \u2013 Ryan, it's a global question and a global answer. It's not a U.S.-centric question. Though I think people tend to focus on \u2013 in the U.S., on just seeing America and American-related when \u2013 just look at the globe, there's a much bigger world out there. And on a global basis, CATs are elevated. This year is elevated. And is it a new normal? There's deviation around the mean. You just look at it over the last bunch of years. It's obviously better than last year, but it is an elevated year. And you look at the CAT losses in Asia, you look at some in Europe, you look at what there's been in the U.S. between from wildfires to water and everything in between, and you look at the fourth quarter of that; this is not an average year if you define average as the mean or the median over the last 10 or 15 or 20 years. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Fair enough. Any indication on how to think about, I guess, the Michael loss and how that might fit within the 4Q budget? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Look, it's early days, and we don't have a good handle on this yet. Our very early indication would say $150 million to $250 million pre-tax net. But you know what; I don't know if it's going be higher than that or lower than that. Ryan J. Tunis - Autonomous Research : Thanks for your answers. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Mike Zaremski of Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG : Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up for Phil on taxes first. There's been a few \u2013 at least a few multi-national financial firms that have signaled that this \u2013 it's called the base erosion tax, the BEAT is the acronym, it kicks in 2020, could cause the tax rate to creep up in the coming years. But there's still kind of uncertainty which I think you also mentioned as to guidance from the tax authorities. So I know Phil you said 13% to 15% is the right range, but were you speaking to 2018, and more information is needed to determine longer-term? Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: That's exactly right. So certainly the BEAT kicked in this year and it's affecting our tax rate this year and it's reflected in our 13% to 15%. But as I said, there's going to be new guidance that's issued around Thanksgiving that will clarify the BEAT provision, and \u2013 among other things, and once we get to see that we'll have a better estimate for 2019. Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG : Okay, great. And, Evan, kind of wanted to talk about \u2013 you've been one of the leading insurers investing and talking about the need to adapt to the digital age. Some of your peers seem to also be increasingly talking about it as well. I don't typically think of CapEx being material for P&C insurers, but I'm curious if it is material these days. And I guess, similarly, some insurers have kind of made technology-oriented acquisitions that maybe could be put in that digital CapEx bucket as well. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: What are you asking me? What's the question? Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG : So just curious if Chubb's CapEx levels are material. We don't typically talk about that, but it seems like there's more and more investments being made in technology-oriented processes and investments. I know you guys have been doing it for years now as well. So just curious if that could... Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. And I have tried to be clear about it. I haven't given a number relative to the increase and I'm not doing that. But our CapEx \u2013 our investment, both CapEx and non-CapEx-related, because some of it comes directly just through expense and activities that you wouldn't classify as CapEx. So CapEx and that expense related to digital has increased over the last number of years. We have been clear. We spend about $1 billion a year on technology. A good portion of that is CapEx related and capitalized. That would go towards technology related to software, to infrastructure, to communications, et cetera, and to improve your abilities or your insights from customer experience to data analytics and everything in between that. And of the $1 billion, roughly 40% of it is towards development that we classify as digital. And that kind of gives you a sense. Michael Zaremski - Credit Suisse Group AG : Okay. That's helpful. Thanks for the color. Operator : And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Good morning, everybody. I guess my first question goes back to the small commercial space. You posted two consecutive quarters of very, very strong growth. And I hate to nitpick here, but, Evan, I think last quarter you talked about getting this portfolio up to a multi-billion-dollar level within three to five years. So I think even with this growth level, you still would need more. So are you expecting more acceleration of your organic growth or would this require \u2013 getting to your target, would that require some inorganic opportunities as well? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Well, first of all, I don't know how you did your math. Because I gave you a U.S. number, but I didn't give you a basic premium; and gave you an international number where you even have basic premium. And last quarter, we talked about the U.S. alone being at an annualized run rate of $400 million. So I'm going stop right there. I think I've answered the question. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. So maybe I misunderstood, because I do remember the $400 million number in the US alone. I thought that multi-billion dollar target was for the U.S. alone. So if I misunderstood, I apologize. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: No, I think it's global. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: I see. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And in any event there, you... Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: And I didn't break it down, because I just don't give guidance that way. I didn't break it down \u2013 and fair enough, I didn't break it down how much of that would be U.S. and not. But I did leave it vague as to \u2013 I gave a range around it and left it vague because I'm really trying to express the intent, the kind of size of opportunity and our confidence in executing it. That's really the point, rather than to allow you to make a point estimate. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's helpful. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: I'm not trying to express it and deliver it in a way that makes it sort of work sheet-related. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Okay, but at least it clarifies my confusion. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: And my second question was around the annual A&E reserve update. I guess I was a little surprised to see as low as $12 million of strengthening this quarter. Can you maybe talk about that? Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: There were two moving parts in that. One was, we did take a charge from environmental. On the other hand, we had a greater recognition because it just factually came through of recoverables against third parties that helped to offset. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: Yeah, that's right. So we had $54 million charge as I've said in my commentary on environmental. And then as Evan says, we had the benefit of an increase in our estimate of reinsurance recoverables relating to long outstanding legacy liabilities. Yaron Kinar - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay, got it. Thank you very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Gelb from Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: Thank you. I was hoping to get your perspective on the Lloyd's marketplace based on the new leadership there, and that market's focused on improving its underwriting profitability. What do you envision there, and what are the implications for Chubb? Thanks. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: I know John Neil. I think he's a good man. And I wish him \u2013 and he's a good \u2013 I think he's a good executive, and I wish him all the best in his role. And on the other hand, it's the chief executive of a marketplace and the governance over a marketplace. The syndicates make their individual decisions regarding underwriting. And there's only so much that the Lloyd's Corporation can do about that, though it has important strategic handles that can pull in the future. The Lloyd's marketplace is important to the industry, but it has longer-term structural issues in my mind that it ultimately has to address. It's a business model where the business seeks the market and comes to the market. That was a model that worked very well before a globalized world and before a digitized world. But I think the world has changed, and I think that the model to survive and remain as robust has got to adapt. Its cost structure is way too high, and the way you access the market is \u2013 and underwriters are way too inefficient. Those are the bigger strategic questions. And over time, given the way the world has adapted, there is an element of antiselection that starts creeping into what comes to that marketplace if you fail to adapt. That's my reflection on that, and I'll stop right there. Jay Gelb - Barclays Capital, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks very much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you. We have time for just one more person to ask question, please. Operator : And we'll take our final question from Meyer Shields from Keefe, Bruyette & Woods. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Great. Thanks. Just a very brief question. We saw administrative expenses in corporate come down significantly on the year-over-year basis. I was wondering whether there's anything unusual in that. Philip V. Bancroft - Chubb Ltd.: No, there's nothing unusual. We did have some integration-related savings but there's nothing material \u2013 no material change in that. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: Meyer, there's some variability quarter to quarter in that line, based on one-off items and that sort of thing. Meyer Shields - Keefe, Bruyette & Woods, Inc.: Okay. Perfect. Thanks so much. Evan G. Greenberg - Chubb Ltd.: You're welcome. Helen Wilson - Chubb Ltd.: Thank you, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again at the end of next quarter. Thank you and good day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference.

There will be a question-and-answer session at the end of today's prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Karen Beyer, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you and welcome to our December 31, 2018 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Company's performance and growth, pricing and business mix, and economic market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us today to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, I will turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we reported core operating income in the fourth quarter of $2.02 per share. The quarter was marked by greater volatility from elevated natural catastrophes around the world from a variety of perils and from increased property loss activity in the U.S. On the other hand, we had strong premium revenue growth, enjoyed improved commercial P&C pricing globally, and produced record net investment income. Core operating income was $935 million and included $506 million of after-tax CAT losses, compared with a $1.5 billion income last year, which included a tax benefit of $450 million and tax of $331 million. Simply, to give you a sense of underlying strength, excluding CATs and the tax benefit, core operating income per share in the quarter was up 6.5% over prior. Our published P&C combined ratio was 93.1% and included 8.5 points of CATs on the combined. On a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined was 88.3% versus 86.4% prior year. The accident year was impacted in the quarter by elevated large loss activity in our U.S commercial property portfolio in both our major account and E&S businesses, as well as in our middle-market division. And this added about 1.4 points to our combined ratio. From what we can see, this is simply volatility or variability in a short period result, not a trend. We also continued to experience elevated losses in our U.S. homeowners\u2019 book, which we have discussed in some detail with you. We are on track with the pricing, product and underwriting strategies that we outlined on last quarter's call. Given, the state-by-state regulatory nature of this business, it\u2019ll take some time to show through in the results on a run rate basis. On the plus side of short-tail activity, our combined ratio in the quarter included a strong contribution from our crop insurance business as well as positive pretax prior period reserve development, which benefited by $130 million from a one-time reinsurance settlement in our legacy A&E runoff liabilities. Premium revenue growth in the quarter was 5.8% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact of 1.6 points, bringing the published growth to over 4%. The pricing environment overall improved over the third quarter in a number of our businesses. And this momentum continued into January with much better tone in actual rate movements compared to the fourth quarter prior year. In fact, in terms of price movement, globally, this was the best and most broad-based quarter of the year and the best in several years. We are also seeing more dislocation in certain markets and that means opportunity. For the full-year, our growth was 4.4%. Geo-economic environment notwithstanding, I expect we will at a minimum, maintain that range in constant dollars and with some variability quarter-to-quarter. There is a great deal of optimism and positive energy across the company. Net investment come in the quarter was $903 million, was up about 3.5% and contributed to net investment income for the year of $3.6 billion, both were records. Our results are being driven by strong positive cash flow and higher reinvestment rates that now exceed our current book yield and are beginning to benefit from an improving interest rate environment. Core operating income for the year was $4.4 billion or $9.44 per share, up 18% on a per share basis from \u201817. Earnings were split between P&C underwriting income of $2.6 billion and adjusted pretax investment income of $3.6 billion. For your information, pretax CAT losses for the year were $1.6 billion, about $700 million more than we planned for when calculating our expecting CAT amount. Our earnings led to a core operating ROE of 8.7% for the year or 9.8% on an expected CAT basis. For the year, the P&C combined ratio was 90.6% compared to 94.7% prior. And on a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, the combined ratio for the year was 88% versus 87.6% prior year. Book value per share was down about 0.5%, and tangible book per share was flat, unfavorably impacted by the mark-to-market effect of rising interest rates and foreign exchange. Adjusting for the mark, book and tangible per share were up 2.7% and 5.8%, respectively. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value CATs and prior very development. Turning to growth and market conditions. Commercial P&C pricing and underwriting for the business we wrote in the quarter, was as good or better than what we saw in the third quarter and overall for the year, and materially better than this time last year. The industry and Chubb is no exception, is experiencing margin pressure in numerous classes and an improving rate environment, particularly in the U.S. and the London wholesale market is important. I hope it continues to improve and spread because rate is needed in other markets. I mentioned at the opening that we began to see some signs of dislocation on the margin in the market as some carriers curved their appetite for certain lines of business by reduced line sizes or exiting from markets altogether. That's another marker of affirming or market correction. In North America, the positive pricing trends in the third quarter continued, in fact improved in several areas, particularly in our major accounts, retail and E&S wholesale divisions. Overall, rates in North America were up about 2.5%, the same as last quarter, while renewal price change, which includes exposure, was up 4%. Retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America commercial and personal P&C businesses. Renewal retention is measured by premium of nearly 92%. In major accounts in specialty which doesn't include agriculture, premiums were up 5%. Rates for major accounts were up over 3 with risk management at rates of less than 1%, while excess casualty rates were up 10%, property was up 12% and public D&O was up 8.5%. In our Westchester specialty business, rates were up 4.5%. In our North American middle-market and small commercial, premiums overall were up over 4.5% the quarter, our best growth in many quarters. New business was up almost 14% with a meaningful percentage of that coming from growth initiatives. Renewal retention in our middle-market business was 90%, middle-market pricing which includes rate and exposure change was up 2.5%. In our U.S. small commercial business, premium revenue continued its positive growth momentum with net premiums up almost 30%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums in the quarter declined 2.5%. In the quarter, we added California to our existing homeowners quota share treaty, effective 10/1. And this impacted growth by 4.2 points. Excluding premiums paid to reinsurers, premiums were up 2.3%. Retention remained very-strong at about 96%. Homeowners pricing was up 7.5% in the quarter, which included again, both rate and exposure change. Our North American agriculture business had a very good year, highlighted by a full-year combined ratio of 75.5%, which is about flat with prior of 74%. Our crop insurance business is a great franchise and we are the clearly leaders. Turning to our overseas general insurance operations, a $10 billion business. As I mentioned, we experienced excellent growth this quarter in our international P&C division. Net premiums written for our international retail division were up 8% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact of 4.5 points. This compared favorably to year-to-date constant dollar growth of about 6%. Growth was broad-based. Asia-Pacific and the Latin America grew 10% and 8.5% respectively, while the Continent was up over 5%, UK-Ireland was up 4%. We benefited from our growth initiatives and improved price environment, in certain markets, particularly London and Australia. Net premiums for our commercial P&C lines overall, international retail were up 8.5% in the quarter with strong growth in particular coming from our middle-market and small commercial initiatives. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 12% in the quarter in constant dollars. This business is growing again, on the back of improved pricing after several years of shrinking. It\u2019s an excellent example of how Chubb is nimble and can quickly take advantage of changing and dynamic market conditions. As for pricing conditions outside the U.S., rates in our international retail and London wholesale business vary by line and by country. Overall, rates in our retail were up 4%, the best in some time, though concentrated in a few countries and lines of business. For example, property was up 5% and professional lines were up 7%. Rates in our London wholesale business were up 10%. International personal lines premiums were up 8.5% in constant dollar, driven again by Asia and Latin America with growth of 19.5% and 9.5%, respectively. And finally, our Asia life insurance business had an excellent year with premium revenue of $2.4 billion and earnings of over $100 million. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump, Juan Andrade and Ed Clancy can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. In summary, Chubb performed quite well, despite a quarter of greater short-tail volatility. We have a good momentum and it\u2019s continuing to build in terms of executing on our growth initiatives and taking advantage of an improving pricing and underwriting environment in the U.S., London a few important territories. Our organization is optimistic about the year ahead, and we are off to a good start. With that, I'll turn over to Phil and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. We completed the year with a strong balance sheet and an excellent overall financial position with total capital of over $63 billion. Even with significant catastrophe loss payments, our operating cash flow was quite strong at $1.6 billion for the quarter and $5.5 billion for the year. During the quarter, we returned $654 million to shareholders including $336 million in dividends and $318 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned over $2.3 billion to shareholders, equaling 54% of our earnings, including over $1.3 billion in dividends and over $1 billion in share repurchases. Also, during the year, we issued $2.2 billion of debt in the European markets, paid off $1 billion of debt that matured throughout the year, and redeemed $1 billion of hybrid securities, which together, reduced our annual interest expense run rate by approximately $47 million. Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter were $958 million after-tax, which included $383 million of losses in the investment portfolio, reflecting the widening of credit spreads on corporate fixed income securities late in the quarter, partially offset by declining interest rates. Since December 31st, the mark-to-market gain on the portfolio is in excess of $900 million. We also had unrealized losses of $205 million related to the annual review of our retirement benefit plans and mark to market loss of $263 million on our variable annuity portfolio, principally driven by a decline in the equity markets, and $95 million loss from FX. Since December 31st, the mark on VA portfolio is a gain on $65 million. Since the Chubb acquisition, we have reduced our dilution on tangible book value per share from 29% to 9%, an improvement of 20 percentage points. Since December 31st, the dilution improved to 6%, based on market movements in the portfolio. If we had included the fair value mark on our private equity portfolio in our operating income as others do, core operating ROE for the year would have been 9.5% compared to the reported 8.7%. Our adjusted net investment income for the quarter was above our expected range due principally to higher private equity distributions and higher reinvestment rates. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including interest rates and private equity distributions, we now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million. We had a favorable prior period development in the quarter of $253 million pretax or $202 million after-tax. This includes pretax favorable prior period development from our legacy runoff exposures of $22 million, comprising adverse development of $108 million, principally related to asbestos, offset by a favorable reinsurance settlement of $130 million. The remaining favorable development of $231 million was split approximately 60% from long-tail lines, principally accident years 2013 and prior, and 40% from short-tail lines. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves decreased $661 million for the year, reflecting the impact of catastrophe loss payments and the impact of favorable prior period development. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 102% for the year. After adjusting for the items noted above, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 93%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 17.1%, driven in part by catastrophe losses, which were incurred in lower tax jurisdictions, as previously disclosed. Our full-year operating effective tax rate was 14.4%, in line with our range of 13% to 15%. For 2019, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. There has been a report that the tax deductibility of our intercompany debt will be affected by the provisions of the tax law that impact hybrid debt. That is not true. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point we'd be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll hear first from Kai Pan from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. Kai Pan : Thank you and good morning. Evan, you mentioned that the larger property loss in commercial line, you considered one-off. Can you give a little bit more details, what gives you confidence it\u2019s one-off rather than a trend? Evan Greenberg : There is just variability -- there was a variability of frequency in North America larger losses in a very short period of time. I mean, it\u2019s just a deviation, and it wasn't a huge number of losses but it has an impact. And, there is nothing we see in the underwriting that leads us to believe, and there is nothing we see in data that leads us to believe that\u2019s trend. It\u2019s just you can have quarter-to-quarter volatility, and we had more volatility. So, that\u2019s what I can tell you. And beyond that, we've been -- short-tail lines need rate. And we have been achieving rate full year, actually began in \u201817, and that continues into the first quarter and that too has an ameliorating impact. And in fact, we are achieving rate that achieves or exceeds trend. So, that\u2019s all beneficial. Kai Pan : My second question on the catastrophe losses. You mentioned that without catastrophe, your ROE would have been 9.8% for the year versus 8.7%. So, my calculation points to probably -- implies 4 points of normal CAT load. I just want to make sure my math is right. And also, given the elevated losses last few years, do you think that that\u2019s still a good run rate going forward? Are you taking any actions in terms of reinsurance coverage potentially could mitigate the CAT exposure? Evan Greenberg : We\u2019re constantly managing our portfolio and it\u2019s dynamic in terms of how we protect. And so, I\u2019m not going to give any forward-looking on that. But, that\u2019s something that we constantly are engaged in Kai. And as far as what to expect, look, we work on longer range period than just a couple of years and looking at what's expected CAT. So, the last two years have been elevated. People have short memories. I'll remind you that the four or five years prior to that, had far lower CATs. And yet we don\u2019t adjust the number of expected down to that; you're using a longer-term average, 10 to 15 years. The most recent years become a part of that average. And so, they reflect that experience for both modeled, and the way you project non-modeled and put a factor on that as well. And so, that's what informs how we look at CAT loss over a longer period. And so, it has more stability to the expected number. It\u2019s just editorialize one step further to imagine that well, the last two years, now climate change has arrived and boy, this is the new normal. Well, what would you have said about the four or five years prior to that? I think, it\u2019s simplistic thinking to imagine on that basis. I think, longer term averages have a bit more stability to them. It\u2019s sort of like the same as looking at quarterly result variability in short-tail versus looking at the annual current accident number, which is a far more credible number. Operator : We will hear next from Mike Zaremski from Credit Suisse. Mike Zaremski : Thanks. Good morning. A follow-up to the question on the CAT load. Given, there was a merger that took place, do you know -- could you tell us what your 10 to 15-year average has been? Because the math that some of us have done here points to the 10 to 15-year average being 30% or so above what your expectation was in 2018 in terms of the CAT load? Phil Bancroft : Well, I don't know what your math is; I can't comment on that. I only know how we do our own math and to imagine modeled and non-modeled loss. So, what I can\u2019t do is on this call engage in here is my math versus your math. But, you are free to call us and tell us about your math. And while some of this we disclose, some we don't, we\u2019ll discuss it with you. Mike Zaremski : And so, my next question is regarding relationship of commercial P&C pricing versus loss trends. We always appreciate your insights\u2026 Phil Bancroft : By the way, I\u2019m confident in my math. I just thought I\u2019d put that out to you. But, go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Okay. That\u2019s fair. So, yes, regarding pricing versus loss trend on the commercial side, we\u2019re always trying to parse whether you feel the -- clearly improving rate environment is largely due to just the industry reacting to higher loss trends or do you feel that Chubb could potentially see some margin improvement, if commercial rate environment hovers around the current levels? Evan Greenberg : No, I don\u2019t see an improvement. Mike Zaremski : That\u2019s simple answer. And maybe one quick follow-up to that, some -- is number of [multiple speakers]. That\u2019s fair. One more in, a lot of management teams including yourself have talked about a more legal -- active legal bar, and some teams have also talked about the rise of third-party capital backing lawsuits, some people call litigation finance or finding. Do you think that having -- that asset class is having impact on the insurance industry\u2019s loss trends? Evan Greenberg : On the margin, I think only on the margin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will hear from Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question is going back to where Kai was asking about the higher non-CAT property losses in commercial lines. I know you made the comment that it seemed just due to the variability to be a one-off quarter. Did you see non-CAT property elevated in any of the other quarters of \u201818? And then, could you also give us a sense -- I know it\u2019s only one month and we\u2019re just into February. Do you have a sense that the level of losses reverted back to normal in January? Evan Greenberg : Yes. The answer on January is, yes. But Jesus, it\u2019s one month and hardly a credible period. And to answer your other question, it was basically fourth quarter. We saw little bit in late third quarter occur, and then it was fourth quarter. And January, sure -- but that's a fool's game. And by the way, Elyse, you\u2019re really -- when you\u2019re looking at something like property, and let\u2019s keep in prospective, we write -- what, in North America about $4 billion -- sorry, about $2.4 billion of property business. So, a very large portfolio, we have a lot of experience with it. The variability quarter-to-quarter is not that unusual. Obviously, it's a short period of time. It's not that credible. The annual period is far more credible. Anyway, I think I\u2019ve answered your questions. And please don't take one month of January, better as well; it was -- it\u2019s a month. Elyse Greenspan : I get that. That was helpful. And then, in terms of homeowners, you pointed during your prepared remarks, it takes time for with the states to get the rates into the system. Would you expect to start to see the margin improve in the first quarter or is that something that we should start to think about seeing more of the underlying margin improvement coming later in 2019. Phil Bancroft : We were pretty clear when we talked about it in the third quarter to you that it would be something in the latter part of \u201819, we should begin to see it come through on a run rate basis, all things being equal. Elyse Greenspan : And then, my last numbers question, you guys bought more reinsurance timely for in California this year, at the start of the quarter. Can you give us a sense of your gross losses for the California fires? And then, how did the gross loss in 2018 compared to the gross losses that you guys saw from the fires in 2017? Evan Greenberg : We didn\u2019t -- and it was really a miscommunication in here. We didn't publish a CAT page but we are going to give you a CAT page and put one out to you, so you can see by CAT how it breaks down, and we're giving you the net. The gross number is not applicable really to an investor's view of the company, and that is what impacts our balance sheet and financial statement. And so, we will give you what you need for that. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Paul Newsome from Sandler O'Neill. Paul Newsome : I was hoping you could maybe just add on to the high net worth environment. We still seem to have -- personal lines front -- we seem to have still a large number of new entrants into that market. I\u2019m just interested if there's been any really change in that competitive environment, seeing how it does feel like there is a lot of folks that are announcing new efforts? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019ll ask Paul Krump to comment on that. From my point of view, we don't see a change of any consequence in the competitive environment over the last year. It\u2019s pretty stable that way. You get new entrants who come in and they are particularly in the mass affluent category, not the true high net worth. They don't have the coverages and the services and the capabilities to really manage that market. And when they come in, they got one thing to offer in a segment of the market that is I would say, in some ways -- it\u2019s the price-sensitive end of the market. And in there where coverage matters or service matters less, on that one way and that\u2019s to under price the business. But we\u2019ve seen that for a while and it\u2019s on the margin. But, Paul, do you want\u2026 Paul Krump : Evan, I agree with everything you just said. Just to try to put some more color around it. Our retention in the homeowners and PRS space is 96%, it\u2019s actually even better on the high net worth, the real wealthy homes, what will recall premier and signature. So, we do lose a couple of customers through that, and we\u2019re trying to figure out how to stop that but can\u2019t. So, I can\u2019t -- maybe on two hands I could count the number of accounts that we lost to any new entrants in the last 12 months. They are definitely going after the low-end of the market. And if you look at the writings, I think you'd be shocked that how little traction they are getting in new market. It really is a service game and agents and brokers are very conscious of that. It\u2019s not just one-off fire loss they worry about, they worry about what happens in the big capitals and then there are hundreds if not thousands of claims to handle. Evan Greenberg : And I would say this. We don\u2019t -- we're not arrogant about it, we\u2019re not at rest about it. It\u2019s like everything else in the world. Service has to constantly improve; your standards of service must constantly improve. Coverages have to be constantly improved. You\u2019ve to be able to offer more choice to customers. Some who want to buy a full boat of coverage and some who want to buy something a little later. And you\u2019ve got to be able to do this in a digital world where the customer service and experience represents that. And the same thing with marketing and sales. And we\u2019re continuing to iterate and crank up our capabilities in all of those areas because we think there is -- and remains a large opportunity in this marketplace. Paul Newsome : And second, I wanted to ask about the accident health business. We haven't talked about that in quite some time. At one point it was a huge focus for the old Chubb to have it, I think as much as 25% of the revenue\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I think you mean\u2026 Paul Newsome : You\u2019re right. And I was curious is that -- is it still an idea to have or a goal to have that kind of high percentage of the -- in each business in the new combined entity? Evan Greenberg : Yes. When you look at -- which I know you did, our investor deck and you look at growth lines, and I believe from memory, 31% on pie chart that would grow high single to double digit, you saw the accident health business as one of those areas of business. And in Asia and Latin America and in North America, in particular, the growth rate is improving in that business and will continue to improve in \u201819. And a lot of the distribution that we have, deals that we have made over the last year, including what we just announced as Banco de Chile, will directly benefit that accident and health business. And so, it is a growth area for the Company. And our objective is to increase because if it is growing at high single to double-digit, it will increase -- continue to increase as a percentage of our total business. Because it\u2019s a specialty and a capability of ours; it\u2019s deep in our DNA. And by the way, whether it is in the combined, in the U.S. where we reinvented in our growing, our worksite benefits businesses, it\u2019s now $150 million premium from nothing that\u2019s growing at serious double-digit to serving the lower middle income with -- to grab, which is the largest -- which is the Uber of Southeast Asia or DBS\u2019s customer or Banamex\u2019s customers or Banco de Chile or many other sponsors that we have on a direct marketing and digital basis, it\u2019s the full boat. Operator : Moving next to Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Two questions on North America commercial. So, the first, I just want to confirm that the 1.4% impact from adverse property claims experience or loss experience, that\u2019s consolidated, right? Evan Greenberg : Consolidated? Phil Bancroft : On total P&C. Yaron Kinar : Total P&C, sorry. Evan Greenberg : Sorry. Yes on total P&C. Yes, we did post the number. Yaron Kinar : So, if my math is correct, it would suggest that the accident year loss ratio excluding the elevated property office actually improved year-over-year. And if that is correct, could you maybe talk about what's led to that improvement? Is it earned rates, is it something else that\u2019s driving that? Evan Greenberg : Are you saying the accident loss ratio on the total business? Yaron Kinar : No, on North America commercial, excluding the property deterioration. Evan Greenberg : Excluding the property deterioration, and are you looking at the combined ratio or the loss ratio? Yaron Kinar : No. The accident year loss ratio for North America commercial. Evan Greenberg : We will take that offline with you and go through that with you. I'm not sure I'm completely relating to that number, the way you\u2019re saying it. And it would be very modest and it would be likely mixed related. But before I jump to that we\u2019ll take that off line with you. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. I appreciate that. And then, my second question on North America commercial, Evan, in your comments, you talked about the rate increases. It sounds to me like you may be actually leading the rate increases here, maybe a little bit above industry here. And if that is the case, would you expect that to impact the growth -- the top line growth over the next few quarters as maybe the industry tries to catch up? Evan Greenberg : A couple of things. One, the industry -- I would glue it together this way. You saw the fourth quarter growth rate. And in January, our growth relative to our own plans was good. And we were on or over or exceeded our plan in the first -- in the month of January. You don\u2019t know our plan and we don\u2019t disclose it. And, we got better rate in January or the same rate; it varied by line that we -- particularly in North America and in our wholesale business that we saw in the fourth quarter. And our renewal retention is good. So that implies to me the industry environment is improving as well. And you have a couple of things going on. You have not just driving for rate but you companies reacting to the loss environment, to the pressure by reducing limits in areas or competitors depends on the area withdrawing from a line of business. That starts to -- that plays with the supply-demand part of the dynamic of the market. Okay? So, you\u2019re only thinking just in terms of rate. And that\u2019s why it is trying to signal that there is more than that going on. But, you see our retention rates, you see our business, and yet we\u2019re pressing for rate adequacy. Anyway, I think, that's the best way I can explain it to you. Operator : Jay Gelb from Barclays, your line is open. Jay Gelb : Based on the commentary that Chubb is off to a good start in 2019, and if I look back over the past three years, there is remarkably stable underlying accident year combined ratio. Given the pricing is improving, should we expect that trend on the accident year combined to be the same in 2019, the same or better as 2018? Evan Greenberg : I wouldn't look for an improvement. What I have said is that remarkably stable. Remarkably stable rate on some of the business, particularly in short-tail is achieving or exceeding trend, which it needs to do, which is beneficial. In long-tail lines, it varies. There are many classes where rate is not keeping pace with loss cost trend. We constantly are exercising portfolio management, used reinsurance and mix, and so therefore mix of business to balance it. But, this is a risk business. And I wouldn't imagine -- and I don't imagine that you just pick a combined ratio and that's a static number. It has variability around it. And so, I would say, what you see is what you get within a reasonable range of deviation. That\u2019s all. Jay Gelb : Right, of course, okay. And then, separately, given the strong operating cash flow for full-year 2018, I believe you said around $5.5 billion, what would you quantify as Chubb\u2019s excess capital position as of year-end? Phil Bancroft : What we have said is that the impact of the excess capital on a full-year basis would strip about 0.5 point off of our ROE. So, you can do the math. Jay Gelb : I hope so. Phil Bancroft : I trust you buddy. Operator : We\u2019ll hear next from Brian Meredith from UBS. Brian Meredith : Just first one, Phil, I\u2019m just curios, tax rate guidance; it looks like it\u2019s actually up a little bit on year-over-year basis. Is there anything to that; is it just mix business, something else going on geographically? Phil Bancroft : There is two things. One is, in the past two years, we\u2019ve had some compensated related deductions, and we don't expect them -- compensation related deductions that we don\u2019t expect to recur. And we\u2019re going to have lower tax exempt income. We\u2019ve sold about $4.4 billion of our municipal bond portfolio. And as we look at the after-tax yields, we would expect that some of that will continue. Remember, that doesn\u2019t take away from our income because our after-tax yield is going to be higher based on the judgment to sell the munies. Brian Meredith : Got it, makes sense. And then, I noticed that administrative expenses on a year-over-year basis were actually down this quarter. Was that FX-driven, was there anything else going on? Phil Bancroft : It\u2019s principally just timing, as we look at it. There is nothing specific that I would point to, it\u2019s just going to be variable and it\u2019s a timing issue. Brian Meredith : And just lastly, Evan, on the small commercial property thing. If I take a look at your North American commercial, your underlying combined ratio for the year was pretty much flat to down modestly. Is that the way we should kind of think about how the business is going to perform? And you\u2019ll have some ups and downs every quarter, I assume. Evan Greenberg : Yes. You should think about it and you can see it, if you look at past years. There is a variability -- there is a little more in this quarter than it is in the recent quarters. But, you\u2019ll have some variability by the nature of the business. It\u2019s a risk business. So, that can just happen. Of course, we\u2019re underwriters. And when we see a spike in something, we take a pretty close look. We want to know what an early -- what that\u2019s telling us and is it -- is there something that is changed in our business or is it just a natural variability that you continue. But we more judge then on a longer period and at an annual period of time it\u2019s a more stable measure obviously than one three-month period. And so, again when we look at this, we judge it from everything we can see as just a deviation around the mean, and the annual was more stable period. Look, I expect and it doesn't surprise me, given the nature of the business. It\u2019s a risk business that you see some variability. Brian Meredith : I just want to make sure because if you strip out that\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Casualty? I got to tell you, I have a whole different view [multiple speakers] one-off large loss of some kind. But, if I saw a frequency or casualty, that\u2019s a whole different story. Brian Meredith : That makes sense, because you strip out that large loss all of a sudden, your underlying combined ratio in North America looks way down on a year-over-year basis. And I just want to make sure, that\u2019s not kind of way to model off of. Evan Greenberg : Yes. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right way. And we will take it offline and do some work with you about those. Operator : We will hear next from Meyer Shields from KBW. Meyer Shields : I just wanted to follow up on Brian\u2019s question, we saw particularly lower admin expenses year-over-year in North America commercial and personal. Is that also just randomness or is there some connection to the elevated losses? Evan Greenberg : No, no connection to the elevated losses. It is a randomness, quarter-to-quarter. Meyer Shields : And Evan, I was hoping you could take us through the thought process of buying more quota share protection in California homeowners over excess? Evan Greenberg : Well, we -- it benefited the Company. Look, we wanted to reduce our exposure and balance our exposure in California where we have a lot of concentration in both CAT and non- CAT modeled and non-modeled CAT. We did -- the quarter share was initially purchased for the New England states and the Northeast where we had -- we have an usual amount of concentration. We weren\u2019t simply trying to balance CAT but the exposures of non-modeled CAT is well like, just frequency of winter losses that you had in the Northeast and the impact it could have on the total book when we put all these books together. So, it was really looking for to spread the risk of the ground up concentration, not simply a single event concentration, or the losses produced because of the concentration from a single event. And that was the reason for purchasing the Northeast quota share. And it made sense to us to extend that then to California as well. And we gave the reinsurers a better balance; they were concentrated in just one territory. Operator : Larry Greenberg from Janney Montgomery Scott, your line is now open. Larry Greenberg : My question also is on the underlying and commercial North America, and you\u2019ve probably given me enough to answer it. But I\u2019m going to still ask... Evan Greenberg : Then, why you\u2019re asking me, Larry. Larry Greenberg : Because I\u2019m not sure if I know the answer. But, let me just ask it this way. The underlying loss ratio deteriorated by about 60 bps for the year. And over the course of the year, you've called out some things, you actually called out some things last year as well. But, would you say the 60 bps is fairly representative of the price versus lost trends in the business? Evan Greenberg : Perfect, perfect. Larry Greenberg : Okay, thanks. Evan Greenberg : There is gravity. Yes. Larry Greenberg : Okay. And then, the expense ratio improved more this year than at least I was thinking. And I would say, maybe you guys had indicated coming out of last year. And is that just kind of operating leverage in the business, are there any other explanations to discuss there? Evan Greenberg : Larry, there is -- I\u2019m going to give you three answers. Number one, we had the runoff, if you will, of all the projects we have put in place since the merger. And those had some runoff final benefits that emerged in the year. We have a constant expense control in here. And yes, there is one-off items that benefit the expense ratio during the year. But, every year we have one-off items. They vary by quarter and that sort of thing. But, there always seems to be a number of them; it\u2019s just the nature of the business. So, but the first two I gave you are really the enduring drivers of it. Expense ratio is part of strategy. Operator : And at this time, we do have time for one final question and that final question will come from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Just a couple for Evan. I guess, first of all, thinking about casualty line in North America commercial, how do you feel about loss trend today versus maybe a year ago? Do you feel like there is more pressure, is the pressure alleviated some? Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s about stable. We haven't seen -- over the last year, we haven't seen a change in loss trend from... Ryan Tunis : Is it still mostly limited to the management liability lines or have you seen it creep at all into excess casualty or... Evan Greenberg : No, not -- the way you\u2019re asking it, I want to make sure we have clarity here. What you're asking about change in loss trend, and I'm responding to change in loss trend but -- and that\u2019s stable. But, there is a loss trend to every line of casualty. I mean, I could tell you that middle-market, our comp business, the frequency is stable, so is the loss -- the severity trend but it has a trend of calling our book of over 5 points -- 5%. So, it\u2019s real. Excess casualty, excess casualty has a loss trend to it, whether it's major account or it\u2019s middle-market, all casualty does. And so, loss costs go up every year. But, the trend is stable. Ryan Tunis : The trend is stable. Got you. And on the personal line side, I appreciate it\u2019s going to take some time for your rate increases to earn in. But, would you say the loss activity has -- is that still getting worse at this point and you\u2019re still kind of trying to pin that down... Evan Greenberg : No. I would say and we were just looking at it yesterday, looking month by month actuals versus expected. The frequency and severity, average severities by cause of loss, we believe they have stabilized; we\u2019re seeing it stabilized. We're not still trying to get a handle on it. It has stabilized, we see it. And it is a clear trend we have seen for a period of time. And so, we know the target we\u2019re shooting at. Operator : And at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to your host, Karen Beyer. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : That does conclude today's teleconference. We thank you all for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's March 31, 2019 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. See our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us today to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, I'll turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had a very good first quarter, highlighted by good underwriting results, strong premium revenue growth globally, and the best pricing environment in U.S. and London wholesale market in maybe 5 years. Core operating income of $2.54 per share was up 8.5% from prior year. Book and tangible book value per share were up 4.3% and about 7% respectively in the quarter. We reported a P&C combined ratio of 89.2%, which included 3.8 points of CAT losses, and favorable prior period reserve development of 3.1 points, to $104 million pre-tax. On a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the P&C combined ratio was 88.5%, simply world class. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CAT, prior period reserve development. P&C premium revenue growth in the quarter, in constant dollars was quite strong, and frankly, better than we anticipated in our plans for the quarter. Net premiums grew just over 5%. Our foreign exchange given the strength of the dollar then had a negative impact of 2.2 percentage points. During the quarter and through April, the pricing environment continued to improve with overall price change in North America on a written basis equaled the loss cost trend. In addition to property, pricing improved throughout the quarter in many casualty related areas including general casualty, both primary and excess, and D&O and professional lines. Renewal price change, which includes both rate and exposure, was up over 5%. Retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses, with renewal retention as measured by premium of over 94%. In major accounts in specialty commercial, excluding agriculture, premiums were up 4%. Renewal price change for major accounts was 4.8%, with risk management pricing up 5%, excess casualty up 7% and property up nearly 9%. Public D&O rates increased 5.5%. In our Westchester E&S business, renewal pricing was up 8%. Turning to our middle market and small commercial business in North America, premiums overall were up about 6.5%, our strongest quarter in terms of growth since the merger. New business was up 13% and renewal retention in our middle market business was over 91%. Middle market pricing was up 3%. And excluding workers' comp, it was up 4.2%, again, that's the best we've seen in a number of years. The middle market pricing for primary casualty, pricing was up about 7%. Excess umbrella was up 4.3%, and D&O was up 9%. In our U.S. small commercial business, premium revenue continued its positive growth momentum, with net premiums up over 40%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written in the quarter were up 1%, adjusted for the expanded quota share session we discussed last quarter, net premiums were up about 2.5%. Retention remained quite strong at over 96%, with homeowners pricing was up over 8% in the quarter. Turning to Overseas General Insurance operations, we had reasonable growth, which we expect to accelerate as the year moves along, particularly in Asia. Net premiums written for our international retail division were up 5.7% in constant dollar. And FX then had a negative impact of 5.8 percentage points. Growth was led by Latin America, premiums up almost 13%, while premiums in Europe were up 4.2%, and Asia was up 4% or 8% adjusting for a onetime positive item last year. International growth in the quarter was driven by both commercial and consumer lines. Consumer lines were up 6%, personal lines were up 5% and driven by Latin America growth of 17.5% and A&H was up 5%, driven by double-digit growth in both Latin America and Japan. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up nearly 15% in the quarter in constant dollar. As I noted last quarter, this business is growing again on the back of improved pricing after several years of shrinking. Pricing conditions in our international retail and London wholesale businesses vary by line and by country. Overall rates in our retail were up 2%, while rates in London wholesale open market business were up over 8%. Property up over 8%, financial lines up 13% and marine up about 6.5%, and finally aviation up 18%. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. Since the beginning of the year, we've completed a couple of important transactions that represent important opportunities, which will feed growth in the future. In January, we entered into a 15-year exclusive distribution agreement with Banco de Chile. The largest bank based in that country. We will distribute life and general insurance products to their customers throughout their branches, telemarketing and digital channels. Banco de Chile has a long track record, it successfully marketing insurance to its more than 2 million banking customers. In March, we received approval to increase our ownership in Huatai Insurance Group, a holding company of P&C, life and asset management subsidiaries. Huatai Group's insurance operations have more than 600 branches and 11 million customers. With our increased stake, Huatai Group became the first domestic Chinese financial services holding company to convert to a foreign invested joint venture. Our increased ownership is an important milestone towards our future goal of majority ownership. In closing, we're off to a good start to the year. We're achieving increased growth in many of our businesses globally and momentum continues to build, a benefit of our broadly diversified presence and capabilities. We are experiencing continued and even accelerated pricing increases. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil numbering back and take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. We are starting out the year in an exceptionally strong financial position. We have a very strong balance sheet to support our business activities with total capital exceeding $65 billion. We also have a $105 billion portfolio of cash and investments, it's highly rated in liquid and we generated operating cash flow of $1.3 billion in the quarter. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we've returned $702 million to shareholders, including $335 million in dividends and $367 million in share repurchases. Though yesterday, we repurchased shares for over $435 million and an average price of $134.17 per share. Since the Chubb acquisition, we have reduced our dilution on tangible book value per share from 29% to about 2.5%. Our annualized core operating ROE was 9.2% and our annualized core operating return on tangible equity was 15.1%. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were $1.6 billion after-tax. There was a gain of $1.4 billion in the investment portfolio due to decline in interest rates and $50 million gain from our variable annuity portfolio, primarily from the improvement in the equity markets. We also had a gain of $150 million from FX. The current quarter investment income of $882 million was within our previously communicated range. We continue to expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be in the range of $880 million to $890 million. As a remainder, as we discussed previously, we reduced the utilization of our cash liquidity program. On a basis of utilization comparable to last year's first quarter, our investment income would have been $902 million, $20 million higher than reported this quarter. And our interest expense would have been $165 million, also $20 million higher than reported in the quarter. Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $250 million, 90% from weather-related events in the U.S. and the balance from international events, primarily in Australia. The catastrophe losses were about 20% higher than we expected, which was worth about $0.06 on our EPS. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $240 million - $204 million pre-tax or $161 million after-tax, which included $61 million pre-tax related to the 2018 crop year loss estimates. The remaining favorable development is split approximately 60% from short-tail lines and 40% long-tail, primarily from accident years 2014 and prior. Net loss reserves increased $39 million or decrease $63 million on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of prior period development and catastrophe and crop insurance payments in the quarter. Underlying reserves increased about $560 million. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 98% for the quarter. After adjusting for the items noted previously, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 86%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.7%, which is in line with our expected range of 14% to 16%. I'll turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good - thank you. Good morning. My first question just, Evan, going back to some of your pricing and loss cost commentary from your prepared remarks, in North America specifically you said that written rate is now equal to loss trend. In your annual letter that recently came out, you did say that pricing in the U.S. and some other market is not keeping pace with loss trend. So is that something that we saw change towards the end of the quarter and into April? If you could just expand on that and then give us your view for the rate versus trend that you see over the balance of this year. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. First of all, I'll answer your last part. I hardly - if I had that insight, I wouldn't be doing this job if I could read the future that way, Elyse, I would probably be in Vegas. But when I wrote my shareholder letter, it was about 2018 year, and it wasn't about the first quarter of 2019. And in 2019, in fact, in the first quarter, in total, all lines aggregated, rate on a written basis equaled loss cost trend and that is a change. The rate of increase is accelerating in short-tail and long-tail lines in the United States and in London wholesale in particular. Elyse Greenspan : Does this feel like a market, where when you think, obviously, you don't want to project going forward? But does this feel like we're starting to get into a market where we can think about seeing some underlying margin improvement given that you made a point of saying that things really improved as we got into April? Evan Greenberg : Well, I didn't say they really improved. I said, they continue to improve. And I don't want to prognosticate the future. Frankly, Chubb runs a world-class combined ratio. And if we can continue to achieve rate that equals loss cost trend in areas that are adequately priced, that's brilliant. If we can achieve rate in excess of loss cost trend in those areas that need rate, because margin is not adequate, that too is the objective, and we'll how it plays out and whether it continues to accelerate. I like the tone of the market. I like what I see and what I feel. It's rational and I see what appears to be continued forward momentum. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks, and then a couple of just quick numbers questions. Evan Greenberg : And that's particularly in large account and in E&S business. Middle market, I would make the same comment, but it is not at the same rate of change that I observe in large account and E&S and that is wholesome as I think I can be with you. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. That's very helpful. And then a couple of quick numbers questions for Phil. Can we get the FX impact on EPS in the quarter? Philip Bancroft : Well, it was $23 million. Evan Greenberg : We gave it on the first page of the press release. Philip Bancroft : Yeah. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. Philip Bancroft : $23 million was the - that's on core operating income and it was about $18 million on underwriting. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. Evan Greenberg : And the percentage points are right on the first page of the press release. Elyse Greenspan : And then, my last question, Phil, you said that net investment income and interest expense kind of had offsetting impacts of the $20 million. Is the Q1 interest expense the right way to think about using that number as a run rate? Philip Bancroft : Yes, I would say that, I would use the netted number, right. So the - I would take $20 million out of the number that I gave for both investment income and for interest expense. Evan Greenberg : You would add it to investment income. You'd take it away from interest expense. Philip Bancroft : Interest income will down to the range of [80 to 890] [ph]. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Philip Bancroft : And I take it out of interest expense. Evan Greenberg : Correct. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. That's very helpful. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : Thanks. Thank you and good morning. For the Chubb team, there's been a number of fairly significant aircrafts, terrorism and likely ongoing cyber claims in the industry. Can you talk about how you manage those exposures and maybe your typical net risk after reinsurance protection on those types of risks? Evan Greenberg : Well, you're talking about a variety of classes and we don't talk about - I'm not sure we're going to answer much of your question. We don't talk about individual losses. And the net limits we retain per risk really vary by risk and by class of business. And that's not something we really disclose and talk much about. But it's all - it is all rolled up. All the experience related to loss events are all rolled up in that combined ratio you're looking at. Jay Gelb : It would be fair to say though, Evan, right, that it's - reinsurance is probably a significant risk mitigation factor in those type of exposures? Evan Greenberg : Not necessarily. You don't know what risks we're on. And so, you're referring right now Boeing and then certain cyber events. And those are just individual insureds. And we're not - and some of them we're on and some of them we have modest exposures, some we have more exposure. It varies a whole lot. Jay Gelb : Okay. Fair enough. Evan Greenberg : But I have to say this. There is nothing we see in losses occurring in the industry that gives us any pause about Chubb's underwriting of any of those risks. Jay Gelb : Understood, okay. And then\u2026 Evan Greenberg : We do - we're underwriters, so we do post-claim underwriting reviews, when we see losses come in and we're in the business of losses. And what we really look for is are we proud of the underwriting, do we think the judgments and the appetite were correct, and the pricing was and the terms and conditions, and there's nothing in what we've seen that gives us pause. Jay Gelb : I see. Okay. The broader question I had was, clearly, there is some favorable momentum in primarily commercial lines. If 2019 is not a major CAT year like we saw in the past two years, which I believe was the largest ever two-year period for the industry in terms of catastrophe experience. Do you believe that this positive price momentum can persist, if it is not a big CAT year, this year? Evan Greenberg : I do. Because - look, time will tell. But I frankly do, because this is becoming casualty driven. And remember casualty entails insurance companies, not short-tail property. And casualty, you just all casualty related, so I'm using the term in a broad way with the exception of one or two classes, rate and loss cost trends have been going in the opposite direction. And loss cost trend depending on the class and the jurisdiction have worsened in some cases, because there is more pressure, because of the things that we know. And the industry has experienced in that. And I think many are just waking up to the results that are emerging for behaviors that have occurred over a number of years. So I think this is a rational reaction and I imagine it to continue. Jay Gelb : Thank you, Evan. Does that mean that for maybe some of your weaker position competitors that they haven't trued up with their underwriting reserve position might be, if it's going to be the casualty-driven term? Evan Greenberg : Well, you have to ask them. I'm not - I really can't speculate on that, because I don't know what they know and don't know. Jay Gelb : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : If they all want to share their books with me, I'll tell you. Operator : And our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yeah. Thank you. Thanks. A couple of questions here for you. First one, I just notice North America, a big increase in the amount of ceded reinsurance. Did you change reinsurance buying habits this year? Evan Greenberg : No. We didn't change. So that would just be idiosyncratic to the business in the quarter. Brian Meredith : Okay. Just allocation and stuff like that\u2026 Evan Greenberg : No. Risk management or crop insurance adjustments or any of that. Brian Meredith : Okay. Okay. Excellent. And then, Evan, my second question\u2026 Evan Greenberg : And then you do know though on personal lines we increased the quota share. Brian Meredith : Right. Right. I was looking more\u2026 Evan Greenberg : We [expanding] [ph] the quota share, as we told you last quarter that has an impact on that line of business. It's not that material to the overall North America. Brian Meredith : Got you. Got you. I was looking more into your North America commercial operations. It was like 18.5% increase in ceded premium? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Not just - that's just the timing quarter-to-quarter. Brian Meredith : Great. Great. And then I'm just curious, you're making a lot of contingent investments in emerging growth areas, China, et cetera. What are the margins on that business like versus your - kind of overall business? Is it better or worse? How should we think about that potentially over the long-term impacting your business? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. I think, when you look at the - it varies. When you look at something like Banco de Chile or Banamex or some of the major bank related distribution agreements we have made. Those are at the kind of business that produces is at the lower end of our combined ratio of range. By the nature of the business, its consumer business and small commercial and accident and health, et cetera. China - and we're not consolidating China now, I hope that will occur in the medium-term, when we cross the majority ownership market. We're in the midst of our activity in front of us is to acquire more ownership. We're engaged in that activity though I can't give a precise timing. The life business is a fast growing business, and it is generating. It is now turning the corner and beginning to generate positive GAAP earnings, and I believe the biggest opportunity in China is Life Insurance. Brian Meredith : Okay. Evan Greenberg : Just given them to macro. And we've got licenses, Huatai Life has licenses in all - in fundamentally, all the provinces. And the majority of those offices of 600 or life-related got 43,000 agents. Though, for China, that's small. I can imagine a company with 250,000. It would be years from now. The P&C business will run a combined ratio that will produce an underwriting profit. And it will - it won't be Chubb's average combined - the average of Chubb's combined ratio. It will be at the higher-end spectrum likely for a while. But that has - that too has very good potential. And I think, when I think of it in the early days right now. As we - when I say early days, the next few years. I imagine that when we consolidate, it will be at least neutral to our ROE. Brian Meredith : Okay. And does that also go for the PICC relationship we have. Evan Greenberg : Well, the PICC relationship is different. That's a venture to where we're like really the international arm of the PICC. Our Chinese business, it's overseas. And we do with the underwriting and the servicing and they do the marketing and relationship and sales side of it, and we share the business together. Brian Meredith : Okay. Got you. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Philips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Phillips : Thank you. Good morning. I kind of want to touch this. A lot of comments on the rates and how they changed now or at the point where as you say were equal to loss cost trend. And it kind of a follow-up, I guess, to Jay Gelb's question a second ago. Maybe you could spend a little more time talking - help us understand the other side of equation, the loss cost trends. You said it worsened this year. It's casualty driven. And the rates and loss cost are moving in the opposite direction, and now it's not the case. But can you talk a little bit more about what you see in the loss cost? Where are they worsened, and maybe just more to the extent that they are worse this year versus last year? Evan Greenberg : I did not say they're worse this year than last year. So please listen to what\u2026 Michael Phillips : No. Right. Loss cost trends, it worsened, I heard you said them. Okay. Evan Greenberg : No. No. I did not say they worsened. So again, please, you'll read the transcript and the question, I didn't say that. I said the overall - overall loss cost is behaving. We haven't seen a deterioration in overall loss cost trend. I was speaking about there are specific classes and that it's a mixed bag of some behaving, some not. And when you rapid altogether, I don't see a deterioration in the overall. But I did say these rates have not kept pace with loss cost in a number of years. And that naturally from the math is pretty simple as to what that equals. It equals margin pressure. And if you don't have margin pressure then I guarantee you've got reserve pressure. And that the industry is response to that, right now, I think, is rational. And I see it having legs based on all I know right now. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you for that clarification. I appreciate it. I guess, just a quick numbers question on the reserve side. Do you have any exposure to what - I guess, what [Travers had mentioned for that] [ph] Child Victims Act in New York, and so were there any reserves because of that? Evan Greenberg : No. Mike, you want to\u2026 Michael Smith : Sure. Evan, you'll recall, we recorded additional IBNR in the fourth quarter response to the difficult environment around molestation and abuse. That was not specifically related to the Child Victims Act, but it was in part a response to the trend in certain states to introduce revival legislation. By the way, I should also remind you a large number of states don't constitutionally allow for such legislation. At the New York, specifically, it's a fluid situation, it's too early predict the outcomes of any claims since the statue doesn't even take effect until August. So therefore, it's really premature to talk about in the potential impact. Michael Phillips : Okay. Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question comes from Jay Cohen of Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. Jay Cohen : Thank you. Yeah, just a quick one on the Overseas General business, the - there was the - the development was very minimal in the quarter. I just didn't know if you had any exposure to spillover from events that occurred in 2018? Evan Greenberg : No. We did not, Jay. We don't actually review much in the way of reserves in Overseas General in the first quarter. It's a couple of regions, there are short-tail business that we review in the quarter. And so you see that sometime just bounce around a bit. But nothing - there was no development in the quarter and we had no [jebby] [ph] development. By the way, which is what everyone's trying to talk about. Jay Cohen : Exactly. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question comes from Yaron Kinar from Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. First question is around the normalized CAT load. So I think you said that CATs were about $20 million in excess of your expectations. I think that gets about 3.5% CAT load\u2026 Evan Greenberg : It was 20% more than our expectation. Yaron Kinar : Oh, 20%. Evan Greenberg : Right. Yaron Kinar : Okay. I missed that. Okay. That's helpful. And is there a reason that you stopped offering the normalized CAT load in the supplement? Evan Greenberg : The normalized - oh, the ROE normalized CAT load? John? John Keogh : We decided to put it into the commentary. There was no conscious\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Yeah, there was nothing - yeah, there was no signal there that we - yeah. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Okay. Evan Greenberg : There was nothing like we were - we had some change of philosophy or this or that. It wasn't - it was an item that we put in, particularly when we saw - when there was elevated CATs of significance, where it was a real CAT event quarter. And we just didn't see it this quarter is that. That's all. Yaron Kinar : Fair. And given this quarter was ratably benign quarter from an industry perspective from a CAT load perspective. I guess, I was just a little bit surprised to see the CAT load being kind of close to 4% for the quarter. Are you still comfortable with your longer-term guidance or targets of under 4% for the year? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. I - we are - we really are and when you think about how we do, which we've been quite transparent and we think that The Street's estimate are a pretty good proxy for what is our own work on expected CAT. And the way it's done. We model, obviously, the perils that have good models, hurricane and earthquake have reasonable models and we model our exposure based on that. And then, on non-model, tornado activity and flood and the like we look at long-term averages. We trend them, we adjust for our exposure. We adjust for reinsurance. And when you bake all that in, The Street's summary is pretty good. When I look at the number over our quote on quote expected. And expected is a quarter. In a quarter, you're just going to have volatility around that. And by the way on any annual basis, of course, you're going to have volatility. You're never - it's so hard that you're going to hit the actual expected. You're either going to be under it a little bit, you're going to be over it a little bit. I mean, that's just real world. And in any quarter, you're going to have a little volatility. Some of that was international related, because we had Australia. And I don't think - I'm not sure how you guys think about all that. And then, the balance was just in the homeowners' line and the winter storms that occurred and that's about it. So it didn't fuss us at all as we looked at it. And it didn't have us re-imagine CAT losses on an expected basis. Yaron Kinar : Okay. That's helpful. And then when I look at the expense ratio and overseas general and global reinsurance, it seems to go up a little bit. Is that just business mix shift? Is there an FX impact there? Could you maybe walk us through what drove the increase? Evan Greenberg : Yeah, in overseas general, very simple, last year we had onetime items that benefited, and they were all around pension and compensation. And they were one time. And that we had over-accrual and that came down. And you normalize for that and the expense ratio is flat. Yaron Kinar : Okay, and in global reinsurance? Evan Greenberg : Global reinsurance is a mix of business question. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Thank you. Good morning. When we're in an environment where rate increases are matching loss trends, is there an internal expectation that various underwriting efforts should translate into margin expansion, because the external catalysts are neutral? Evan Greenberg : Very line specific, where lines of business are more stressed or don't meet our combined ratio standards, then there we drive for more rate. We drive for change in terms and we reshape portfolio. And that is actively going on, Meyer. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. That's all I had. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And our next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just following up on the question Meyer had, I mean, there is clearly some lines, we're seeing a lot of rate - excess casualty. And you said, plus 7, the middle market was just plus 3. I mean, I don't know, I guess, I'm curious, is there [8] [ph] in the pricing even a good indicator of - on a line-by-line basis of what's happening with margins? Like for instance, are the lines that are getting plus 7 likely to see more margin improvement than the lines that are only getting plus 3 or is that really just based on relative need? Evan Greenberg : It's all based on relative need. You can't translate it. We can, but we don't - we're not disclosing that and we don't go there. Ryan Tunis : So what are some areas, where you think that loss trend is - I'm sorry, the rate is below loss trend, what are some lines that jump out to you? Evan Greenberg : Where rate remains below loss trend? A lot of E&S casualty, it varies by line of business. But rate continues and not below loss trend, it's actually above loss trend. I shouldn't say that, let me take that back. But it needs more rate, because you look at the - you look at the combined ratio starting point in those lines. I see this - I see stressed lines right now. And the better way of saying it, because I'm not going to give it to you by line, in real specific detail, but I see stressed lines getting above loss cost trend. And it need to, which helps to begin to improve the margin in that area. Now, in many of those areas we shrank and shrank substantially, because that you could see it in our numbers. We talked about it. Go back in how we talked about shrinking our Westchester business, our London E&S business, our reinsurance business, as examples, because of the competitive environment. And in those areas, some of them have classes where we see growth opportunity right now, because rate is exceeding loss cost trend and it presents opportunity. Some rate is exceeding loss cost trend. We right a modest portfolio, and we're - but it's still not adequate enough where we want to grow that business. Ryan Tunis : That's helpful. And then, Evan, I know you don't want to prognosticate\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I believe there are some lines - there are some lines where rate frankly is still not adequate relative to loss cost trend. And they're coming up, but they're still not there yet. Ryan Tunis : Got you. And again, I know you don't want to prognosticate on pricing. But I am curious, how much - how important is - what's going on with reinsurance pricing do you think in terms of - how much primary pricing can continue to improve? Is it such that - as we understand in what happens there, you can tell most of this story or is it still a situation where you have a primary company or [lease are inadequate] [ph] and you think you could continue to have [lease firming in] [ph] primary while reinsurance stays sort of not so spectacular? Evan Greenberg : Right now, this is primary insurer driven. It's not reinsurance market driven. Ryan Tunis : Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And we will take our final question from Mark Dwelle from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Dwelle : Yeah, good morning. Just a question related to the agriculture business with the various flooding and other events that we've seen so far. Does that likely to have any impact on either the premium or potentially how you might think about losses this year? Evan Greenberg : Frankly, the - let's take it in two pieces. The wet season and how people think about late plantings and all of that. The planting season right now and the pace of it is really the same as last year. And you know how last year turned out. So it's very early days and - but right now planting conditions are pretty good and improving. And then, on the loss side from flooding, most of the flood - most of that flooding occurred in flood plain areas. And from a loss point of view, therefore it's - when we look at our portfolio, it's really about late planting question. And as I said, we see the conditions of that equal to last year. Mark Dwelle : That's helpful. Thanks very much. That's my only question. Operator : And I'd like to now turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Beyer for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Karen Beyer : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's June 30, 2019 second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. See our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. And now, it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, I'll turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very good second quarter highlighted by excellent underwriting and strong premium revenue growth globally in constant dollars that is benefitting from favorable underwriting conditions and our various growth initiatives. In fact, the positive pricing in underwriting environment continued to improve through the quarter and spread to more classes and segments of business. Core operating income was $1.2 billion with $2.60 per share down 3% due to modestly higher year-on-year CAT losses. Book and tangible book value per share were up 3.2% and 4.7% respectively in the quarter, they\u2019re now up 7.7% and nearly 12% for the year. Combination of income and the mark derived from falling interest rates. Our combined ratio of 90.1%, included 3.8 points of CAT losses, and 2.6 points of favorable prior period reserve development. So, on a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the combined ratio was 88.9%. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CAT and prior period development. Turning to growth, P&C premium revenue in the quarter, in constant dollars was quite strong. Net premiums return grew 6% with foreign exchange having a negative impact of 1.8 percentage points. The pricing environment continued to firm through the quarter and we took advantage of some of the best pricing we\u2019ve seen in years. The rate of increase of prices accelerated while at the same time it spread to more classes of business and more classes of risk. Rates continue to firm in the U.S. for major accounts in E&S specialty to the middle market. We continued to observe favorable conditions in the London wholesale market and in Australia with their early signs, firming conditions are spreading to the U.K. company market and to certain classes of risk on the continent and Europe and Southeast Asia. Overall, where rates are moving, they\u2019re firming broadly to varying degrees in most all short and long-tail classes. Accompanying price increases, terms and conditions are tightening in certain classes. In my judgment given some of the market dislocation we\u2019ve observed including a reset of risk appetite on the part of some, this firming trend is sustainable and will likely continue to accelerate and spread. It is income and loss reserve driven, not capital driven. Overall prices increased in North America commercial on a written basis by about 7% in the quarter versus a loss cost trend in aggregate of just 4.5%. Renewal price change includes both rate and exposure; the rate was up 6.3 and exposure a half a point. Pricing improved throughout the quarter in many property and casualty related areas including general casualty, both primary and excess, D&O and professional lines. As more business comes into our underwriting appetite and price range and other carriers take corrective actions, we are benefiting from a flight to quality. All things being equal many buyers prefer Chubb. New business in our North America commercial lines was up over a 11% in the quarter with major accounts and specialty up nearly 15%. Retention of our customers remained strong across all of our North America Commercial and Personal P&C businesses with renewal retention as measured by premium of 93.5%. In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding agriculture, premiums were up 7% with major up 5.5 and Westchester E&S up over 9%. Renewal price change for major accounts was 8.5% with risk management pricing up 6.3%, excess casualty up almost 10%, and property up nearly 18.5%. Public D&O rates increased to 11%. In our Westchester business renewal pricing was up over 9.5%. Turning to our middle market and small commercial business, premiums overall were up over 4.5%. Renewal retention in our middle market business was 92%. Middle market pricing was up over 4.5% and if you exclude workers' comp, it was up nearly 5%. Again, this is the best we've seen in a number of years. The middle market pricing for primary casualty was up 4.5%, property 6.5%, excess umbrella up over 6% and public D&O rates were up 18%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums in the quarter were down 2%, but adjusting for the expanded reinsurance that we have discussed in the past and an accounting change that impacted growth prior year, net premiums written were up about 2.5. Retention remained strong at 96% and for homeowners pricing was up nearly 10% in the quarter. [: In our London wholesale business, we continued to see a reduction in capacity and rates firming across multiple lines of business. We are also seeing a significant increase in submissions to Chubb, as brokers worry about the continuity of markets as they look to us as a preferred carrier of choice. Overall rates in our London open market business were up over 9%, property was up 23.5%, marine cargo almost 7.5%, aviation was up 12 and onshore energy was up 15%. D&O rates in the London wholesale market were up 20%. Our life insurance business had a strong quarter and half year with a contribution to earnings of 76 million year-to-date. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Andrade can provide further color on the quarter including current market conditions and pricing trends. In closing this was a good quarter for Chubb. We have momentum from affirming market, flight to quality and our various global growth initiatives. We're achieving rate which is supporting margins and helping ameliorate exposures we observe on the loss side. In some we have some wind in our sails and we're taking advantage of it. Our organization is focused, energized and hungry. With that I'll turn the call over to Phil. Philip Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Our balance sheet and overall financial position remain quite strong. We have a $107 billion portfolio, cash and high quality investments that is well rated and liquid and we are generating substantial capital, a significant positive cash flow. Cash flow in the quarter was $1.4 billion. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $720 million to shareholders including $344 million in dividends and $376 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased over 800 million in shares at an average price of $140 per share. In June, we paid off $500 million of debt that matured and issued $1.3 billion of 8 and 12 year debt in the European market. The net proceeds will be used to repay our $1.3 billion senior debt at maturity in November 2020. The debt was issued at an average rate of 1.14%. We grew tangible book value per share by 4.7% in the quarter and 11.9% year-to-date. Since the close of the Chubb acquisition in 2016, tangible book value per share has fully recovered from the initial 29% dilution even excluding the favorable impact of unrealized gains. Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 9.3% and our annualized core operating return on tangible equity was 15.2%. As a reminder, Chubb records a change in the fair value mark on its private equity funds as realized gain. So therefore, it is not included in core operating income. Other companies record the impact of the mark as part of their investment income. This quarter we had after-tax realized gains of $237 million which would increase our core operating EPS by $0.51 and our annualized core operating ROE to 11.1%. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $902 million pre-tax which was higher than our estimated range and benefited from a one-off accrual adjustment of $9 million and increased corporate bond fall activity. During the quarter, interest rates continued to decline as financial markets anticipated a shift in Fed policy towards monetary easing. This favorably impacted our portfolio mark-to-market resulting in an after-tax unrealized gain of $1 billion. Although market yields have declined significantly in recent months, we will remain conservative in our investment strategy and do not contemplate any significant shift in asset allocation. Our investment income going forward will continue to benefit from growth in our invested assets and will be impacted by the level of market interest rates. Despite the negative impact of lower rates, we expect net investment income to grow moderately due to our growth in invested assets and strong cash flow. We now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million going forward. Adjusted interest expense was $145 million pre-tax in the quarter. Factoring in the debt to mature and the new Euro debt issue in June, we expect our quarterly adjusted interest expense to remain the same for the balance of the year. Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $275 million principally from U.S. weather-related events. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of a $188 million pre-tax or $152 million after tax. This included $48 million of pre-tax adverse development on prior year catastrophe losses principally for hurricane Irma and typhoon JV primarily in our assumed reinsurance operation and $25 million pre-tax adverse development related to our runoff non-A&E casualty exposures. The remaining favorable development of $261 million is split approximately 90% from long-tail lines principally from accident years 2015 and prior and 10% from short-tail lines. Foreign currency movement adversely impacted core operating income by $23 million in the quarter. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased $831 million reflecting catastrophe losses in the quarter and the seasonal increase in our crop reserve offset by favorable prior period development. A paid-to-incurred ratio was 87%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.3% which is in line with our annual expected range of 14% to 16%. Through six months, our core operating effective tax rate was 15%. I'll turn the call back to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your question. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Mike Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Mike Phillips : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question on Evan on your comments of what's driving the rate activity. I believe you said something like its income and reserve driven not capital driven. So, I guess want to know if you can expand upon that kind of implies there's going to be some timing of reserve issues and maybe what you've seen and why you mentioned are reserve driven? Evan Greenberg : Well, just simply the rate has not kept pace with loss cost trend and that puts pressure on income and it puts pressure ultimately on reserves. You're either I think that it just imply, it shows what it implies the balance sheets over time, and have less redundancy in them. And for some are adequate, for others and become negative for others. And you have a loss cost environment that in many ways in the headlines is stable. But you have areas of casualty and catastrophe's and other areas within the business where there is volatility. And there is trend pressure. And so, my comments meant to imply all of that. What I was saying to you is income and balance sheet not capital driven that there was a dearth of capital. There is plenty of capital around and but it is more disciplined at this moment and it comes to its deployed with the rate and terms are more adequate. Mike Phillips : Okay. Well, thank you, that's helpful. I guess if I could turn specifically to North America commercial lines, where I guess dependent on what you use for 2Q '18 with your comments from last year, the structure settlement term had some impact there. So, the core loss ratio deteriorated about a 70 bips or a 170 bips dependent on how you adjust for that. Our set looks like kind one of the highest core loss ratios that's seen in a while. We heard Trevor just now talk about non- CAT weather, I'm not sure if any of that came into play here for that segment for you or what else truly uptick and maybe has your view of loss trends and that segment -- since last quarter? Evan Greenberg : Let look at North America commercial P&C that's looking on a current accident year ex-CAT. Last year ran an 80 74 combined ratio. This year ran an 80 79 combined ratio. I mean, simply outstanding world class and in the 80s. So, let's have that perspective. We wrote the same volume of LPTs this year that we did last year and so no impact from that. It was simply rate and trend naturally, not a non-CAT weather or any of that, just simply rate and trend something I've been saying for many quarters. Thanks for the question. Mike Phillips : Alright, thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, Evan, is also just going back I guess to some of your comments to the previous question on just what you're seeing with loss trend. You guys seeing any trend changes and that TOD environment. And I know there is a lot of different classes that went together but that 4.5% of trend that you said in the book for North America commercial. Can you give us some perspective on how that would compare and maybe it's not number, it's just for qualitatively to what you're seeing in some recent quarters? Evan Greenberg : Sure, Elyse. In the aggregate in the round, it's a loss cost trend is stable; we haven\u2019t seen a change in it. As you rightfully note though within that, it varies by class of business and area of business, we've talked for a number of quarters for quite some time now about professional lines D&A in particular and I won't repeat or go into what we've talked about. But simply about the increase of frequency and in some areas severity in that. In the TOD environment, generally there has been less of an increase of frequency but and in there had been headlines of increase in severity during of what's paces in here, see it from commercial lot owed to products liability that is chemical related. And then, the trend from of TOD from #MeToo and molestation and the specter in the future of the reviver statutes which is unknowable at the time. There is and then the Australian market behaves a certain and TOD and the London market U.K. where D&O had deteriorated. So, you have it varies by area and by class of business, comp on the other hand behaved very well. General liability behaves in a steady way, reasonably steady. So, I hope that helps you. Elyse Greenspan : Yes, that's helpful. And then, on you said kind of and talking to the core margin within North America commercial that the delta between this Q2 and last Q2 is really just to rate versus trend. You see, in on your comments this quarter and also last quarter pretty bullish on pricing and the fact that you would think it would continue. So, do you think where reaching the point where obviously it takes a while to earn in the rate but if you keep getting this rate and accelerates, do you think as we get into 2020 you can think about that being an environment where there will be come core margin improvement? Evan Greenberg : We're in the risk business, so I can project the numerator reasonably well to you. I can't reject and prognosticate the denominator. The denominator I can project, I can't quite project the numerator the same way to you because we are in a risk business. And so, look rate exceeding trend is a simple statement, it's an ameliorating factor and that's a good thing. We'll see what its impact is on margin in the future. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. And the, one last quick numbers question. You guys mentioned you've added a little bit to your Debby last in the quarter. What are you guys taking that as for ensure loss for the overall industry right now? Evan Greenberg : I don\u2019t have a number in my head, my colleagues around the table don\u2019t but will we'll take it offline with you, we'll give you a number. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : We'll take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. Going with the North America commercial, so Evan, you're talking about world class margins there and loss trends that are stable. I guess, do you need more rate in that segment today or is this maybe an opportunity to try and take market share or others are still pushing free? Evan Greenberg : It varies by class of business and there is no general statement. Some classes are adequately priced, some classes need rate and terms and conditions changes and some classes need substantial rate. And so, it varies, it's there is no other simple box for that. But as I think you can see our new business is up, our renewal retention is high or in a more favorable underwriting environment and where it make sense to us and we've got a lot of data and a lot of experience, we're leaning right into it. Yaron Kinar : Okay, thank you. And then, I guess if I shift to the investment portfolio. So, it sounds like apart from comments that you're not really looking for any change in direction here even with the change in monitory policy. One thing I did notice was an increase in duration sequentially. Is there a strategic move or was that just of normal quarterly noise or movement? Philip Bancroft : It was simply tactical, at the end of last year we had a decrease to duration because we were getting paid to take duration risk. And with the course of this year it's drifted up slightly but to the extent it's within half a point or half a year or four years, we don\u2019t think there's any material impact on our investment income. Yaron Kinar : Okay. So, you're not necessarily looking to extend duration here? Philip Bancroft : We're not. Yaron Kinar : Okay, thank you. Philip Bancroft : Welcome. Operator : We will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hi thanks, good morning. So, clearly in terms and conditions, rate have accelerated improved throughout the year. Evan, would you say on the other side that loss trend today is it' some more challenging environment in over six months ago? Evan Greenberg : No. Let's say its if I compare six months ago to today, it's stable. Ryan Tunis : Fair enough. And then, I guess I'll be the annoying one to ask about the crop but just curious what the thought process was in and how you're thinking about the planting, so it didn\u2019t look like you put up a loss taking agriculture, I'm not sure if you did but just in your thoughts there. Evan Greenberg : Sure. Let me make just a couple of comments about that. And it's not an annoying, I would be surprised if when you didn\u2019t ask about it. First of all, we did put up the loss ratio about 2.5 points this quarter. So, but what you have to recognize it's on a low earned premium base at this time of year. And it is not signaling at this point what you should imagine for third quarter or for fourth quarter at all. Given the weather conditions this spring and potential impact on prevented planting or delayed planting along with the volatility that in commodity prices, impact by trade and other factors, its natural the questions raised about what kind of year we're anticipating for crop. So, in a word it's \"unknowable.\" Our modals under various scenarios moving toward roughly average year. However, the actually tally or prevented planting claims, the summer growing season conditions and therefore the result in quality of the crop commodity prices and then the full harvest weather conditions are rolled to play out all of that's in front of us. So, we simply raised our loss ratio modestly in the second quarter as a naturally conservative action very little bit that we can say. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : But it's unknowable when if you know, then I'll tell you what but and we're going to make a lot of money in hedging in commodities. Thanks. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Paul Newsome with Sandler O'Neill. Please go ahead. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Congrats in the quarter. I want to ask, if I make my own assumption about where we are from pricing versus loss cost spread. Is there anything in either the North America commercial or the overseas more business mix and that this is exchange, they would affect though that sort of simple calculation for me? Evan Greenberg : You have to explain. I'm not really sure what you're asking me Paul. Paul Newsome : So what I'm asking is, is the natural business mix all things being equal going to be for a business that has lower or higher combined ratios because I think we're all making an assumption of whether or not Chubb hit a point where the earnings or the price increases are above claim costs inflation that gives us an estimate of where we think we're going to see the inflexion margins. But that calculation assumes basically that the business mix is the same in the various segments? Evan Greenberg : The business mix within the segments is reasonably steady. There's a big book of business. So there is not big shift taking place. There's always, every quarter it changes is jittery, but in the round at some, the mix is quite steady. Paul Newsome : And then, I'm sorry I'm going to beat on crop a little bit, but is there a chance that given the delay in the harvest, we could see a change in the premium recognition from mainly in third to more in the fourth? Evan Greenberg : No. Paul Newsome : Okay, thank you. Evan Greenberg : It's formulaic. So, no. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. A couple here for you. First, I'm just curious in the overseas area Evan, reserve releases kind of really slowed down on year-over-year basis, were there any kind of one-timers there that was going on? Evan Greenberg : No, there was not. Brian Meredith : And then, the growth you're seeing. No, one timers, got you. And the growth you're seeing in that overseas where's it coming from? Is that some of these new distribution relationships you have, other things going on? Philip Bancroft : Brian this is one on dry day. The growth is actually pretty broad based as Evan said in his opening remarks, we certainly are seeing a pretty good growth coming out of our London wholesale market operation as we see the market continuing to firm and we see contraction and capacity there. But underlying all of that and particularly for our retail businesses, it's really our strategies continuing to gain traction and I'm talking about our strategies in the small commercial, the middle market, accident and health personal lines on a global basis. The distribution agreements are certainly doing well. We are getting good traction on all of that so I would say it's really a combination of our organic strategies in addition to the right that we're continuing to see now. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : Thank you and good morning. Given the ongoing shifts we're seeing and tightening in the commercial property casualty insurance market, Evan I'm wondering if in this environment it might shift your thinking on mergers and acquisitions at all? Evan Greenberg : No. Steady and it doesn't shift with the times that way. So we know, I've been very consistent in when I ask this for many years now. We are builders and we're a company of builders and we have a strategy to grow our company organically. And acquisitions complement that strategy. They help to advance it or improve upon it in any and the strategy is product segment of customer distribution and territory oriented. And when we identify the right target or partner and financials and we judge it to advance our strategy and in a positive way and will be accretive to our shareholders, their capital then we know our minds and we will pull that trigger. Jay Gelb : That's helpful, thank you. Just a follow-up on that with the potential for acquisitions to complement organic growth, is that imply you're more focused on bolt-on acquisitions as opposed to something larger or transformational? Evan Greenberg : We're agnostic. Jay Gelb : Understood, thank you. Evan Greenberg : I am sorry, there's not really more to say there. Operator : We will take our final question from Meyer Shields of KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Thanks, good morning. And I was hoping you could talk about what you're seeing in reinsurance. We're getting a lot of commentary that's very positive especially on the CAT fee side, didn't see tremendous amount of growth in global reinsurance this quarter? Evan Greenberg : Yes. The reinsurance market is, I think modestly tightening. I think for the most part reinsures are riding on the backs of primary riders and if they feel pressure in their own income or balance sheet statements then they're more taking action by seasons they select and they're banking on seasons to get better rates and terms that ultimately feed into their results. It's more unusual than we've seen in the past typically we would have seen a change in market pricing cycles more reinsurance led that doesn't happen. And I think in many cases reinsures their results are inferior due that of insurers\u2019 results and other than Chubb, I'm surprised they don't take more action in their underwriting positions on reinsurance. And that they don't drive higher pricing, better terms themselves. I can't prognosticate the future, but so far I see it's relatively modest, the changes, the terms and conditions and pricing in the reinsurance market. Meyer Shields : That's very helpful, thanks. And second, Chubb came out with a fairly strong statement on climate change in the context of which entity you're willing to underwrite. Has that changed, I guess loss trend assumptions for property risk? Evan Greenberg : No. You're referring to the decision we took on coal. Meyer Shields : Yes. Evan Greenberg : And it's a de-minimis portion of our writings. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect, thanks so much. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, we will take our next question from Greg Peters from Raymond James. Please go ahead. Greg Peters : Good morning. Thanks for squeezing my question. Evan in the past you've commented on the impact of the tariffs and trade wars that seemed to be evolving from quarter-to-quarter and I wanted to give you an opportunity to give us an update on how you think the current environment has affected your business and what we should be thinking about in our calculus about the results going forward? Evan Greenberg : Yes. We grew our overseas business by 9% in the quarter and you see it broad based. So I don't see a linkage between tariffs and the health of Chubb's business and our business is more idiosyncratic. They are active in local markets around the world where you're impacted by their local economic plus their trade and their trade related economic invention. So, yes both. Look when it comes to, I'm not in favor of tariffs as a strategy and I'm not in favor of putting the walls up and bring in your supply chains home. This is a globalized world in terms of trade and world led by a vision, America's vision of global trade. I continue to stand behind that and think that's the best path to peace and prosperity for the citizens of our nation. And so, I hope that we will engage more in reaching conclusions to trade agreements than imposing further tariffs. Obviously, the degree that the tariffs and other actions, other protectionist actions taken slow down economic growth around the world, this country is not immune and the insurance industry is then not immune because we grow, we're exposure driven, not about premium, premium is a proxy for exposure, we grow based on growth of exposure globally. An economic activity grows or contracts exposure. Greg Peters : Speaking about industries, one of the themes that has emerged for I guess, a couple of years now is pricing, price increases in commercial auto and I'm trying to reconcile the desire by the insurance market to raise prices on the trucking industry with the news it seems like every other week we're hearing about troubles in the trucking industry whether it's LME or Timmerman Starlite. And so, I'm curious what your perspective is on the balance between rate and fiscal survival of an industry? Evan Greenberg : We are not responsible for the fiscal survival of any industry except our own and I know from my perspective, I'm a fiduciary of shareholder capital that expects a reasonable return if we deploy that capital towards the trucking industry to take insurance risk. I can tell you that Chubb writes a fair amount of trucking related long, medium and short haul exposure. We work with clients who are embracing modern technology and that exists today and they've got strong balance sheets to lower their loss costs, to reduce their exposures, to police driver behavior and that results in amelioration of lost costs rises and therefore the premiums we charge, it's a pretty rational circle of life there. And for those who simply operate in a less professional manner and can't police their loss cost will be to buy insurance the price is going to be reflected, that's it. Greg Peters : I'm not trying to suggest that you have financial responsibility for the trucking industry. I just realized that everyone wants to raise prices on long-haul trucking, etcetera and yet it seems like a lot of the long-haul truckers are having a lot of headwinds and their survival is in question. So there's a balance to be had exposed between charging higher prices and actually not being able to have a customer insure at all? Evan Greenberg : Yes, but if it was and I understand what you're saying. If it was to raise prices to earn unreasonable margins were to earn any margin. I mean, right now the trucking business is not, that's never been an easy business and to make any money in trucking. So is it better if you can't make any money to just say then I won't insure it at all. They are uninsurable. They can't buy insurance. Now you go out of business instantly versus you're going to work with those who can work with themselves and help to reduce loss costs and ameliorate price and so I tell you there's not a one-size-fits-all in trucking. There are those who are quite professional and we work with them and they have far more modest price increases than say those who don't have the wherewithal or capability or desire to embrace technologies that will help to ameliorate that rise in their loss cost. The best they can do for you. Greg Peters : Okay, great, thanks for your answers. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And this does conclude today's question and answer session. I'd like to turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Thanks and have a great day. Operator : And this does conclude today's conference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. And now, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Karen Beyer : Thank you and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's September 30, 2019 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our Web site at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist you with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, I'll turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had a strong third quarter with core operating earnings up double digit and excellent premium revenue growth globally. Growth benefitted from a continuously improving pricing and underwriting environment where insurance rates and terms continued to firm quarter-over-quarter in major areas of our business. Our growth is also benefitting from our many product, customer and distribution-related growth initiatives around the globe, particularly in the U.S., Asia and Latin America. Core operating income was $2.70 per share, up 12%. The balance of our earnings between underwriting and investment income was very good with underwriting income of 754 million, up 12.5% and adjusted net investment income of 910 million, up 3%. Global P&C underwriting income, which excludes agriculture, was up 27.7%. The combined ratio was 90.2 and benefitted from lower year-on-year CATs offset partially by higher crop losses, another CAT-like risk. On a current accident year basis, excluding CAT, the combined ratio was 89.5% and excluding ag it was 88.3%, up modestly like four-tenths of a percent from prior year. Book and tangible book value per share were up 2% and 3.3%, respectively, in the quarter and were up 9.8% and 15.7% since December 31, driven by a combination of strong income and the mark from falling interest rates. While benefiting temporarily our company's book value growth, prolonged low interest rates, a result of overreliance on monetary policy, have penalized savers and led to misallocation of capital and overvaluation of assets without substantially supporting business investments and economic growth. Annualized core operating return on equity for the quarter was 9.5%. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, CATs and prior period development.  Turning to growth and the rate environment, P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was quite strong. Net premiums grew 7.2% and then foreign exchange had a 1 point negative impact. As I noted at the beginning, the pricing environment continued to improve quarter-on-quarter with the rate of increase accelerating and spreading to more classes of business and risk type. More perspective, rate increases in both our North America commercial lines and in our London wholesale businesses this quarter were double those of the first quarter, 6.4% versus 3.2% and 17% versus 8%, respectively. In the U.S., rates continued to firm in major accounts; E&S wholesale specialty and the middle market. In our international operations, we continued to observe firming conditions in the London wholesale market and in Australia, while rates began to increase in the UK retail market and parts of the continent, particularly for large risk. The market is responding to the fact that rates have not kept pace with loss cost over a number of years, which has put pressure on margins and ultimately on reserves. Rates have gone down while loss cost have risen, very simple math. However, as we have been saying for some time, the frequency of severity in certain long-tail and short-tail classes has been worsening while at the same time in other classes it has remained subdued or declined. For the sake of simplicity, let\u2019s divide long-tail loss into three buckets. Bucket one, generally speaking in the attritional loss layers, severity has been increasing at a relatively modest pace and frequency has been steady, though there are exceptions. In the second bucket, in excess claims settlements has been increasing and putting pressure on rate adequacy, a consequence of so-called social inflation but also casualty attachment points not moving for years. A $1 million attachment point for casualty excess 10 years ago is worth a fraction of the amount today. And finally the third bucket, there has been an increase in class actions, large to mega, everything from securities and anti-trust related to science-based, for example, chemical, pharma and physical trauma-related. And there are casualty CAT type events such as molestation-related reviver statute legislative actions. I have spoken about all this for some time now. In my judgment, given the simple math, the risk environment and a reset of risk appetite on the part of many, the current market conditions are sustainable. Returning to the quarter. Overall prices increased in North America commercial on a written basis by 6.8% versus a loss cost trend of about 4.5%. Renewal price change 0.4% and exposure change of 0.4%. As I noted last quarter, we are also benefiting from a flight to quality, particularly in large account and specialty as more business meets our underwriting standards. Given the choice, many potential customers prefer Chubb. New business in North America commercial lines was up 18.5% in the quarter with major accounts and specialty up over 23%. And middle market and small commercial up over 9.5%. Retention of our customers remained very strong across all of our North America commercial and personal P&C businesses with renewal retention as measured by premium of 96.6%. In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding agriculture, premiums were up 9.5% with major accounts retail up about 5.5% and E&S wholesale up over 18%. Rates for major accounts were up over 8% with risk management up 4.5%, excess casualty up 17.5% and property up over 29%. Public D&O rates increased over 17.5%. In our E&S wholesale business, rates were up about 7.5% with property up 17% and financial lines up 8.5%. Turning to our middle market and small commercial business. Premiums overall were up 5.6% and renewal retention in our middle market business was 92%. Middle market pricing was up over 6%; and excluding workers\u2019 comp, up about 6.5%. Pricing for primary casualty was up 7.7%, property up 7.3%, excess umbrella up 7% and public D&O rates up 32%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written in the quarter were up 2.7%. But adjusting for the expanded reinsurance, net premiums written were up almost 4%, our best quarter of the year. Retention remains strong at 97% on a premium basis and steady at over 90% on a policy basis. Homeowners pricing was up 10.7% in the quarter. Turning to our international business. Growth accelerated in our overseas general insurance operations with net premiums written up about 11% in constant dollar and FX then had a negative impact of about 3.5 percentage points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 29%, while our retail division was up over 9.5% with growth broadly distributed across the globe. Growth in our international retail business was led by Latin America and Asia Pacific, up circa 10% and 9%, respectively, with UK retail in the continent up over 8% and 6%, a very good result. Overall, rates in our London wholesale business were up 17%. Our Asia-focused international life insurance business had a strong quarter with net written premiums up over 20% in constant dollar and a contribution to earnings of 40 million, up over 43% from prior year. John Keogh, John Lupica and Paul Krump can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. In closing, this was a very good quarter for Chubb. Premium revenue growth continued to accelerate as more business met our underwriting standards and we continued to achieve greater price adequacy in an improving underwriting environment. At the same time, long-term growth initiatives around the globe, our organization is firing on all cylinders. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil and then will come back to take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. We ended the quarter with a very strong overall financial position. Our businesses and investment performance produced positive cash flow in the quarter of 2.2 billion. We grew our assets to 175 billion, excluding cash and invested assets of 109 billion, which generated strong investment income and we grew total capital to over 68 billion. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned 819 million to shareholders including 341 million in dividends and 478 million in share repurchases. Year-to-date through yesterday, we have repurchased over 1.3 billion new shares at an average price of $145.70 per share. Our annualized core operating return on tangible equity was 15.6%. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter of 910 million pre-tax was higher than our estimated range and benefited from higher private equity distributions and increased corporate bond core activities. Net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter were 263 million after tax. There was a gain of 503 million in the investment portfolio from a decline in interest rates, partially offset by a loss of 112 million from our variable annuity portfolio and a loss of 116 million from FX. Although market yields have declined significantly in recent months, we will remain conservative in our investment strategy and do not contemplate any significant shift in asset allocation. Despite the negative impact of lower interest rates, we expect our growth in invested assets and strong cash flow will support current investment income levels. We now expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income run rate to be approximately 900 million. Catastrophe losses in the quarter were 232 million with about 90% from U.S. weather-related events, including Hurricane Dorian and the balance from international events, primarily in Japan. In addition, agriculture underwriting income was adversely impacted by weather conditions resulting in underwriting income of 1 million compared to 79 million in the prior year. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of 167 million pre-tax or 112 million after tax. This included 27 million pre-tax adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures. The remaining favorable development of 194 million comprises 279 million favorable development from long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior and in short-tail lines principally from non-CAT large losses from commercial property lines. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves decreased 137 million reflecting the impact of favorable prior period development and catastrophe losses. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 103% for the quarter. After adjusting for the items I discussed, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 96%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 15.1%, which is in line with our annual expected range of 14% to 16%. Through the nine months, our core operating effective tax rate was 15%. As a clarification to a point in the press release relating to North America commercial, we had a 2 point increase in our loss ratio; 1 point is property related. Year-to-date losses were higher than our selected loss ratio. The other point is long-tail related, simply higher loss fix this year than last and in line with previous quarters, no change. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our first question from Paul Newsome, Sandler O\u2019Neill. Please go ahead. Paul Newsome : Good morning. I was hoping you could touch a little bit more on your comments on the TOD environment, which I found very interesting. And specifically I\u2019m curious if the buckets and descriptions you\u2019re using are just attributed to the U.S. or given your international focus is also something we can think about having similar issues in or developments in the international markets? Evan Greenberg : Yes, that\u2019s a good question and good morning, Paul. The securities related and we don\u2019t see it in general casualty. General casualty is behaving in a steady way. We don\u2019t see the same factors that we see in the U.S. However, in securities related, so in D&O, the UK, Germany which has always been the troubled environment and Australia, there you see the same trends and in a place like Australia it\u2019s even more acute. But that\u2019s been for some time and I\u2019ve been talking about it for a while because it\u2019s the same \u2013 we\u2019ve observed the trends for the last couple of years. The UK has worsened over the last two years, maybe three. Australia has been \u2013 it began deteriorating about four years ago and accelerated and it\u2019s just a stupid environment now. And Germany given their insured versus insured \u2013 and the fact that they have \u2013 you have two boards in a company has been a difficult environment for a long time. But that\u2019s about \u2013 the other markets around the world are kind of minor. Paul Newsome : Great. And then separately just a more topical comment on the California wildfires and the exposures, is there anything about Chubb\u2019s exposures out there that would be different from the last couple of years just from a pure written exposure from a reinsurance perspective? Evan Greenberg : Well, let\u2019s take the last couple of years, we do have a quota of share that we did not have before and that would be the one major difference. Over the last year, in particular, though it began two years ago but really it\u2019s been the last year, we\u2019ve been reshaping the portfolio. Given the underwriting environment and the level of rate we can charge, we have aggressively pursued more rate increase. So that earns into the portfolio and has a benefit and we\u2019ve reshaped the portfolio around the margin and that continues, particularly in extreme wildfire zones. Paul Newsome : Great. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter. Evan Greenberg : Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning. My first question, Evan, going back also to some of your comments on inflation, in North America commercial you guys pointed to consolidated trend about 4.5, which is in line with what you guys have been saying in the past couple of quarters. So just given the whole environment and what you see out there in terms of class action lawsuits, et cetera, picking up, do you view that as kind of the right base as we think about where trends would be over the next 12 months? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, our trend reflects everything we know. And we have \u2013 and it\u2019s the overall portfolio, so that\u2019s everything; long and short tail. We have classes in long and short tail with the loss cost trend as benign. And we have in both long and short-tail classes where it is less benign and I specifically spiked out [ph] to talk about the casualty \u2013 and I\u2019m using casualty in the broad sense, including professional lines. The areas where we for some time have been talking about that loss cost trends or like loss cost trends, the loss environment has been worsening or becoming more hostile. That\u2019s all baked into that 4.5%. Our selected trend factors by line reflect everything we know that we can mathematically calculate and substantiate is in our loss PIKs. Now, we can\u2019t speak about the future because we don't know the future. We only know what we can observe today in the trends as we see them today and we have reflective all of that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. In terms of North America commercial, the prior year developments slowed. I believe it\u2019s all due to what Phil pointed out in terms of the non-CAT losses in commercial property. I just wanted to clarify. So did all \u2013 away from just non-CAT property, did all their lines within commercial developed favorably in the quarter, if we can just get a little bit more color on that, were there releases within that business? Evan Greenberg : In the current accident year \u2013 you\u2019re speaking to current accident year? Elyse Greenspan : No. I was talking about the prior year development, so the 109 this year versus North America commercial. Evan Greenberg : We had releases and we had \u2013 we took reserve charges, as we told you. And when you say lines, it\u2019s the lines that we study in the quarter. We don\u2019t do a deep dive study on all lines every quarter. And as we\u2019ve described numerous times, we have a schedule for that. And so of the lines studied in the quarter, those would be the long-tail ones that had releases. And by the way it\u2019s many sub-lines and so some have some increases, some have decreases, but the aggregate that we gave you was a decrease. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Evan Greenberg : Sure. Operator : Next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James, please go ahead. Greg Peters : Good morning. I have one question and a follow up. Evan, in your prepared remarks and I\u2019m not trying to put words in your mouth, but I believe you suggested that assets might be overvalued due to the lower interest rate environment and I\u2019m curious how you want your investors to view those comments in the context of your investment portfolio. Evan Greenberg : Yes, what I was really relating to more than anything in my mind is I look at the prices people are paying to buy assets, all kinds of assets. And in my mind, in particular, I think about is we purchase insurance companies and we look at those assets and I find the market knows to be tremendously overvalued. And when I look at prices being paid and so much private equity and in IT related and technology related, the asset values are tremendously inflated and really making the comment that investors are chasing absolute yield, not risk-adjusted yield. When I come to our own investment portfolio, we\u2019re very careful about how we invest the risk-adjusted return, not absolute yield, and that\u2019s why Phil made the comment that there won\u2019t be and you won\u2019t see a change in our investment philosophy and strategy, because we\u2019re disciplined and we\u2019re not just going to chase the highest yield, for example, in high-yield bonds where we\u2019re active. We know what we think the right risk-adjusted price is. I\u2019m looking at historic default trends, et cetera. We\u2019re not going to chase and that\u2019s what my comments were related to. Greg Peters : Excellent. Thanks for the clarification. I want to pivot and at the outset, I just want you to realize I\u2019m not trying to get you to criticize your distribution partners, but if I consider the stock market performance as a measure of success, the insurance brokers have outperformed the underwriters on a one, three and five-year basis. And I was wondering if you could just update us on your views about the symbiotic relationship with your insurance brokers and/or if it\u2019s changed? Evan Greenberg : Yes. That bounces around and we\u2019re in the risk-taking business. Brokerage is in the intermediation business only. And I realize we\u2019re both in the advisory business that way. That they have done well, it\u2019s not a zero-sum game. They have done well, I applaud them for it. I reflect they\u2019ve done a good job and congratulations. And we\u2019ll run our own race. And I\u2019m not concerned with Chubb\u2019s ability to outperform over reasonable periods of time and that particularly in comparison to those who were like us, risk takers. Secondly, has the relationship changed? No, it\u2019s fundamentally the same relationship it has been for years. It changes based on tools and capabilities, change. But beyond that, the relationship is \u2013 the foundation of it hasn\u2019t changed and that is a broker is in the business of representing their client and their client\u2019s interest and helping them to select \u2013 advising them and helping them to select the right coverages, the right insurers and put together the right program. They intermediate that. And our relationship is \u2013 brokerage is an ambivalent relationship. You work in partnership together and you also work \u2013 you work for each of your respective interest. Greg Peters : Thanks for the answers. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Michael Zaremski : Hi. Good morning. First question, Evan, when you\u2019re talking about the competitive environment in your prepared remarks, I think you used the term reset of risk appetite on the part of some competitors. Do you feel that that reset is causing maybe pricing to move well in excess of loss trend and low interest rate pressures in certain lines? I guess what I\u2019m trying to get at is that I think we all know that there\u2019s a number of competitors kind of resetting and that gives us confidence and you confidence if the rate environment stays \u2013 is moving in the right direction. But I guess a lot of investors ask us whether Chubb\u2019s margins can maybe eventually benefit more so than peers if the environment persists? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Look, I can only speak about what I know, not what I don\u2019t know. There are lines of business \u2013 there are numerous lines of business where rate is exceeding loss cost trend and that is \u2013 it\u2019s healing margins and therefore it is naturally ameliorating and benefitting margins. And then there are other lines and some of that, it\u2019s actually improving the underwriting margin and in some areas it needs to go further because it\u2019s still not adequate to earn under a positive underwriting margin. So it\u2019s all over the lot. As far as Chubb\u2019s margin goes, I\u2019m not going to prognosticate about the future. The trends as we see them are positive, they\u2019re good and all things being equal it benefits margin. However, I can\u2019t speak to the future loss cost environment and future trends that way. So that\u2019s why I never predict the future when it comes to that. We\u2019re in the risk business. Michael Zaremski : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And lastly just kind of a follow up to the previous questions, Evan you said that broadly speaking asset values are inflated and I think you alluded to also the M&A environment, but you can correct me if I\u2019m wrong. So does that imply that there\u2019s maybe less M&A opportunities today than I guess \u2013 well, there hasn\u2019t been much M&A for you guys in recent years and maybe Phil can also remind us of the drag excess capital is having on your ROE? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes. In the environment, sure, you\u2019ve seen us quiet and you observe the prices for assets yourselves. I assume you come to the same conclusion I do. Phil, on ROE? Philip Bancroft : The drag on the ROE it\u2019s in the range of 0.7% to 1%. Michael Zaremski : Thanks. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. Evan, this is probably just me not at full capacity after a busy night, so I apologize in advance. But there is something I don\u2019t quite understand \u2013 I\u2019m sorry. Evan Greenberg : Did you drink too much? Yaron Kinar : I drank a lot of insurance [ph]. Evan Greenberg : That\u2019s intoxicating. Yaron Kinar : Yes. So overall loss trend remains stable at 4.5%, which incorporates lines that are deteriorating; others that are benign. But if it remains stable, why are we seeing Chubb and peers increase only vocalizing concerns over the loss trend deterioration? And why are rates as a whole firming? Evan Greenberg : Because the loss environment in those troubled lines, you do see trends and you do see it showing up in overall loss PIKs that you\u2019ve seen loss ratios in casualty rising and \u2013 I\u2019m using casualty broadly, I\u2019m using the term to include professional lines and general casualty. And taking our workers\u2019 comp, it varies by line but you\u2019ve been hearing about it and seeing it in commercial auto. You\u2019ve been hearing about it and you\u2019ve seen it in D&O and medical malpractice and excess liability. And so that has focus and attention from \u2013 underwriters see it and the investing community sees it. So there\u2019s dialogue about that. And I do think that it is the loss cost environment there has not been benign. I\u2019ve been talking about it for a while. Our own loss PIKs in those areas have been increasing. It does have an impact on our overall loss ratios, because it gets blended in there and it has. And so you need to be aware of it and focus on it and it is a trend right now. It has been and is. Am I making sense to you? Yaron Kinar : Okay. Yes. And is this the way it means though that even for a long-term loss remains stable, there\u2019s a certain reset of a base given the recent experience? Evan Greenberg : Not a reset of a base, but remember we\u2019re talking loss ratios and that\u2019s calendar year that can include prior period reserves, that includes current accident year. So naturally you\u2019ve seen very strong rate and with more benign loss years releasing reserves \u2013 industry releasing reserves into earnings when I take prior period. And you know as you get to more recent years, rates have been going down, loss cost trends have been rising and you\u2019ve seen underneath the surface of these loss cost trends some of these ones that I just talked about and have been talking about that are more troubling and they show up. And then in the current \u2013 that all then rolls forward to the current accident year loss PIKs where you raise your expectations based on what you see today and as it has trended from the recent and past years. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my follow-up question is -- Evan Greenberg : Am I being clear for you? Yaron Kinar : I think so. I may follow up offline, but I think I got the general gist. And then my second question is just around, you mentioned the three buckets; attrition loss for each layers, excess and large to mega. Can you offer maybe a broad distribution of those premiums for Chubb by those buckets? Evan Greenberg : No. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. I don\u2019t have those to discuss. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead, sir. Mike Phillips : Thank you. Good morning. I guess and I appreciate, Evan, your comments on not wanting to kind of go and predict the future. I guess I would ask then on your North America commercial, you had 90 bps of deterioration in the core. And you call out the commercial property. Can you say how much that 90 bps would have been without that commercial property loss? Evan Greenberg : We said that \u2013 I\u2019m a little lost. The 90 bps is in the combined ratio. Mike Phillips : That\u2019s correct, yes. Evan Greenberg : The loss ratio in North America commercial was 2 points. We told you 1 point was year-to-date property were losses outside the loss PIK and we said the other 1 point was casualty related. That\u2019s casualty long-tail lines, which is casualty broadly, and that was in line with our loss PIKs all year, no change. That\u2019s just rate and trend. Mike Phillips : Okay. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Phil gave you that. Mike Phillips : No, perfect. Thanks. And then I guess on those three buckets again that was just asked, do you have any concerns on what you see in that second layer kind of filtering back down into the first layer that you talked about, the first bucket? Evan Greenberg : No. We\u2019re not seeing it that way. And think about it a little bit. The average loss always it increases by the normal trend factor in the primary layer. Frequency has been pretty steady. It\u2019s always jittery a little bit, but steady. And the severity has risen at a kind of a normal loss cost trend. But what it does is when attachment points and that\u2019s what I was trying to say in excess don\u2019t change over years and years and years, the more losses bleed into that layer. Do you get it? And that\u2019s separate from the larger one-offs that large excess losses that I talked about. I broke bucket two down into two pieces for you. And so to answer your question, no, I don\u2019t see that. Actually, it\u2019s the opposite. Mike Phillips : Thank you, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead, sir. Ryan Tunis : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Evan, I wanted to go back to your comment in your prepared remarks where you said that conditions are sustainable. I was just a little bit confused on what in particular is sustainable? Is it the pricing environment, is it where you view the loss trend environment, just I guess maybe a little more specificity on that please? Evan Greenberg : Yes, buddy, you\u2019re over thinking it. I was talking about the underwriting and pricing environment only. Ryan Tunis : Got it, so broadly speaking. I guess my follow up -- Evan Greenberg : The trend we see in pricing and underwriting, we see \u2013 in the areas that this is impacting, we see it continuing. Ryan Tunis : Understood. And then I guess my follow up is keeping it on this discussion about \u2013 it sounds like \u2013 and I might be wrong on this, but it sounds like there might be a difference between the conversation about loss trend and the conversation about loss PIKs. Like for instance, Phil mentioned that \u2013 sorry, Evan -- Evan Greenberg : Go ahead. Ryan Tunis : So Phil\u2019s comment that because of casualty lines in North America, your loss ratio deteriorated a point. That\u2019s similar to previous quarters but in previous quarters you seemingly didn\u2019t have quite as much rate. So is it such that there\u2019s an uncertain enough loss environment that you\u2019re observing a certain level of trend but maybe you\u2019re saying we should \u2013 out of abundance of conservatism just continue to set loss PIKs a little bit higher and that\u2019s why that\u2019s perhaps staying at a point or was it more simple than that and I just have that wrong. Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s more simple than that. I\u2019m trying to understand what your \u2013 how you\u2019re thinking about it. But remember, the loss ratio is based on earned rate not written rate. And it\u2019s earned rate over \u2013 the loss PIK you have, the earned rate goes into. Again, you trend losses forward. We have an overall loss trend factor of 4.5. We had an earned rate of whatever it was in those long-tail areas. That went into us imagining a loss PIK for the year in those casualty areas of X and that has remained steady. We have not changed the loss ratios we have selected in any of our casualty areas. Ryan Tunis : So if more of that earned rate comes in, we would expect that point of deterioration to moderate? Evan Greenberg : Then the earned premium grows, then you look at the loss cost trend for each line and you decide does it remain the same or does it go up or go down? Ryan Tunis : Got it. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : Okay. Best I can give, Ryan. That\u2019s why I\u2019m not prognosticating future, I go back to that, but based on what I see right now, I got a 4.5 loss cost trend and I\u2019ve got \u2013 and that is blend of all lines of business and we\u2019ve got rate that exceeds loss cost trend in North America on a written basis. Operator : Next is Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Thanks. Evan, I\u2019m just curious. Are you getting tightening terms and conditions and enough to maybe ameliorate some of this loss cost trend going forward, or should we not think about it that way? Evan Greenberg : Are we getting changes in terms and conditions? Brian Meredith : Yes, tightening enough to maybe \u2013 the 4.5% that you\u2019re seeing are some of the social inflation? Evan Greenberg : In some \u2013 and I don\u2019t want to overstate it, so I don\u2019t \u2013 you can\u2019t take it in, in the overall. But we are getting more changes in deductibles, we\u2019re getting changes in sub-limits, we\u2019re getting changes in attachment points, in casualty excess and those things are all part and are ameliorating and we put values on those. Brian Meredith : And that\u2019s not in your \u2013 when you give us your price increases, that\u2019s not included in that, is it? Evan Greenberg : In some lines, it is, because where we can actually measure it, it is an exposure adjustment and then we take rate against exposure and we determine \u2013 where we can determine mathematically, that is the same thing as rate. So we consider it. Brian Meredith : Great. And then my follow-up question, Evan, I\u2019m curious. PG&E I know it\u2019s been talked about a little bit. There\u2019s some nice subrogation that should be coming through there. What are your kind of thoughts on that subrogation? When could you potentially see some of that come through? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m not going to speculate on that. But we don\u2019t see any material or substantial future subrogation opportunity for Chubb from PG&E. Brian Meredith : Got you. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. I actually didn\u2019t have another one, but I guess I\u2019ll ask on agriculture. I think I asked last quarter on this as well. No, I don\u2019t think anyone got to it. But, yes, I guess there was a little bit of a higher loss PIK there. I guess first of all, what does that incorporate? How much development can we potentially expect on that in the fourth quarter? And what are you still thinking a good combiner is to use for that business as we look out to 2020, or I guess in normalized annual combined ratio for the overall crop segment? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019ll just take that last part. We\u2019ve run in the high 80s to 90 historically and we don\u2019t see a change to that. And by the way, looking at the last number of years we had excellent results, the last few years in that business. It has a natural volatility. It\u2019s crops. It has both a nutritional and a CAT-like nature to it. And this year we\u2019re going to have a less than average year for that business. And let me turn it over to John Lupica for a minute to give you a little more color on that. John Lupica : Yes. Thanks, Evan. Ryan, so we certainly adjusted the year-to-date numbers in the quarter based on what we know today. And we still have to capture all the yields from the field before we can really put a final number. The nice part about the yield is prices are pretty much at base prices. We finish out the October harvest price schedule. So due to the delay in [indiscernible], the harvest period has been pushed out five or six weeks. So I think by the end of the year we\u2019ll obviously have a better sense of the year. And as Evan noted, we don\u2019t see any change off our expectations. We certainly expect it to be in that low 90s area. Evan Greenberg : Low 90s combined for the fourth quarter would be about where we would imagine if nothing changes from what we know now. But God, there\u2019s a lot of unknowns out there. We have no idea right now about yields. We just don\u2019t know. Ryan Tunis : Perfect. And I guess I\u2019ll ask one more. Workers\u2019 comp, Evan, obviously there\u2019s been some rate pressure. How are you seeing absolute levels of profitability there? Are \u2013 there are few opportunities at one point. What\u2019s the outlook right now on workers\u2019 comp? Evan Greenberg : For Chubb that\u2019s not a growth area at this time. It has \u2013 loss cost trends have been quite benign. And the industry has responded with a lot of competition and lowering the prices, some of it rational, some of it to us, just beginning to overshoot that mark. And the benign loss cost environment it\u2019s questionable whether that will remain. And so we have been \u2013 as rates have been coming down, we have been exerting more discipline in that area. It has not been a growth area for us. And I\u2019m speaking about first-dollar primary risk transfer business. In our risk management business, that\u2019s a whole different book and that\u2019s where the \u2013 that\u2019s a large account where it\u2019s self insured or self funded on some basis and we provide all kinds of services and we provide excess coverage. And there that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re quite active and probably the largest writer of that in the United States and we have a lot of knowledge and capability. And that\u2019s where the client has skin in the game, and so that we treat different. Ryan Tunis : It makes sense. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Next, we\u2019ll go to Jay Gelb with Barclays. Please go ahead. Jay Gelb : Good morning. I know it\u2019s early days with regard to other catastrophe loss potential in 4Q, but any initial perspective on Typhoon Hagibis and the California wildfires and looking at that relative to what was a pretty heavy catastrophe loss a year ago in the fourth quarter, around 8 points of catastrophe losses on the combined ratio, how should we think about that? Evan Greenberg : Well, you should think that this is the end of October, so we\u2019re one-third through the movie. And I can\u2019t tell you how the movie ends. I didn\u2019t see it before. So I don\u2019t know. We\u2019re in the risk business and part of being in the risk business, we take catastrophe exposure. And so I don\u2019t wring my hands about having catastrophe losses. I\u2019m just concerned that we measured the exposure correctly and did we charge a proper price for taking the risk. Other than that, I\u2019m going to have that volatility, so I\u2019m not wringing my hands. On the Japan typhoon, so far from everything we know, it is not a significant event for Chubb. On the California wildfires there were ongoing right now. The only thing we know is the Tick Fire is the one that\u2019s out and on that one, we didn\u2019t have any losses. And on the other two, it\u2019s just very early days and I\u2019d rather not predict. And I don\u2019t know what the outcomes will be at this moment. Our losses are very minor. Jay Gelb : Right, understood. And then on a separate issue, I just wanted to follow up on the North America commercial. The gross rate in premium in the third quarter was up 10% year-over-year. Was there any one-timers in there that would have influenced that or was that kind of a true perspective on the growth rate that you\u2019re now seeing in that business given improving market conditions? Evan Greenberg : We didn\u2019t have anything mega in the quarter, but we write large accounts there. And so we won a number of new large accounts and that\u2019s what just gets baked into that, but nothing in particular that stands out to us. Jay Gelb : So a strong acceleration in the core business. Evan Greenberg : It was a strong growth quarter. We won a number of new large accounts in the quarter. But remember, it\u2019s lumpy business. So I can\u2019t tell you the next quarter is going to be the same. It bounces around a bit, but it was very good. Jay Gelb : Understood. That\u2019s great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : We liked everything we saw about how the market behaved and moved towards us in terms of rates and terms. Jay Gelb : Excellent. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Hi. Good morning. Just had a question \u2013 and I appreciate the color on the three buckets. Just wanted to get a little bit more detail on when you really saw or have seen an acceleration in the loss trends in the last two buckets? And specifically if you\u2019ve seen any increase over the last couple of quarters that you\u2019d note? Evan Greenberg : Nothing over the last couple of quarters that we\u2019d note. I\u2019ve been talking about this. If you go back into shareholder letters, into quarterly commentaries, we\u2019ve been talking about this for two years. David Motemaden : Got it. So no meaningful acceleration beyond what you\u2019ve been mentioning, okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then just on the PPD in North America commercial, the [indiscernible] obviously went into effect this quarter. Just wondering any early indications you got on your exposure there and if that was an element that led to the lower year-over-year PPD? Evan Greenberg : No, zero, number one. Number two, I think you\u2019re referring to New York. California went into effect, I believe the governor signed it last week and there are a number of other states that are in the middle of passing reviver statute now. We have no way at this point of estimating the exposure and ultimately loss to Chubb in that. And so you\u2019re at the very beginning, it\u2019s way too early. David Motemaden : Okay, great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we\u2019ll take our final question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks very much. Evan, I was wondering if there\u2019s any way of quantifying broadly how much of the current insurance market is adequately priced compared to a year ago. Evan Greenberg : Meyer, we haven\u2019t done \u2013 we haven\u2019t added it up that way or thought about it that way. And when you say the market, that\u2019s asking \u2013 I cannot tell you the adequacy of the ocean overall. So, no. Meyer Shields : Okay, fair enough. The second question, given \u2013 I don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s external \u2013 whether issues with the underlying chronological changes. Is there any way of assessing what loss trend is for North America property lines? Evan Greenberg : There\u2019s no way for you to assess that, but we can assess that. Meyer Shields : Can you tell us what you\u2019ve come up with? Evan Greenberg : And it will vary \u2013 Meyer, I\u2019m not disclosing it, but it will vary \u2013 we\u2019re not going into sub-lines, but it will vary \u2013 we have a number of property portfolio. We have first-dollar property that is admitted risk, we have first-dollar property that is E&S and they behave differently. We have excess property. And we have other coverages that go along with them and then we have large account property. And it all behaves a little bit differently. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I\u2019d like to turn the call back over to today\u2019s presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

This conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to Chubb's December 31st, 2019 fourth quarter year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance and growth opportunities, pricing and business mix and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now it's my pleasure to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, we'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist you with your questions are several members of our management team. And now I will turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we recorded core operating income in the fourth quarter of $2.28 per share, up 13% from prior year. The quarter was marked by excellent premium revenue growth globally, driven by an improved and improving pricing and underwriting environment, that is spreading to more lines of business and more territories. Our organic growth in the commercial lines underwriting environment were the best in over five years. We also experienced a fairly active quarter globally for weather-related and man-made catastrophes, including the impact of weather on our U.S. agriculture business. Core operating income was just over $1 billion. Our published P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 92.7%, about 0.5% point improvement over prior year, with P&C underwriting income up 12%. On the one hand, we benefited from lower year-over-year catastrophe losses. You may have noticed that half of our total CAT losses in the quarter was from one event at Tornado that destroyed a mile by 1.5 mile affluent neighborhood in the suburbs of Dallas, where Chubb had significant market share, what are the odds, but that's our business. On the other hand, as you saw from our pre-announcement, we reported an underwriting loss of $23 million for the quarter in our crop insurance business, attributable to yield shortfalls from difficult growing conditions compared with an underwriting gain of $161 million in last year's fourth quarter. As I pointed out before, by its nature, crop insurance is a business with CAT like exposures. After all, it's about moisture and temperature i.e., the weather. The risk-reward for crop insurance has been favorable for Chubb over the long, short and medium term. And after three exceptional years in '16 to '18, last year was below average. For the quarter, the global P&C combined ratio, which excludes agriculture was 91.9% compared with 95.2% prior year. And on a current accident year basis, excluding CATs, it was an outstanding, 88.6% versus 89.9% last year. To briefly recap the year, core operating earnings of $4.6 billion were up over 5%. The P&C underwriting income, up 4.5%. Global P&C underwriting income, which again excludes Ag, was up 18.5%. The Global P&C combined ratios both calendar and current accident year were simply excellent. The calendar year was down from the year before, and the current accident year, excluding CATs was flat with prior year. Booking tangible book value per share were up 11.7% and 18.6%, respectively for the year, driven by a combination of income and the mark from falling interest rates. Phil will have more to say about the investment income, book value, CATs and prior period development. Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premium revenue in the quarter in constant dollars was excellent. And as I noted a moment ago, the strongest organic premium revenue growth in over five years. Net premiums grew 9.8% before foreign exchange, which had less than 1 point of negative impact. The pricing environment continued to improve quarter-on-quarter with the rate of increase accelerating and spreading to more classes of business and risk types. Overall, prices increased in North America, commercial, which includes both major accounts and specialty, as well as middle market and small commercial by 8.3% on a written basis versus a current loss cost trend of about 4.5%. Renewal price change includes both rate of 9%, and a slight decline on exposure of about 0.5%. We continue to benefit from a flight to quality, more business continues to meet our underwriting standards and new and existing customers choose Chubb. New business was up nearly 10% in the quarter and renewal retention was excellent, 95.5% on a premium and 87% on a policy count basis. In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding ag, premiums grew over 10.5%, with major accounts retail growth of 9% and E&S wholesale growth of 10%. In terms of rate increases : rates for major accounts were up 10.5%; with risk management, up 5.5%; excess casualty, up 27%; and property and short-tail lines, up 20%. Management liability rates increased 20%. In our Westchester, E&S wholesale business, rates were up 15%; property, up over 19%; casualty, up 15%; and financial lines, up nearly 12%, all well above third quarter's increases. Rates in our Chubb Bermuda business were up 33%. Turning to our U.S. middle market and small commercial division, premiums grew over 7.5%, and excluding workers comp, we grew 10%. Renewal retention in our middle market business was nearly 94%. Middle market pricing was up 5%, and excluding comp, it was up nearly 7%. Pricing for casualty ex. comp was up about 6%, while comp pricing was down about 4.5%. Package was up 6%; property, up 10.5%; and financial lines rates were up almost 8%. In our North America, personal lines business, net premiums in the quarter were up over 9%, but adjusted for additional reinsurance items, which negatively impacted prior year growth, we grew 4.5%. Retention remains strong at 97.5% on a premium basis, and over 89% on a policy basis. Homeowners pricing was up nearly 13% in the quarter. We are making great progress in reshaping the portfolio, the more closely focused on clients, who lead our risk profile. Turning to our international business, growth remains strong in our Overseas General Insurance operations with premiums written, up 9% in constant dollars and FX then had a negative impact about 2.5 percentage points. Net premiums for our London market wholesale business were up 22%, while our retail division was up almost 8% with growth broadly distributed across the globe. Growth in our international retail was led by Continental Europe, up nearly 10.5% and the best growth in many years, followed by Latin America and Asia Pac, up over 9% and 8%, respectively, and the U.K., up over 5.5%. Overall, rates in our international retail business were up 10%; property, up 11%; casualty, up 3%; and financial lines, up 17%. Rates in our London wholesale business were up 20%; property, up 21%; financial lines, up 16%; and aviation, up 27%. Our Asia-focused international Life Insurance business had a strong quarter with net premiums, up over 14% in constant dollar and a contribution to earnings of $36 million, up over 12% from prior year. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. In closing, it was a good quarter and year for Chubb. Premium revenue growth continued to accelerate as more business meets our underwriting standards and we achieve greater price adequacy and a rapidly improving underwriting environment. We have started the New Year in excellent shape with a lot of momentum. Our organization was built on a global scale to capitalize on market conditions, such as this. We have patiently waited and remain disciplined and true to our culture and the craft of underwriting excellence. We are now capitalizing on greater opportunity. At the same time, we are not taking our eye off the execution of our many important long-term strategic initiatives, that position us for future revenue and earnings growth, including our increasing ownership stake in Huatai Insurance Group, progress we are making with our digital efforts, our growing international consumer lines operation and our growth strategies for middle market and small commercial around the globe. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then we'll be back to take your questions. Philip Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. We completed the year with a very strong overall financial position. Businesses and investment performance produced positive cash flow of $1.4 billion for the quarter and $6.3 billion for the year. Our total capital grew to over $70 billion and our cash and invested assets grew $8.6 billion for the year, to $111 billion. In addition, as Evan mentioned our book and tangible book value per share were 11.7% and 18.6%, respectively. For the year, excluding unrealized gains from declining interest rates book and tangible book value per share grew 5.5% and 8.1%, respectively. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $650 million to shareholders, including $340 million in dividends and $310 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned $2.9 billion to shareholders, including $1.4 billion in dividends and over $1.5 billion in share repurchases at an average price of $146.61 per share. In December, we issued $1.6 billion of five-year and 10-year debt in the European market at an average interest rate of 0.59%. For the year, we have issued $2.8 billion of euro debt and paid out of $500 million of debt that mature. This debt produced to fund certain future debt maturities and other corporate uses. Our annualized core operating ROE for the year was 9% and our core operating return on tangible equity was 14.6%. As previously announced in December, we increased our ownership stake in Huatai Insurance Group to 30.9% and agreed to purchase another 22.4% in two separate transactions, contingent on certain approvals and other conditions. We will hold a majority stake when we complete the second transaction. Until then, we continue to apply equity accounting to our Huatai ownership. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $893 million pretax and $3.6 billion pretax for the year. The investment income in the quarter was slightly below our previous guidance due to lower than expected private equity distributions. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $885 million to $895 million. After-tax net realized and unrealized gains were $268 million for the quarter and $3 billion for the year, primarily from a decline in interest rates in the fixed income portfolio. Net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $430 million pretax, or $350 million after-tax, as previously announced and are further detailed in the financial supplement. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $233 million pretax, or $199 million after-tax. This is net of $74 million adverse development from our legacy run off exposure principally related to asbestos. The remaining favorable development of $307 million is split approximately 67% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior and 33% in short-tail lines. The full year agriculture combined ratio was 95.1%, compared with 75.5% in the prior year, or a decline of $296 million in underwriting income from higher crop losses. Given this year's results, we do not expect the 2019 crop year to develop anywhere near as favorably in 2020, as the 2018 year developed in the first quarter of 2019. As a reminder, we had positive development of over $60 million in last year's first quarter. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves decreased $118 million in the quarter, reflecting the impact of catastrophe loss statements, favorable prior period development and crop insurance payments in the quarter. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 106%. After adjusting for the items noted above, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 98%. For the year, net loss reserves increased $514 million on a constant dollar basis. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 99% and was 92% adjusted for the items noted above. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 14.2%, which is in line with our annual expected range, although, is there at the lower end of the range given the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter. For the year, our core operating effective tax rate was 14.9%. For 2020, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to continue to be in the range of 14% to 16%. I'll turn the call back to - I mean, Karen, sorry. Karen Beyer : Thank you. And at this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : I guess, first question, Evan, very high-level question and then kind of apologize in advance. It's kind of a generic question, but I really want to get your thoughts on this. Look, the industry is reacting to, I guess, listening to the past, if you will from pricing and its to the industry. You seem, we don't have to do those much because your prior year stuff was already strong. And so the question here is kind of more, how do you think about - the answer is really your account by account details of your underwriting, and which you guys do phenomenally well. But at a high-level, Evan, how do you steer the ship with thinking about just the trade-off between - you have a cushion that you could maybe not really worry about margin expansion as much because you got such great MBS margins. And think about the growth that you could possibly get even higher growth, if you give up a little bit more on the margin expansion. So, just kind of a high-level. How do you think about the tug-of-war between the pricing that you want to get the growth. Do you want rest of the margins that you had on that? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I don't think about it that way. And not how an underwriting organization really thinks about it. Your question is, in a sense, be simplistic. We quote the rates and prices and underwriting terms that we require in each line of business, to earn what we think is an adequate risk adjusted return as expressed by a combined ratio in that line of business. It then all mixes together in portfolio, which you then see as an overall published average combined ratio. And so you can't in the commercial P&C business, which runs higher than the average that you look at, as a whole company. You then dig down by line and there are lines of business that are - that we think are adequate now, or maybe a bit above the adequate in some cases, and there are lines of business that are below adequate, and we'll continue to drive for rate. Wherever we see adequacy and we like the risk-reward, we're hardly holding back on growth. And I think the question is a little ironic this quarter, when you're asking it in the backdrop of fundamentally a 10% growth rate on an organization of this size. I hope that helps you. Michael Phillips : Okay. Yes, thanks. A little more detail than on the\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I think you had a second question. Michael Phillips : I did. Yes, thanks. This is more detail on Overseas General, it kind of nitpicky question here on your expense ratio, how to think about that in 2020? I mean, it looks like it's ticked up a bit throughout '19 more on the acquisition expense and what's behind that to the return 2020? Evan Greenberg : Yes, it's pretty - it's pretty simple. About one-third of it, as - of the increase is related to one-time items last year that, that benefited last year's expense ratio, from about one-third of it is, is mix of business, where it's business runs a lower loss ratio, higher expense ratio, and some of the partnerships we have will have that signature to them, because the mix of product is a lower loss ratio related. And the third is investments we've been making in certain businesses, particularly in Asia and to a degree in Latin America to grow - for future growth, and we'll grow into our sleeves there and the expense ratio will ameliorate and improve. Operator : We'll now hear from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Paul Newsome : I want to ask about North American casualty, the loss trend that you mentioned, because that seems to be a big topic of just how you might be accelerating. Could you a little talk about maybe what's going on there as well as, I would imagine, tell me if I'm wrong, there are pieces in there with some pretty high loss trends maybe D&O, professional liability? And then where are the offsets? Evan Greenberg : Yes. No. Yes, without going into too much detail, just to give the shape of that a little bit. First of all, I don't agree with your last comment. I think, it's - I don't - it's not how we see it. D&O is an old story. We've been talking about it for a while. Frequency and severity both moved up, but that was a couple of years ago. And we've seen it pretty steady at that elevated level. We don't see that continuing to deteriorate overall, and that's all classes that we've mixed together in there. There are some classes, individual classes, sub-classes that, that have an increasing frequency, but overall. In primary casualty, we're seeing severity stable. We haven't - in the risk transfer primary casualty area, we haven't noticed a deterioration. In workers comp, in the risk transfer comp business through the year, we've seen an increase of severity, particularly on the '18 and '19 years. And by the way, so all of our loss cost trends, we're comfortable with our OpEx. And we're constantly looking at updated data. And the trends we see are reflected in our loss cost fix for the year, for the back years and inform us as we go forward into the '20 year. I hope that helps you. Paul Newsome : No, no. I think it makes sense. And then secondly, I just want to make sure, and I think, I have a good guess at this, but that the Asian exposure to all this virus, just the economic turmoil that's resulting there. I would imagine, and tell me if I'm wrong that you've got fairly minimal exposures through losses, but there might be some sales disruption just because people will not be able to get out. Is that a kind of a good way to think about it, or is there something else I should be thinking about. I don't expect\u2026 Evan Greenberg : We're experienced, we're informed in our underwriting from past pandemics and/or potential pandemics. SARs was a good run at this. And given our underwriting position, and how we think about supply chains, and how we think about property in the perils we cover, et cetera. We see very minimal loss exposure on this. We have a very small, almost non-exist and accident and health business in China. And we don't see - we imagine modest impact from everything we can tell, from economic slowdown or economic activity. But time will tell in that regard. We don't know the true infection rate likely and we don't know when this is going to peak. And so that's what I can give you based on what we know today. Paul Newsome : Obviously, keeping our fingers crossed there. So thank you very much. Operator : Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo has the next question. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, Evan, in your prepared remarks you talked about strongest growth you guys have seen in five years. You also painted a picture of a lot of price going through your book that you said continued into 2020. So, as we think about 2020, do you see price and growth picking up as we move throughout the year. And I guess how long, do you have a line of sight in terms of how long do you think the upward pricing momentum might last? Evan Greenberg : Yes. You're asking me a bunch of questions that you know, I'm not going to answer much, Elyse, but I admire you for asking. Look, I can't - I'm not going to prognosticate the balance of the year. I mean, the only thing I'll tell you is this, I think growth, we ran about 7% in '19, and I think that will be in the range, if not better in the '20 underwriting year is my sense of it, but no guarantees and there's always a little volatility quarter-to-quarter given some seasonality and mix of business. So, you never see it in just some steady way. On pricing, I think, it endures. The fundamentals speak to it. And so the environment we see is the environment I imagine and will continue for some time, it's rational. And there are many reasons for it. And there is nothing that I see that tells me the momentum will slow. If anything, it's picked up, and it is spreading more broadly. Industry needs rate and needs it in quite a number of classes and across the globe. And then you're in a low interest rate environment and you can hardly rely on investment income to bail you out. And the industry needs rate because rate has just not kept pace with loss cost trends for quite a number of years. The math is so simple. People seem to over intellectualize this. And then on the other side of the coin, in the numerator, there are a few discrete classes where the loss environment is more hostile, and that is out there. That is understood. That is known and you either recognized it and reflected it in your reserves and in your loss picks and pricing in the past come, or it's something that you're doing with currently and is in front of you. But I think that just varies by organization. Elyse Greenspan : And then secondly on - we've heard a lot in the reinsurance market about prices going up at January 1, and I think there are some expectations. We'll see that continuing throughout the year. Does Chubb, have any thoughts of changing their reinsurance program in a significant degree for what you had placed in 2019, your outbound program? Evan Greenberg : I'm not - that is a treaty-by-treaty book of business by book of business decision. We make rational decisions around all of that. And so I'm not going to make any general statements about that. Elyse Greenspan : And then one last question. In the past, you guys have given us your excess capital, in terms of the drag on your ROE. Could you let us know about where that will sit after you make the next investment within the Huatai. Have you increased your stake over the next couple of deals? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Go ahead, Philip. Philip Bancroft : 5% to 7%, drag on the ROE. I'm sorry, 5% to 7%. Evan Greenberg : Oh, it's not 5%, it's 0.5%. Philip Bancroft : I'm sorry, 50 basis points to 70 basis points. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : Elyse, what we said is 50 basis points to 75 basis points of drag on ROE. Operator : And our next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Evan, I think in response to previous question, you had said that, you'd seen the D&O option started to deteriorate at least two years ago or about two years ago. Just curious what happened, six months ago, four months ago, when rates started to really move up? Why was there kind of year-and-a-half lag there? Evan Greenberg : Yes, sure. And by the way, we saw it, two years or three years ago, it's three years we've been talking about it, because it was the '17 year, '17, '18, '19. So, sorry, even longer. You know, look, you get notices. Notices turn into - you get notices of circumstance. You get - you then get notices of claim. You get those turning into incurs. And then ultimately they move to cash flow. And those who have large books of this, teach and play both the primary and the excess they see it and they play. First, layer excess they see it earlier and have a sense of it, have the data, have the experience to know, which cases are going to turn into which - what kind of loss. And what is a realistic loss amount around that case? They have the data and understanding to see it law firm behavior. And by the way, the nature of the type of claims that are changing and how they're being made. And so you get a sense of all of that early if you're in the position and which we are, and we're a market leader that way. And we see it on a global basis. We could look at it early. There are others who just - they arrive at it late and they arrive at it when it turns into incurred and paid losses. And you get an education, but you pay a tuition for it. Yaron Kinar : And then my second question not really related, North America Personal. I think that delta between adjusted net premiums written and our growth in net premiums growth had been positive for the last four quarters and then this quarter it turn negative. Just trying to understand that the dynamic there. I know that you guys have added a quota share insurance - reinsurance policy for California. But just trying to understand what happened that quarter? Evan Greenberg : I think you are - I think you're confused - I'm sorry, maybe we're looking at different numbers for you confused. We grew, first of all, on a published basis at 9%. When you adjust for the California reinsurance, which we placed last year and it had a bigger impact last year than this year because we made a premium transfer to them of unearned premium. If you understand how that works. And therefore the adjusted real growth rate is 4.5%. If you look back on previous quarters, is our best growth in premium terms and the year. And it has a combination of rate and a reasonable level of retention as we also shape the portfolio, and there are areas where we're eliminating exposure and by the way we got 13 points of price change in the quarter. Operator : Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse has the next question. Mike Zaremski : First question maybe sticking on personal lines. Yeah, the pricing in personal lines seems to have accelerated and I know you've talked about reshaping the portfolio. And I also believe in past quarters, you've been cited as saying loss costs in personal lines is as high as the high-single digits. Maybe you can kind of talk about why loss costs inflation is at that level and some other of your competitors don't speak to it being that high and maybe you can talk about probably about the reshaping and what where you are in that reshaping? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes, sure. First of all, I don't know who you're thinking of as a competitor, but we don't write general market homeowners. We write only affluent. And the share of market we have in there is - and our reach, our national reach on that business is just five-fold. The loss costs in the homeowners business are running in that 8% range. They have been for some time. Cost of materials, cost of labor, and there is a labor shortage and materials particularly at the high end, are very expensive. Business interruption, business interruption, homeowners out of their homes, interrupted an extra living expense is up, because there is more remediation work in a claim than there was in the past more around mold and other conditions that people are more concerned about and that are focused on and get attention. And then frequency of loss as contributed particularly in non-weather water-related, which we've talked about for some time and others have the same issues. So, when you add all that up, those are the main contributing factors to loss costs trend. I don't see it ameliorating by the way, not much. Mike Zaremski : And lastly, thanks for the color on loss expense trend. I'm curious, when you talked about the trend in North America. Does that take into account some of the state changes in terms of the statutes of limitations, some reviver statutes? So maybe you could comment on that. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes. It takes into account everything we know in our portfolio. So, I'm not leaving anything out. However, on the reviver statute changes only - there's notices. There is notice activity and filing of claims. Like there is very little information at this moment to respond to. And that's going to be in my judgment quite a while developing. And I don't - there is not much to respond to at this point. Just take New York for example, all of the cases are being consolidated with one court and judge, who's going to just figure out how to move forward with these in a structured way. So the rules and the process by which these will be adjudicated is yet to be determined. So you can't take discovery. You can't get information. You can't do anything right now. And that's the plaintiff and the defendant, let alone then the insurer that is a derivative of all of this. So it's going to evolve over a period of time, but right now, anything we know where it's - where it can be estimated is in our numbers. Operator : And we'll now take a question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Ryan Tunis : Evan, just in North America commercial, I was hoping you could give us some color on how you'd characterize the accident year loss ratio improvement, 64 versus 66 a year ago, 1.5 point of improvement sequentially. How - is that mostly we earned premium and excessive trend, was a benign attritional activity? I'm just trying to think about what's going on from a margin standpoint there? Evan Greenberg : How would I characterize it? I'd characterize it as darn good. There you go. And look last year we did take some reserve charge, you will recall. So think about it, for a short-tail that did not repeat. And we've recognized a higher loss pick for that. And the improvement is a combination of earned rate underwriting, which frankly is more powerful than the earned rate and actions we take in that regard. And that's about it, because we had seen a lot of change in loss environment. Ryan Tunis : To add one for Phil and then one more for Evan. But Phil, on the Huatai consolidation, how should we think about the impact that might have on either - on book value per share, tangible book value per share, if you do go over that 50% threshold? Philip Bancroft : Yes. It's way too early for that. We're evaluating it. We'll continue to evaluate it, but I'm not ready to give you an impact on tangible at this point. Ryan Tunis : Understood. And then, I guess keeping on these legacy issues we're having. For Chubb, and I guess the industry in general, how are you thinking about with the opioid litigation going on how that might manifest as an Insurance liability? Evan Greenberg : Yes. And I don't think of that as legacy. I think of that is current. It's like other mass story that exists. So I don't see legacy in that. It's - when it comes to opioid, you got to make - we don't cover - insurance doesn't cover financial loss. We cover a loss due to bodily injury property damage. And you have to have that clear linkage in liabilities. You got approved liability. And you got to prove in liability that have resulted in bodily injury and property damage, and/or property damage. And the cases that are brought against pharma right now, are brought for financial loss, because the municipalities and society had a big financial penalty as a result of the overuse of opioids. That's what's alleged. Then making the case to Insurance. Well, you've got - there's plenty of - you got to leap the hurdle, I just said in that regard. You got to be able to demonstrate that you didn't know that you weren't aware when you bought insurance that these things were going on and other defenses. And so right now as far as coverage and what exist, we look at our portfolio through that lens and through those eyes and that we see an estimated liability. We reflected in our records - in our books and records and therefore, our reserves. Ryan Tunis : And I guess, my one follow there would be - is this something that the insureds understand the difference between BI and financial, or is just a type of - in other words, this is something you're able to sort out with your clients, or is this something that ultimately is going to have to be resolved, insurance-related disputes policy wording like that sort of thing? Evan Greenberg : You know what Ryan, welcome to the insurance business. It varies by insured and a) both intellectually and their own character of do they - do you understand the spirit of intent. And then versus let's go torture the language and see what we can get. And so it's all over the lot, always all over. Operator : We'll now hear from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Evan, in your opening comments you noted that there was a small headwinds to premium growth from exposure as opposed to last quarter's small increase. I was wondering, whether there's anything significant in that change? Evan Greenberg : No. And what I gave you, Meyer, was simply, which is kind of an over simplistic way of doing it. What I said to you was that pricing was up 8.5 in North America, all the businesses rolled up. And when that it was made up of 9 in rate and the half and exposure. That - negative exposure. That exposure change is just - we have businesses with positive exposure change in - more in the middle market and small commercial and then it jumps all over the lot in the large account business. And so, I wouldn't - there is - it's got puts and calls in it. There is no general theme to read into that whatsoever. Meyer Shields : And then in the two North America, non-agriculture segment, so it was a bigger year-over-year increase in admin expenses than we've seen year-to-date through September. And I was hoping you could add some color to what's driving that? Evan Greenberg : In which one are you looking at North America? Meyer Shields : Commercial and personal, right, the admin expenses. Evan Greenberg : I'm sorry. Meyer Shields : The administrative expenses. Evan Greenberg : Did you say North America, though? Meyer Shields : Oh, I'm sorry, yeah. North America, commercial; North America, personal. Evan Greenberg : North America, personal. There was nothing. Go ahead, Phil. Philip Bancroft : There were a couple of items in the prior year related to pension and other benefits that benefited this last year. And so it makes it look like an increase this year. Evan Greenberg : Pension adjustment expense. Meyer Shields : Perfect. Thank you so much. Evan Greenberg : It can bounce around a little bit year-by-year. You don't know, it will depend on interest rate levels and all that at the end of this year, how it will look versus the year before. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Two here for you. And then just a quick follow up on Meyer's question about the exposure. I'm just curious, are you guys picking up market share right now and kind of what is the unit kind of growth in North America, commercial, as well as in overseas, or is this not the time for you guys to pick up market share? Evan Greenberg : Well, I think we're picking up market share, but as far as unit, I think the numbers are trying to demonstrate that, but unit growth, we don't have a unit growth number for you. Brian Meredith : Okay. But - I got you. But I guess\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Yes. No, we're picking up market share. Brian Meredith : You're picking up market share. So I guess - the question I guess, Meyer was asking, the 8.5% pricing in North America, right? You said a little bit exposure. I would have thought that would be even higher\u2026 Evan Greenberg : You're missing it. No, you're missing how to define exposure. Brian Meredith : Okay. Evan Greenberg : We are growing - that's not how insurance companies, when they say exposure growth give it to you. So we're growing exposure by writing more clients. That 0.5% that goes into pricing happens to do with how clients - clients have a rate against exposure to determine their premium. That's their own payroll. That's their own receipts, et cetera. And they then report that to you and that goes into their actual premium price. Do you what I mean? Brian Meredith : Right. Yes, yes. Absolute\u2026 Evan Greenberg : That's very different than - that's very different than is Chubb in its written premium growing exposure or we're growing exposure. Brian Meredith : And then my second question. I'm just curious, on your Global A&H business, growth has been fairly muted for a little while. Is that just a function of just economic activity globally, or is there something else to read into that? Evan Greenberg : No. Latin America is growing quite well. Europe grows at an unexciting sort of steady rate, low single digit. It's Asia Pac, where the underlying activity is very good and it's growing well, but we lost a client, Siam Commercial Bank earlier in the year and we talked about that and that has impacted that growth rate year-on-year. And what you'll see as the year goes along that A&H growth will pickup. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now hear from David Motemaden from Evercore. David Motemaden : Just a quick numbers one for Evan and maybe Phil. Just on the civil unrest losses that we saw, the $33 million, is any of that spilling over into 1Q especially in Chile, just given the protests are still going on there? Evan Greenberg : No, not that we see, de minimis. David Motemaden : And then, just - I saw in the December slides, Evan, you had laid out around 45% of your business is exposed to a hardening rate environment. Just wondering what that percentage is today. Just given that it's spreading into other lines in other geographies? Evan Greenberg : That's up. It's up - it's not up dramatically. We have an updated the number yet. David Motemaden : And then with the Huatai investment or the increased stake, just wondering why you guys chose to increase your share there as opposed to maybe applying to get a fully owned license there like some of your peers have? Evan Greenberg : Well, we do. We have a fully-owned, and Chubb Insurance is a wholly owned, completely 100% foreign invested. And if you want to go in that direction, that's the 100-year plan or more. We have with Huatai 600 offices around the country. We have most all provinces. It's a life insurance company that - and foreigners have just been allowed to now own majority in life insurance. But it has a life insurance company that we built and help to build that is doing, closing on $1 billion revenue. It's got P&C company doing that $1.5 billion or so. Got a retail mutual fund license. Good luck getting one of those. It's got so much capability that it gives us to build from. And if you go simply as a foreigner entering China, de novo to build it is very hot style both the regulatory and the business environment. And very difficult to get it done. You have to do it province-by-province. You got to go city-by-city. And not simply you get it at a national level, it's not how it works in China. So this is a very precious asset, if we execute well in recognizing the future value of that asset. David Motemaden : Yes, understood. And I guess just thinking about in terms of the number of Board seats you there. I guess, how much control do you have over wide time? And obviously that will increase as you buy up your stake? And just some of those benefits that you had mentioned in terms of having the local expertise, which Pru U.K. has mentioned as well with their relationship with CITIC. Do you see any risk, once you guys go up to wholly ownership, or maybe even up to like 100% that, that becomes a headwind? Evan Greenberg : No, I don't. And you know, I've been doing business there for almost 30 years. So I know something about the environment there. And approach it with my eyes open and from a perspective that I'm going to - that's the perspective with which I'm going to give you the next comment. When we have majority. We have very clear control. Right now we have substantial influence and control to do more things in there. But obviously, with the majority is when you have clear control, that will happen relatively near-term. And secondly, China is like doing business anywhere. If you're a builder of business versus an investor, then you understand it not in some sterile way and that is that every territory, every country. China in particular are complicated and they have a risk around them. There is no guarantees. But the opportunity, if you execute well, and the opportunity in China is simply dramatic. It's a country of a lot of talented people. Our ability to source talent, ability to recognize leadership, our ability to use talent that we have around the region and around the world, including Chinese, we have those tools and those advantages. And we've got it's a country of relationships. We have a lot of them. And so it is again not without risk, but given the reward and the potential, and that it is the largest and what will be the largest economy in the world and it's the second largest now, well, I'll tell you what. It's not a hard decision to make that the long-term potential value creation for this organization. And that's what it's about long-term value creation. David Motemaden : Yes, I totally agree. Thanks for the thoughts. Appreciate it. Operator : Looks like we have time for one more question. And that question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : Thank you for fitting me in. I mean, I just had one question. I guess, it sort of dovetails with this long-term value creation comment you just made. If I look in your earnings press releases, you always include both core operating, return on equity results. And then you include a core operating return on equity on tangible equity results. So, I'm not trying to be argumentative, but could you remind me of the thought process behind that tangible reference? I assume, the goodwill from Chubb and other acquisitions continues to be valuable. So just looking for clarification there. Evan Greenberg : Sure, it is. I am - first of all, I think tangible is your most constraining factor, when you are - when you in a balance sheet risk business. You can only pay claims against tangible. Can only grow your revenue and exposure to the extent of your tangible wherewithal. You can only borrow and you can only make acquisition to the extent of tangible, to your most constraining factor. Tangible is also the purest. Book, straight book has accounting, what I'd say is, more accounting related within it's more subjective than objective. When I look at the return on equity versus tangible return on equity, tangible is the one I have my eye on more for value creation. When I look at equity and return on equity, the Chubb, I look at it over a long-term. And you said it right to me, depends on, it varies by company and you have to able to assess that. The goodwill, I think is an appreciating asset in this company, not a - hardly a depreciating or a stagnant. It opened the path to such future value creation of the organization that is occurring over time and will occur over time. And the goodwill you grow into that goodwill and because it's an appreciating asset, the Chubb and ACE combination that created most of that, created that value that way. So that's how we see it. And I think it's the right balance and how we think about value creation. So, thanks for the question, I didn't take it as argumentative. Greg Peters : Thanks for fitting me in. Operator : That will conclude our question-and-answer session. I'll turn the call back to your host for closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to seeing you again next quarter. Thank you and have a good day. Operator : With that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Chubb Limited First Quarter 2020 Earnings Conference Call. Today\u2019s call is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you. And welcome to our March 31, 2020 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Company performance and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and other effects, pricing and business mix and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I would like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we\u2019ll take your questions. Also, with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We\u2019re in an unprecedented moment of historic proportions. None of us living today has experienced an event of this nature or magnitude. It is at once surreal and catastrophic. As a country, we will manage through and heal both our society and economy, and it will take time. The decisive heroic actions taken by our health professionals in combination with the support and leadership of our federal and state governments, and our vast private sector and civil society are powerful force to combat the virus, stabilize our financial markets, support our economy, which remains in a virtual coma, and set the stage for recovery. The most important thing we can do now to achieve stability and health while reopening the economy is to improve our tests, digital trace and isolate capability. The insurance industry plays an important role in our economic foundation. During this health and economic crisis, we are shouldering our responsibilities and carrying our share of the financial load. This event impacts both the liability and asset side of our industry balance sheet. With that, I\u2019m going to divide my remarks into two parts : First, our quarterly results, which were very good; then, I\u2019ll provide some perspective on the current environment and how we are operating. To begin, as you saw from the numbers, we reported core operating income in the first quarter of $2.68 per share. The quarter was marked by very strong premium revenue growth globally and excellent underwriting results on both the published in current accident year basis. The calendar year P&C combined ratio for the quarter was 89.1% versus 89.2% prior year with P&C underwriting income up over 9.5% in constant dollar. On a current accident year basis, excluding cat, the combined ratio was 87.5%, a full point improvement over prior year with current accident year underwriting income up over 18%. The major difference between calendar year and current accident year underwriting income growth was a reduced benefit from the runoff of the \u201819 crop insurance year. You\u2019ll recall, \u201819 was a difficult year for agriculture, while \u201818 was an excellent one. Book and tangible book value per share decline 5.5% and 7.5% respectively for the quarter, and Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period development. Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C net premiums grew 8.9% on a published or 9.3% in constant dollars. The commercial P&C pricing environment continued to firm across the globe. We secured greater market share as we achieved improved rate to exposure and more lines of business, and this unnecessary firming continued into April. Overall rates increased in North America commercial which includes both, major accounts and specialty, as well as middle market and small commercial by 10.5%. New business was up 27.5% in the quarter and renewal retention was 95% on a premium basis. Our North America commercial P&C business had a strong quarter with net premiums growth of over 10%. In major accounts and specialty commercial, excluding ag, premiums grew about 9.5% with major account retail growth of 7% and E&S wholesale growth of over 19%. In terms of rate increases, rates per major accounts were up 13%, and in Westchester and Bermuda, they were up 16% and 42%, respectively. Turning to our U.S. middle market and small commercial division. Premiums grew 11% overall with middle market up 9% and small commercial up over 40%. Renewal retention in our middle market business was 94.5%. Middle market pricing was up over 6.5% and excluding workers\u2019 comp, it was up over 7%. In our North America personal lines business, net premiums written in the quarter were up 4.8% and retention remained very strong at 98% on a premium basis. In our international general insurance operations, growth remains strong with net premiums written up 10% in constant dollar and FX then had a negative impact of about 1.3 points. Net premiums for London wholesale business grew over 27%, while retail division was up over 8.5%. Growth in our international retail business was led by Latin America, which was up 13%, continental Europe and UK had growth of 9.7% and 9.1% respectively. And overall rates in our international retail business were up 8% and 18% in our London wholesale. Our international life insurance business had a strong quarter with net written premiums up nearly 30% in constant dollar. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. But that\u2019s ancient history and from another time. What\u2019s important is to recognize the underlying strength and momentum of our Company, as we entered this moment. Turning to the current environment. The COVID-19 pandemic and consequent economic crisis will of course impact Chubb. Our growth momentum, particularly in our commercial P&C business globally continued into April and we continue to experience improved rates to exposure. As we go forward, offsetting that will be a meaningful impact to growth from the health and economic crisis as exposures in important areas shrink for a time with the impact varying by country. This includes consumer-related lines. For example, travel insurance, A&H discretionary purchases, automobile insurance, commercial lines where exposures are reduced while businesses are closed or as they reopen and are diminished or simply go out of business. Small commercial businesses in aggregate will be more impacted than medium, which will be more impacted than large companies, but it will vary substantially by industry. For credit-related products such as trade, credit, surety, and other lines such as workers\u2019 comp, premium revenue will be impacted by reduced exposures. As you know, we do not give forward guidance and in this case, the degree of revenue impact is simply unknowable. On the other hand, as I said, we are and will continue to benefit in terms of growth from improved technical conditions as many insurance companies take actions to reduce exposures or improve their rate to exposure to correct for inadequate underwriting. This will be an earnings event for Chubb. It will not threaten our balance sheet. Operating earnings will be impacted predominantly on the liability side of the balance sheet from increased insurance claims, though the asset side will likely be impacted as well from increased asset impairments. In addition, as I just mentioned, earnings will be impacted by a reduction in premium revenues for a period of time. In sum, from what we know now, this will be a manageable cat-like event. However, from an exposure, we really don\u2019t discreetly price for. So, its impact is additive to our normal projected loss exposure. In a sense, it\u2019s like what terrorism exposure was before 9/11. We have a very strong balance sheet. Our capital and liquidity position are robust and Chubb will continue to operate at a high level and emerge strong or stronger. Again, insurance has an important role to play in society and in the economy, and we\u2019re shouldering our share of responsibility while doing our job to support our employees, our customers, and our business partners. We have been quite clear about our priorities and it shows in our response. First, to the extent possible, we have taken care of our 33,000 people around the world and endeavored to keep them safe through aggressive work from home protocols. We\u2019ve provided them a degree of peace of mind knowing their jobs and benefits are secure during the health crisis with a no layoff pledge. Second, we have remained consistent in how we take care of our customers and distribution partners doing what we can to support their needs. In fact, we are operating around the globe as a normal company during abnormal times. I am so proud and absolutely grateful for how my colleagues are performing every day as a group. From the smallest to the largest unit, from the biggest to the smallest country, how each is focused on delivering on our mission from internal operations to underwriting, sales, claims, marketing and finance, it\u2019s really quite remarkable. We\u2019re extending payment terms to commercial customers, recognizing their cash flow pressures. We\u2019re providing a premium credit for auto policyholders in the U.S., recognizing their reduced exposures. We\u2019re supporting our U.S., small business clients with premium reductions for their reduced exposures, and we\u2019re supporting our small commercial clients by providing health care workers, and first responders the gift cards redeemable at our customers\u2019 businesses. Lastly, as a corporate citizen, we\u2019re contributing to the immediate emergency response today while supporting the future tomorrow. Our commitment of $10 million to pandemic relief efforts globally is being directed to a range of organizations that provide essential resources immediately in areas that facing the most acute need. This includes providing emergency medical equipment and supplies to healthcare facilities and helping community food banks support those who are hungry and vulnerable, including so many who\u2019ve become unemployed as a result of the pandemic. This is only the first chapter. As we move into the recovery phase, the Chubb Foundation will commit substantial additional funds. In sum, our Company is very strong. Our balance sheet is in good shape. We are operating well. While I see pressure on revenue and earnings in the short term, I see much opportunity for us in the future. Given all of our capabilities, I am confident Chubb will weather these difficult times and emerge stronger from this challenge. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Phil and then we\u2019ll be back to take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. I want to begin with a few words on our financial position, which remains exceptionally strong. Our balance sheet includes a AA rated investment portfolio with a relatively short duration and conservative approach to our loss reserves. We have over $67 billion in total capital, which as we enter this period, is very strong, stemming from superior operating performance. Our access to liquidity on a global basis is excellent and unimpaired. Our operating cash flow remains quite strong and was $1.7 billion for the quarter. Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter of $3.7 billion pretax included $2.2 billion from the investment portfolio, which resulted primarily from widening credit spreads in the investment grade and high yield bond portfolio through March 31st. Even after considering the valuation adjustments noted, our portfolio remains in an overall unrealized gain position through the quarter-end. Since that time, credit markets have recovered and liquidity has improved as a result of the extraordinary actions taken by the Fed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The portfolio mark has improved by approximately $1.7 billion pretax through this Monday. We also had a mark-to-market loss on a variable annuity reinsurance portfolio of $560 million. This was primarily due to negative equity returns and an increase in implied volatility. Again, this is purely a mark-to-market adjustment required because the transactions are deemed to be derivatives for accounting purposes and it does not indicate a reduction in cash flows from our reinsurance treaties for the quarter. The results are in line with our expectations, given these market conditions. Finally, realized-unrealized losses included $896 million after-tax losses from FX, related to our net asset exposure to foreign currency. These represent a point in time mark to market valuation adjustment and do not affect the capital position of our international operating units. As we noted in the press release, the marks are market price-driven based on the last day of the quarter and a moment in time. We believe they are largely transient and will accrete back to book value over time. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $893 million pretax and was within our guidance range. During March, we engaged on the margin in several tactical adjustments to the portfolio. We purchased a modest amount of high quality equities and modestly increased our exposure to investment grade corporate bonds. While there are number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we expect our quarterly run-rate to remain in the range of $885 million to $895 million. Net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $237 million pretax or $199 million after-tax, including $224 million from global weather-related events and $13 million so far from COVID-19, which has been classified as an ongoing catastrophe. While there was no significant impact on core operating income in the first quarter related to COVID-19, the Company anticipates that this global catastrophe event will have an impact on revenue as well as net and core operating income in the second quarter and potentially future quarters as a result of an increase in insurance claims, due to both the pandemic and recessionary economic conditions. On a constant dollar basis, net loss reserves increased $363 million in the quarter and include the impact of catastrophe loss payments, favorable prior period development and crop insurance payments in the quarter. On a reported basis, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 95%. After adjusting for the items noted above, the paid-to-incurred ratio was 88%. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $118 million pre-tax or $94 million after-tax. The favorable development is split approximately 28% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2016 and prior, and 72% in short-tail lines. Last year\u2019s favorable development of $204 million included $61 million of positive development from our agriculture segment resulting from stronger than expected results from the 2018 crop year. As we said at year-end, based on the difficult 2019 crop year, this level of development would not recur in the first quarter of 2020. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $666 million to shareholders, including $340 million in dividends and $326 million in share repurchases at an average price of $143.67 per share. Given the current economic environment and to preserve capital for both risk and opportunity, the Company has suspended further share repurchases indefinitely. Our annualized core operating ROE in the quarter was 9.4% and our core operating return on tangible equity was 15.1%. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.3%. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 14% to 16%. I\u2019ll turn the call back to Evan -- I mean Karen. Sorry, excuse me. Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And with that we\u2019ll take our first question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks, Evan for your comments. I guess, the first question is going to be on the future impact on the wealth side from COVID in the coming quarters. And obviously without giving numbers, but maybe just where you feel Chubb is most exposed to that from I guess a geographic and coverage perspective? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m not going to give any specifics in that. There\u2019ll be -- it\u2019ll come from a variety of areas, as we imagine right now. And there\u2019ll be a -- the reason we didn\u2019t put up numbers in the first quarter is because we\u2019re going to do it in a thoughtful way, based on claims that come in, that are analyzed and reported, and then, we\u2019re able to have a framework to project the IBNR with that in a thoughtful way as well. But, claims will come from travel insurance and A&H. We\u2019ll have business interruption losses where we purposely provided coverage as opposed to where we -- the vast majority where we did not provide coverage. We\u2019ll have it through credit-related that is surety and trade credit and maybe political risk, who knows. Workers\u2019 comp will produce losses, I\u2019m sure. And so, it kind of gives you a sense. And it\u2019ll be -- I think it\u2019ll be pretty broad based because it\u2019s created exposures for clients, for the industries and the economies broadly. And geography, well, over half our business is in the United States. So, I expect all things being equal, since our greatest exposure is in the U.S. by territory, the greatest amount of loss will come out of the U.S. And I hope that helps you. Michael Phillips : Yes, it does. It does. Thank you very much. I know, Evan, you\u2019ve been very actively involved in task force and things that are happening here in the U.S. And I guess, clearly all the pressure from states on BI and states on workers\u2019 comp and big restaurants that are in bed with [indiscernible] and things like that, all these different pressures in the U.S. And I\u2019m not really looking for one expectation, but just your thoughts on how this all kind of shakes out, given all the different scenarios on how the pressure on insurance kind of unfolds and what to expect maybe as this thing kind of shakes out? Evan Greenberg : The insurance industry is an important part of the financial plumbing of our economy in the U.S. And frankly, it\u2019s part of the financial plumbing, it\u2019s critical globally. The insurance industry I think is performing quite well and I think will perform very well in meeting their obligations and our obligations. When it comes to business interruption, there is activity that I put into two categories. One is on the political side where there\u2019s talk about retroactively imposing cover on insurers for something that they didn\u2019t cover and didn\u2019t charge a premium. That is retroactively changing contract and increasing our exposure. I think that that\u2019s unnecessary harm and would do great damage. It would damage or destroy the insurance industry in a terrible way. It would simply take money from one to give to another. Who does that serve? And frankly, it\u2019s unconstitutional. And we are a constitutional democracy and preservation of that and the certainty of that in such uncertain times is paramount. So, I\u2019d start with that. Secondly, the insurance industry, for the most part, except for those customers who discreetly purchased it, BI insurance doesn\u2019t cover COVID-19. It covers and requires direct physical loss to a property. And the regulators who\u2019ve approved these forms, because we\u2019re highly regulated, confirm that themselves that it\u2019s not contemplated. Now, lawyers and the trial bar will attempt to torture the language on standard industry forms and try to prove something exists that actually doesn\u2019t exist and try to twist the intent when the intent is very clear and the industry will fight this tooth and nail. We will pay what we owe. And finally, what I\u2019d say is business interruption insurance, actually we should remember, is very good value for money because what it does cover, we pay out as an industry roughly from what we can estimate about $0.70 on the dollar and every business -- for every business interruption, dollar of premium we collect in claims. And that\u2019s pretty good value for money. So, thank you for the question. Operator : And we will take our next question form Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Good morning, Evan. My first question I guess picks up on the BI conversation a little bit. So, internationally, does this policy language typically follow the standard language within the U.S.? I guess, you did mention that you could see some business interruption losses from COVID. But, should we think conceptually that the same excludes -- virus exclusions would imply internationally as well as you attributed to within the U.S.? Even Greenberg : Yes. Elyse, two comments. First, internationally, it follows the same pattern generally, which is, it requires direct physical loss to property as a trigger for BI. Number one. And then, number two, the exceptions to that for Chubb are where we purposely extended cover for different clients and different industries and purposely took on the exposure. And in those cases, it\u2019s clearly defined. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. And then, my second question, you guys suspended your buybacks indefinitely. And the language in the prepared remarks as well as your press release kind of attributed to seem like economic uncertainty as well as just having capital flexibility. We\u2019ve obviously seen suppressed prices throughout the insurance space coming off of this COVID uncertainty. So, can you just kind of provide us little updates in terms of suspending the buybacks and how you think about just having more capital as well as the potential for some M&A here, given that valuations are much more attractive right now? Even Greenberg : Elyse, when you look at the historic -- and let\u2019s just look at this from a big picture perspective. We are in the worst economic event that we have faced as a nation and globally since The Great Depression. The economy is shut down. The opening of the economy is going to take time and it\u2019s not going to happen in a smooth way, and no one knows for sure the shape or size or duration, no one knows with any certainty. And frankly, to be buying back stock at that time, to me is so clearly unwise. And the fiduciary responsibility is to our customers, our shareholders, our employees. And I think capital, strength of balance sheet, capital and liquidity are king in this environment. And those are attributes and strengths you can have enough of and very fundamental, very basic. And when there is visibility and there is certainty and we all have a better sense, then we will reassess. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our next question from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for the call. So, first question, I was wondering if you could talk about how you might see a really fundamental change in the perception of risk. I think, it\u2019s hard and soft, it\u2019s happening because of underwriting, seeing risk change\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I can\u2019t really hear what you\u2019re saying. Can you speak up, Paul and say clearly? Because we\u2019re on a funny line right now. Yes. Paul Newsome : My apologies. Hopefully that\u2019s better. I was hoping you could talk about where you see the perception of risk changing in the insurance industry, given the current environment. Where do we see underwriters likely changing how they do underwriting and rethinking risk concentrations and such? Evan Greenberg : Yes. First of all, we\u2019re asking a question right now that is asking about what do you think of the results of the wildfire when we\u2019re in the middle of the fire. This event is unfolding. And I would urge you to think that way. It\u2019s not like it has occurred and now we\u2019re looking back. We\u2019re in the middle of it. And so, some of the implications, it\u2019s too early to tell, don\u2019t know. But, the one thing I will say, perception of risk, as always occurs when a new parallel rears its head from the more academic to the actual, it has a powerful impact, and impacts perception of risk. And in this case, the last time we had that was really terrorism. And now, in this case, we will go through in a similar exercise in some ways, underwriters will. It will vary by company, whether they actually had considered pandemic in their ERM modeling, which we do, or had not and really examine concentrations and how it impacts both sides of the balance sheet. And then, by the way how, we modeled and what the actual looks like, are always different. There is always basis risk. And reality is, it is always different than the laboratory. And this is no different. But, this is a peril that the industry really didn\u2019t discreetly charge for. It\u2019s a peril that has no bounds in terms of geography nor time. So, it\u2019s a very different kind of cat, and that has in a practical sense, infinite tail. So, it will impact. By the way, no doubt in my mind, better underwriters had better control over the exposures. And underwriters who were maybe not as good will have many surprises that will emerge. And time will tell and we\u2019ll see that as this event unfolds. I hope that helps. Paul Newsome : That\u2019s great. My second question, we\u2019ve been focused very much on the business interruption issues, the political risks in the U.S. Could you speak to how that may differ outside the U.S.? I think just some of the basics. I think, sometimes you just don\u2019t know how extensively it was included overseas and how the political situation may differ? Evan Greenberg : Overseas, we\u2019re not in any one country. Chubb is not a large middle market or small commercial writer. It\u2019s a business we\u2019re growing. And in most every jurisdiction, no different than the United States, small commercial and middle market customers have standard industry forms providing coverage in their country. They require direct physical loss. Most countries that I know of adhered that where there\u2019s significant concentration of exposure to the industry, adhere to the rule of law and their forms are pretty darn clear. Large commercial customers, business interruption insurance is typically on a more manuscript basis. And so, each customer\u2019s forms speak to a large degree for themselves. And in each jurisdiction, they\u2019ll be adjudicated based on the wordings as they were drafted. Paul Newsome : Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : And frankly, Paul, to-date, I feel more stability outside the United States on the regulatory and legal front than I do in the United States. The irony. Paul Newsome : Absolutely. Operator : And our next question will come from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Go ahead. Mike Zaremski : First question, do you feel the COVID losses will impact your reinsurance covering, you\u2019ll get some help from your reinsurance partners? Evan Greenberg : That\u2019s specific to each reinsurance cover or it\u2019s very fact-specific we\u2019ll say. Mike Zaremski : Okay. My next question, if I look at the North America commercial segments,, and I heard your commentary about exposure on pricing being a 10% I think plus. And I\u2019m looking at gross written premiums and the segment growing up a lesser, 6%. Is exposure shrinking in the North America commercial segment, trying to understand the dynamics there? Evan Greenberg : North America commercial grew like 9%. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Evan Greenberg : So, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re saying\u2026 Mike Zaremski : So, still less than\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Mid and small group, you can see double-digit; large account grew a little slower. And last year, we wrote a one-off transaction related to or two one-off transactions related to wildfire last year that didn\u2019t repeat this year. Mike Zaremski : Okay, got it. So, maybe some noise in there. Evan Greenberg : But underlying that is -- it\u2019s like really strong growth. Mike Zaremski : Okay. I\u2019ll just speak one quick one. And given you announced the no layoff policy for your valued employees and there will be top line pressure, should we expect a material spike in the expense ratio in 2Q? Evan Greenberg : No. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : That\u2019s as far as I\u2019ll go on forward guidance because I don\u2019t give forward guidance, but no. Operator : And we will take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : So, on the call and in your press release, you reported $13 million of catastrophe losses related to COVID-19. Then, you made the statement saying this will be tracked as a separate ongoing catastrophic event. So, it is clear that there\u2019s going to be losses and revenue. And I\u2019m -- revenue hit and losses related to this. Is the tracking that you\u2019re going to provide going to give us color on both? And then, maybe you can dovetail that into the accounting geography of your announced premium reduction programs in the interim U.S. small business to personal lines, et cetera. Evan Greenberg : Yes. I\u2019m not going to give you much satisfaction on that question. But the -- nice try. The loss part will be tracked -- you're doing your job. The loss part will be tracked as part of cat. And that\u2019s what we report as cat. The revenue reduction from exposures, et cetera, those will just come out in our published numbers. And we\u2019ll give you as much color as we can around it as we understand it or know it. We don\u2019t see it yet. But, we know it\u2019s coming. You can\u2019t have an -- I mean, it\u2019s common sense. You can\u2019t have an economy shutdown and exposures aren\u2019t shrinking and premium is a function of rate to exposure. So, just pretty basic there. And that\u2019ll just be on a published basis. But what we call as cat and assign to cat number is to corral the losses and distinguish them from this for the cat event from what we would think is the underlying sort of run rate at the time. Greg Peters : Got it. I had to try\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I gave you a framework. And I think that that\u2019ll help you. Greg Peters : I understand and I do appreciate it. So, I guess, my second question, the investment market has been clearly thrown into chaos. And so, I was curious, if you could comment, one -- and I know you guys did provide some color on the opening comments, but just some additional color around how your approach to investing is going to change? And then, maybe also dovetail in on the life insurance business, because a lot of that business is spread-based business. And with interest rates at near zero, I got to imagine that the outlook for those types of business is under a great deal of duress. Evan Greenberg : Remember, I\u2019ll just answer the life insurance part quickly for you. Our life business is not in the United States, it\u2019s in Asia. It\u2019s savings and protection related and very strongly protection related. And the interest rate environment is quite different. It\u2019s -- and the minimum guarantees you provide are extremely low. And you can see we publish it to you, our earnings on the international life business are pretty good, grew nicely. On the investment portfolio, I\u2019m going to ask Tim Boroughs, our Chief Investment Officer to give you a little more color. But fundamentally, the changes we are making in investment activity are tactical and not strategic and the fundamentals remain in place. Tim, you\u2019re on? Tim Boroughs : Yes, thanks. Maybe put a little context around this. As you watch the Fed, their response to the markets has been, I think very impressive. It\u2019s been large and historic and it included the purchase of corporate bonds, both in the investment and the high yield sectors. So, I guess, one way, you might think about our portfolio is that the Fed is buying or supporting the financing over 80% of what we own. So, I think in that regard, we are in good shape. As Phil mentioned in his commentary, we have made a few tactical adjustments to our portfolio. I think this is advantage of the dislocations that occurred in March with liquidity, and that included corporate bonds and equities. And as Evan mentioned, overall, I think that there\u2019s -- there remains too much uncertainty on how the virus will progress and how quickly the economy recover to make any significant moves off our current allocation. Operator : And next, we will here from Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : We\u2019re hearing a lot of I think very legitimate opposition to changing definition of business interruption exposure. And it seems like a lot less concern over expanding presumptions of kind of feasibility within workers\u2019 compensation. Is that a fair read? And should we expect that difference in attitude to persist? Evan Greenberg : Say that again Meyer, the second part. Will you repeat the question for me? Meyer Shields : Okay. There is a lot of I think completely appropriate opposition to retroactively changing the exposure on business interruption policies. But, I\u2019m not hearing that much pushback from insurance companies about the fact that workers\u2019 compensation, presumptions are changing a lot of states. And I understanding the sort of emotional component of that, but from an economic standpoint, how are you thinking about that change in exposure? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Meyer, a very right line decision that should not confuse anyone, business interruption insurance, not the regulatory, the political activity around it where there are those who are suggesting to retroactively change contract and add coverage that was never contemplated, nor charged for, is very different than the workers\u2019 comp where I think you\u2019re referring to healthcare workers and first responders where there is the notion of presumption that you got the virus on the job. That is not a change of contract. That is something perfectly within the purview, depending on the state of the regulators and the legislatures. And so, that\u2019s within legal bounds to do that and so, very, very different. And I wouldn\u2019t confuse the two. And by the way, it varies by jurisdiction. Some jurisdictions right now have all along said that that a medical worker, for instance who contracts an illness, it is presumed to have occurred on the job, whereas in other -- and for any other profession, it\u2019s construed to be a general illness. You could have gotten anywhere. And so, it\u2019s not job-related. So, workers\u2019 comp is very different in that regard. Meyer Shields : Okay. Thank you. That really helps illustrate the difference. Operator : And next, we\u2019ll hear from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thanks. Evan, so, just curious, understand the implications for exposures here going forward. Do you think any impact on pricing going forward, be it -- will companies lax up a little bit on pricing, given the economic strain or is it going to go the other way given potential increase in exposure? Evan Greenberg : I think that the industry has woken up to rate to exposure in the last year in particular, last year and a half and understands generally the need to get paid for properly for the exposures take on. I don\u2019t see that trend changing. And I think this event is very likely -- more than very likely, I think this event will be the largest event in insurance history when you add it all up, both asset side and liability side of the balance sheet. And I think that just raises the specter of risk and the notion of managing exposure. And I think, it will just put a point on getting the right rate to exposure. I think that absolutely continues. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. And then, second question, just on the business interruption. Is it possible to give us a percentage or number of your policies that actually carry a virus endorsement and maybe some perspective on what a typical kind of sublimit on that is? I know it\u2019s typically pretty heavily sublimited. Evan Greenberg : No. Brian, I\u2019m not going into that level of detail. But, what\u2019s very clear, the vast, vast majority of our policies require direct physical loss. And then, the sublimits vary by whether it\u2019s in a major account or it\u2019s in middle market or it\u2019s a small commercial client. It really varies. And on both -- what we offered and what they bought, because we offer different options. Operator : And next, we will here from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Evan, just hoping to get your outlook on D&O and other management liability lines amid COVID, and likely lawsuits alleging, misleading disclosures and other things related to the COVID. I mean, how big of an issue do you think this is for the industry and then for Chubb in particular? Evan Greenberg : Who knows? So, I\u2019m not going to overly speculate about that? And that\u2019s just -- but out of every event, and every event creates trial bar, ambulance chasing, drive-by shooting where they get most of the money and the supposed aggrieved get very little. I have no doubt that there will be COVID-related D&O suits related to price drop and disclosure, et cetera. And frankly, it is frivolous. It is an unnecessary tax on business and society at this point. It is a waste of time in terms of both resource and time and money and Congress ought to grant immunity to business in some form against that kind of activity that is so counterproductive, enriches one industry at the expense of an economy that is trying to emerge. All stocks dropped broadly. The COVID-19 was no one\u2019s fault. And foreseeability of it, no one is -- no one has that kind of vision. And so, there\u2019s still the notion of buyer beware for basic thing. And in my mind, that\u2019s something that we ought to deal with. And I\u2019m glad you asked that question. David Motemaden : And then, just also, you guys are obviously I think top five in the workers\u2019 comp market. Just wondering, if you could give us a sense for the percentage of your book that is healthcare and other frontline responders, what sort of exposure you have there? Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s -- I won\u2019t give you specifics. And only to say though, healthcare is not a meaningful part of our book of business. Operator : The next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Just couple of questions. Heard a lot about cyber risk being greater in this environment with a lot of workers working from home\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I can\u2019t hear you. Can you speak more clearly? I\u2019m sorry. Yaron Kinar : Can you hear me better now? Evan Greenberg : Yes, now I can. Yaron Kinar : So, my first question is around cyber. I know you guys have a large cyber practice. There has been speculation or talk about an increased cyber risk considering that a lot of employees working from home. Do you see that as a large issue? And if so, how can the industry address that? Evan Greenberg : No, to-date, we\u2019re not seeing a meaningful change in patterns. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then, the second question is a more philosophical question. But, I think you\u2019ve seen several insurers as renewals come up, maybe articulate some of the exclusions around pandemic and around COVID-19 specifically and policies. Do you think that that actually could create an opening for the plaintiff\u2019s bar to go after a prior language that was maybe less explicit in the exclusions? Evan Greenberg : I can\u2019t speak to what people\u2019s manuscript forms look like and therefore whether they\u2019re correcting weaknesses with that. I can\u2019t speak to that. But generally, no, I think COVID-19 or pandemic-related exclusions are just belt and suspenders on policies -- on the basic policies that require direct physical loss. Yaron Kinar : Okay. If I could sneak one other quick one and I think in response to Brian\u2019s question, if we look at the vast majority of your business interruption policies have physical damage trigger requirements. Can you say anything about what -- how many of your policies have viral exclusions? Evan Greenberg : No. It really -- no, it\u2019s -- I\u2019ll leave it at that. No. There is -- it\u2019s -- where it\u2019s appropriate, it does. Operator : And we will take our next question from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : I guess, I\u2019ll try one more time on this business interruption. But I mean I guess one question I have is, should we -- is the real question in terms of the business interruption exposure, how many or is it how long business lockdown happen? What\u2019s kind of more relevant in terms of sizing that loss? Evan Greenberg : Say that again? Ryan Tunis : Is the question more about the number of policies? Is that sort of what the questioning has been so far that what percentage might actively cover the virus? My question is, how dependent would that loss ultimately be on how long the lockdown is in place, or in other words, how are the caps and limits on that? Evan Greenberg : There are caps and limits in all policies. And duration of shutdown, it\u2019s just axiomatic in business interruption that length of shutdown can impact and does impact severity of loss pretty basic in any BI cover. Ryan Tunis : And then, my other question, just taking a step back. I know you mentioned in the journal this morning that you think ultimately the industry will pay out tens of billions of dollars of claims. Is there any reason in your mind that you should think that Chubb\u2019s market share of those claims should be more or less than what its global market share is currently as the global leader in P&C? Evan Greenberg : I think, Chubb from everything I know, we\u2019re pretty good underwriter. We\u2019re pretty buttoned up disciplined shop. We have good controls within the organization. And I have no reason to believe that Chubb would produce something outsized. Look, this is a significant event for the industry and it\u2019s going to be a significant event for Chubb as well. It\u2019s an earnings event, not a balance sheet event, as I said. And I do think it will be the largest loss, single loss in industry history when you add up both sides of the balance sheet when look at the capital impact to the industry. Operator : And our final question will come from Larry Greenberg with Janney. Go ahead. Larry Greenberg : Thank you very much. I just want to be certain that I understand the accounting and the intent of how you\u2019re going to recognize losses in the second quarter. So, should we assume that you will put up a catastrophe loss for what you expect will be your ultimate exposure from COVID, recognizing that so much is changing and there\u2019s a lot of unknowns down the road, but is that your plan? Evan Greenberg : We will let the facts speak to us. We will put up our loss based on the facts as we know them at the time, when we come to close the books on the second quarter. And I\u2019m not going to speculate ahead right now. And we will then provide our perspective and color around that to help define it and give you a sense. But, I\u2019m not going to speculate on where we\u2019ll be by the end of the second quarter, to give you definitive color on the question you asked. Larry Greenberg : Okay. And then\u2026 Evan Greenberg : It\u2019ll depend on what we know. Get used to being in a world with a lot of unknowns and a lot of uncertainty right now. And you\u2019re requesting certainty when there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty. And a lot of that is for worksheet projection related, and I would caution against trying to over speculate on any of them. Larry Greenberg : Yes. I\u2019m really not asking for any level of certainty. Really just is the intent to put a number for what you -- given your level of information at that given point of time for what you can best estimate as your ultimate exposure. Evan Greenberg : Exactly right. We will put up and we always do our best estimate of ultimate loss to an event. We always do that. And no different here, we\u2019re consistent that way. So, you can expect that of us. Larry Greenberg : Thank you. And then, just your -- curious on your thoughts on legislative proposals. That might be productive, probably just prospectively. But, is there any conceivable model where government involvement could be helpful on a retrospective basis? Evan Greenberg : There is a -- I absolutely see a public private partnership prospectively. I don\u2019t see the sense of one on some retrospective. So, there is -- and I\u2019m going to give you both, very quickly. The retrospective one would say, well, why don\u2019t you pay the BI losses and the government will backstop you 100%? Well, right now, the government\u2019s current program to provide loans that then become grants, if you retain your employees, is a very efficient way versus now we create some BI way. And by the way, BI insurance to adjust the claim requires that you prove it\u2019s an ascertain net loss. You have to prove what your expenses were and what -- and your loss of revenue and all of that. And that\u2019s -- and the adjudication of that is messy and takes time, very -- it\u2019s time consuming and it\u2019s one at a time. And what matters right now is cash flow to small businesses. And so, it wouldn\u2019t be an efficient way of dealing with the cash flow needs. The government\u2019s already created a program. So, what problem are we trying to solve? On a prospective basis, I see it differently. Why doesn\u2019t the industry underwrite pandemic, because of the size of the tail, as I say it as it\u2019s an event that has no geographic or time limits. And so, the tail is so great, the industry has a finite balance sheet that can\u2019t take infinite risk. If the government would take the tail risk and take the significant loss on -- in a pandemic event, the industry I believe could take a retention, and could be underwriting pandemic, a little -- very different but a little like, think about TRIA. And I can tell you, I\u2019m in favor of a public private partnership in shouldering the burden in the future. And Chubb has put together its own proposal and we will be sharing that around shortly with the appropriate parties, both inside the industry and outside the industry. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. And I would now like to turn the call back to Karen Beyer for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for joining us this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again. Have a nice day and stay well. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2020, second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including statements relating to company performance and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its economic and other effects, pricing and business mix, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers today. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. COVID-19 is an event of historic proportions, impacting societies and economies globally. This hit businesses and individuals hard and the impact will be with us for some time. Chubb has and is performing well, while naturally shouldering our burden of responsibility, supporting our insured's businesses and consumers. COVID-19 is a slow rolling global catastrophe impacting virtually all countries, unlike other natural catastrophes it has no geographic or time limits and the event continues as we speak. Together the health and consequent economic crisis will likely produce the largest loss in insurance history, particularly considering its worldwide scope and how both sides of the balance sheet are ultimately impacted. We pre-announced a few weeks ago an after tax COVID related loss estimate of $1.2 billion, which essentially cost us a quarter of earnings. This loss is an estimate of our ultimate loss from the pandemic and economic crisis based on everything we know and can project. The estimate does not include for the most part, the credit for potentially lower current accident year losses from a decrease in exposures, except for a very modest amount. Looking beyond this quarter's catastrophe losses and the shadow it casts is an important story to tell about our company. Our underlying health and vitality are excellent. And we are capitalizing on current industry commercial P&C conditions. Our published P&C combined ratio was 112.3% with total after tax cash charge of $1.5 billion, including $353 million of natural catastrophe and civil unrest related losses. Separately, we took an after tax charge of $205 million in unfavorable prior period development for child molestation related claims emerging predominantly from reviver statutes that came into effect last year. If anybody's moving papers stop it. On a current accident year basis, excluding cats, the combined ratio was 87.4%, 0.5% improvement over prior year with current accident year underwriting income of over 18% in constant dollars. The loss ratio was essentially flat with prior year, while the expense ratio was down 1.5 points. We benefited from expense saves due to the shutdown as well as our ongoing efficiency efforts, while we continued to invest in important areas to improve our competitive profile. In the quarter, book value benefited from actions taken by the Fed to support the economy during this exigent time, which positively impacted asset values, but will pressure future investment income. Per share book value grew about 5%, while tangible was up over 7%, both are now essentially flat for the year. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period development. Broadly speaking, two themes impacted the growth in the quarter. On the one hand shrinking exposures from the decline in economic activity weighed negatively on growth. And on the other hand, favorable commercial P&C underwriting conditions contributed to growth. In the quarter, P&C net premiums grew 1.4% in constant dollars. Growth was impacted due to a onetime charge we took to estimate the ultimate impact on premiums that we will incur from exposure adjustments on in-force policies due to a reduction in economic activity. Excluding the charge which is a better way of viewing our underlying quarterly growth, we grew 3.9%. This is made up of 9.1% positive growth globally in commercial P&C and 6.3% negative growth in consumer lines, which includes A&H travel and personal lines. In the quarter, we continued to experience favorable underwriting conditions in commercial P&C, which varied by geography and product lines. The commercial P&C pricing environment is particularly strong in North America, the UK, the continent of Europe and certain locations in Asia Pacific. And it continues to spread further in North America, which includes the U.S., Canada and Bermuda. Commercial P&C net premiums grew 10% adjusting for the one-time premium charge I just mentioned. And on the back of strong new business growth and premium retention, with our major accounts and specialty business growing over 12% and our middle market and small commercial business growing 6.5%. In our international general insurance operations, commercial P&C net premiums grew over 5.5% in the quarter in constant dollars. Chubb Global Markets, our London wholesale business grew over 20%, while our commercial P&C business in continental Europe grew nearly 16%. In those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate through exposure across most core commercial product lines. Overall rates increased the North America commercial P&C by 14%. And major accounts and specialty rates per property were up 21%. Casualty rates were up over 25.5%. And financial lines rates were up over 18.5%. In our middle market business rates per property were up 18%, casualty rates were up over 12%, excluding workers comp. Comp rates were down 1% and financial lines rates were up 14.5% in the middle market. In our international general insurance operations, rates were up 16% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter was severely impacted, given the pandemics effects on consumer related activities. Our North America personal lines business was an exception, as we experienced flight to safety and quality in our high net worth segment. Net premiums written in the quarter were up 2% on an adjusted basis and retention's remained very strong at almost 97%. In our international personal lines business predominantly, auto home and cell phone premium shrink 12.5, while our global A&H premiums, U.S. and international together were down 13.5%. Our Asia-focused international life insurance business however had a good quarter with net written premiums up 30% in constant dollar. In sum to provide you a better perspective, though we typically provide limited guidance we expect Chubb will have on a published basis, positive premium revenue growth for the full year. John Keogh, John Lupica, Paul Krump and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. As a company, we continue to operate around the globe as a normal company during extremely abnormal times. Depending on where you are in the world with exceptions, the substantial portion of our international staff is back in the office on any given day. This includes most of Asia Pacific, where about 50% are back in the office and in some countries 100%. Europe with the exception of Spain and Italy, 25% are back. And while the UK remained closed, we expect about 20% to 25% to return in August. We have been ready to begin our return to the office in the U.S., but took a pause, given the increase in infection rates in many parts of the country. Among developed countries in the world, the U.S. stands out in its inability to manage the health crisis on a national basis. And this is damaging our economic recovery and our image globally. We're conditioned to have stabilized in the U.S. like the Northeast. We've begun to bring employees back to the office for meetings, to collaborate, learn and plan. We are ready to return on a broader basis when conditions warrant. The health and wellbeing of our staff is a paramount concern. Insurance is an essential service. We never stopped or even paused in providing coverage, paying claims for providing risk engineering and other services to our customers and clients. We are very active on a daily basis with our clients and distribution partners globally and we have done so with service levels that are virtually the same as we provide normally. I'm going to say a few words about the business interruption issue that I know is on the minds of many. As you know, the insurance industry is under attack by the trial bar over business interruption claims. They represent many businesses which purchased BI coverage that does not provide cover for pandemic and these customers are understandably disappointed and upset. Pointless attorneys are attempting to torture or reverse engineer insurance contract language to conjure business interruption coverage that for the most part simply doesn't exist. Coverage for pandemic was never contemplated in standard business interruption policies and therefore no premiums were ever charged for that risk. In fact, state insurance regulators who approved the policies have been clear that this risk is not covered. And that the industry could not cover the massive open-ended tail risk of a global pandemic, because it threatens the industry solvency. Without the Federal government playing a major role to cover the tail risk, pandemics are simply under uninsurable on a broad basis. Standard BI policies, which are an addendum to a fire policy required direct physical loss or damage to the property. For example, a fire or flood damages the property and prevents the business from operating while repairs are being made. COVID-19 does not cause physical loss or damage to a property despite the trial bar's efforts to influence some government officials in the wording of their civil public shutdown orders. But it doesn't cover pandemic, standard BI coverage provides good value for the money. We estimate the industry pays out about $0.70 in insurance claims for every business interruption production dollar collected with most of the remaining amount paid in commissions, premium taxes and other expenses. For Chubb, in addition to our normal losses this year, we will pay BI claims for policies that specifically covered certain pandemic related shutdowns, such as those for the entertainment industry. We care deeply about properly supporting and servicing all of our policy holders, and I have particular sympathy for the millions of businesses that have suffered terribly during the pandemic forced economic shutdowns, but it would be wrong in fact catastrophic and irresponsible to pay the claims of those who didn't have coverage. And in fact, didn't pay premiums with the coverage by using funds that have been properly reserved for the legitimate claims of the vast majority of our BMC policy holders, who number over 100 million globally. To provide some context in 2019, Chubb paid $24 billion on approximately 4 million property and casualty claims, again to pay billions of dollars and not the covered claims by rating the reserves or capital needed to pay claims on other kinds of policies, such as auto and home, commercial insurance exposures, respond to natural catastrophes such as hurricanes and wildfires would be irresponsible to the vast majority of our policy holders and to our shareholders. On the business interruption challenges of the current COVID-19 crisis, the insurance industry has an important role to play in society and in the economy. And that includes fully participating in the development of a prospective future pandemic business interruption solution to crises arise. Earlier this month, Chubb released its pandemic business interruption program designed to mitigate the economic disruption and losses in the event of a future pandemic. Our framework is not the first plan to be introduced, but the public-private partnership framework we develop has important differences from the other leading proposals. By sharing our ideas and approach we hope to spark and influence a productive debate on a solution that will work for businesses of all sizes : tax payers, our industry, and the economy more broadly. First and foremost, I believe the industry can and should take pandemic risks along with the government. This is apparel that can be covered to a greater degree than we do today, as long as the tail exposure covered by the government. It is our job to figure out how to do that. We can do more than simply play an administrative role where we belittle ourselves and we're less relevant and we can or should be. The framework we announced has attributes that we believe will make for a successful program. It accounts for the different needs of small, medium and to a modest degree large businesses. Premium for small business will be affordable and they will be paid quickly. Large companies would pay a fair and risk adjusted price to both the government insurers, for pandemic cover and a program built on free market principles. The government gets paid for the use of its balance sheet, not a handout to larger companies. Our framework has incentives for broad participation by the industry and by committing insurance industry capital and providing opportunity for increased risk sharing over time as direct and secondary markets develop the pandemic burdens shouldered by the government will ultimately be lessened to a degree. This is an important issue for our nation. We look forward to contributing to the dialogue as policymaker\u2019s work to refine the most effective solution. Before I turn the things over to Phil, I want to say a few words about an issue that concerns all of us, and that's the persistent challenges arising from bigotry, racism and racial injustice in society, particularly for black people. The events that unfolded across our nation these past few months has focused our attention on what we should do as citizens and as a company. We characterize Chubb\u2019s culture is an inclusive meritocracy. We earnestly strive to achieve an environment where all colleagues feel comfortable to perform to their full potential and are recognized for their contributions. It's a never ending work in progress, and we can do more. We developed recently shared with our employees an action plan to which we will hold ourselves accountable. The plan has a few simple objectives. We do want to enhance our individual and collective understanding of racism in society and strive within Chubb to be anti-racist in our behavior as individuals and as an organization. We want to actively support each other. It starts with more frank dialogue between our employees of color, particularly black colleagues and our white college to create better understanding and awareness about the realities of racism. We will hold leaders more accountable for curating and leading an environment of inclusion and we'll eliminate policies and practices that potentially create bias and inhibit our ability to create greater racial mix of our workforce at all levels of the company. This is an enduring process, not a momentary event in time. We believe we have a responsibility to do our part with candor, open minds and a commitment to change. In closing, our company is very strong. Our balance sheet is in excellent shape, in fact, outstanding shape, and we are operating well around the globe during very difficult times. Our underlying strengths are enduring. We are capitalizing on favorable market conditions as we simultaneously navigate the extreme headwinds and uncertainty created by COVID-19. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil, and then I'm going to come back and take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Our financial position at quarter end is exceptionally strong. COVID-19 is an earnings event for Chubb, while our balance sheet remains in excellent shape. Our balance sheet features a $112 billion, AA rated cash and investment portfolio with a duration of four years and consistently conservative approach to loss reserving and total capital of $70 billion. We are a balance sheet business operating in extremely uncertain times, and we have maintained a conservative level of capital. Our operating cash flow for the quarter was $2 billion, and our liquidity on a global basis continues to be excellent. In the quarter, we returned $353 million to shareholders in dividends. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter of $857 million pretax was below our guidance range, mainly due to foreign exchange, lower rates on our floating rate obligations and an acceleration of prepayments in the mortgage loan portfolio. We remained consistent and conservative in our investment strategy and do not expect to materially adjust the portfolios asset allocation. We intend to maintain a high-quality bias and conservative duration. Fed easing actions have inflated asset values causing a disconnect with underlying credit conditions, so that many classes of debt appear mispriced. We will continue to focus on risk adjusted returns and not reach for yield. Well, there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income. We now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $850 million to $860 million. Turning to book value. Our share book and tangible book value were up 4.9% and 7.2% respectively in the quarter. Our core operating loss and dividend payment were more than offset by net realized and unrealized gains for the quarter of $3.1 billion after tax, including $2.7 billion in our investment portfolio, $410 million from favorable foreign currency movements, and $110 million mark-to-market gain in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. The gain in the investment portfolio is due mainly to the narrowing of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio and the decline in interest rates. At June 30th, our investment portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $3.4 billion after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $1.8 billion pretax or $1.5 billion after tax as previously announced and are further detailed in our financial supplement. Our net loss reserves increased $2.7 billion in constant dollars, including the significant catastrophe losses and adverse prior period development. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 59% reflecting the catastrophe losses. We had unfavorable prior period development in the quarter of $75 million pretax or $52 million after tax. This included a charge for U.S. child molestation claims of $259 million pretax or $205 million after tax as previously announced. The vast majority of these losses were reviver statute-related. Excluding this charge we had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $184 million pretax split approximately 79% in long-tail lines principally from accident years 2016 and prior and 21% in short-tail lines. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter of 15.3% was impacted by the high level of catastrophe losses. Through six months, our core operating effective tax rate was 16.5% slightly higher than our expected 14% to 16% range. We now expect our annual core operating tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. With that, I'll turn the call back over to Karen Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning, everybody. Evan, thanks for all those comments especially on the BI stuff, and appreciate that. I guess, can you talk about the impact that COVID and shelter in place is having on your acquisition expense ratio? And then longer term, maybe you've made some good strides in your expense ratio in general, even prior to COVID. So kind of how we should think about a good run rate going forward from there? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Let's see, the acquisition ratio benefits fundamentally from a mix of business change. You had consumer lines that, that as I said had a negative growth to them and they run a higher acquisition cost than commercial P&C does, and we're growing underneath, as you could see commercial P&C at a rapid clip, and it has a lower acquisition ratio. The OpEx ratio did benefit reasonably well in the quarter from COVID related shutdown, and I expect that we'll continue to receive benefit from that as we go forward in future quarters. And so overall I think the expense ratio will continue to benefit in future quarters. How much and to what degree, I'm not going to prognosticate or give guidance on. Michael Phillips : Okay. No, thanks. That's helpful. I guess, second question on COVID and frequency benefits on commercial lines. Can you talk about what specific lines maybe benefit the most from frequency benefits? And then with some of the reopenings we've seen recently, has there been any change in trends, certainly on the frequency that you've noticed an uptick on because of the reopenings? Evan Greenberg : Commercial lines, fundamentally most classes of business in traditional property and casualty benefit to a degree and it varies by line of business from the COVID shutdown on one. On the other hand, we took a massive charge to recognize the COVID related claims that will arise, but excluding that the frequency when you take those away, the frequency and severity and most traditional lines will benefit because, and are benefiting at least to this point in time because commercial activities are down. And that would be both in the short tail lines, as well as in the long tail lines, but it varies by class. Obviously in professional lines to a lesser degree than say in general casualty or an excess casualty. And as you know, our policy has always been. We recognize bad news early and we're very slow to recognize good news. And so any of the benefit we might be seeing short-term right now for the most part from the reduction in economic activity, in the shelter in place and the lack of social activity around the world. We're very slow to recognize that and will be because we're in very uncertain times and we don't know what the future is going to bring. Secondly, what I would add is that overall through commercial P&C for the most part; we are achieving rates that are in excess of loss cost trends. And again, we're in uncertain times and we're conservative in our approach. Michael Phillips : Thanks, Evan. I appreciate it. Operator : And we will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. My first question, Evan, follows up on your response to the last question. You guys are getting a lot of price, 14% within your North America commercial book picked-up pretty nicely from where you guys were last quarter. Can you just give us a sense of where last trend is within that business, and just as we think \u2013 and I recognize you give us some guidance on the premium side and you don't like to give forward guidance, but as we think about price up in the teens and depending upon where your loss trend is just trying to get a sense of the potential for margin improvement within that North America commercial book? Evan Greenberg : No, I understand. And Elyse, I'm not going to give you much satisfaction in that question. We don't give forward guidance on that as you know, and I'm going to rest on the statement that in most commercial lines areas, we are not all, but most we are achieving rate in excess of the loss cost trend which is reasonable to achieve a proper risk adjusted return in those classes, and it is needed. As far as where the exact frequency and severity of loss is and trend is over the last number of months. It's very difficult to tell because, and we measure it typically quarterly, but at this point we measure it monthly and because of the economic shutdown, you really can't see what the actual is though it's lower. We do though price on anticipation or reversion to the mean as the economy opens back up and activity returns to normal. And I'm \u2013 I think I'm going to leave it at Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That's helpful. Then I had a couple of other numbers question unrelated to North America commercial. The last couple of Q2, you guys had LPTs on the book that had due typically to higher loss ratios. Was there any LPTs on the book this second quarter? Evan Greenberg : There were, and as you know, we write LPTs virtually, most quarters it's just the amount of it varies by quarter. And this quarter we did have LPTs as we do in most quarters. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Evan Greenberg : And it was within a reasonable range of what we wrote last year in the second quarter. Last year was a pretty big quarter for LPT. This year we wrote a number of transactions as well. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, great. And then within North America commercial your retention went up to 84.5, it had been trending in the high-70s. Does \u2013 was there anything specific to the second quarter or just as we think about maybe kind of a change in retention in terms of that book on a go-forward basis? Evan Greenberg : No, it's more of a \u2013 the difference this quarter, I would attribute more to a change of mix of business then \u2013 and what we wrote then, then I would to a major shift in the retention net to gross. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you, Evan. I appreciate the color. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And next we\u2019ll hear from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey guys. Good morning. I guess, following-up on that last one in North America commercial, there's clearly some cross currents there, so the structured transactions, some COVID frequency benefits but there's about 0.7 points of year-over-year, underlying loss ratio improvement. Evan, is that a fair representation of what you think the relationship is right now between rate and loss trend? Maybe around 0.7 points in North America commercial? Or is it higher than that you think moving forward? Evan Greenberg : As I said, Ryan, I'm not going to prognosticate future. We just don't provide guidance that way. I made a couple of comments that I think they're probably important to you. Number one, that we are achieving rate next in aggregate and excess of loss cost trend. Secondly, we are \u2013 we haven't noticed a major change in trends, but on the other hand you're masked by all of the COVID related impact. Number three, we have COVID-related benefit from the economic shutdown. Given the period of great uncertainty we're in, we are very slow and fundamentally haven't recognized good news while we took what we think is a reserve to ultimate for COVID-related losses. And so in this period of time, I think you're \u2013 and it is our policy. We were conservative in our balance sheet management. And in periods of great uncertainty puts a point on what is our normal policy directly and if there's favorable news, to recognize it in a prudent way late. Ryan Tunis : Understood. And I guess my follow-up is, can you just talk a little bit about the COVID charge that you took? It's obviously conservative. If you ever have to add to it, what do you think the reason would be? Would it be another outbreak later in the year? Like give us a sense of why \u2013 the degree of conservatism around that loss selection? Evan Greenberg : Its, we didn\u2019t know it in a in a conservative way. We pitched it right up the middle. We've modeled what we think and we took from what we know of \u2013 at others, economists will project from various organizations. We projected what we think the economic patterns are going to look like. We projected what we think the \u2013 from the best we know at the time what the health situation is and will be and how the two work together. And therefore, based on all the information we know today, we modeled both top-down and bottom-up, particularly short-tail losses, longer tail. You have to model more top-down and based on what we know of prior events and history and how things work. And so we used all that based on our \u2013 on the picture of economic and health as we can see it going forward from this pandemic event to project a loss to ultimate. Did we get it precisely right? God knows. And is there risk around it? Of course, there is because you tell me, what's the next six or nine months precisely going to look like? No one knows. There's great uncertainty. But we did our best within uncertain times to try to reflect the ultimate loss on our balance sheet, our liabilities. Hello? Operator : And next we will hear from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Paul Newsome : Good morning and hope you're all well. I was wondering if you can talk about how the business interruption claim issue has evolved, not necessarily just in the U.S. but outside the U.S. It looks like to me at least that the courts are trending in the industry's favor so far in the U.S., but I don't have a great sense of how that's happening outside the U.S. and how that might differ from the U.S.? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Paul, it's very early days. The U.K., for example, as you know, and you're following, I'm sure, is in a process that is very interesting where the regulator has stepped in. And to avoid, like we have in the U.S., just a free for all of lawsuits and a waste of expense and time and money, they've kind of stepped in and interacting to represent the policyholders, all of their arguments in one place before a panel of judges with the industry presenting its arguments. And that one's going to unfold, and it's a very rational process. And by the way, if you haven't followed it, I would tell you, it really is worth doing. It's admirable how they're going about it. And that will unfold over a period of time and come to a conclusion from what I \u2013 if I recollect properly, by around year-end. In other countries such as Australia, et cetera, it's bubbling. And you have a number of court cases that are just proceeding to test the veracity of the wordings that are \u2013 and better against regulation that is quite different than in the United States and then where the most activity is. And that will be on the longest, most prolonged period of time to resolve is in the United States. Paul Newsome : And then my second question, we've seen a lot of rate increases in the reinsurance business. Has the... Evan Greenberg : Sorry. Can you repeat that? Paul Newsome : I said, we've seen a lot of rate increases in the reinsurance business. I was wondering if the changing market environment had changed your view on the fairly narrow approach you take in the reinsurance business overall. Evan Greenberg : Yes. In the main, we're pretty steady about it. We buy reinsurance fundamentally to be able to provide limits of liability beyond what we're \u2013 what we want to expose our balance sheet to. We buy it for protection of volatility where it makes sense. We measure all reinsurance. So we do it for fundamental business purposes. And we buy reinsurance in a manner where we measure the risk/reward and the proper risk-adjusted pricing. That's what we're willing to pay for protection. And so those fundamental principles lead to a pretty steady approach. At the same time, obviously, when rates are not adequate to earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return, we shrink exposure as a company. When rates are adequate for \u2013 to earn a proper risk-adjusted return and may increase to a point where they justify greater volatility, we will increase our net exposures. And we do that alongside how we purchase reinsurance. Paul Newsome : I am sorry. I was thinking more about the actual reinsurance business that you have and whether you might be interested in. Evan Greenberg : Oh, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Yes, I got it. Yes, we are more active and \u2013 in our reinsurance business. It is a greater growth area for Chubb now. We have like our E&S business, particularly in London, where we have been disciplined and shrunk for a number of years because we weren't getting paid to take risk. We are getting paid more adequately to take risk in a number of classes, and that is growing by the quarter. And therefore, we're leaning into that. And our reinsurance business, from what we can tell today, will continue to expand as we go forward. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And next, we will hear from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Greg Peters : Hi, good morning. Just FYI, Evan, there is a little bit of feedback that we're hearing throughout the call. So I'm not sure what's going on there, but it's \u2013 we're hearing it. Evan Greenberg : Yes, I'm hearing it, too. And I hate it. Greg Peters : Yes. We do, too. So it's mutual. Evan Greenberg : Can you still hear the answers? Can you still hear well enough, though, to get the information? Greg Peters : Yes, yes, yes. It's coming through. It's just there's a little feedback somewhere in the system. So in your prepared remarks, you offered to have some of the other executives provide some commentary around conditions, pricing, et cetera, in the respective segments of the business. And I was wondering if you could follow through with that offer. Evan Greenberg : Love to. Thank you for asking. I'm going to start with John Lupica on major and specialty, and then I'm going to have Paul Krump do middle. John Lupica : Sure. Thank you, Evan, and thank you, Greg. Let me give you a little more color on what we're seeing in major and specialty. I'll start really with rate and premium retention. And on our major portfolio, we're looking at over 16 points of pure rate increase. In Westchester, our E&S business, we're looking at 18 points of rate increase. And in Bermuda, our high excess business, as you know, we're looking at 48 points of rate increase. And when I break that down into just some segments on the retail side, our primary casualty risk management business is getting some of its best rate in the history of that organization at 8 points of rate and the adjusted premium retention ratio of 97.5% and I take into account one large front to trade. In our excess casualty book, we are getting 48 points of rate and achieving 111 points of premium retention. And as Evan noted, in our property business, we're getting 21 points of rate with 109 points of pure premium retention. And in our financial lines, again, another note in the retail business that Evan had noted, 18 points of rate and 103 points of premium retention. And we're seeing the same in our E&S lines of business. Our property business is getting 18 points of rate with 103 points of premium retention. Casualty book is getting 31 points of rate with 87 points of premium retention. And our financial lines is getting 17 points of rate. So as you can see, pretty healthy rate environment and premium retention inside of the retail and E&S marketplace. Evan Greenberg : Paul Krump? Paul Krump : Hi, Greg. Good morning. I\u2019ll start out with amount of prop. Evan had mentioned getting over 18 points of rate there. Our retention in that line of business is 95%, so just excellent. As respect to package, we're getting 6 points of rate and 97% retention. In our excess umbrella, we're getting over 20 points of pure rate increase and 94% retention. Auto has got 11 points of rate on it in the last quarter, 99% retention in our professional lines, as Evan mentioned, is at 14.5% and there, we're getting 98 points of retention. As respect to terms and conditions, briefly I tell you that obviously, a lot of these rate increases were tightening terms and conditions, I'd say in particular, we're pleased with where deductibles are going and how much they've increased. We've also been able to trim down some of the sub-limits for the cat perils of flood and quake as well on excess umbrella, we've been working on attachment points and that's been going extremely well also. Evan Greenberg : Here you go, Greg, more than you ever asked for. Greg Peters : Well, it's never enough. So if you take the \u2013 all of those businesses that were just summarized with rather robust rates, what percentage of the total premium are we talking about, just to put this in perspective because not all of your business is getting these type of rate increases. Evan Greenberg : When I add in the international areas that are achieving the \u2013 that are in a similar hard market condition, it's over 50% of our premiums globally. I mean all the business, not just commercial P&C inside of our total business. Greg Peters : Okay. Thank you. And then obviously, it begs the question when we're hearing about the substantial rate increases. What's the commercial customer response to this because this is far exceeding inflation trends with the rest of their business and a lot of your commercial customers are experiencing pressures because of COVID and the economic slowdown or whatever you want to call it? I have to believe you're getting a lot of customer pushback, or maybe you could give us some perspective around that. Evan Greenberg : We're not. We're actually \u2013 there is a lot of goodwill between us and customers. Look, why is this occurring? Because loss cost trends, even when they're benign, have far exceeded premium rates charged for a prolonged period of time. Rates have gone in one direction, while loss costs have continued to rise. And so industry results overall are severely elevated and many lines of business just were so inadequate in pricing, and it varied by company. If you were trying to gain market share at that time, well, you're \u2013 it's coming home to roost. And it will continue to come home to roost for a period of time. If you are more disciplined and shrunk exposure at that time, then it had less impact on you. But rates are now moving in a direction where over time, they'll achieve adequacy, and there are lines where adequacy is achieved. And there are lines where, given loss cost trends and then you have on top of that, things like social inflation that have exacerbated trends means that rates need to continue to move higher. Well, the other dynamic about all of that is that companies are pulling back and capacity is less available. Chubb is stepping up. We're offering capacity. We're consistent to our customers. We're there. We're not in and out. We've been consistently speaking to our customers that, \"You know what, this is not going to last. The good times of rates going down or premiums going down is irrational and it's not going to last, and that we will remain consistent. It's the market that will wane and wax.\" Well, they understand and see that. And by the way, as we can get more adequately paid and as capacity is shrunk, we've actually stepped up with bigger lines and bigger solutions and more creative solutions to customers. And so we're consistent in that service in \u2013 during the shutdown period. There is no company that has been more available to dialogue and to be on the front line with customers and respond on a moment's notice globally than has Chubb. So I would actually say our reputation and our image and all of this in the goodwill with customers has been building. And yes, I understand the notion that insurance pricing is going up when all of this is going on with COVID. But that trend, which is very rational, was occurring before COVID ever began. And to deploy the capital, you've got to get paid adequately. And capital, risk capital is precious. Greg Peters : Thank you for the answers. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And we will take our final question from David Motemaden with Evercore. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Thanks. Good morning. Just a quick numbers question on the current action in your loss ratio ex-cat in North America commercial. Just in the past, you've talked about the impact that some of these large structured transactions have had on the loss ratio. I think in 2018, 2019, in those second quarters, it was around 100 basis points of an elevation in the loss ratio. Just wondering how I should think about that impact this quarter within North America commercial? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It had an impact on it. I can't give you an exact basis point number. It's one of those so we could probably take off-line with you. But it had on \u2013 it hadn't \u2013 we wrote LPTs fairly consistent in the neighborhood of what we wrote in aggregate last year. So we \u2013 and they have an elevated impact on it. That's all. Phil Bancroft : Year-on-year, Evan, the impact was 70 basis points. Evan Greenberg : Thank you, Phil. David Motemaden : Great. Thanks Evan and Phil, that\u2019s helpful. And then just a question. So the recent GOP stimulus, that includes some liability shields for businesses and health care providers. Just wondering how you're thinking about this. How important this is for you and the industry? And outside of this going through, just wondering what sort of underwriting actions you're taking to mitigate the future liability claims that you may be getting. Evan Greenberg : I think that this kind of liability safe harbor that the Republicans are proposing as part of the bill is so important to our nation. We have \u2013 we right now confront such economic headwinds between \u2013 toggling between \u2013 trying to manage the health crisis and open up an economy. And the burden on business, all businesses throughout the United States today is extreme. To add on to them, the additional expense and burden of liability exposure when for those who are practicing the right protocols in protecting their employees and customers and then trying to open up the economy, to ascribe to them the burden of liability and cause them to be more cautious. We foist on them an additional economic expense and which ultimately benefits, frankly, one industry, and that is the legal profession, the trial bar, I think would be a travesty and a shame. And I think that is the wisdom to try to remove some of that and create certainty for business in an environment of tremendous uncertainty. And not only do we applaud it, we support it actively as a company and not for the benefit of the insurance industry, to the benefit of all of our society right now. We need to open up this economy. We need to control this health crisis better than we are and, my God, not believe that living at home and working from home is the normal \u2013 the new normal for America. That don't make any sense to me. With that, thank you very much. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks, and have a good day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

We will conduct a question-and-answer session after the prepared remarks. [Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome to our September 30, 2020 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to the company's performance, pricing and business mix and economic market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us today to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. The quarter was marked by continued insurance market hardening, an economy struggling to reopen globally and a very active period for catastrophes with current industry estimates ranging between $35 billion and $40 billion in insured natural and manmade cat globally. As an industry leader, we of course have our share of exposure in losses. We published a P&C combined ratio of 95%, which was impacted by $925 million of net cat losses, a good performance, all considered, supported by both significant underlying - underwriting margin improvement and very strong commercial P&C revenue growth globally as we capitalized on favorable underwriting conditions. To begin, in terms of cats, we tracked over 40 separate events globally in the quarter, a very high frequency. For the North Atlantic hurricane season, we're now into the Greek alphabet. Aside from hurricanes, we had the derecho in the Midwest, wildfires along the West Coast and a number of international weather events. The increasing trend in both frequency and severity of events, from a variety of natural perils, wind, flood and fire-related informs our views of current and future expected cat loss levels, as well as our view of required rate to ensure the exposure in both commercial and consumer property-related lines. Where we can get paid adequately for the volatility and uncertainty, we will maintain and even grow our exposures. Where we cannot, we shrink. And in either case, shape our portfolio according to our risk appetite. California wildfire is a good example of both shrinking and shaping the portfolio. We shrunk our overall insured home count 16% over the past few years and improved the shape of the portfolio by reducing the home count 21% in fire exposed areas. Overall for cat risk, there is more to come, as we continue to improve the tools we use, both science and technology to better assess the risk and concentration of exposure in the areas of flood, wildfire and wind. Our global P&C, which excludes agriculture ex-cat current accident year combined ratio was 85%, an improvement of 3.3 points over prior year with underwriting income up 36% in constant dollars, as a result of both margin improvement and earned premium growth of 10% in commercial lines. Over 2 points of the margin improvement were loss ratio related. The balance was expense ratio related. Of the loss ratio component, about a point was margin improvement because earned rate exceeded loss cost trend. The balance was a modest recognition of the favorable impact from the health-related shutdown and economic conditions, principally a reduction in loss frequency in US and Latin American Automobile lines. Of the 1.2 point expense ratio improvement, the acquisition-related portion is due to mix of business, i.e. less consumer, more commercial. And of the operating portion one half is efficiency related and the balance due to current operating conditions. As for crop insurance, much has been written about the impact of the derecho on crops. Despite the derecho, from all we can see, we are on track for an average crop insurance year. Finally, given the relatively improved visibility and stability in both the risk and business environment, as compared to the first three quarters of the year, and given our very strong capital position, we are lifting the moratorium on our share repurchase activities. Phil will have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period development. Turning to growth and the rate environment, P&C premium revenue in the quarter grew about 6.5% globally in constant dollars, made up of 10.8% growth in commercial P&C and 3.3% decline in consumer lines, which included negative growth in global A&H and international personal lines, and positive growth in North America personal lines. In the quarter, we continued to experience a strong and continuously improving commercial P&C pricing environment, particularly in North America, the UK, the Continent of Europe and certain locations in Asia Pacific. And it continues to spread further. In North America, commercial P&C net premiums grew over 11% which is very strong, and by the way includes a reduction in growth of 5 points, due to reduced exposures from the decline in economic activity, including employment. New business was up 15% and renewal retention remained strong at 93.6% on a premium basis. In our North America Major Accounts & Specialty business, net premiums written grew over 12%, while our middle market and small commercial business grew about 5.5%. In our international general insurance operations, commercial P&C net premiums grew 13% in the quarter in constant dollars. Our international retail commercial grew 11% and our London wholesale business grew nearly 22%. New business was up over 6.5% overall internationally. Retail commercial P&C growth by region, with net premiums written, up 26% in Continental Europe; 11.5% in Asia-Pacific; and about 9% in UK and Ireland. Globally in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio, and I'll return to that. Overall rates increased in North America commercial P&C by over 15%. Major accounts risk management casualty rates were up 6.5%, general casualty was up 31%. Property rates were up 22% and financial lines rates were up 23%. In our E&S wholesale business, property rates were up 21%, casualty was up almost 32% and financial lines up about 25.5%. And in our middle market US business, rates for property were up 16%, casualty rates were up over 11% excluding comp, which was down 1.2% and financial lines rates were up over 17%. And in international general insurance operations rates were up 15% in international retail and 32% in London wholesale. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter remains heavily impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities, and our international personal lines business, predominantly auto, home and cellphone premiums shrank 1.7%, while our global A&H premiums, that's US and international together, were down about 12.5%. We expect both to return to growth sometime during '21. Our North America personal lines business grew about 3%, as we continue to experience flight to safety and quality in our high net-worth segment. New business in that line was up over 11% and retention remained very strong at 95%. Our Global Re business grew premiums 27% in constant dollar. The underwriting environment is improving in reinsurance and Global Re has become more of a growth area. Lastly, our Asia focused international life business had a decent quarter with net premiums written up about 9.5% in constant dollars. In sum, we are in a hard market or firming market for commercial P&C, depending on where you are in the world, what cohort of business, and it is spreading. Where we are growing, we are achieving rates that exceed loss costs, and therefore we are achieving margin improvement. More lines of business on a policy year basis are coming closer to achieving combined ratio levels that will produce adequate risk-adjusted returns. However, in most areas rates need to continue moving higher. I believe they will, based on everything we see, given the risk environment, interest rate levels and for how long business was inadequately priced by many companies. The current market is a reasonable response and the trend in my judgment is enduring. John Keogh, John Lupica, and Juan Luis Ortega can provide further color on the quarter, including current market conditions and pricing trends. Closing, our company is in excellent shape. We have the people, the capabilities, the culture and the command and control structure to execute and continue capitalizing on this improved underwriting environment. Our fundamentals and balance sheet are strong, and we know our minds. Again where we can get paid adequately to assume the risk and volatility, we're leaning into it and growing exposure and rate. As we look forward, we expect to grow our EPS through both revenue growth and improved margins. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then we'll come back and we'll take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong. Total capital grew to $73 billion and our AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets grew over $5 billion this quarter to $118 billion. Our strong underwriting results and investment performance produced a $3.5 billion of positive cash flow in the quarter. Among the capital-related actions we returned $353 million to shareholders in dividends and in September, we issued $1 billion of 10 year debt at an interest rate of 1.375%. The proceeds will be used to prefund $1 billion of debt due in November '22 with an interest rate of 2.875%. Adjusted net investment income from the quarter of $900 million pretax was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. In addition there was a $32 million of investment income previously included in other income from our private equity partnership funds where we own greater than 3% that we are now classifying as adjusted net investment income. We believe reclassifying this income as investment income is more appropriate. We adjusted the prior period results to align with this new presentation in the financial supplement. While there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, we now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million. This considers the reclassification of private equity income described above. In light of the reclassification, we now estimate other income and expense to range between $0 and a $5 million expense going forward. As a separate matter we continue to record the change in the fair value mark on our private equity funds, outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses, instead of, as investment income, as other companies do. In this quarter, the mark-to-market gain related to private equities was $428 million after tax. Book and tangible book value per share were up 3% and 4.7% respectively in the quarter, favorably impacted by net realized and unrealized gains of $1.1 billion after tax, principally in our fixed income investment portfolio from lower interest rates and mark-to-market gains on private equities. At September 30, our investment portfolio was in a net unrealized gain position of $4 billion after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $925 million pretax or $797 million after tax, primarily attributable to severe weather-related events globally and wildfires. There were no changes to the previously reported aggregate COVID-19 loss estimate from June 30. Additional information on catastrophe losses is detailed in our financial supplement. Our net loss reserves increased $1.5 billion in constant dollars in the quarter and our paid to incurred ratio was 73%. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $146 million pretax or $126 million after tax. This included $35 million of pretax adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures. The remaining favorable build development of $181 million comprises $312 million of favorable development from long tail lines, principally from accident years 2016 and prior, and adverse development of $131 million in short tail lines. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 16%. We continue to expect our annual core operating tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. I'll turn the call back to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. And at this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Mike Zaremski with Credit Suisse. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. Thanks. I guess, first question, if we can kind of talk about M&A appetite and your willingness to entertain additional kind of transformational M&A. I think one of your peers earlier this week kind of talked about looking to break up the company. Do you have any view of whether their - do you think there is kind of properties out there that could become available that you'd consider engaging in M&A? Evan Greenberg : Well, very short answer, will be real quick. I'm not commenting on M&A, and Chubb's appetite and whether we're entertaining this or that, just stay tuned. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Moving on to, I guess the environments, I guess one of the main questions I get asked is whether we feel COVID is - the charges are more in the rearview mirror, or is there a chance that companies kind of have to change your loss picks, currently up. Clearly COVID, you're demonstrating great results this quarter and there's a lot of improvement in the margin, some of it due to a benefit from COVID most likely due to the less claims frequency, but I guess question is if the pandemic drags on through next year, is that something that could cause Chubb to change its COVID loss picks, just trying to think about how sturdy the charge you took last quarter is and how to think about it potentially changing? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : We took no adjustment to our COVID charge. We see our reserve as adequate, nothing that shows us any reason to be imagining any charge. Thank you very much for your questions. Operator : And our next question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Gregory Peters : Good morning. Thanks for all the information in the call on pricing. If I step back, in your second quarter conference call, went out market conditions you opined that perhaps over 50% of your business was in a hard market sort of environment. Would you characterize the change from the second to third quarter as being - more of your business being in hard market or is it the same lines just continuing to experience these conditions? Evan Greenberg : No, Greg, I haven't calculated it precisely. But it has spread to more lines of business and more cohorts at risk. And when I think of cohorts, and that's why I use that term, it's line, it's customer cohorts within line. So if you think of large account versus upper middle market versus middle versus small, and then I do it by territory. And I think about it across geography. And when I look at it that way, it continues to spread. It's more in the middle market then it was. It's in more geographies. It's in more large account business, in more geographies and it's spreading to more lines of business, and within lines of business, it's been accelerating. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for that answer. My follow-up would be, just in your prepared comments you talked about the expense ratio, and I think for one portion you identified half was efficiency gains and half was operating conditions. I guess considering the effect of COVID and the economic slowdown on things like T&E, et cetera, as we look forward, and let's move past this year, we think about next year and the following years, how much of the expense improvements do you think that you realized are structural and will be with the company going forward. And how much are transitory or sort of one-time in nature? Evan Greenberg : Greg, I gave you such transparency by breaking down, as I did for you in the commentary. It was a gift. And I gave you a sense of what, at least I can see right now were current condition-related versus what is structural-related and from there, I don't have a crystal ball to go forward. But I gave you [indiscernible] half there. Gregory Peters : So the half, to sort of follow up on that - Evan Greenberg : The half is run rate related, and the rest, it has to do with the environment. Well, I can't tell you precisely when does travel open up, when does businesses open up, when do you back at, not just traveling but meetings and other activities that have to do with people to people contact and all the rest of that. I can't tell you that. Gregory Peters : Got it. All right, thanks, Evan. Operator : Our next question will come from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Good morning. Evan. My first question, appreciate all the comments on price increases, very helpful. You pointed to North America rates up over 15% in the quarter. There also, could you point [ph] to other comments you pointed to rate exceeding trend on an earned basis by about one investment [ph] your overall book. As we think about earning in that 15% of rate within North America commercial, can you just give us a sense of how that within could translate into margin improvement over the next year? Maybe you don't want to get into specific numbers but just as we could think about the trajectory within North America commercial given that you're getting such great rate within that book of business. Evan Greenberg : Yes, look, Elyse, it's going to earn its way and it will continue to have an ameliorating and positive impact on margin. That is what I'm telling you. And I see margin improvement and loss ratio, all things being equal, and I gave you a sense on expense ratio. Beyond that, I'm not going to get to point estimates and I'm not going to - as you know, we don't give forward guidance. So I actually, right to the line to give you a better sense than I have of that. Remember the 15% breaks down by line of business, and some lines require more rigs than other lines do, and it depends on loss trend, it depends on where you're starting from, and I gave you a sense as well that on a policy year basis, it's not a matter of making underwriting profit. That's my minimum red line in a soft market. There are harder market and what we strive for over any cycle is to earn a proper risk-adjusted rate of return, which means a combined ratio that will generate just that. And we consider all the factors, trend and loss ratio, et cetera. And we're coming closer in different lines of business to pricing levels that will achieve that. It's not there yet and we will continue to - I imagine, and I see that we can - and I'm confident that we will continue to publish improved margins as we go forward. All things being equal, because I can't predict volatility in the risk environment, cats, et cetera. So I hope that helps you. Elyse Greenspan : Yes. That's helpful, Evan. My second question, you've been pretty bullish on the market, I would say over the past few quarters. I recognize every hardening market is different, but as you think about these rates by 15% in North America, commercial strongly on commercial internationally as well. Does this market feel like we're in the strongest market, has come - it's like the early 2000s? And obviously there's differences with interest rates et cetera, but you feel like today, we are getting the best rate and have the best forward momentum as you know with COVID being, 2000 as compared to today? Evan Greenberg : I don't see it as like the early 2000s. I don't see it that way in terms of rate. Look, Elyse, look at the loss cost environment. We just look at the cat environment. You got to be able to pay for cat, and modeled and non-modeled, and in short tail lines, the industry is chasing a risk environment in that area. You look at casualty, when you look through COVID plus and minus. And I can expand on that comment of COVID plus and minus later. But when you look through you have a loss cost environment that is not benign, and you have an industry that in my judgment fell behind on pricing, quite a bit behind and the momentum is very good, but it's got ways to go. And then there are some areas, look at the size of workers' comp in the market, and workers' comp rates have continued to go down. And that's - we don't see that as a growth area to Chubb. Workers' comp continues to go down, and I wonder if the industry won't shoot the mark in that area. Right now, you have - we can come back to it. It's one of the areas that may have some frequency benefit from COVID et cetera, but that ultimately becomes a head fake [ph], and then you play catch up. So mixed bag. I don't see it as the early 2000s, but I see it as a very healthy trend, and we are in a hard market and it needs to sustain itself. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks, Evan. I appreciate all the color. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Phillips : Thank you. Good morning. Evan, more on the environment, I guess, kind of drilling down into - you've talked about areas where you see growth opportunities and you're going after those pretty aggressively, because the rate is good. Can you talk about - would you want to talk about areas, specific areas and maybe lines and whatever the way you want to talk about this, where you shy away from? Evan Greenberg : No, I'm not going to. I'm not - that's proprietary. That I'm not going to get into, and I don't think that benefits in investing thesis. So I'm not - I'm sorry Mike, I'm not going there. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thanks. And then I guess you've talked about in the past\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I'm not going to help others to benefit from Chubb's knowledge. Michael Phillips : Okay. Fair enough, thanks. You've talked about in the past, maybe an update if you on overseas gen [indiscernible]. Evan Greenberg : Mike, I lost you. You just said overseas gen and then cut out on me. Michael Phillips : Is this better, Evan? Evan Greenberg : Keep going. Michael Phillips : Okay, on Latin American overseas general and growth, so [indiscernible] there? Evan Greenberg : Did you say Latin America? Michael Phillips : I did so, yes. Evan Greenberg : And you wanted an update on Latin America? Michael Phillips : I did. Evan Greenberg : Okay. Latin America is only three months since I think I gave you the last update on it, and not much has changed. Latin America is the one region that I think is going to suffer the most and will continue to suffer. When you add the combination of economic conditions there, political and government-related policies and leadership, the general infrastructure and the management of healthcare and the capabilities of government healthcare, in the security situation in numerous countries in Latin America, it all mixes to where you can't be overly optimistic. It's not a region where I'm expecting to see growth. We are - we have negative growth right now and I expect that, that will turn around because we have a large consumer lines business, and that is beginning to - it's beginning to stabilize and quarter-on-quarter, it is starting to look a little better. And we'll then get to - is the year we get into 2021, it will have - it will stop being the drag and you'll have a year-on-year comparison, and it will improve. And some of the fundamentals in Latin America are stabilizing. But I don't see it as a real growth area now. And at the same time, I would say this, we make money in Latin America and our combined ratios are healthy. We have a good book of business. We have a good position. We've got a great team, and we're positioned to take advantage. We got a lot of opportunity, and we're signing up a lot of new distribution et cetera. And so over time, and at some point and that's why it's good to be a diversified global company as we are - at some point, Latin America will contribute in a better way to the organization. Michael Phillips : Okay, thank you. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, David. David Motemaden : Hey, good morning, Evan. Just hoping to get a bit more of your commentary just around loss cost trends and you had kind of mentioned it in response to Elyse's question, just wondering any sort of update on what you're seeing in the third quarter as economic activity has picked up, courts have reopened, and how much conservatism you feel you're baking into your loss picks, given the environment, underneath some of the statements you made on the loss - on the margin improvement? Evan Greenberg : Look, and you don't want to divide this. We use normalized trend to price, which is really data through the first quarter of '20. We looked through COVID, both the pluses and minuses, that in our judgment are temporarily distorting. And so we view COVID on one hand as a cat event, and it's a cat event that's producing some plus and minus. On the one hand you have the COVID benefit from a reduction in frequency. And that's showing up and it shows up early. On the other COVID losses are emerging so far from our global look at it, they are in the $30 billion range. And it's mostly short tail and we stick to our view of the ultimate industry COVID loss. Most companies to me appear to be recognizing COVID losses as they emerge and they're going to emerge over the next few years. You haven't really seen the COVID casualty end of it. I should - it may be in your parlance, long tail. Does the benefit from frequency we're seeing right now ultimately offset the ultimate development on COVID, I doubt it. But I don't know. So as things stand that means, again we price, looking through both the benefit of lower frequency and we look through the COVID loss itself, as we treat it as a CAT and we did our darnedest to recognize it, to ultimate. And there is nothing we see so far that changes our view of that at all. So that's fundamentally how we look at it. In my judgment, that's how any good underwriter should be thinking about this. So then that says you imagine that the world ultimately reverts to the normal trend lines we had been seeing in casualty, professional lines, property, et cetera, et cetera. And that's what we used to price, and to imagine the appropriate returns on the business. And may be that gives you a better organized way, of thinking about this. David Motemaden : No, that's very helpful. I appreciate the color there, Evan. And so it sounds like there is really - there is nothing right now that would make you trade - that would make you change your ultimate trend, and whether that's - so you felt comfortable that it may even be conservatism potentially baked in depending on how some of these short-term benefits come through. Evan Greenberg : Your first part I agree with. Your second part, you have said twice to me, and you noticed I'm steady in not answering that. David Motemaden : Thought I'd give it a shot. But I appreciate that. If I could just ask one. Evan Greenberg : It was a good shot. David Motemaden : Just one more. This is just a quick one. I know you've said in the past, the E&S book is around 10% of the total company's premium base. But that was after a time where you cut that by roughly half over 10 years. Just from your prepared remarks, it sounds like we are in rate adequacy and more and more of those lines. So my question is, how big do you think E&S can become as a percentage of the entire company as we look forward over the next few years? Evan Greenberg : Well, first of all, E&S is growing. Rate adequacy, I return you to my comments about policy year, be careful with the statement, just because you're getting a lot of rate, you got to know where the classes started from. We shrunk - I'm going to give you an example. We shrunk primary casualty in the US. E&S just dramatically. That business in my judgment in the US, probably running a 150 anyway. So how much rate do you think that area needs to get to produce a reasonable risk-adjusted, let alone umbrella or access. So you know what you need depends on where you're starting and so imagine that now E&S is one of the growth engines right now for Chubb, between Westchester, Bermuda and London, exactly as I told you before. It's a growth engine. And how big can it become as a percentage of the company, well the rest of the company is not standing still, except temporarily the consumer lines businesses going backwards a little bit. So I'd return you - I probably - which I can't. I'm not going to do, return you to that old joke about how - what it would be. It will grow as a percentage of the company. Thank you. David Motemaden : Thank you. Operator : Next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Got two for you Evan. The first one, you mentioned you're lifting the moratorium on share buyback. Yet you still got obviously some pretty significant growth opportunities here given that you're in this hard market and you're starting to see your growth accelerate here. How do you think about balancing the capital management with the growth here? Is it just simply because you just stock's too cheap, you're like - it's a much better return to buy back stock today rather than allocate it to some new business or how you're thinking about that? Evan Greenberg : Oh my god. No, Brian, you're way over thinking this. We have plenty of capital flexibility. There is not a prayer, I'm going to starve any business of growth because of capital, no, no. The businesses are left to grow as rapidly as underwriting conditions and our risk appetite warrant and our ability to get out of our own way and get after it allows. And so, no. And at the same time, I can guarantee you with this share price I'm a buyer. Brian Meredith : Got you, got you. So it was really the share price that prompted your, kind of let's just lift the moratorium here? Evan Greenberg : Listen this is a - no, it's not just the share price. It's - that's actually my last consideration. That's my consideration in terms of do we buy or not buy once we've looked at a moratorium. The moratorium lifting is based on simply good balance sheet and capital management and stewardship of the business. And that is based on our visibility in both understanding the environment we're in, the risk environment, the economic environment, et cetera, the stability of the organization versus that, as we see it and our overall balance sheet position. And all that says to us, okay. It's prudent to lift that moratorium. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. And then my second question, Evan, you talked about some lines getting closer to kind of an acceptable risk adjusted return. I'm just curious given the current interest rate environment and I know you've talked about ROEs and kind of where you would like them to get to. Evan Greenberg : It's in there. Brian Meredith : Where do you think - pardon me? Evan Greenberg : We use earned interest rate environment. Brian Meredith : Got you. And what do you think the appropriate kind of a return on equity is right now for your business, right. And do you think, given this for a market hard market we're in, can you get there? Evan Greenberg : Well, I'm certainly driving to get there, and this isn't calculus where you approach it, and never reach it. I expect to achieve it. And there is both clear-eyed management position I can give you. And I think that's in the industries best interest to achieve stability in the face of a more hostile loss environment and the uncertainty in environment, this industry needs to achieve the proper risk-adjusted return and that varies by area of business and by company on the degree [ph], but I'll tell you what, our objective of achieving in that 15% range has not changed. That's where we are [ph]. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : And our next question will come from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks, good morning. So overseas general, really good underwriting quarter. I guess what I'm trying to understand is how exposed is that to the dynamic between rate and loss trend? I think historically, this has been more of a stable margin business, is a lot of A&H, some personal lines. So, I mean to what extent do you think that segment should benefit in some of the same way as North America commercial is full margin improvement standpoint moving forward? Evan Greenberg : Well, the market is not - the firming market is not about A&H, and it's not about personal lines. Those are very idiosyncratic, and they go to their own rhythm and personal lines in particular is a country by country, line by line. But the commercial lines business in international has many of the same trends that North America does and it varies by country. I guarantee in the short-tail lines, it's got the same trends and faces the same kinds of exposures, that I'm sure you have noticed. By the way just remember Australia wildfires, floods, wind, hail storms, just take them across the various geographies and international. And then in the long tail areas, well, I'd refer you to professional lines, into different countries casualty, marine in certain markets, it has its own - it has its own rhythm to it, and patterns, themes are the same as North America, varies by - Ryan Tunis : Got you. And then, I guess just on the expense ratio. It always feels like in these hard markets, if you guys hard [ph], kind of was doing a 30% expense ratio and the kind of keep doing - there's not usually a lot of operating leverage, if you will, but we have seen your expense ratio improve over the past couple of quarters. And I'm wondering if - is there a dynamic there of expense ratio improvement as well, that's tied to the combination of top line growing at a more elevated pace, than you kind of used to stay. Evan Greenberg : I didn't get the last part of that question. I understood what you said expense ratio blah - not blah, blah, blah, but I got expenses. I didn't get the punch line Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Yes, so the punch line is we usually think about these hard markets in loss ratio improvement kind of improvement story, but we're seeing expense ratio improve, we're not seeing your expenses grow at the level your premiums. Is that the type of things you think they can continue in this type of market, like should we also be thinking that as you're getting the rate adequacy? And as you're growing faster you should also see some ongoing positive torque in terms of expense ratio improvement? Evan Greenberg : Well, I think I gave it to you already when I gave you the operating expense ratio and told you how much was kind of COVID and health-related environmental, and excluding that about half of the improvement in the OpEx was our own structural. And so that gives you - that I think that answers your question. But I don't give forward guidance. And on the other hand, what I also tried to give you, which I don't have a crystal ball on it, and that is in the acquisition ratio we benefit from mix because of consumer lines coming down, and God bless, that's one that I hope turns itself around and we have the pleasure of seeing our acquisition ratio to a degree, go back up because of the A&H business and some of the personal lines business, right. Ryan Tunis : Yes. And then one other thing I just - and this was past, how much you can to help me with it, but it seems like a year ago, everyone was worried about reserves, the seasoning of accident year, just across the industry. And your long tail reserve releases of $312 million were higher than I think $280 million last year. I think that this is like '16 in prior, before it was '15 in prior. So it feels like whatever information content we're getting this year and some of those Green or older accident years has been positive. Is there a different - do you see a different dynamic as we get into kind of '17, '18, '19 stuff where we actually did start to see a little bit more of a pickup, or and I'm just trying to interpret the - because that does seem like a high quality result? I'm just trying to interpret what you're learning, not just about the recent COVID stuff, but also in terms of stuff from a casualty standpoint that are - that you were quite long [ph]. Evan Greenberg : Ryan, I know what you are asking. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Evan Greenberg : I know what you're asking me. You know I've been saying for some time that the more recent accident years in casualty, when we look at trends, and others have spoken about it, so called social inflation, which I think it's too narrow a way of thinking of things. But in any event, you see - you saw rates continue to go down. And then loss costs, particularly in the frequency, and to a degree are dependent on the area of severity, the trends worsening. We saw - we've been aware that - and we have reserved and priced for it. I'm not sure the industry has reserved adequately for '17, '18 and '19. And we'll see over time but I think that's also part of the impetus that continues hard market, resolved to recognized and get paid for the exposure and for some, maybe to address holes they'll have in some of those more recent accident years. We'll see. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question will come from Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. My first question is around premiums. So I think premium growth this quarter actually came in stronger than the cautious tone that was set last quarter. It sounds to me like the tone has also changed and become a little more constructive here. What's changed if I may ask? Evan Greenberg : What did you just say, I'm sorry, you're - I'm not sure what you asked me? Yaron Kinar : Okay. I think last quarter, the tone I heard about, on second half of the year premium growth was cautious and results this quarter were actually quite strong on the premium growth side. Sounds to me like the tone has also become more constructive going forward. So I'm just trying to understand what has changed from where you were seeing the environment a quarter ago to where we are today? Evan Greenberg : I see. We don't exist in a vacuum. We live in a world right now, look around you. By the way, are you talking to me from an office or your home? Yaron Kinar : I'm at home. Evan Greenberg : Okay. You're home because we're in a health crisis, and we got an economy with fits and starts, and we've got it globally. The visibility is not great. We have economic activity in terms of businesses, are they opened or closed. We have a hard market and we have exposures, are they reduced, are they the same or they're increasing. Trying to guess all of it in a general environment, don't - I'm saying it to you this way first, because don't narrow your sight to simply the insurance market or you miss the real picture, that it's in context of a world that is unprecedented in our lifetimes. And so if I'm going to give - if I'm going to be responsible in any of my comments in that regard, of course I'm going to be reasonably sober in what I say. We're benefiting from all of the insurance market-related dynamics we've been talking about. And on the other hand, we have the vagaries of the world I just mentioned and that's what you add together, and we're doing our best to drive through that. There will be some in our business, particularly by the nature of it large account, middle market, small consumer and the regions of the world, we operate in, there'll be some variability in growth rate quarter-on-quarter between the quarters, but overall all things considered, I'm very confident in Chubb's ability to outperform. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my second question probably a broader question still, so if I look at the P&C market, the tone from the supply side, including from Chubb is that there is more need for momentum, for rate momentum to continue with the low interest rate environment, with loss trend uncertainty. Do you think that the demand side of the market can and will support this considering that the underlying ratios are actually improving a bit? You're getting some favorable frequency, you're getting rate in excess of trend, COVID losses seem to be manageable to date and prior year development doesn't seem to be a particular drag at this point. Evan Greenberg : Yaron, first of all, I'm not sure in that comment, you just listened to what I had to say, I'm sorry about what's the COVID benefit versus COVID losses and how to think about that. And what I was very clear about - so that's head fake and you want to go back and think about that with all due respect. But I think you see through that and you look at the trends, and you look what the industry requires to achieve a reasonable risk-adjusted and will clients decide that - well the arbitrage - will large clients decide, well, the arbitrage I got for me because you were selling to me cheap. And I can't take advantage of that anymore. So I think I will increase my retentions and take more myself. Will that occur? Sure it'll occur. And it always occurs and it's natural and it should happen. And that's not a problem to me. Is the industry overcharging and therefore there'll be a natural response against that? Absolutely not. And by the way the last point that I think that I'm going to make to you that I think you left out, when you talked about industry loss costs, you talked about loss ratio. Well, let's also talk about the reinsurance market. And the reinsurance market, I have some sense of their exposures, and I have some sense of what they are running, and we have yet to see the real response, from the reinsurance industry, which increases the cost to the insurance industry, which means that rates continue to move because costs go up. And do I think for the industry this is great behavior? No, I hate the cycles this way. It's because the clients took advantage of very cheap pricing that kept going down year-by-year. The industry kept providing it to them, the brokers kept broking, and no one came with clean hands in it. And it gets to a point then where pressure builds and it goes the other way and it does it in a way that I don't think it's the most responsible way of doing this. But that's where we are. Thank you for the questions. Operator : And that will conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back to Karen Beyer for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you all for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thank you and have a great day. Operator : And this concludes today's conference. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] And now, for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you. Welcome everyone to our December 31, 2020 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Company performance, pricing and business mix and economic market condition, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, it\u2019s my pleasure to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer. And then, we'll take your questions. Also with us today to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had a very strong finish to the year with excellent financial results, headlined by rapid premium revenue growth and underwriting margin improvement across our commercial lines portfolio in both, the U.S. and internationally, a trend we are confident will continue. We produced very good earnings, and our balance sheet is in excellent shape. Our fourth quarter results were in context of the historic and unprecedented time we live in, nationally and globally. We continue to face the health, economic, political and social impact, the COVID-19 pandemic globally, which might now be more accurately viewed as an endemic and which despite the efficacy of vaccines and therapeutics, will likely be with us for years to come.  Before I go further with the quarter, I want to make a few comments about recent events in our country. We all witnessed the shocking display of demagoguery and insurrection by a group of our own citizens in our nation's capital in early January. We witnessed the scene in our Capitol Building never before viewed in our country's 200-year history, including the totally unacceptable display of symbols of hate, bigotry, violence and antisemitism in the halls of Congress. The incident has left our country shaken and our international image tarnished. Some members of Congress attempting to subvert the will of the people and stand in the way of what is largely a ceremonial affirmation of the electoral college vote was also unacceptable. At the end of the day, the facts are the facts. All of the independent institutions, recharged with overseeing our election process, including the Department of Justice, the new federal cyber watchdog agency, state and federal courts, and state election officials investigated, opined and confirmed there was no widespread election fraud. Just because you don't like the political outcome doesn't give you the right to make up your own facts, or attempt to subvert our democracy and the rule of law. This isn't going away, and this is a wakeup call to all of us who care about and love our country. Now, returning to our fourth quarter results. We recorded core operating income of $3.18 per share, up nearly 40% from prior year, and net income of $2.4 billion, or $5.34 per share, up over 100%, which by the way was a record. We produced strong premium revenue growth in the quarter with global P&C net premiums written, which exclude agriculture, up 6%. Our P&C combined ratio of 87.6%, along with very good net earned premium growth produced P&C underwriting income of $969 million, up 82%, while our current accident year underwriting results, excluding cats were even better, supported by continued underwriting margin improvement and excellent revenue growth in our commercial P&C businesses globally, as we continue to capitalize on more favorable underwriting conditions. The current accident year combined ratio excluding cats was 86.4% compared to 90% prior year, the 3.6 percentage points of improvement included 2.8 points of loss ratio related improvement, which was broad-based. And let me give you a better sense of this. Agriculture improved 27 points, and then excluding agriculture, the global P&C commercial lines loss ratio improved about 1.5 percentage points, virtually all as a result of earned rate exceeding loss cost trend. The loss ratio for global P&C consumer lines, which is globally A&H and global personal lines, improved 1.2 percentage points, the vast majority of which was indirect COVID benefit related. Phil will discuss the expense ratio improvement in the quarter. To very briefly recap the year, though we had an entire quarter of earnings loss to our effort to reserve COVID to ultimate and a very active year for natural catastrophes, we produced $3.3 billion of core operating earnings. The full year published P&C combined ratio is 96.1%, compared to 90.6% in '19. The full year P&C current accident year combined ratio excluding cats was 86.7% compared to 89.2%, which speaks to our underlying health. And our full year premium revenue growth is about 5.5% in constant dollar with commercial lines growth of 9.3%. I mentioned in the beginning a strong balance sheet. The strength of our loss reserves, which is the most important part of the balance sheet, improved throughout the year. Consistent with our practices, we continue to recognize bad news early and any potential good news late. On the one hand, there have been no changes to our P&C COVID-19 incurred loss charge, which we consider adequate to absorb COVID losses that may emerge. The vast majority of the charge remains IBNR. On the other hand, we have recognized to only a modest degree the reduction in losses, mostly frequency due to the economic shutdowns. Beyond COVID related, we have also purposely strengthened reserves. Increasing the strength of our reserves is the prudent thing to do, given the uncertainty in the environment. Book and tangible book value per share were up 7.7% and 12.2%, respectively, for the year. So, we'll have more to say about investment income, book value, cats and prior period development. Turning to growth and the rate environment. As I said, global P&C premium revenue in the quarter, which excludes agriculture, grew 6%, comprising 11.3% growth in commercial P&C and 3.9% decline in consumer lines. The consumer lines result included negative growth in global A&H and international personal lines and positive growth in North America personal lines. In the quarter, we continued to experience a strong and continuously improving commercial P&C pricing environment globally. In fact, the level of rate and rate of increase was the strongest since this part of the underwriting cycle began approximately three years ago. I expect the favorable underwriting conditions to continue. In North America, commercial P&C, net premiums grew 10% and that actually includes a reduction in growth of 3 points due to reduced exposures from the decline in economic activity. New business was up nearly 12%, and renewal retention remained strong at over 95% on a premium basis. In our North America major accounts and specialty business, net premiums written grew over 11.5%, while our middle market and small commercial business grew nearly 8%. Overall rates increased in North America commercial P&C by 16.5% with a loss cost trend of approximately 5%, though it varies up or down, depending upon line of business. Let me give you a better sense of the rate movement. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty, up 7%, while general casualty rates were up over 36% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up over 30%, and financial lines rates were up over 26%. In our E&S wholesale business, the Westchester, property rates were up over 23%, casualty rates were up nearly 29%, and financial lines rates were up over 26%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up over 15%. Casualty rates were up nearly 12%, excluding workers' comp, with workers' comp rates up about 0.5%, and financial lines rates were up over 20%. In our international general insurance operations, commercial P&C net written premiums grew 14% in the quarter. Our international retail commercial business grew 9% and our London wholesale business grew over 32%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region, with net written premiums up 17.5% in the UK, about 16.5% on the Continent and over 16% in Asia-Pacific, while Latin America shrank 14% as the combination of insurance market and economic conditions weigh on Latin America. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In overseas gen, rates were up 18.5% overall, with loss cost trend of 3%. Rates were up 17% in international retail and 26% in London wholesale. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continues to be impacted by the pandemic's effects on consumer-related activities. Our international personal lines business and our global A&H business together shrank 8%. We expect growth to return and to begin to return in these businesses as the year goes along. Our North America high net worth personal lines business, what we call personal risk services, however, remains an exception, with net premiums up 2.5% in the quarter. We continue to experience flight to safety and quality in our high net worth segment. New business was up 6.5% and retention remained strong at about 92.3%, while we continue to achieve rate increases of 4.5%. Our global re business grew its net premiums written about 14.5%. And lastly, in our Asia focused international life insurance business, net written premiums were up 25% in the quarter. In sum, we are in a continuing hard or firming market for commercial P&C in most all parts of the world. The rate environment in my judgment is a rational and necessary response to years of underpricing of risk and a more uncertain risk environment today. Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting knowhow, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted rate of return from underwriting, and that is the objective. Some lines are there, while others have a way to go. Virtually all of our commercial P&C lines of business throughout the year have been achieving rates that exceed loss cost, and so margins continue to improve. Looking forward, we are off to a very good start to the year in the first quarter. Both growth and the level of rate increase we are achieving look a lot like the fourth quarter. Based on everything we see, the current commercial market condition has legs. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. By almost any measure, our Company performed admirably and distinguished itself during the past year. And I applaud, and I'm so grateful to our more than 31,000 Chubb colleagues around the globe, whose resilience, determination and dedication have produced distinguishing results for our clients and shareholders, in spite of work-from-home conditions. I also want to recognize our global management team, who lead and reinforce our culture and discipline, a wellhead of our performance every single day. In closing, our Company finished the year with a strong performance and momentum that continues. We are leaning into the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are, in fact, growing exposure. Our people are energized, and we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our Company profitably and increase shareholder value. With that, I'll turn the call over to Phil. And then, we're going to come back and take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. We completed an eventful year with solid financial results and continued to build on our balance sheet strength, including substantial capital of almost $75 billion. Supported by extraordinary Fed actions, our AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets grew almost $10 billion for the year and now exceeds $120 billion. Our excellent underwriting and investment performance produced very strong operating cash flow of $2.5 billion for the quarter and a record $9.8 billion for the year. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $542 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $190 million in share repurchases. For the year, we returned $1.9 billion to shareholders or 58% of earnings, including $1.4 billion in dividends and $516 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was $924 million and $3.6 billion for the year. Investment income in the quarter was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities and greater private equity distributions. While there were a number of factors that impacted variability in investment income, we now expect our quarterly run rate to be in the range of $890 million to $900 million. Separately, our policy has always been to record the change in the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses, instead of net investment income, as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark, if included in investment income, would have increased adjusted net investment income by $485 million for the quarter and $714 million for the year. Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 10.7% and 17.1%, respectively for the quarter. If we had included the fair value mark on our private equity portfolio and our core operating income, core operating ROE would have been higher by 3.5 percentage points for the quarter. During the past few quarters, since S&P Global Ratings published a ratings update on Chubb, management has had discussions with S&P regarding Chubb's track record of strong and diverse underwriting results and operating performance. This has resulted in the Company updating its capital management policy to calibrate its estimate of capital adequacy from S&P's AAA level to S&P's AA level. We believe this is sufficient to maintain our AA rating. Our capital management policy remains consistent. We hold surplus capital for both, risk and opportunity. Our undeployed capital on a run rate basis dilutes our core operating ROE by around 200 basis points. We are also announcing today that our Board has increased the authorization to repurchase shares by $1 billion. Our total repurchase program now allows for up to $2.5 billion between January 1st and December 31st of 2021. Book and tangible book value increased 5.4% and 8%, respectively, for the quarter, and 7.4% and 11.9%, respectively, for the year. Book and tangible book value were favorably impacted by after-tax net realized and unrealized gains of $2 billion for the quarter and $2.5 billion for the year. The gains were principally in our investment portfolio, primarily from the narrowing of credit spreads in our corporate bond portfolio, a decline in interest rates and the fair value mark on private equities. At December 31st, our investment portfolio was in an unrealized gain position of $4.7 billion after tax. Our net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $314 million pretax or $271 million after tax. The P&C catastrophe losses of $296 million were primarily from a series of severe weather-related events globally. There were no changes to the previously reported estimate of our P&C COVID incurred loss charge from June 30th. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $206 million pretax or $189 million after tax. This included $94 million pretax adverse development from our legacy runoff exposures, principally related to asbestos. The remaining favorable development of $300 million is split 70% from long tail lines, principally from accident years 2015 and prior, and 30% from short tail lines. For the year, our net loss reserves increased $4.3 billion in constant dollars, and our paid to incurred ratio was 80%. The P&C expense ratio was 28% in the quarter with a 70 basis-point improvement over the prior year. About half of the improvement is from the health-related shutdown and the balance is principally from operating efficiencies. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.2% for the quarter and 15.8% for the year. For 2021, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate to be in the range of 15% to 17%. I'll turn the call back to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Phillips : Can you talk about your ability in times like this with rates so much higher than [Technical Difficulty] strength? Can you help with your ability [Technical Difficulty] in place, I guess, to keep your business sticky [Technical Difficulty]? Evan Greenberg : I'm having a very hard time hearing you. Can you get closer to your microphone or something? Michael Phillips : Sorry. Is this better, Evan? Evan Greenberg : Yes. That's better. Please, go ahead. Michael Phillips : In times like this with rates so much higher than loss [Technical Difficulty] you're able to get. Can you just talk about programs you have in place to keep your business sticky and keep your retentions high? Evan Greenberg : Keeping retentions high? Michael Phillips : Yes. Evan Greenberg : The program -- I'm sorry. Are you saying the programs we have in place to keep our retentions high? Michael Phillips : That's correct. Keep your business sticky and not moving elsewhere. Evan Greenberg : Yes. We -- it's very basic blocking and tackling every single day. This is a customer and client-focused Company. And frankly, our communication begins early and it's continuous with all of our clients and customers. We endeavor not to surprise. We explained very clearly to our customers and clients the reason for need, for rate increase, how we're running today, the kind of transparency we give you, we give them a lot of transparency around the loss cost environment, around our return hurdles, around our appetite for risk, the consistency of the Company has by itself, distinguished itself. And we've stood out and given -- and therefore, garnered a lot more credibility and confidence from our clients. Chubb has been consistent in its approach about underwriting and its need for rate throughout the years, particularly when we were shrinking and know that when we couldn't achieve what we required to earn an adequate return. And at the same time, given the rate environment changing our appetite consistent, we continue to promote. And on the same basis, our appetite for the amount of risk we'll take, the classes of business that we will serve, where we will serve them, all of that is a well-understood story about us. And finally, what I'd say is, we don't serve them in one line of business or two lines of business, we serve them broadly across virtually all of their needs. And the secret, we do it on a local basis. It isn't simply that we operate from 2 or 3 hubs. We're where they do business and where they need to work with us and see us every single day. There is no magic sauce about this. It's a day-to-day, year-in and year-out effort of a consistent approach to how we do business. And right now, it serves us quite well. Michael Phillips : I guess, on the COVID losses, almost a year out now, and at the early stages, you are one, and there were a number that said it's going to be the worst than ever. Some are still saying that, but there is many that have put the industry losses a lot lower than what they initially had said. I guess, where do you stand on that? And do you think there is any upside to bringing your current numbers that you put up last year down as [Technical Difficulty]. Evan Greenberg : I'm right where you left me standing. I think the loss to the industry -- we had pegged that loss somewhere in the underwriting loss, somewhere in that $70 billion, $80 billion range, and I think it's ultimately going to play out there. Right now, it's at around $35 billion to $40 billion. And that number is going to continue to climb. And so far, you've really focused on BI that you've seen. And BI, I don't think, has run its course. But beyond that, there are a lot more casualties to come. D&O, the employment practices liability, et cetera, and credit related. And then, the other side of the balance sheet as well over time. So far, we have had a recession that has been relatively credit loss proof brought to you by central banks around the world and government policies. That's not going to last forever, and there is -- just look at how the banks have handled reserves. There is more to come. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now take our next question from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : I had a question just on the international consumer lines. And I guess, pretty encouraging commentary that you expect that to come back as the year progresses, Evan. I guess, one thing that I'm realizing is, it feels like the mix shift away from those consumer lines has had -- has been somewhat of a headwind to the loss ratios and to margins overall over the course of 2020. So, I guess, I'm just wondering maybe if you could size that. And then, help us think about the positive margin benefit that may have as the mix shift moves a little bit back towards that as we get through the course of 2021? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I'm not sure you're thinking about that completely right. The consumer lines depends on line of business within consumer, we talk about accident and health and we\u2019re talking about automobile. But, it in general runs a lower loss ratio, but it runs a higher expense ratio. We're producing the current accident year in the 80s. And the consumer lines business runs in aggregate in that kind of range. So, it's a shift in loss ratio, expense ratio predominantly. Now, that varies, which I'm not going to get into with you and then you're going down the rabbit hole. It varies by region of the world and international versus domestic, but you really spoke about the international in that regard. So, look, as it comes back, it lifts growth and it lifts earnings, and it's less of a margin story. David Motemaden : Got it. That's helpful. That helps... Evan Greenberg : I'm comparing that to current accident year ex cat. On a published basis, it will have some benefit. I'm not prepared to go into the detail on that. David Motemaden : Okay. That's fair. And then, I guess, just a question on North America commercial. So, we're obviously seeing continued positive rate trend there, 16.5 points in the fourth quarter. I guess, my question is, if I look at the current accident year loss ratio ex cat, about 120 basis points improvement year-over-year. That compares to an average rate, I think that you guys have said over the last five quarters, it's been well above 10%, I think closer to 13%. So, it sounds like it's I would say, maybe 8 points above trend roughly. I guess I'm wondering what are the moving pieces here I'm thinking maybe mix shifts that would explain why we're not seeing more of that rate above trend come through in the loss ratio. Evan Greenberg : If you listened to me in the commentary, I spoke about reserves. I also broke down this quarter's loss ratio margin improvement. And as you heard, there was a greater percentage of improvement for Commercial P&C than there was for consumer lines within Global P&C. And so, you are seeing margin improvement. On the other hand, we are striving and will achieve an adequate risk-adjusted return, which does that we're pegging ourselves to achieve a result like that. We raised the bar in a market like this, where we're growing exposure, and there is more loss cost certainty as we look forward, COVID and non-COVID related, we are properly building reserve margin, and at the same time, through growth and margin improvement and not a small amount, and a current accident year combined ratio that is world-class. We are delivering tremendous earnings. At the same time, we're building balance sheet strength, absolutely the right thing to do. And I hope that answers your question. And finally, don't be overly simplistic about it and you weren't. You got an average loss cost trend. That varies by category of business and line of business. And we are also growing in areas, that is to some degree, changing our mix right now. Something else, that's proprietary, I'm not going to go into. So that does have an impact as well to some degree. Operator : We will take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, on prior calls, you've also mentioned the fact that we could see reinsurance rate increases. So, January 1, you heard about a good amount of casualty, the insurance rate increases. So, have you -- do you see that, or do you expect to see that help with some of the pricing momentum that you've been talking about throughout the commercial line space? Evan Greenberg : No, not really, Elyse. The reinsurance market in January was firmed to a lesser degree than we anticipated. And it was a bit surprising to us, both in casualty and short-tail lines, less of an impact. Elyse Greenspan : Would you expect -- when we think about more retentions, obviously, that's moved by a lot of different reinsurance programs, but maybe if we're just thinking about North America or commercial, would you expect any significant change in your gross to net retentions in 2021? Evan Greenberg : No. Not a significant change. Targeted in specific areas, we already have changed our retentions. But, it is -- on the margin, we're quite consistent. Remember, we buy reinsurance, both for capacity purposes where the amount of exposure we take is beyond what we want to retain on the balance sheet, and we buy a certain amount for volatility protection. And that's pretty steady in how we manage, but there are targeted areas, again, something I won't go into in any detail. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then, one last for me on the market. You made a lot of good double-digit price increases, in some instances, like, well into the double digits across many lines. And you also said that there are some lines that have a ways to go, I believe. So, which lines, and I'm assuming that some lines where loss cost is perhaps well above that 5% aggregate. But, when you think about your commercial book on what lines do you still think need a good amount of rate increase? Evan Greenberg : Right. And remember, it's to -- we translate combined ratio hurdles from what we consider to be an appropriate risk-adjusted rate of return we should be earning in any line of business. And there are lines of business around the world that have a ways to go in achieving that. And there are lines that are approaching it or have are there, so it varies. I'm not going to go into what's what, that's that. As you can imagine it\u2019s clearly proprietary. I'm not going to give a road map to the market. Operator : We will take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Before I ask my question, just -- I know we got you for another quarter, Phil, but I just want to congratulate you on your retirement. Actually surprised Evan's actually letting you go. But, here's my questions. The first one, Evan, could you talk a little bit about the A&H business right now? I mean, what I want to understand is, how coincident is growth in that business with economic growth? And perhaps maybe you can kind of outline for us where is the growth more important globally to start seeing that growth come back in that line of business? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I'm going to give it to you in two very -- the simplest ways, and it's more complicated than this, but I think we'll help you conceptualize it, credit and travel. It's not -- so, it's not simply economic. It's the shutdown and travel. And imagine -- let's take it for a couple of hands. You would think of travel as simply, okay, retail travel insurance that you sell-through travel agents, et cetera, or airlines. That's actually a small part of it. Employers and employer purchased insurance, where it's really -- it's purchased not for employees sitting in the office. It's purchased because they have employees traveling all the time, travel accident insurance, as an example. With travel down and then on top of it, economic -- the economic headwinds, that impacts overall A&H, a major part of A&H around the globe, whether it's in the United States, Europe, Asia or Latin America. Credit related, we have a huge direct marketing book of business, and it is principally Asia and Latin America, and with people taking less credit on one hand, and secondly, not just tied to credit, but marketing to their customer bases, the middle-income customer for supplemental insurances, A&H, modest homeowners and householders related, I think, on the credit side as well, mortgages, with economic activity down, that business slows down substantially. We are seeing signs of it, and it is beginning to pick back up, but it has a ways to grow in Asia in particular, and believe it or not, in parts of Latin America, like Chile, and to some degree in places like Brazil. So, the business does start to -- and we're seeing it in the first quarter begin a bit in different areas to pick up. And then, of course, as you go further into the year beginning with second quarter, you start getting a year-on-year comparison. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. That's really helpful. Evan Greenberg : The overall health of the business -- by the way, the overall health of the business, very strong. And this is not like a lost forever thing. The clients remain in place. The distribution, not only remains in place, but our people have spent a lot of time putting a lot of new distribution channels in place. New partnerships across the board, and we are very optimistic that as time goes on -- and I just can't pick the time. You're trying to pick the timing of the health crisis right now. And when does it -- when are we able to, around the world, resume travel, economies open up, people leave their homes and get back to work that's -- good luck predicting that, you can't. But, what we know is, it will over time, heal itself. And as it does, that\u2019s very vital part of our franchise. It is an excellent franchise in place, and we'll get a lot more joy for the effort we got today. Brian Meredith : Great. Thanks. Second question, I am just curious, Phil mentioned the 200 basis points of drag from your excess capital position right now. I'm just curious, do you think you'll be able to use that excess capital organically over the next couple of years, or do you think you'll need to do some inorganic stuff in order to utilize that excess capital, or do you anticipate utilizing it? Evan Greenberg : I anticipate, over the next number of years, next few years, you know I'm a pretty patient guy. And I expect over the next medium-term to put that capital to work, either organically or inorganically. Brian Meredith : Got you. Is the market condition is good enough to... Evan Greenberg : Chubb remains a growth company. And that's how we see ourselves. And it is predominantly beginning with the most fundamental shareholder wealth creation, indicator tangible book value. And by tangible book and book over any medium-term period of time, we will continue to grow this Company. And our share of the global insurance market, we view it globally, is almost a rounding error. And so, there is a lot of scope to grow for this company. And it is both organic and inorganic. And the inorganic things we will do are things that will complement what we are already doing organically, and we'll produce what we think are superior or very favorable return to shareholders. So, we will use the capital wisely. And to the degree, we build surplus capital in excess of what we require, we will return that to shareholders. And you notice we're returning another $1 billion. We just announced, right, something from $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion. I know we live in worlds of trillions, but I got to say, honor the mouth to meet that, right? Operator : We will take our next question from Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Maybe just piggybacking off the inorganic growth discussion. Can you comment, Chubb had exercised its option to purchase an additional 7.1% stake in Huatai, which would make Chubb a majority owner? I mean, it seems certain conditions had to be met, but the intent previously expressed was to do so by year-end 2021. And if so, how will we change [ph] the majority ownership milestone change or strategic priorities in China and APAC more broadly? Evan Greenberg : Could you repeat in -- what is the essence of your question? Tracy Benguigui : On the inorganic growth -- yes, on the topic of inorganic growth, I recognize\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Huatai -- yes. Huatai insurance? Tracy Benguigui : Right. Have you exercised that 7.1% option? Evan Greenberg : No, we have not exercised the 7.1%. When we do, when it occurs, we will announce it to the market. Of course, we will. And you will know when and if we achieve the majority control, which we expect to do. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. All right. So, I'll just move on from there. Maybe just to cyber, congrats to Mike Kessler on his new cyber leadership role. With a new set of eyes, is Chubb refreshing its view of cyber risk, or is there secular trends like 2020 ransomware that is prompting you to revisit limit and impose self-insured retention? And if you want to just add anything more broadly on terms and conditions. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Mike, who's an outstanding executive and he's been with us a long time. He wasn't appointed based on market conditions or what we see as the general underwriting environment. Mike was appointed because he's a great executive. It's an important line of business to us. It has -- it's a very complex line of business. And Mike brings the skills and the capabilities to manage on a global basis, a business like that. Great opportunity for him and a great opportunity for Chubb. Beyond that, the cyber itself is in a state of change. And the product is evolving and will evolve. It's a lot beyond pricing. Pricing is the easy part of it. The loss environment, which I've been speaking about for numerous quarters consistently, is changing. And so, I'll just remind everyone, frequency of loss has been increasing as the world has digitized, and we gave it a huge shove during COVID and work remotely conditions, the world is more cyber and digitally integrated. And that raises both, exposure in terms of frequency of loss, but it also raises and continues to raise the catastrophe nature of the product because of the interconnectedness of everyone globally. I have said for a number of quarters that the next pandemic, the exposure that looks like a virus is cyber related because it has no geographic or time bound to it. We've seen a number of events over the recent years that give a glimmer of that. So, it is complicated. And the product has to evolve to recognize that kind of exposure, both on the frequency side and the severity side. And we have a fabulous team of cyber experts who've been doing this for quite a while. You got to, at the same time, be humble and know what you don't know and not over imagine, there's a lot of basis risk in it, even the cyber -- all the cyber experts are constantly surprised with new day zero events and techniques that emerge. And so, I can, on that, wrap it up, by saying, I can think of no one better to help lead along with our cyber experts than Mike Kessler. Operator : We will take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Evan, I'm going to assume in this question that if the industry was putting up underwriting results like Chubb, would be experiencing great increases to the jury [ph] that we are. So hoping you could talk a little bit about, maybe on the technology side the proprietary differences that allow underperformance -- sorry, underwriting outperformance relative to peers and ambitions maybe over the next couple of years to spend that? Evan Greenberg : Be careful of one thing, Meyer. Everybody has a different mix of business, a different book of business. Chubb, we have a balance between middle market and small in the United States and around the globe and large account and specialty risk, E&S, we're very large E&S player. We're very large, maybe the global leader in major account business. And then, we're a top-tier middle market company. All of that goes, and I was pretty clear that the level of rate increase we're getting varies by the market area. And then, beyond that, it varies by product area, and I gave you some sense of that. We have years and years of data. And it's not just data. It's been turned into information, and it has taken us a long time to do that and to do it properly. And so the management information flow here is so well connected between the reserving process and the rate making process in a granular, real-time way and updated based on loss and loss cost trends and actual in virtually real time, without a lot of lag. And it is something that all of us at all levels have great transparency and availability to access and that links back with then how we look at what business are we quoting, what business are we binding and at what terms and conditions? It doesn't mean that it's all perfect and we don't make mistakes. And given loss cost and real world about the loss environment that we don't get surprised on the margin because things change swiftly here or there, of course, but we react quickly. And finally, what I'd say to you is it's no different than this conversation that goes on about, well, how come you haven't produced more margin? Well, we're producing outstanding margin and margin improvement. It\u2019s that -- look at our reserving policy. It's that we recognize bad news most immediately, and we recognize good news over time. The commercial P&C business, particularly the casualty areas are not for optimists, and I've said this many times. And by the way, the notion of prior period reserve development, well, that's a strength. And that's part of being prudent on recognizing slowly when you're conservative and cautious about a loss cost environment. So, it's the data, it's the technology, it's the knowledge of the people, and it's the management policies and practices consistently that make the difference. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's very helpful\u2026 Evan Greenberg : We play for the long term. We're not trying to make some short-term killing in our business. And that's not what it's about. And by the way, we run the Company first for our customers. And we run it to deliver them a product at the right price, not take advantage of them in any way. Meyer Shields : No, that's clear. Thank you. Second question, looking back after 9/11, I guess, the industry basically reassessed its expectation of terrorists domestically. Are some underwriters thinking differently about political risk in the United States? Is that a real world issue from an underwriting standpoint? Evan Greenberg : Well, there isn't really a political risk insurance market in the United States. The United States, given rule of law and given credit ratings, there has not been true political risk losses in the United States. And true political risk exposure from what we classically deliver as a product outside the United States in political risk. And, God help us. I don't expect that to change. Now, you could ask the question on the investment side of the portfolio, and do we see political risk? I think we see more credit-related risk than we do at this time political risk. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Ms. Bayer, at this time, I will turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thanks everyone for dialing in this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Thanks. And have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I\u2019d like to turn the call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you. Welcome everyone to our March 31, 2021 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market condition, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Phil Bancroft, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had a really good start to the year, highlighted by excellent premium revenue growth globally, powered by our commercial businesses, double-digit commercial P&C rate increases and expanding underwriting margins, leading the record ex-cat underwriting results and simply world class margins. It was an active quarter for natural catastrophes due primarily to the winter storm losses in Texas. Though even with that, we produced a really good calendar year combined ratio, which speaks to our improved risk adjusted underwriting returns. The public P&C combined ratio was 91.8% and included catastrophe losses of 9.1 percentage points, compared with 3.3% last year. The current accident year combined without cats was 85.2%, compared to 87.5% prior year. The 2.3 percentage point improvement was made up of 0.1% loss ratio with the balance related to the expense ratio. Adjusted net investment income in the quarter was $930 million, up about 1.5%. That excludes private equity gains, which most other companies include. On that basis, investment income grew 50%. In sum, core operating income in the quarter of $2.52 per share was down $40 million from prior year to $1.1 billion, while net income of $2.3 billion was up significantly over prior year\u2019s $252 million. Phil will have more to say about the expense ratio, cat, prior period development, investment income and book value. Turning to growth and the rate environment, P&C premium were up 9.7% globally, with commercial premiums up 15.6% and consumer lines down 2.5. Foreign exchange had a positive impact on growth of 1.6 points. The consumer lines result included negative growth in global A&H, flat revenue in international personal lines and about 2.5% underlying growth in North America personal lines. We continue to experience a very strong commercial P&C pricing environment globally and based on what we see today, I\u2019m confident these conditions will endure. Chubb was built in all aspects over years to capitalize on these conditions. In North America, commercial P&C premiums grew almost 15%, new business was up 21.7% and renewal retentions remain strong at 95% on a premium basis. In North America, major accounts and specialty business, net premiums written grew about 17.5% or about 15% excluding year-over-year impact of large structured transactions. Our middle market and small commercial business grew over 11%. Overall rate increases in North America commercial were up by 14.5%, while loss costs are trending up about 5.5%. That would varies up or down depending upon line of business. Let me give you a better sense of the rate environment. In major accounts, risk management related primary casualty rates were up almost 8%, general casualty rates were up 34.5% and varied by category of casualty, property rates were up nearly 20% and financial lines rates were up almost 21%. In our E&S wholesale business, property was up 15.5%, casualty and financial lines rates were up 25%. In our middle market business, rates for property were up 16%, casualty was up 12% excluding comp, with comp up 1% and financial lines rates were up 18.5%. In our international general insurance operations, commercial premiums grew over 20% on a published basis or 15% in constant dollar. International retail commercial grew about 17.5% and our London wholesale business grew 38.5%. Retail commercial growth varied by region with premiums up over 26.5% in Asia-Pac, 22.5% in Europe, with equally strong growth in both the U.K. and on the Continent. Our Latin America commercial lines business returned to growth in the quarter with premiums up 4.7%. Internationally, like in the U.S., in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In overseas gen, rates were up about 14.5%, with a loss cost trend of 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. Rates were up 14% in our international retail business and 20% in our London wholesale business. Keep in mind, these outstanding commercial insurance growth rates in the U.S. and overseas were achieved in spite of the headwinds we face from negative exposure growth due to reduced business activity. On the other hand, consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to be impacted by the pandemic\u2019s effects on consumer-related activities. During the quarter, there were signs of recovery beginning. Breaking consumer down between A&H and personal lines, our international personal lines business produced modest growth of 1.2% on a published basis, fundamentally flat constant dollar. While our international A&H business shrank 3.7%. Travel globally, both business and consumer related remains depressed and that hits A&H hard. While our direct marketing and group employee benefits A&H business is beginning to pick up modestly. If we exclude the travel business, our internationally A&H business grew almost 2% on a published basis. We expect growth to continue to improve as the year goes along, though predicting the continued impact of the pandemic in Asia, Latin America and Europe is difficult. Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 2.5% excluding reinsurance reinstatements, auto renewal credits in California and wildfire exposure related cancellations. As I have said before, this outstanding franchise is about customers who choose Chubb for the service and richness of coverage and are willing to pay for them. These clients segments which are at the heart of what we do grew 8% in the quarter. Overall portfolio retention remains strong in high net worth at over 94%. We achieve positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 11% in our homeowners portfolio. Looking ahead, we have been and are taking continued action to shape this portfolio. To that point, we\u2019re taking ongoing action to reduce our wildfire exposure in parts of California as a consequence of our inability to achieve adequate rate and terms for the coverage. This will have an impact for the remainder of the year of about $15 million or about 1.25% impact on our growth rate. Lastly, in our Asia focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 18.5% in the quarter. In sum, as I have said, the past few quarters are longer. We\u2019re in a harder firming market for commercial P&C in most of the world. The rate environment and my judgment is a rational and necessary response to years of industry under pricing and a more uncertain risk environment today, driven by climate change, litigation, environment and cyber related exposures. Given our years of data and analytics capabilities and underwriting knowhow, we know what rate we need in order to achieve an adequate risk adjusted rate of return from underwriting and that is the objective. And it is a relentless focus, though we\u2019re never perfect. Some lines are there. Others have a way to go. Virtually all of our commercial P&C lines of business continued to achieve rates that exceed loss cost and so margin continued to improve. As you can see, we\u2019re off to an outstanding start to the year. My colleagues and I are confident in our ability to grow our business and continue to expand margins. And as I said, I expect as the year progresses, our sizable consumer business will return to growth. Our organization is focused, it\u2019s mission driven, the quality of Chubb service and consistency is a widely recognized differentiator. They are the wellhead of our reputation. We are leaning in to the current favorable underwriting conditions and capitalizing wherever we can get paid adequately to assume risk and volatility. We are growing exposure. Our people are energized and focused, and we have all of the capabilities in place to grow our company profitably, while increasing shareholder value. In light of recent events concerning the Hartford and for the sake of absolute clarity, I want to reiterate once again, our enduring views concerning M&A and capital management. We look at lots of deals every year, different sizes, small to large, different geographies and product areas, and we pull the trigger infrequently. We have lots of optionality. We have made 17 acquisitions over the past 15 years and have an excellent track record of advancing the company\u2019s capabilities, while creating shareholder value. Our approach is steady and consistent. We are extremely patient, disciplined and the money is not burning a hole in our pocket. If we believe a transaction will advance our strategy and further what we are building organically and is good for shareholders, we won\u2019t hesitate to pull the trigger. As regards surplus capital, we\u2019re again very consistent. We hold capital for risk and growth, both organic and non-organic. Beyond that, we return surplus capital to shareholders. We are highly confident about our future and wealth creating -- creation prospects and we approached the Hartford from that position of strength. This was another opportunity to create additional value and would not distract us from capitalizing on an organic growth opportunity. With that said, the purpose of today\u2019s call is to discuss our first quarter financials and our company\u2019s business. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Phil and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Evan. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong. Our balance sheet includes a $121 billion AA rated portfolio of cash and investment assets. We have over $74 billion in capital, stemming from our superior operating and investing performance. Our operating cash flow remains very strong and was $2.1 billion for the quarter. Among the capital related actions in the quarter, we returned $871 million to shareholders, including $352 million in dividends and $519 million in share repurchases. Adjusted pretax investment income for the quarter of $930 million was higher than our estimated range and benefited from increased corporate bond call activities. Well, there are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income. We expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.8%, respectively, for the quarter. Separately, as Evan mentioned, we continued to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses. Instead of net investment income, as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter would have added 3.1 percentage points to core operating ROE. Book and tangible book value per shares decreased by 0.4% and 0.6%, respectively, for the quarter due to unrealized losses of $1.9 billion after-tax in our investment portfolio from rising interest rates. This loss was tempered by adjusted realized gains of $1.2 billion after-tax, mainly from the mark-to-market gains in private and public equities, and in our variable annuity reinsurance portfolio. At March 31st, our investment portfolio remains in an unrealized gains position of $2.8 billion after-tax. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $700 million from severe weather related events globally, including $657 million of losses from the storms in the U.S. We had favorable prior period developments in the quarter of $192 million pretax or $156 million after-tax. The favorable development is with approximately 20% in long tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 80% in short tail lines. There was no change to the previously reported aggregate P&C COVID-19 losses, the majority of which remain as incurred but not reported. For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion and are paid to incurred ratio was 77%. The P&C administrative expense ratio of 8.6% in the quarter improved by 70 basis points over the prior year, about half related to one-time items that we don\u2019t expect to repeat. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.5% for the quarter, which is within our expected range of 15% to 17% for the year. I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you, Phil. At this time, we are happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll go first to Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning and congrats on the nice quarter and Evan appreciate it the time here. I guess I want to focus first on you sound still very bullish on commercial lines and exposure growth you want to push for. You said, last quarter commercial lines will lag this quarter, you\u2019re confident that conditions will continue on? I guess, with your numbers that you gave on pricing and loss trends, there still quite a bit of a gap there, that\u2019s good, a little bit narrower than what you said prior. But I guess two-part question is, how adequate are current rates across the Board? It\u2019s hard to imagine they\u2019re not? And then, I guess, you didn\u2019t say you want to push for exposure growth still, so is commercial lines still the place to push given what might be a narrowing gap and the rate versus loss trend? Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s funny how people think about rate right now. And this obsession with our rate increases decelerating the rate of increase decelerating, accelerating, where is it and nothing is [ph] trying to achieve. You\u2019re trying to achieve a risk adjusted return, which translates to a combined ratio that is at least adequate to return a good risk adjusted return. So let\u2019s call that, 15% or it depends on the line of business, let\u2019s call it 15%. And as you approach that, as you achieve it, do you need to keep increasing rates? So you ask yourself that question. And you need rates to remain there, you got to achieve at least loss cost. We\u2019re achieving. We have more and more of our portfolio and its proprietary, so I will not go into what percentages of the portfolio are at a proper risk adjusted return in terms of combined ratios on a policy year and accident your basis. We measure both. And with that, in total, look at the overall level of rate increase. And look at the margin between the rate and exposure and loss cost. Now with that, let me go a step further for you, because of this obsession about this. When I look at the third quarter and fourth quarter last year, and I measure the first quarter against it right now, and I\u2019m taking the time on this question, because I know all of your colleagues or most of them have this question on their mind. When I look at the level of rate increase this quarter measured against prior, okay? Property in North America in aggregate got rate increases in the mid-teens, which is about 2 point to 3 points lower than it was in -- when I look at the average of the third quarter and fourth quarter last year. Property has been getting rate on, rate on, rate on, rate. When I look at primary casualty, the rates are up. They\u2019re higher than they were on the average. When I look at excess and umbrella, the rate of increase is flat, with the average of the quarters. When I look at financial lines, the rate of increase is flat with prior quarters. When I look at marine, it\u2019s up. When I look at aviation, it\u2019s flat to down. When I do this internationally kind of the same trend, property down 2 points to 3 points, the rate of increase from what it was the other two quarters. Primary casualty is flat. Excess and umbrella the rate of increase is flat. Financial line is up. And marine is down. So, no, sorry, marine is up and aviation is down a little bit. So you know what, I think that gives you guys as much color as I can give you and to answer that question that from every angle I can that I know is on everyone\u2019s mind. You know what, the conditions are excellent. Thank you very much for the question, Mike. Michael Phillips : Okay. No. Thanks. Yeah. Thank you. That\u2019s helpful. Conditions are excellent. So that lead to this ones, frankly, marine question I didn\u2019t ask, Evan, but I am curious to hear what you can say. Not even asking about [inaudible], specifically at all. But just in general, clearly, there was some capital to be deployed there. And as you said, not burning a hole in your pocket, you\u2019re very infrequently posed for entries only. If something like that is off the table and then growth in the conditions are still pretty right. I guess how should we think about where to go from here for maybe another capital deployment round of authorization versus more organic or just kind of what can we expect for what was possibly can be used there and how it might be used in the near-term? Evan Greenberg : Well, you can imagine Michael is steady as she goes. We have clear minds and we are at rest. We adopt our buybacks from a $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion, and we will actively resume that. We had to take a pause during the -- this episode with Hartford and beyond that steady as she goes. We got capital for risk and opportunity and we are patient people. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you very much. I appreciate. Congrats. Evan Greenberg : Thank you very much Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : Good morning. I don\u2019t want this to count as a question, but I believe, Phil, this is going to be your last earnings call, if I\u2019m correct. Well, congratulations on your retirement. Phil Bancroft : Thank you very much. With by the way number 78. Evan Greenberg : He is going over the wall, right? Phil Bancroft : Well, that\u2019s\u2026 Greg Peters : Number 78. Yeah. Not to use. Yeah. I knew you guys. Phil Bancroft : Yeah. Yeah. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Greg Peters : Yeah. Phil Bancroft : Thank you. Greg Peters : I knew I\u2019d be -- I knew that would be an issue. Phil Bancroft : And remember I\u2019m not here with me, it\u2019s like dog here. Oh, I would say\u2026 Greg Peters : Yeah. Phil Bancroft : \u2026 at all. Greg Peters : Yeah. Phil Bancroft : You know how old you look. Greg Peters : Well, the rumors about working for you are epic. So I\u2019m sure it\u2019s been good time. Phil Bancroft : I don\u2019t know what you are talking about. I don\u2019t know what\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Like a just rumors. Greg Peters : So, one of the areas that you spent time in previous calls talking about is the expense ratio, because it has -- it showed improvement last year, because of in part, some COVID related teeny savings and things like that. And then, it\u2019s still seems like it\u2019s on a general pathway of improvement. So I was wondering, perhaps, if you can give us an updated view. When we look at these other companies that we follow, most of them try and map out of between a 40-basis-point to 70-basis-point operational improvement in your expense ratio year in and year out? I\u2019m wondering if you can just give us an update a view on your expense ratio? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Most of them are bloated. Look at our expense ratio in absolute terms versus others our operating expense ratio. And North America is in the single digits and continuing to head marginally lower and it will through efficiencies, which I have talked about numerous times that with technology and in all forms, so I won\u2019t go into it in great detail, but analytics, robotics, straight through processing, et cetera. We are on track to continue to drive efficiencies in the operations. And the same in overseas, general the difference there is, you\u2019re across 50 some odd countries. And so by its nature, you have a different expense structure and it continues to improve. So we\u2019re growing our commercial -- our P&C business, the commercial businesses at a rate far in excess of growing operating expense, operating expenses of marginally. So we\u2019re leveraging against that. Both exposure and policy count is up. But you\u2019re also got the added benefit, which drives the ratio down of simply price increase that feeds in there also, It runs a lower acquisition cost then does the consumer lines business, but it runs a higher loss ratio. That\u2019s just axiomatic and true, but that business will continue to operate in the range that it\u2019s in that you see right now, up or down a couple of tenths of a percent in my mind as we look forward. The consumer businesses will come back. And as they come back, they have that higher acquisition cost, the operating expense, so the internal expense ratio will go down, because you will have more volume returning against it. But the acquisition ratio, which will remain steady within the line, it will become a greater mix of our total and so that\u2019ll go the other way. It\u2019s just natural. And -- but that business then runs a lower loss ratio, the margins are excellent as you know. So maybe that gives you the color you\u2019re looking for. Greg Peters : Indeed. Thanks. And my follow-up question, boy, so many different areas I could go on. But I\u2019m going to focus on operations. You said in your prepared remarks, that loss cost trend is running around just about 5 points across the book. And then during your comments and then your response to the previous question, you talked about really some --really robust rate, actions being taken across certain lines of business like general casualty, financial lines, things like that? Should I think about the loss cost trend in those lines is running higher, because of the rate you\u2019re able to achieve or is that just an industry loss cost trend that you\u2019re able to get the rate you\u2019re getting? Evan Greenberg : Let\u2019s see if I answer it this way for you. The marketplace in terms of rate is striving -- the marketplace, because you operate within the marketplace, is striving for two things. And that is you have those who have a hole to fill, because they have deficiency in lines of business. Remember, the industry operates like a giant retro. And then they also need rate for adequacy today. That\u2019s the marketplace. If you have operated at adequacy along the way, you don\u2019t have that first part that hold the film and achieving market rate, you\u2019re achieving better than adequate and not benefits. You will see we\u2019re in a -- we\u2019re certainly in an active loss cost period when you remove the transient impact of COVID. And so we\u2019ll see how it all plays in terms of a margin. We play things conservatively. But we are receiving rate that ensures the portfolio will achieve adequacy in terms of risk adjusted rate of return across the book and if we have more than that, well, that\u2019ll just speak for itself over time. Greg Peters : Got it. Thanks for the answers. Evan Greenberg : That\u2019s the best I can give you. Greg Peters : Understood. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Evan I just wanted to follow-up a little bit on the loss cost trend in North America commercial. It sounds like that ticked up a bit to 5.5%. Sounds like it\u2019s been ticking up, I guess, it is obviously a minor detail, given the amount of rate that you\u2019re getting and continuing to earn in above trend. But wondering if you could just talk about what you\u2019re seeing that\u2019s driving that increase? I know there\u2019s a lot of moving pieces and mix and everything else, but just sort of wondering if maybe you can just elaborate on what was driving the increase in the loss trend? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. And my god, you\u2019re looking at about 0.5 point change. So, let\u2019s just keep it in perspective. You have a couple of things. So in the short tail lines, you have non-modeled cat loss that is on an accelerated trend. Everyone sees it. You know that. I\u2019ll stop -- I\u2019ll move on from there, but that finds its way into your -- if you\u2019re prudent in your expected loss cost. Secondly, on the casualty side, given the litigation environment and across different lines of business, we have watched and have talked about it endlessly. That it is the loss cost environment there is not benign and so as we always relentlessly study our trends across each class, we reflected over a period of time in how we view loss cost and we react very quickly, particularly if there\u2019s any bad news, we react very slowly to goodness. And so it\u2019s -- those two that are conspire between short and long tail. David Motemaden : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Was there anything in the quarter or, I guess, some of the courts started to reopen? Was there anything specifically on the litigation environment that you saw during the quarter or it\u2019s just more reflection? Evan Greenberg : No. David, no news in a quarter. We just do study that we look at -- we\u2019re looking at years past and trending forward. When you think about these things, they don\u2019t -- you don\u2019t react, the loss cost trends aren\u2019t based upon news of this or that in any given quarter. They\u2019re based on a more stable period of time and a much bigger data set obviously. David Motemaden : Yes. Got it. That makes sense. Thanks for that. And then I wanted to switch gears a little bit to the international life business. Another good quarter strong sales there, up 14% constant currency. I was hoping maybe you could dive into the different regions between Asia and LatAm and what\u2019s driving success there in each region? And maybe just stepping back a bit and just talk about the opportunity here and if you think M&A is the lever that that you\u2019re evaluating to maybe increase scale in any of these markets? Evan Greenberg : So, great question. The business is overwhelmingly Asia. Latin America, think predominantly, Chile, and Banco de Chile and our partnership with them. And Chile is a great market, but Chile has truly been suffering from COVID and the lockdown. And while it\u2019s a very good business, it has some headwind in terms of growth related to that, but it\u2019s coming back and that\u2019ll continue to do very well, spent distribution, both branch and direct marketing related. It\u2019s more credit related type products and short-term than it is long-term product. Though there is a mix of that in the portfolio. When you go to Asia, the growth is coming predominantly right now and in this quarter, Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, Taiwan doing well and our business in Korea getting better, but it\u2019s small. And I don\u2019t know it\u2019ll take a while to cast shadow. What\u2019s not consolidated in those numbers, but we -- that we add as a line item, because we don\u2019t have over 50% yet, is the increase in Guantai [ph], which is doing well. And by the way, we are on our path and it\u2019s a very sensitive moment. So I don\u2019t want to talk about it much. But that will consolidate. I\u2019m confident we\u2019ll finish what we got to get done to -- be able to consolidate Guantai and that life business is growing well. So, the organic growth and those are agency-based businesses for the most part, with some direct marketing as well, particularly in Thailand and bank distribution in Taiwan. But if you look at Vietnam, Thailand, Hong Kong, China and those are predominantly -- those are agency businesses, where agency force is growing. These are long-term products. Guarantees are extremely low, like in the 1% to 2% range. And there\u2019s a healthy mix of savings and protection products. And that business is, we built it from dust predominantly and it\u2019s cast and a shadow. It\u2019s a few billion dollars now and I see great growth potential for that. As regards M&A, I made the statement. When I came to the end of my commentary, I said, we have lots of optionality. We have optionality, when we\u2019re looking at opportunity. What that means is across product lines, across geographies, across customer segments and that includes the life insurance business. And if we found the right thing and it was accretive to our strategy. That was good for shareholders. We wouldn\u2019t hesitate for a minute. Thanks for the question. David Motemaden : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. My first question is tying together some of the comments we\u2019ve heard throughout the call, just in terms of market conditions, Evan still seems pretty positive there? And then, as we think about the rest of this year, right, we\u2019ll have, the economy continues to improve, so exposure growth should pick up. So, as we think about your commercial businesses, both within the U.S. and internationally, given the dynamics of maybe some stabilization to slight deceleration in pricing, but\u2026 Evan Greenberg : What is the question Elyse? Elyse Greenspan : I guess the question is and trying to understand, should we think about pre -- as we think about premium growth within commercial? Should we think about that being stable relative to the Q1, and perhaps, even improving as we get the economic improvement on picking up from here? Evan Greenberg : I don\u2019t -- there\u2019s nothing on the horizon that I see that I -- that tells me we\u2019re going to really decelerate in the commercial area. It varies by businesses as we look at it. But we\u2019re feeling very good about it. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Then my second question. Evan, as I was reading your annual letter, you may have mentioned of social inflation, throughout the call, we\u2019ve kind of brought it off in terms of just what we\u2019re seeing today. But there\u2019s obviously the issues that the industry is dealing with it goes back many, many decades and I was just hoping to kind of get your update as you kind of elaborate on some of the what you mentioned in your annual report, as you guys think about some of the kind of the looming issues that the industry, yourselves and others are dealing with today? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. It\u2019s a -- it\u2019s not a new issue to us. We\u2019ve been on top of it for a while, the reviver statutes. They produce lots of notices. They then start to ripen and you get fax. And you are match -- you\u2019re able to match them up against coverages that were in force at a period of time and as they do, we recognize any life of we have been and continue to recognize liabilities that we have against those and that is all baked into our published loss ratios that you see. The reviver statutes have been open for a period of time and so in most all jurisdictions, the reported notices of circumstances have decelerated tremendously from when they first opened up. There are some states that are continuing to consider opening up reviver statutes and there\u2019s, and so this is an event that the industry deals with over time, these things evolve over time. I might add, we\u2019re very sympathetic to those and it breaks your heart where you see the circumstances of children abused by adults sexually and were there for real. Then on the other side of the coin, the trial bar is a money making machine and there is -- that combined with new technologies of social media and litigation funding, they see it as another dog bowl they eat out of. And there is also a lot of suspect and specious behavior that is involved here. And our job is to tease out what\u2019s real and defend against anything that that we suspect is just for we\u2019ll got gain. Elyse Greenspan : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for the color, Evan, and I also just want to extend my congrats to Phil on his upcoming retirement. Evan Greenberg : Elyse was out also because he went over the wall. Phil Bancroft : Thank you, Elyse. Evan Greenberg : Thanks, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Yaron Kinar with Goldman Sachs. Yaron Kinar : Good morning, everybody. So I\u2019m a bit obsessive in my nature. So I hope you can indulge another question on rates. Okay. I just\u2026 Evan Greenberg : At least not asking me to be redundant, you\u2019re wrong. Don\u2019t ask me to do that. You will be\u2026 Yaron Kinar : I will try. Evan Greenberg : \u2026question though. Absolutely. With some odd there. Yaron Kinar : I will try. So your sub-market condition center. I think that we are seeing more lines achieving rate adequacy, as you pointed out. We\u2019re in third year of rate increases in excess of trends, interest rates have increased. So why wouldn\u2019t Chubb specifically or the industry more broadly be willing to give up more rate for volume as we look at the year? Evan Greenberg : Doesn\u2019t make any sense to me at this point? Look at combined ratios of most, look at the loss environment. And I\u2019ll tell you what, I think, the industry overall is not in a place where it has achieved adequate risk adjusted when you consider both things I talked about. And by the way, we are driving. I can\u2019t speak about the industry. But I\u2019ll tell you what Chubb is grow -- just look at it. Chubb is growing exposure. We\u2019re achieving rate and we are growing a lot of business. Because it\u2019s at prices that we think are adequate to produce an adequate risk adjusted return. Our new business was up over 20%. Well, and our renewal retentions are high. We\u2019re growing. We\u2019re growing market share, because the pricing is right. You\u2019re in on risk business. Pricing is an adequacy is where you start. That\u2019s as good as I can give you Yaron. Beyond that you\u2019re over thinking it. Yaron Kinar : No. That\u2019s very helpful. And clearly you guys are growing off a really large base to begin with. So, yeah, no, no, no other questions on that. I guess switching gears a little bit. We\u2019ve heard some talk about potential tax reform. I realize these are very early days here. But can you maybe share your views on corporate tax reform? It\u2019s potential impact on Chubb and Chubb positioning? Evan Greenberg : I -- You know what I -- I don\u2019t know enough. And we have both the corporate tax rate that that could go up. They are talking 21 going to 25 or 28. We\u2019ll see how that plays. And then, secondly, you\u2019ve got guilty and beat. And then you\u2019ve got the notion of a minimum global tax rate multilateral agreement with OECD. All of these plates are spinning. The green book is not yet out. That would tell us any detail of what\u2019s in the tax reform for -- the tax increase, heck, it\u2019s not a reform, proposal. And so we don\u2019t even know what the administration is yet proposing other than in headlines and so we really can\u2019t speculate at this point. We just don\u2019t know. When it comes out, we\u2019ll have a better sense and then it\u2019s got to run the gauntlet in Congress and we\u2019ll see from there. I can\u2019t speculate at this point, Yaron. Yaron Kinar : Fair enough. I appreciate the thoughts. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thanks. A couple of them here quickly for you, Evan. The first one, if I look at the rate activity that you\u2019ve been generating the last several quarters in North America commercial and then 5.5 % loss cost inflation. Now you do the math and you get a lot more on the line loss ratio improvement in your booking right now. Is that because of your just conservatism with respect to your potential social inflation trends or is there something else that we\u2019re just not thinking about? Evan Greenberg : Brian, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking about. I don\u2019t know what you guys are thinking about. But I -- we have always operated the company conservatively and I\u2019m not going to -- I\u2019m going to stop right there. Brian Meredith : Okay. And then the second question, just curious if I look at\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I will say this to you, let\u2019s say, we produced over 2 points of margin improvement. It was an accident year combined ratio of 85.2%, My God, world class. Brian Meredith : No doubt. I completely agree. The second one just sticking with North American commercial, written premium -- net written premium growth really attractive in the quarter, gross written premium growth also kind of increased, but clearly, you\u2019re seeing some benefits from just lower seated premium, any change in kind of the reinsurance strategy, as we head into 2021? Evan Greenberg : So, not a change of strategy. Not a change of strategy there. We have -- it varies by line of business. There\u2019s mixed within there. And then there is also within some lines of business, we have increased our net appetite. Brian Meredith : Got you. Make sense. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : And one more here, we have better spread of risk. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We\u2019ll go next to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Hey. Thanks. Good morning. My question was just on -- a similar way, which from the statement that you guys put out last week. There\u2019s something for some clarification. There\u2019s a comment, you said, and this is involving the Hartford past, your transaction would have been engagement coming from the Hartford on the terms of our last proposal. I guess my question is, is that just a general comment about your desire to do friendly M&A or are you trying to say something about that being your last proposal? Evan Greenberg : Look, the chapter with the Hartford is closed. We have moved along. And beyond that, Ryan, I\u2019m not going to now engage and talk about past events. Ryan Tunis : Understood. That\u2019s right. And then, in terms of like, thinking about M&A now, I guess, it\u2019s been five years since Chubb, back then, I think, the big gating item was you didn\u2019t want to dilute tangible book value per share. I\u2019m just trying to understand as you think about M&A targets, has any of your thinking evolved in terms of, what\u2019s most important financially, the earnings accretion is it still, mainly, or accretion at least into tangible book value per share. Evan Greenberg : First of all, Ryan, with all the respect, your comment about tangible book is a nonsense comment. It was dilutive to begin with to tangible and then it\u2026 Ryan Tunis : Okay. Evan Greenberg : \u2026 forward [ph] it\u2019s way, way out of it. Ryan Tunis : Almost 29%. Evan Greenberg : And so I don\u2019t know what, how you\u2019re thinking about it, it\u2019s hard to do M&A that isn\u2019t dilutive to tangible and then the question is, is -- in the first moment and then the question is, is how creative is it and how quickly do you return. So, with all due respect, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re thinking clearly. Number two, let me make one --I\u2019m not going to go into Chubb\u2019s metrics of what\u2019s most important, that\u2019s not important here, and by the way, every deal has its own signature. And so you want it to fit on a bumper sticker and it doesn\u2019t work that way. But I\u2019m going to make one comment about M&A today. EPS accretion, when you use a lot of cash, this immediate lift, that\u2019s really easy. And I don\u2019t miss that one, whatsoever. None of us do. So that\u2019s the easiest metric. That\u2019s not what it\u2019s about when you measure wealth creation value. Thank you very much for the question. Ryan Tunis : Thanks for that. Operator : We\u2019ll take our last question from Meyer Shields, KBW. Meyer Shields : Thanks. Two really quick ones I think. One, Evan, should we infer anything significant about reinsurance pricing from the fact that those written premiums were down year-over-year. Evan Greenberg : No. Meyer Shields : Okay. Second question. I was hoping you could comment on non-travel accident health pricing. Evan Greenberg : On accident health pricing. Meyer Shields : Yes. With non-travel. Evan Greenberg : Non-travel. Yeah. It\u2019s a -- Meyer, it\u2019s a -- it\u2019s -- remember we don\u2019t do a lot of health insurance, it\u2019s supplemental health and accident business. So, it\u2019s fundamentally stable and actually up a few points. Rates have been moving up particularly in the corporate travel area, the commercial business. Meyer Shields : Okay. Evan Greenberg : And in our direct marketing\u2026 Meyer Shields : Okay. Evan Greenberg : \u2026 business, it\u2019s very steady. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : And at this time, there are no further questions. Karen Beyer : Thanks, everyone, for your time and attention this morning, and we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : This does conclude today\u2019s conference. We thank you for your participation.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the conference over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our June 30, 2021, Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company's performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the number Chubb had an outstanding quarter, highlighted by record operating earnings and underwriting results, expanded margins and double-digit premium revenue growth globally, the best in over 15 years, powered by commercial P&C and supported by continued robust commercial P&C rate movement. Chubb was built for these conditions. We have averaged double-digit commercial P&C growth over the past 10 quarters. The breadth of our product and reach, combined with our execution-oriented underwriting culture, and our reputation for service and consistency enable us to fully capitalize on opportunity globally, and conditions such as these size and scale are our friend. Core operating income in the quarter was $1.62 billion or $3.62 per share, again, both records. On both the reported and current accident year ex-cat basis, underwriting results in the quarter were simply world-class. The published P&C combined ratio was 85.5% and current accident year was 85.4% compared to 87.4% prior year. The 2 percentage points of margin improvement were almost entirely loss ratio related.  Current accident year underwriting income of $1.2 billion was up 27%. While on the other side of the balance sheet, adjusted net investment income of $945 million, also record, was up nearly 9.5% from prior year. Peter will have more to say about cat and prior period development, investment income and book value. Turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums were up 15.5% globally, with commercial premiums excluding agriculture, up nearly 21%. The 15.5% growth for the quarter and 12.6% for the first six months were the strongest growth we have seen since 2004. Growth in the quarter was extremely broad-based, with contributions from virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally, from those serving large companies, to midsize, small, and most regions of the world and distribution channels. We continue to experience a needed and robust commercial P&C pricing environment in most all important regions of the world, with continued year-on-year improvement in rate to exposure on the business we wrote, both new and renewal. Based on what we see today, I'm confident these conditions will continue. In North America, Commercial P&C net premiums grew over 16%. New business was up 24% and renewal retention remained strong at 96.5% on a premium basis. In our North America major accounts and specialty commercial business, net premiums grew over 13%, with each division, major accounts, Westchester and Bermuda having its largest quarter in history in terms of written business and the standout was our middle market and small commercial division, which had the biggest quarter in about 20 years, driven by record new business growth and strong retentions. Overall rates increased in North America commercial by a strong 13.5%, which is on top of a 14. 7% rate increase last year for the same business, making the two-year cumulative increase over 30%. And remember, in North America, rates have been rising for almost four years. However, they have exceeded loss costs for only about two years now. Loss costs are currently trending about 5.5% and vary up or down depending upon line of business. General commercial lines loss costs for short-tail classes are trending around 4%, while long-tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%. Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement by division and line in North America. In major accounts, rates increased in the quarter by about 16% on top of almost 18% prior year for the same business, making the two-year cumulative increase over 36%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up almost 9&. General rates casualty rates were up 27% and varied by category of casualty. Property rates were up nearly 12% and financial lines rates were up almost 20%. In our E&S wholesale business, the cumulative two-year rate increase was 39% comprised of an increase of circa 18% this quarter on top of 18% prior year second quarter. Property rates were up about 16.5%, casualty was up about $21 million, and financial lines rates were up over 21%. In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter over 9.5% on top of over 9% last year, making the two-year cumulative increase 20%. Rates for property were up over 10.5%. Casualty rates were up 11%, excluding workers' comp, and comp rates were down at about 0.5%. Financial lines rates were up over 17.5% in our middle market business. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew an astonishing 33% on a published basis or 24% in constant dollars. International retail commercial grew 27% and our London wholesale business grew 60%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region, with premiums up 36.5% in our European division, with equally strong growth in both the UK and on the continent. Asia-Pacific was up over 29%, while our Latin America commercial lines business grew over 14.5%. Internationally, like in the US, in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail commercial P&C business, the two-year cumulative rate increase was 35%, comprised of increases this quarter and prior year of 16% each. Two territories in particular, the U.K. and Australia, stand out in terms of rate achievement. In our U.K. business, rates increased in the quarter by 18%, on top of a 26% rate increase prior year for the same business, making the 2-year cumulative increased 48%. In Australia, the 2-year cumulative rate was 42%, comprised of an increase of 23% this quarter, on top of 16% prior year. In our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 13%, on top of a 20% rate increase prior year, so making the 2-year cumulative 36%. International markets began firming later in the US and again, like with the US, rates has exceeded loss costs for about 2 years now. Outside the US, loss costs are currently trending 3%, and so that varies by class of business and country. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic effects on consumer-related activities. Our international consumer business grew 13% in the quarter, and that's on a published basis. It grew 5% in constant dollars. Breaking that down for you, international personal lines grew 20% on a published basis, while our international A&H grew 6.5%, but it was essentially flat in constant dollar. Within our A&H book, a nascent recovery in our leisure travel business outside of Asia is beginning to result in growth, although passenger travel activity is still well below pre-pandemic levels in both our group A&H business, with its employer-based benefits and our consumer-focused direct marketing business. Premiums were up mid-single digits, still impacted by the pandemic, but beginning to improve. Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up over 2.5%. Non-renewals in California and COVID auto-related renewal credits had almost 1 point of negative impact on growth in the quarter. Our TruNiNetworkh [ph] client segment, the heart of our business, grew almost 8% in the quarter. Overall retention remains strong at over 94%. And we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 13% in our homeowners portfolio. Loss cost inflation in homeowners is currently running about 11%. Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits, were up 55% in the quarter, while net premiums in our Global Re business grew over 32%. In sum, we continue to capitalize on a hard or firming market for commercial P&C in most areas of the world. Both growth and margin expansion are 2 trends that I am confident will continue. Our organization is firing on all cylinders. We're growing our business and our exposures, and we continue to expand our margins. Our leadership employees are energized and driven to win. I couldn't be more proud or humbled by the results they are producing, and I want to thank them all publicly for their efforts. I am confident in our ability to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value. I'll now turn the call over to Peter. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan, and good morning. First, I'd like to acknowledge Phil Bancroft's almost 20 years of service and leadership with the company. I'm excited to be in my new position and build upon all that he has achieved -- all he has achieved under his leadership, and I'm honored to be leading the very strong team he has built going forward. Turning to our results, we completed the quarter in an excellent financial position and continue to build upon our balance sheet strength. We have over $75 billion in capital and a AA-rated portfolio of cash and invested assets that now exceeds $123 billion. Our record underwriting and investment performance produced strong positive operating cash flow of $3.1 billion for the quarter. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $2.3 billion to shareholders, including $1.9 billion in share repurchases and $352 million in dividends. Through the six months ended June 30, we returned $3.1 billion, including $2.4 billion in share repurchases and dividends of $704 million. We recently announced a one-time incremental share repurchase program of up to $5 billion through June 2022. As Evan said, adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was a record $945 million, higher than our estimated range, benefiting from increased corporate bond call activity and higher private equity distributions. We increased the size of our investment portfolio by $2.4 billion in the quarter after buybacks due to strong operating cash flow and high portfolio returns, including $694 million in pretax unrealized gains from falling interest rates. At June 30, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $3.3 billion after-tax. During this challenging investment return environment, we will remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy and do not expect to materially adjust the portfolio asset allocation over the near-term. We will be selective but active, and will continue to focus on risk-adjusted returns and we will not reach for yields. There are a number of factors that impact the variability in investment income, including the amount of operating cash flow available to invest, the reinvestment rate environment and the assumed prepayment speeds on our corporate bond calls and variability around private equity distributions. Based on the current interest rate environment and a normalized long calls in private equity distributions, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. Our annualized core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 11.5% and 17.7%, respectively, for the quarter. And as a reminder, we continue to present the fair value mark on our private equity funds outside of core operating income as realized gains and losses instead of net investment income as other companies do. The gain from the fair value mark this quarter of $712 million after-tax, we have increased core operating ROE by five percentage points to 16.5% and core operating income by $1.59 per share to $5.21. Book and tangible book value per share increased by 4.2% and 5%, respectively from the first quarter. Due to record core operating income and realized and unrealized gains of $1.4 billion after-tax in our investment portfolio, which again primarily came from declining rates and mark-to-market gains on private equities. The increase in book value per share also reflects the impact of returning over $2 billion to shareholders in the quarter. Our pretax P&C net catastrophe losses for the quarter were $280 million, principally from severe US weather-related events. There was no overall change to our aggregate COVID-19 loss estimate. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $268 million. This included a charge from molestation claims of $68 million pretax compared with $259 million in the prior year. Excluding this charge, we had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $336 million pretax, split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior and 70% short-tail lines. For the quarter, our net loss reserves increased $1.1 billion in constant dollars and our paid-to-incurred ratio was 80%. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.8% for the quarter, which is within our expected 17% for the year. Now I'll turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning Evan and thanks for taking the question. First question is on growth, I guess, maybe specifically North America commercial lines. Are you pleased with the growth there relative to the rate you're getting? And I guess, what I'm implying is how much of the growth you're getting is true market share gains versus just all rate? Peter Enns : Well, I think it's a serious combination of both. You just heard me provide you new business growth rates and strong renewal retention rates, and that means exposure growth. And that means in your part and gaining market share. And so all in, very, very strong growth, fundamental growth in the business. And by the way, actual exposure growth was negative in the quarter. And \u2013 but new business and renewal retention and rate well overcame that. You saw a 21% growth in commercial P&C. Michael Phillips : Okay. And sticking with North America commercial lines. As a core loss ratio relative to 1Q was up a little bit, and was there some impact from portfolio transfer in the second quarter, or is that just a normal second quarter event that happened or what impact that was that in the quarter that maybe? Evan Greenberg : No, it's just normal. it's a normal quarter-on-quarter seasonalization. There wasn't some impact from LPT or that. And the mix of business changes quarter-on-quarter, and that's it. I think the thing you're more focused on is the year-on-year change, and it looks pretty strong. Michael Phillips : Yes, perfect. Okay. Thank you, Evan. Appreciate it and congrats on the quarter. Evan Greenberg : Thanks a lot. Operator : We will now take a question from David Motemaden with Evercore. David Motemaden : Hi thanks. Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on that last question, Evan, just on the North American commercial loss ratio. How much of the 2.4 points year-over-year improvement was driven by mix versus rate in excess of trend? Evan Greenberg : Sure. You're really asking me the question, I want to help you with it, of LPTs and the impact of writing so much LPT last year versus this year, which can inflate loss ratio last year versus this year. If you adjust for the LPT impact and a little bit of other onetime noise, year-on-year combined ratio, adjusting for that, improved 1.8 points. It was 0.7 on expense and it was 1.1 loss ratio related. David Motemaden : Got it. That's perfect. That's exactly what I was looking for. Thanks. And that's good to see that accelerated a bit from the improvement last quarter. I guess just another question, just overall on the expense ratio. Maybe this is also for Peter. I think in the past, you've talked about some of the improvement being driven by some non-sustainable COVID-related impacts for T&E, things like that. Was it -- did that come back those one-time impacts, or are we still realizing some sort of benefit from that? Evan Greenberg : No, you're fundamentally looking overall at a pretty good run rate. And look, if things opened up more and as they open up more, there'll be more travel-related expense, a little more entertainment-related expense. We don't anticipate it to have a big impact. Still a pretty good run rate. And that's on the OpEx ratio. Remember, the acquisition ratio bounces around with mix of business. David Motemaden : Right. Yes. Perfect. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it David. Operator : Our next question will come from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : Good morning. So, the first question we'll focus on just the pricing commentary. You really laid out some very robust results in terms of price achievement, not only in the recent quarter, but really for the last -- almost two years. And in your press release, I think you said you're confident these market conditions will continue. So, Evan you know where I'm going to go with this, which is there's growing-- Evan Greenberg : Don't actually Greg, There's a lot, but I don't know where you're going. Go ahead. Greg Peters : Well, it's going to -- listen, there's a lot of rhetoric in the market that the rate environment is going to start to soften. And so where I'm going with it is from where you sit today, you're producing an 85% combined ratio. That's pretty darn good. Is -- are we going to be in an environment, say, two years from now where we're back to negative rate increases across many lines of commercial, or talk about your views on how you see the market developing? Evan Greenberg : Look, I can't tell you what we're going to see 2 years from now. I can give you a sense of \u2013 in my own judgment because I don't have a crystal ball. Based on the current market conditions and where I think they're going over the medium term right now, I think loss cost \u2013 I think rates will continue to exceed loss costs. We're exceeding loss costs right now by a reasonable margin. And the industry overall -- forget Chubb, the industry overall has been, number one, achieving loss rates in excess of loss costs for just 2 years now. And secondly, the industry starts at a loss ratio that is quite high. And to achieve a reasonable risk-adjusted return, it has to continue to achieve rate in excess of loss cost for a prolonged period of time. Interest rates are so low, there's no joy on the other side. And then you have an external environment that is \u2013 that has risk around it, from cyber, to climate, to the litigation environment. And all that is baked into, I think, the mood and the thinking among those in the industry underwriting today. And so, in my judgment, from everything I see, it is natural that I gave you year-on-year movement in pricing and rate so that you would have a perspective. And as you think about the rate of increase declining going forward, that is natural, but it's well in excess of loss cost and I believe that will continue. But to a good question that I think deserve a fulsome response. Greg Peters : Well, I -- in your comments about loss costs are interesting because there's 2 -- and you mentioned litigation. So there's a perspective that the legal environment, because of COVID, was shut down last year, and that's going to come back in spades. And then the second piece on loss cost is, there's all this rhetoric about inflationary pressures, especially on things like auto. And do you see that sort of manifesting itself in terms of higher loss costs for the industry as we think about the next 12 months? Evan Greenberg : Yes. So here's how I see it. When we look at the long-tail lines, we're using a historic trend ignoring COVID and the shutdown, assuming a reversion to the mean and which was recognizing what I think is a relatively hostile legal environment and litigation environment. So there's \u2013 the actual at the moment is running better than the trended 6% we're using. But we think that's a head fake on a timing question in how we imagine trend and therefore, what you really need in pricing. On the short tail side of the business, I really gave you two numbers. I gave you homeowners. And I gave the homeowners running a double-digit observed inflation today. I gave you a long tail -- I gave you short-tail commercial that were trending at 4%. On the commercial property side, from all we see and all of our data, currently at the moment, it's actually running below that, both frequency and severity. But we see enough of what we see as inflation externally. We see enough of what we see in the homeowners book that we continue to trend it in both pricing and reserving at that 4% range. Greg Peters : Got it. Thank you for the thorough answers. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : We will now move to Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, Evan, going back to some of the pricing commentary you gave, it seems like most lines still healthy levels above loss trend. So, we've heard from some folks in the industry as certain lines are getting to rate adequate and momentum is slowing. But it sounds like just really across the board, most lines are still in need of rate. I guess, would you characterize any lines as being rate adequate or just general kind of pushing consistently rate across the majority of your commercial lines? Evan Greenberg : I'm not sure, Elyse. I heard your commentary, but I'm not sure I got the question. Elyse Greenspan : I was just trying to get a sense, like broadly across commercial lines and you make your commentary about at still being a firm market. Do you see every line still in need of healthy, robust rate increases, or any lines may be more at adequate levels right now? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, it really varies across the board. When I look at the industry overall, I think, in many classes, the industry, in aggregate, if I rolled it all together, is one big portfolio, needs rate. When I look at it for the Chubb portfolio, most of our business is at or approaching risk-adjusted rate adequacy. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that's helpful. Evan Greenberg : That's as far as I will go. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. Evan Greenberg : But it varies by line, by territory, by class. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys outlined a pretty robust $5 billion capital share repurchase plan last week. As you think about the opportunities, your excess capital position, do you think that -- should we think about the capital return being prorated over the next year depending upon where your share price is maybe you could come sooner than later? How are you thinking about share repurchase, given the $5 billion understanding that you guys bought back a good amount that you shared in the second quarter as well? Evan Greenberg : Nice try Elyse. Stayed tuned. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks Evan. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Now we will hear from Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : Good morning. Evan, one observation, I guess, we had is the Overseas General segment loss ratio improvement has actually been keeping up pretty well at the North America commercial loss ratio improvement. And I guess that's a little bit surprising to us, just given the mix. And I was just curious if that surprises you as well? Evan Greenberg : No. Not at all. Ryan Tunis : So when you think about overseas general North America or you think that they have pretty similar margin profiles at this point, given pricing conditions? Evan Greenberg : Well, they're running different combined ratios. It varies by segment of overseas general, by country, by the mix. It varies wholesale versus retail, but overseas general continues to improve at a pace that's very similar to North pace. Ryan Tunis : I got. Evan Greenberg : I'm a little confused beyond that, Ryan, and I want to help you if I can. Ryan Tunis : No. I -- just overseas general is not a segment where we've been used to seeing a lot of loss ratio growing for a long time. I thought that was more attributable to the ANH mix, but it's been impressive. I was just... Evan Greenberg : No. Here it is, Ryan. Over half the overseas general business is commercial business. And \u2013 but you haven't been in a market where you take Europe or you take the London market, both wholesale and retail. Those were soft markets for an extended period. And we were scratching dirt for growth, but we were getting growth. And -- but we are very disciplined in underwriting, and we were making good money and good margins, a decent return, Not off-the-charts risk-adjusted return, but it a decent return. And relative to the market, we were well outperforming. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Evan Greenberg : You've seen. And what you get is, particularly with Europe and then with the U.K., they're slower to react. But you see that reaction taking place, and that was just an opportunity for us to drive right now, both growth and rate. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then a follow up on Elyse's question, your response for the Chubb book, so a lot of lines are approaching risk-adjusted rate adequacy. I guess just from a growth perspective, how much is that driving \u2013 when you -- the top line? Like when all of a sudden you see a line that a year ago wasn't rate adequate, and now it is. Is that a substantial marginal contributor to the top line growth we're seeing, or is it more incremental than that? Evan Greenberg : Hey, here's how it goes around here. Number one, underwriting will never destroy book value. So, if it's running over 100, you have to fix it or kill it immediately. In this kind of environment, if you have to strive in your business to achieve an adequate risk-adjusted return. If the market will allow an adequate risk-adjusted return on that cohort of business that you are underwriting, then I'll tell you what, more submissions, more quotes and more broker relations, more brokers and agents and drive to write that business. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Evan Greenberg : We know our minds clearly. And that's the point I was really trying to make. We've been growing commercial at double digit now for 10 quarters. No one's really noticed that. And that's because we saw an improving -- an improved environment. Short of that, how many years were people saying, show us the benefit of Chubb and ACE coming together and this and that? We said it's about underwriting discipline, and it's about a market environment. Now, you're surprised to see it. Don't be. Hey, you still there Ryan? Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now move to Tracy Benguigui. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. I'm going to give you a breather on pricing and loss trends. There's a lot of market -- no problem. I don't know if you like this question, but there's a lot of market attention paid to your Century subsidiary with respect to the BSA bankruptcy since that entity has been run off, not made it, not guaranteed and not part of an intercompany pool. So, I'm not trying to box you in on the BSA side. But I'm wondering, structurally, you conceivably let that entity assets run dry, or could there be circumstances that you may theoretically be under any obligation to contribute capital? I mean I recognized that Century is regulated by Pennsylvania, which is also your group supervisor? Evan Greenberg : Tracy, in our 10-K, we have fulsome disclosure around Century and our obligation. It is under a statutory order negotiated and consummated between Cigna and the State of Pennsylvania before ACE purchased Cigna's P&C business, which included Century. And that 10-K disclosure around our obligation to Century speaks for itself. It's quite clear. And it is a limited obligation, and I will leave it at that. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Great. I also recognized that Bermuda is opposing the G7 tax proposal in theory, is this a minimum 15% global tax rate floor holds? How would you be thinking about Chubb's seating arrangement versus affiliate? Evan Greenberg : I would -- how would I think about what? What about affiliate? Tracy Benguigui : Your seating arrangement. Yes, your seating arrangements with-- Evan Greenberg : Our seating arrangement. Tracy Benguigui : Yes. Evan Greenberg : We see risk for pooling and capital efficiency purposes. That's the reason we do it. We don't do it for tax purposes. I'll give you a very simple example so you'll get it really clearly. Imagine that on Chubb's balance sheet, I can take $10 million net per risk on a given class of business. But imagine that in all the countries we do business in around the world, I can't take that kind of retention because of my limited amount of capital. If I tried to take it in each jurisdiction and I had a loss in Malaysia or a loss XYZ country, I'd have to be dividending out of one place, contributing capital in another, it's the most inefficient way to run a business. So the pooling of risk and internal reinsurance is what allows you to leverage a global balance sheet to the benefit of local operations and it provides in one place the stability of spread of risks an amount of capital. So that's the fundamental reason that you start with that Chubb uses internal reinsurance. Thanks for the question, Tracy. Tracy Benguigui : Thanks Evans. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. Evan, just curious. The big $5 billion share repurchase authorization you announced, does that all indicate kind of what your view is of inorganic kind of growth opportunities here, be it opportunities or at least your appetite? : No. Nothing has changed, steady as she goes. The -- we're disciplined. Everything I've ever said about M&A. We're disciplined. Money doesn't burn a hole in our pocket. It has to advance what we're doing strategically. It has to be good for shareholders in terms of value creation. All of that, nothing changes. Our earnings generation power, as we see it. Our current capital position and surplus capital together, led us to the decision that the right thing to do and the prudent thing to do just in the talk, we've said about we'll hold full capital and have capital flexibility for risk and growth, organic and inorganic, and we'll return other than that to shareholders. That's all we're doing. Brian Meredith : Great. Thank you. And Evan, another question here. You all are fairly meaningful player in the cyber insurance marketplace. I'm just curious, can you give us kind of your thoughts on that marketplace right now? I know there were some issues with losses last year, but I understand that the pricing environment is pretty good right now. And just your view of opportunities there? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Look, the pricing environment is pretty good. The \u2013 but that's not it. That is not addressing by itself, the fundamental issue that the industry has to wrestle. And Chubb is beginning to respond to, but others are slow to react to that are the fundamentals around cyber. Like pandemic, cyber has a catastrophe profile to it and the nature of cat potential that has no time nor geographic boundary to it. And you take the growing digital interconnection of the world today in everything, personal and business, and that potential for catastrophe, the concentrations of exposure are only growing. And you see the spector of risk raising its head and all the cyber-attacks we see, malicious cyber-attacks, both nation state and non-nation-state actors for various reasons; one, to disrupt society, another, to make money. And so you have a frequency of loss on one hand and rate -- and some adjustment to coverage can manage that. On the other side of the coin, you have a systemic nature of this. And I can tell you, in the way Chubb underwrites, we are facing it and we are beginning to address it. And then on the -- in underwriting. And now on the other side are the real public policy questions, and we are involved in raising our voice in the public policy arena. Number one, when you look at ransomware, while I don't think the government should outlaw ransom, where payments at this time, I do think that we ought to be looking at whether we allow payments. I do think the nature -- because who are you paying? Terrorists? Secondly, treasury right now, you should require -- you should be obligated under current law, anti-money laundering laws, to get permission to make a ransomware payment. We should be removing the incentive out of the system for ransomware attacks, which are all about money for the most part. And on mask what is the social or the intention to disrupt our country politically and unmask that part of it and show it. Secondly, there are all kinds of things that the private sector and public sector could be doing together. Sharing of information is one of them right now and understanding where systemic risk aggregations are is another. So I'll stop right there, but it is more than about achieving rate in cyber today. Brian Meredith : Thanks Evan. Evan Greenberg : Sorry, Brian, more than you expected, but we have clear views about this. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll now hear from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Good morning. Two, I guess, mobile questions. Evan, you talked about the general expense ratio, but I was hoping you could give us a little color on what drove the actual decrease in administrative expenses in North American commercial year-over-year? Evan Greenberg : Meyer, how about we take that one offline with you, we'll go through the accounting of it. Meyer Shields : Okay. Evan Greenberg : There was nothing substantial. Meyer Shields : Okay, fair enough. In the same sort of tone, other income or expenses in North America Commercial? That was negative 14%. Is there anything unusual in terms of what's building up to that number? Evan Greenberg : No, nothing unusual. I'm within that. It's just noise, quarter-to-quarter noise. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And with no additional questions in the queue, I will turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thanks, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator instructions] For opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Good morning everyone and welcome to our September 30th, 2021, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to Company performance, pricing, and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainty, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors. chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release, and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions to several members of our management team. And now my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had a very strong third quarter highlighted by outstanding P&C premium revenue growth globally of 17% and simply excellent underwriting results on both the calendar and current [Indiscernible] year basis, despite elevated catastrophe losses. Our results were powered by double-digit commercial lines growth, strong continued underlying margin expansion, the strength of our reserves and our broad diversification of businesses. Core operating income in the quarter of 264 per share was up 32% were 250 million over prior year to 1.2 billion, while net income of 1.8 was up 53% from prior year. For the year on both a net and core operating income basis, we have produced record earnings. Again, it was an active quarter for natural catastrophes. Yet with over 1.1 billion of cats, we reported a 93.4 combined ratio. With P&C underwriting income up 58% to 617 million. Which speaks to the underlying strength of our businesses, and again, broad diversification of our Company's sources of revenue and earnings, both domestically and globally. Year-to-date we have produced 2.4 billion on underwriting income for a combined ratio of 90.4. And that includes 2.1 billion of cut losses. And what is shaping up to be another year of sizable weather-related loss events tied to the new normal brought on by climate change and other societal changes. Speaking again to our underwriting health on a current [Indiscernible] year ex-cut basis, underwriting income in the quarter was 1.4 billion, up 23% with a combined ratio of 84.8 compared to 85.7 prior year quarterly underwriting record. If we exclude the one-time positive adjustment we took last year due to lower frequency of loss because of the COVID related shutdown, our current accident year combined ratio, unaffected improve 2 points. This is more reflective of our margin expansion. And we included a simple exhibit in our press release showing the detail. The strength of our Balance Sheet and conservative approach to loss reserving was again in evidence this quarter, as we reported 321 million in favorable prior period reserve development. Net investment income in the quarter was 940 million up 4.5%. Peter is going to have more to say about cuts, and prior period development, investment income, and book value. Turning to growth in the rate environment. As I said at the opening, P&C premiums were up nearly 17% globally, or 15.5 in constant dollar. With commercial premiums up 22% and consumer up 4%, the 17% growth for the quarter, and 14.2 for the first 9 months topped last quarters, and was that was the strongest organic growth we have seen again since 2004. Growth in the quarter was broad-based with contributions virtually all commercial P&C businesses globally. From our agriculture business to those serving large companies, to mid-sized and small, and most regions of the world and distribution channels. The robust commercial P&C pricing environment remains on pace in most all important regions of the world with continued year-on-year improvement in rate to exposure on the business we wrote both new and renewal. In North America, total P&C net premiums grew over 17% with commercial premium up about 22.5%, excluding agriculture, which had a fantastic quarter in its own right with premium growth of over 40%, commercial P&C premiums were up over 16.5 in North America. New business was up 13% for all commercial lines and renewal retention remains strong at over 97% on a premium basis. The 16.5 commercial premium growth is a composite of 15.5% growth in our major accounts and specialty business, and over 18% in our middle market and small commercial business. Simply a standout quarter for this division. Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines by over 12%. Once again, loss costs are currently trending about 5.5%. Can vary up or down depending upon line of business. And again, like last quarter, just to remind you, in general, commercial lines loss costs for short tail classes are trending around 4% though we anticipate to this to increase in the future. While long tail loss costs, excluding comp, are trending about 6%. Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement in North America. In major accounts which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased in the quarter by just over 13%. Risk management related primary casualty rates were up over 6%. General casualty rates we're up about 21% and vary by category of casualty. Property rates were up 12 and financial lines rates were up 17%. In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by 16% in the quarter. Property rates were up 13, casualty was up 20, and financial lines rates were up about 21. In our middle market business rates increased in the quarter, nearly 9.5%. Rates for property were up over 11%. Casualty rates were up 9.5%, excluding workers comp, with comp rates down 2% and financial lines rates were up 18%. Turning into our International General Insurance Operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew 20.5% on a published basis, were 16 in constant dollar. International retail, commercial P&C grew nearly 17% or 12 in constant dollar. While our London wholesale business grew over 31%. Retail commercial P&C growth varied by region. With premiums up almost 28% in our European division. Asia-Pacific was up 15.5, while Latin America commercial lines grew about 6.5. Internationally, like in the U.S. in those markets where we grew, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail commercial P&C business, rates increased in the quarter by 15%. Property rates were up 11, financial lines up 33% and primary and excess casualty up 7% and 11% respectively. And in our London wholesale business, rates increased in the quarter by 11%, property up 13, financial lines up 14, Marine up to 8. Outside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 3%. Though that varies by class of business and country. Consumer lines growth globally in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's ongoing effects on consumer related activities. Our international consumer business grew almost 10% in the quarter on a published basis, or 5% in constant dollars. And breaking that down a little further, international personal lines grew almost 11% on a published basis. While internationally A&H grew over 8.5 or just 5% in constant dollar. Latin America had a particularly strong quarter in consumer with personal lines in A&H premiums up 18.5% and 17.5% respectively, powered by both our traditional and digitally focused distribution relationships. Net premiums in our North America, high net worth personal lines business were up just over 1%, adjusted for non-renewals in California and COVID related auto renewal credits, we grew 3% in the quarter. Our true, high net-worth client segment, the heart of our business grew 11% in the quarter. Overall, retentions remained strong at 95.7% and we achieved positive pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 14% and our homeowners portfolio. The severity trends in personal lines in the U.S. remain elevated. Lastly, in our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up over 52% in the quarter. While net premiums in our Global Re business were up over 22%. In some, we continue to capitalize on broad-based and favorable market conditions and improving economic conditions. All of our businesses did well or are improving from agriculture to all forms of commercial P&C globally. Both retail and wholesale, serving large companies to middle market and small to our improving global personal lines in A&H businesses, to our Asia Life businesses, to our Global Re business. in one sentence, both growth and margin expansion are two trends that will continue. In the quarter, as you saw, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire the life and non-life insurance companies that house the personal accident, supplemental health and life insurance businesses of Cygnet in Asia-Pacific for 5.75 billion in cash. As you saw, or can see from our investor presentation, these operations generate approximately 3 billion in premium revenue, have favorable underwriting margins and are not exposed to the P&C cycle. This highly complementary transaction advances our strategy to expand our presence in the Asia-Pacific region, including our Company's Asia-based life Company presence, and adds significantly to our already sizable Global A&H business. Upon completion of the transaction, which we expect during 2022, Asia Pacific share of Chubb's global portfolio will represent approximately 20% of the Company. For many years, we have admired Cigna's business in Asia, including its people, product innovation, distribution and management capabilities. The underlying economics and value creation to the transaction are very attractive, and these businesses will contribute to our Company strategically for decades to come. The transaction once again, demonstrates our patience in advancing our strategies and confirms our consistent and disciplined approach to holding capital for risk and growth, both organic and inorganic. Our Company has considerable earning power and a patient hand to deploy capital effectively overtime. We return excess of what we need to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases, while we continue to build future revenue and earnings generation capabilities. In conclusion, this was another excellent quarter of growing our business and our exposures, expanding our margins and investing in our future. All in a period with substantial cats, which are not unexpected. My management team and I have never been more confident in our ability to continue to outperform and deliver strong, sustainable shareholder value. I will now turn the call over to Peter, and then we'll be back to take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan, and good morning again everyone. As you've just heard from Evan, our overall franchise continues to deliver outstanding top-line growth, margin improvement, and profit growth. Now let me discuss our balance Sheet and capital management. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong, including our cash flow, liquidity, investment portfolio, reserves, and capital. It all starts with our operating performance, which produced 3.3 billion in operating cash flow for the quarter and 8.5 billion for the first nine months. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of 5.1 billion at the end of the quarter, even after our significant capital management actions. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned 1.9 billion to shareholders, including 1.5 billion in share repurchases and 346 million in dividends. Through the 9 months ended September 30, we returned over 5 billion, including almost 4 billion in share repurchases. Or over 5% of our outstanding shares and dividends of over $1 billion. The agreement to acquire Cigna's, ANH, and life insurance businesses in Asia Pacific is not expected to impact our share repurchase and dividend commitments. Our investment portfolio of 122 billion continues to be of very high quality, and we have not made any material changes during the quarter to our investment allocation. The portfolio increased 759 million in the quarter and at September 30th, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of 2.9 billion after tax. Adjusted pretax net investment income for the quarter was 940 million, similar to last quarter and 40 million higher than our estimated range benefiting from higher private equity distributions. Evan Greenberg : As I noted on the second quarter earnings call, our investment income is based on many factors. And notwithstanding our better-than-expected results over the last few quarters, we continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million. Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were 1.1 billion. With about 1 billion in the U.S. of which 806 million was from Hurricane Ida. And 135 million from international events of which 95 was from flood losses in Europe. Our reserve position remains strong with net reserves increasing 1.7 billion Peter Enns : or 3.2% on a constant dollar basis, reflecting the impact of catastrophe losses in the quarter and 2021 growth, in particular from our agricultural business, which has a seasonality impact on reserves. We had favorable prior period development of 321 million pretax, which includes 33 million of adverse development related to legacy environmental exposures. The remaining favorable development of 354 million was split approximately 30% in long-tail lines, principally from accent years 2017 and prior. And 70% in short tail lines, principally from our 2020 North America personal lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio was 73% for a very strong 75% after adjusting for tax, PPD and agriculture. Book value decreased by 744 million or 1 % reflecting 1.16 billion in core operating income, and a net gain on our investment portfolio of a 190 million, which was more than offset by foreign exchange losses of 305 million, and the 1.9 billion of share repurchases and dividends. Book and tangible book value per share increased 0.6% and 0.4% respectively from last quarter. Our reported ROE for the quarter and year-to-date was 12.3% and 14.4% respectively. Our core operating ROE and core operating return on tangible equity were 8.2% and 12.6% respectively for the quarter. As a reminder, we did not include the fair value mark on our private equity funds in core operating income, as many of our peer companies do. For comparison purposes, our core operating ROE increases by 5 percentage points to 13.2% and our core operating income increases by a $1.61 per share to $4.25. Year-to-date our core operating ROE, including the fair value mark on our P funds, would be 13.8%. I'll turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, [Operator instructions]. We will begin with Michael Phillips, with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Evan in your comments and in the press release, you talked about some actions because of the climate change, just the thoughtful and put the actions you are going to take. Andy, can you talk about what some of those are and what we can expect to see from those actions either on exposure changes or cat load changes that might change in the future because of what you're doing? Evan Greenberg : to answer it a little differently than that. I mean, it's a broader statement that I'm making and in the press release it was not simply about Chubb, it's the industry. The industry and Chubb included has seen in recent years arise in the frequency and severity of insured losses globally from commercial and personal property arising from that cut. And especially losses from less well modeled or non-modeled causes. Our objective with all of this is twofold, price business adequately get paid for the risk. Secondly, understand that manage accumulation of exposures against weather-related pearls modeled and non or less well modeled. Factors that are contributing to the rise in loss actually fall into 3 categories. First, we're seeing today changes globally in the frequency and severity of the apparel such as tropical storms, wildfires, and floods. However, the historical record provides an interesting context when thinking about today's risk environment. For example, recent land falling U.S. hurricane activity is not especially anomalous in either frequency or frequency of intense storms as measured by wind speed compared to say, the first part of the 20th century. And repeats of storms from this earlier period would in fact generate losses far greater than any modern storm in terms of industry loss. All of which is already contemplated in our modeling and risk management. And with all that said though, there is evidence now that the amount of precipitation contained within the storms appears to be greater. And that is increasing the amount of loss emanating from events. The second factor that contributes is changes to the exposure footprint of insurable personal and commercial properties, increases in actual exposure units, and values from GDP growth, demographic shifts to higher risk geographies, and aging building stock are all examples of factors that are leading the higher loss potential. And finally, the third, the impact of natural events is further amplified by increasingly vulnerable infrastructure. For example, the levy failures during Hurricane Katrina in '05, and the systemic electric grid failure during the 2021 Texas freeze. We're actively working to reflect the impact of all of these trends in our pricing, risk selection, and exposure management. We have significant advances in modeling, especially secondary perils such as floods and wildfires. But there's still a way to go. Our loss costs consider recent experience together with explicit recognition of factors that can be quantified, such as sea level rise, exposure growth, or demographic shifts. And we continue to refine our portfolio management to manage risk aggregation and an ever more granular level. The net results for us are dynamically risk adjusted rates that appropriately reflect changes in charges for both recent loss experience and exposure concentrations. So we're striving to stay on top of this, and we have an awful lot of resource dedicated to the effort. And frankly, I think we're in pretty good shape. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you for the details. Appreciate that. Second question then on, I appreciate the details you gave a little bit. Yes. Sure. Is that better? Evan Greenberg : Yeah, that's a little bit better. Michael Phillips : Off-shelf my headset. I appreciate the details on the loss trend numbers that you gave this quarter, I guess, clearly less of the base going on on the casualty side with loss trends specifically on the casualty side here of the long tail that you gave them a 5.5 or 6.5 I guess. What pieces of that, if you can kind of break that down would be most worrisome to you that could make that number change. Again because of all the domain is going on. Some financial inflation, some social inflation and different things that are happening there. Any piece of event that you'd be more worried about there and that could make that number go up? Evan Greenberg : No. There's no one ingredient. I'm not worried, so I wouldn't characterize it as worry. If you're worried, don't be in the casualty business. These are -- these are dynamics that are -- that are enduring and so all of the -- all of the ingredients, whether it is social inflation, the trial bar, and as a business, litigation funding. At this moment in time, understanding the latency because courts are closed and not taking the head -- have been closed, not taking the head-fake on the lag. And then you have simply economic, inflation, and science, and legal environment changing with legislation, all of that has been our consistent factors. Some rear their head a little more than others at times. And we're mindful of all of that. And that's what we try to do a good job of anticipating. And by the nature of it, you can only anticipate so much of it. And the future is unknowable until it arrives. In fact, so therefore, you manage conservatively declare bad news early and good news late. Thanks for the question. Operator : We'll now move to a question from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. I was just hoping to just get an update on the excess capital position. Capital return has been a highlight so far this year, but so as earnings power and capital generation. And I know in the past, I think at the end of last year, you said excess capital was about a 2 point drag on the ROE. But since then you've returned about 5 billion through buybacks and dividends. So I guess [Indiscernible] long-winded way of asking, where do you guys think the excess capital position was at the end of the quarter? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. It's in the range of about -- it's come down from about 2 to about 1.5. David Motemaden : Got it. And then just thinking about potential uses of capital. Obviously still have some headroom on the 5 billion share repurchase. And then the CIGNA acquisition. I guess I'm also just wondering, just any thoughts around the timing of buying up the additional ownership stake in Wutai, and how we should thinking -- should be thinking about that. Evan Greenberg : When it comes to Wutai the ownership stake, buying that up, which -- buying it up to over 50%, and good luck prognosticating specifically with China over the next few months, number of months. And then going well in excess of that potentially I would say through 2022. David Motemaden : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could just sneak one more in. Another good quarter of growth across the board, but I wanted to just drill down a little bit in North America commercial. Last quarter, you talked about exposure being negative. And I was wondering if that's still the case, and obviously pricing and new business, there sounded like they were very strong. We're wondering if you can maybe break down some of the other components of the strong growth this quarter. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Look, exposure growth in aggregate, net-net, had about a 0.5 impact on our North America commercial lines growth. And that includes both positives from economic activity and then structural changes like deductible increases and retention etc, that would go the other way and it all nets out to about a 0.5 a point. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Next we will hear from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Hi. Thanks. Good morning. Again you talked about robust price increases that we've seen for a while across the industry. As you think out over the course of the next year, do you think the industry can broadly maintain rate in excess of loss trend just as you think about the underlying dynamics out there? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, I do. I think -- look, I don't have a crystal ball, but from everything I see right now about rates and the shape and pattern of how -- when I look over a number of quarters, what I would call is simply a moderation in the rate of increase. When I look at that and I look at the loss cost environment, and then I look at our retention rates against the kinds of rates we're achieving. So we achieved certain rate increases, booked a retention rate on business, which then tells me about the tone of the marketplace. All of that tells me that the industry should continue to achieve rate in excess of loss cost for some time to come. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Great. And then in terms of North America commercial in the underlying loss ratio that was around a 150 basis points year-over-year improvement, since you guys didn't call anything out, obviously, the COVID frequency impacted other segments. Is -- was there any one-off noise or is that a pretty good indicator of the underlying margin improvement within North America commercial? Evan Greenberg : It's a pretty good underlying run rate number. There is not one-offs. Elyse Greenspan : Great. Thanks for the color. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Next question will come from Mike Zirinski, Wolfe Research. Mike Zirinski : Great. Good morning. I guess I'm going back to loss costs. I might have missed some of the exact wording, Evan, but I think you said you expected some of the short-tail commercial classes to increase in the future. If you could provide some color around that. Evan Greenberg : Right now in short-tail, there is evidence of inflation in the homeowners lines and has been for some time. but not so much in commercial property, paid losses. But given labor costs and commodity prices, and supply chain problems in scarcity and materials, we expect costs to rise and we're building that view into future claim payments. And our pricing, which is only prudent. And that's all I'm saying, we're anticipating just in the common sense way ahead of it. Not waiting for it to be on top. Mike Zirinski : I guess as a follow-up, having -- that's interesting because looking at some of the carriers, it seemed like paid losses are down in the casualty lines due to some of the courts being let's say, delayed or clogged or running at a slower pace. Is Chubb seeing that too, in the casualty lines? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Let's not confuse though. What I said about short-tail and what you just said about casualty. We and all the whole industry, we've been saying for over a year and a half now that obviously with courts closed, dockets full, it has a delay in the processing or the final adjudication of casualty related claims. And that's a pattern -- a paid pattern and change. But any good underwriter is not going to take that head-fake and believe that change of pattern means a change in ultimate loss. And so therefore, we don't believe that's exchange of the trends. And so therefore, as I said earlier we remain with a 6% trend factor a nd the pace will ultimately come through as well as the lag and incurrence. Meyer Shields : Understood. Lastly just thanks for the granular details about the underlying loss ratio benefits 3Q of last year. I heard your answer, we heard your answer to Lisa 's question in North America commercial. But I guess I just want to make sure, since you guys didn't break out, the granular benefits last year or early 2021. We should be assuming there were some benefits in those same segments that -- when we are thinking about future quarters, year-over-year results, mostly from personal lines? Evan Greenberg : I don't know know what you're saying. Meyer Shields : I guess just -- he frequency benefits, Evan, those just didn't -- okay but the frequency benefits -- yes. But they happen later, not just 3Q, right? In 4Q and probably 1Q of this year. So we should be taking that to account. Evan Greenberg : Not that we -- not that we see. Meyer Shields : Thank you. Operator : We will now move to Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Good morning. Looking at the Cygnet field, can you describe any cohesiveness of those different markets across 7 countries or those marketplace dynamics more siloed. Evan Greenberg : Tracy, it's like describing -- these are countries, they're not markets. They're individual countries with their own cultures, their own socioeconomic dynamics, their own social systems. Their individual languages. Evan Greenberg : These are -- I wouldn't view it in a sterile away, it's -- Asia 's vast and no different than saying, well, can we talk about the United States and France in the same breath? No. Or the United States, France, and Brazil. You have to think of them each independently. That's the whole point of managing a global business. You understand the local market. Idiosyncrasies, opportunities, and risks. The geographies are great varied by each. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Maybe just going back to capital management back in February, you shared S&P's decision to lower capital benchmark to AA from AAA, which help you unlock excess capital. And as you know, S&P has published an advanced notice that plans to update its capital model. We do not know a lot about it. I will come and request for comment comes out, but I guess what I'm getting at, does this development compel you to sit on the sidelines with respect to capital deployment until more is understood? Or will you cross that bridge when more information is known? Evan Greenberg : We'll cross that bridge when more information is known. We have very close and productive dialogue. Always on an ongoing basis with rating agencies. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you for taking my questions. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Thanks for asking. Operator : Next question comes from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. Evan I guess I'd like to focus my first question around retention and recruiting. You talked about money in your previous answer, labor shortages. And there's a lot of news in the marketplace around the availability of workers. I think St. Louis Fed was out something earlier this week, about 3 million workers may have retired due to COVID. So maybe you could give us your perspective around what's going on at Chubb with retention and recruiting. Evan Greenberg : Thanks. Like with all companies, it's a constant effort and it's a difficult marketplace for recruiting and retention rates are modestly lower and it's a combination of people moving around, and more retirements. And just making different choices in their lives an outcome of -- clearly of COVID in many ways. We have -- to manage, we've significantly beefed up and improved our resource capabilities around recruiting. And we have such an intense focus on it, and the -- in aggregate, the number of open positions we had in June in North America is down today from what it was then. We're making progress and continue to make progress, but you have to grind on it. People want -- many people want different -- a different way to work. They want more flexibility in the days that they work or the hours that they work. And while we remain work from office Company and we'll be. We have adjusted and recognized that given the ability with technology today, that has been proven over the -- NSA accelerated the proving of that over the last year-and-a-half since we went into shutdown or closer to 2 years now or I guess about a year and a half. The -- our ability to productively work, not simply from the office, but from home allows for greater flexibility. And we recognize that and therefore are adjusting our own expectations around that. So we're mindful obviously, and we're in a marketplace that competes for talent. We want the best and the brightest and those -- and the most ambitious, I should say. Really the most ambitious to want to work for Chubb. We are an ambitious Company. We're not going to moderate our goals and our objectives because of employment concerns were going to just step up our game to make sure we're a place where those who share our ambition and want to work hard, but want to apply different kind of work life balance and where they work from. We want them to work here. And we want them to be motivated to be here. And so we're making strides in that. I think good strides. And as I said, the overall number of open positions here is down. And down, not a small amount. Greg Peters : Thank you for that answer. And I guess it's sort of related, but we're hearing or seeing in the news a lot of changes going on and distribution. Brokers as roll-ups, private equity involved in roll-ups we're seeing large companies hire producers from other companies. And then you highlighted your higher retention ratios of your business. Can you talk about what the changes are in the distribution outside of Chubb, how that's affecting your business. It's it doesn't seem like it is. Is there some risk out there as we look forward that it might be disruptive to your renewal ratios? Evan Greenberg : No, I don't believe so. Chubb has -- enjoys an extremely strong position with all of the top brokerage, and agency plants in the country. Strong dialog, strong presence. Our spread of product and capability. And our local capability, we are simply a very compelling offering to any broker who has to -- or agent who has to make a market, that's their job, to make a market. And pretty hard to make a market without Chubb. And so we bring a lot of compelling capability and tools, and frankly, as they compete against each other, and it's a fierce market within the brokerage community of how they compete for business. Chubb is an important ingredient in helping them in their effort to compete and our partnership between ourselves is very well balanced. Greg Peters : Seems like a fair answer. Thanks for your time. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Ryan Tunis with Autonomous has the next question. Ryan Tunis : Hi, thanks. Good morning. Another quarter of solid improvement in the policy acquisition cost ratios. I think, especially in the commercial lines segment. Curious what's driving that is that better terms on reinsurance? How sustainable is that trend, Evan? Evan Greenberg : Not better terms on reinsurance. It's sustainable. It's a mix of business driven, predominantly within commercial lines. And it's -- there is fee business, there is commissioned business. And what you see is pretty steady, and on the margin. And though not unimportant, commission rates in some lines of business as rates have increased, have come down. And that also benefits to a degree. We think it's available. Ryan Tunis : And then Ryan Tunis : I've got a follow-up more in terms and conditions. If I recall at the beginning of a hard market, one of the things that kind of bothered you was having done the excess casualty business. I think I remember you talking about $1 million attachment points and how that become stale over the years. Is that -- I guess 2 years later into the hard market, is that something that's been corrected are those attachment points broadly self-corrected? I'm just wondering if there's something that might help us in addition to rate? Evan Greenberg : And it doesn't self-correct. But it is definitely within when you're in a hard market, it is one of the ingredients that also helps clients to ameliorate rate increase. And they're motivated and and incented. because you go from a million to a 2 million attachment point on what you pay, you got out of a dollar swap layer with us. The difference between a million and 2 million is adequately price. So it's rational, you retain that for yourself. And so attachment points and deductibles and limits for different exposures within a policy, are all ingredients that have been and continue to be adjusted to today's economic environment and a more rational construction of policy terms and conditions. And that is taking place and has been taking place on a broad basis. And I'll remind you, Ryan so that completely transparent about it. Within how we -- when we look at rate increase, we include that within our definition of increase in rate because in the areas in the lines were we can measure it definitively, and we can in certain lines very well. Ryan Tunis : You mentioned that happens in a hard market. Is that the type of thing that down the road when we're not in a hard market, do those terms and conditions, those new limits, deductibles, attachment points, do those tend to stick maybe a little bit better than headline rate? Evan Greenberg : Yeah, the attachment point and the deductibles tend to be much stickier than rate is. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Evan Greenberg : And depending on the business, particularly in middle market, more than stickier it endures. It tends to endure. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We will now move to Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Yes. Thanks. Two quick questions here for you. First, what happened with the Ag business, the massive growth years, was it a new client? Was there something happen from an accounting perspective? Evan Greenberg : If it was a new client, they were like they must have had farm the size of -- Brian Meredith : Exactly client [Indiscernible] floral which will take over the Western U.S. Operator : John Lupine. Evan Greenberg : Thanks Brian. know supplies the base prices were up significantly year-over-year and our spring crops, corn and beans were up 18, and 29% respectively. And we had another record year in terms of policy count acquisition growth, and new acres planted by our producers. So that really drove the 43 growth that you can base. price, John 's referring to in a simple way, if you apply a rate against exposure. And exposure is the commodity price of say, corn or beans. And that price, which is a February price, that's when you're priced the policies, is up significantly over the prior year because the commodity prices are up. Operator : Yeah. Makes sense. I think and my second question is, I just wanted to talk a little bit about your global ANH. Evan Greenberg : Giant farm, that was like 200,000 acres [Indiscernible] record Brian Meredith : And then the next, I just like to talk a little bit about the global A&H business. I know there is a component that it's travel-related, but any indications that's going to turn around here, I would've thought that with the economic growth we're seeing that would have already start to seeing some nice growth out of it. Evan Greenberg : Our travel business is predominantly Asia and Latin America. And if you've been following it, Asia has been locked down until very recently where it's just starting to open. Countries like Australia that have been closed for a year-and-a-half, they're just going to open in November. Singapore, Thailand, Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, they've all been locked down. And they are just starting to open now through November. And we're starting to see growth pickup, in fact, and one Luis can remind us, I think it's the month of September or October, is our first month where we've seen real growth and it was, let's say 8% and we're all jumping up and down about it. However, to remind you, our travel is off about 85% from what it was at '19, so 8% is got a ways to go. Brian Meredith : Good. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And we will take our last question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks for fitting me in. One brief questions to start with, Evan are you looking to add or shrink exposure in homeowners in Florida and California? Evan Greenberg : Well, Meyer I'll remind you, we were -- we gave some forward information that in California we were shrinking. We were shrinking not a small amount in our footprint that is exposed to wildfire both highly exposed and even moderately exposed to wildfire, which is not a small amount. And we gave an amount of premium that related to that, that would impact us. And that's because in the State of California, in their own wisdom, we cannot charge an adequate price for the risk and not by a small amount. So someone else will have the pleasure of writing that business, unfortunately. And so we've been shrinking that and in particular Florida, we've been pretty steady. Meyer Shields : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe a broad question. Can you talk about maybe the opportunities and potential risks to Chubb of the infrastructure bills that Congress is now considering. Evan Greenberg : Well, the opportunities are great. It's going to -- over time it's going to add a lot of activity to construction around infrastructure. Now, it's you passed the bill, and then putting the shovel on the ground takes a period of time, and the infrastructure bill, if I recall correctly, is to generate infrastructure improvements over a decade. But it'll -- a trillion dollars is an awful lot of infrastructure. Now, the issue of labor will be very interesting to see. It's one thing to want to -- to want to realize those infrastructure projects that our country sorely needs. And on the other hand, the labor to affect those projects is something that Congress is going to have to wrestle with and read into that immigration and temporary work visa 's for Mexicans and others south of the border we're very capable and executing that labor and by the way, want to go home after they -- after working here. They don't want to necessarily remain here. And we have to rationally recognize that and address that as part of a 1-point -- a $1 trillion infrastructure package, if we're to spend it and make the difference we expect. And the insurance industry will be a beneficiary of that because those projects need to be insured, both construction and surety. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I will turn the call back over to your host for any additional or closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thanks, everyone for your time this morning. We look forward to seeing -- speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : With that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation. And you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] For opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome to our December 31, 2021, fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that can affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. And now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent finish to the year, with record operating earnings and underwriting results, double-digit commercial premium growth globally, strong levels of rate increase and slow but improving growth in our consumer business globally. This performance led to one of the best years in our company's history, with the best organic growth in P&C premiums in over 15 years and record financial results spanning both net and core operating income, calendar and current accident year underwriting income and investment income. Simply stunning results across the board and a testament to the organization and so many of my colleagues last year. Core operating income in the quarter was $1.65 billion or $3.81 per share, up nearly 20% over prior year. For the year, we produced net and core operating income of $8.5 billion and $5.6 billion, respectively. Again, both record results. In the quarter, $1.27 billion of underwriting income was a 31% increase over prior year, with a combined ratio of 85.5%. Allow me to digress for just a second. In my judgment, the calendar year or published combined ratio is the primary measure of underwriting performance that investors and management should focus on, because natural catastrophes are a regular and expected occurrence and the volatility cannot be dismissed away. Our P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 83.9%, a 2.5 point improvement over prior year. This is an important, but secondary measure that provides useful insight into the current underlying strength of our businesses. Full year P&C underwriting income was a record $3.7 billion, up over 200% and that's with $2.4 billion of catastrophe losses in the second costliest year for the industry in terms of cats. On the investment side, adjusted net investment income topped $900 million for the quarter and was a record $3.7 billion for the year. With the Fed finally accepting that inflation is a reality that is not going away anytime soon, interest rates are rising and will continue to rise. QE is coming to a rapid end and spreads should begin to widen, particularly if the Fed begins to shrink their balance sheet, as they should. As a reminder, every 100 basis points of provides about $1.2 billion of additional investment income, and we run about a four-year portfolio duration. As I remarked over a year ago, we're in a period of very strong wealth creation, which is reflected vividly by our quarterly and full year results. And I expect this trend will continue, driven by further growth and margin expansion. Peter will have more to say about cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and other financial items. Before I get to our discussion of growth in rate, as you saw in the press release, we have entered into agreements with several shareholders to purchase additional ownership interest in Huatai Group in China. Upon regulatory approval, which we expect sometime during 2022, our total aggregate ownership will be north of 80%. Separately, integration planning for the Cigna transaction, which we announced in the fourth quarter and I covered on our last call is progressing well. We expect to close in the first half of the year. Now turning to growth and the rate environment. P&C premiums in the quarter increased 9.6%, with commercial up 13% and consumer up 2.2. This strong performance capped a year where we grew our premium revenue 13%, the strongest organic growth since 2003, with commercial up 17.7% and consumer up 2.3%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based, with contributions from virtually all commercial businesses globally, from large corporate to middle market to small, from traditional to specialty to agriculture, including most regions of the world. Commercial premiums for North America were up over 11%, while in overseas general, they grew 15%. For the year, we have grown our commercial business almost 18%. And for perspective, since 2019, it has grown by nearly one-third or over $5 billion of net premium, and that's the size of or bigger than most insurers. In terms of rate, the level of rate increases remains robust and is naturally slowing as portfolios achieve or approach rate adequacy. At the same time, whether short or long-tail exposure, the loss environment is anything but benign. The level of rate increases remains well in excess of loss costs and I expect this trend to continue for some time. In the quarter, in North America, total premiums grew 8.7%, with commercial up over 11%, driven by growth in our major accounts and specialty business of 12% and our middle market and small commercial business of 9.7%. Total exposure change is actually down 0.6% in the quarter. And it's a combination of an increase in economic exposure of 3.4% due to higher payrolls, sales and other economically sensitive activity; and on the other hand, a decline in exposure due to underwriting changes, such as increased attachment points and higher deductibles, a good thing, though it negatively impacted growth. Our retail businesses achieved a 100% retention this quarter on a premium basis and 89% on an account basis, both very strong. Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines 10.5%. Loss costs are trending about 5.5% and vary by line. In general, loss costs for short-tail classes are running about 4%. Though again, we anticipate these to rise and have reacted accordingly. In long tail, excluding workers' comp, we are trending at a 6% rate, and our first dollar workers' comp book is trending between 4% and 4.5%. Let me give you a better sense of the rate increase movement in North America. In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased in the quarter by 10.5%. Risk management-related primary casualty rates were up over 4%. General casualty rates were up over 16% and varied by class of casualty, and property rates were up 9.7%, while financial lines rates were up over 17%. In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by 14.5% in the quarter. Property rates were up 12.5%, casualty was up almost 17%, while financial lines rates were up 18.5%. In our middle market business, rates increased in the quarter about 9%. Rates for property were up 9%; casualty, excluding comp, were up nearly 9% and comp rates were down 1.5%; while comp pricing on the other hand, which is rate plus exposure, was up about 3%; and finally, financial lines rates were up about 19%. Turning to our International General Insurance operations. Commercial P&C premiums grew 15% on a published basis. International Retail Commercial grew over 13%, while our London wholesale business grew 28%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up 19% in our U.K. and Europe division. Asia Pacific was up about 12.5%, while our Latin America commercial business grew over 9%. Internationally, like in the U.S., we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, rates increased in the quarter 13% with property up 8%, financial lines up 30% and primary and excess casualty up 7% and 11%, respectively. By the way, these rate increases were nearly identical to those from the prior quarter. In our London wholesale business in the quarter, property rates were up 8%, financial lines rates were up 24% and marine up 5%... Outside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 3%, though that varies by class of business and country. While international consumer lines growth in the quarter continued to be heavily impacted by the pandemic's ongoing effects on consumer related activities, growth continued to slowly recover and was 3.5% on a published and constant dollar basis. A clear example of that is our international A&H division, which grew for the third consecutive quarter. And on a currency adjusted basis, Q4 was our best quarter since the beginning of the pandemic, with growth of 5.5%. Across Asia and Latin America in our direct marketed business through banks, retailers and digital platforms, we are seeing activity pick up for consumer lending, credit card growth and branch openings. In fact, our direct marketing business grew double digits in Latin America, and we had our best growth quarter in the year in Asia Pac. All-in-all, I expect growth in our consumer lines to continue to improve as the year goes along. The underlying health of the business is excellent. Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up 3.3%. Our true high net worth client segment, the heart of our business, grew 13% in the quarter. Overall retention was very strong this quarter at nearly 98%, and we achieved pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 13% -- 13.5% in our homeowners portfolio. Claims severity in our US personal lines business is running just under 9%, with homeowners cost to repair and rebuild increasing 11%. In our Asia focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were up about 25% in the quarter. Profitability was impacted this quarter from a true-up of our COVID reserve charges, which overall for the company were net positive, but negatively impacted life. Lastly, net premiums in our Global Re business were up 37%. And while conditions have improved in reinsurance, we remain cautious in most lines. Rates and terms in most classes are still not adequate to earn what we believe is needed to justify the volatility and earn an appropriate risk adjusted return. We had an outstanding year, and I look ahead -- looking ahead, we're off to a very good start in the first quarter overall. Market conditions remain consistent with what we experienced in the fourth quarter. 2022 should be a good year in terms of continued growth and margin improvement as we capitalize on favorable underwriting conditions for our commercial P&C businesses globally. I expect rates to continue to exceed loss costs. Consumer lines growth should return as the pandemic eases, though, as you know, there is no certainty. In the future, as rates -- interest rates rise and spreads potentially widen, our investment income will rise, and our strategic investments such as Cigna and Huatai will provide us with greater revenue, earnings and growth opportunity. All of this gives me great confidence in the future. I'll now turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan, and good morning, everyone. Consistent with the record earnings that Evan highlighted, other key financial metrics were also excellent, including a strong return on equity and book and tangible book value per share that now stand at all-time highs. Our strong performance produced operating cash flow of $2.6 billion for the quarter and a record $11.1 billion for the year. We continue to build on our balance sheet strength with capital of $76 billion and cash and invested assets of $124 billion. Our investment portfolio of $122 billion, supported by our positive operating cash flow, continues to be of a very high quality, which we expect will continue to support growth in our investment income. At the end of the year, our investment portfolio remained in an unrealized gain position of $2.3 billion after tax. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.2 billion to shareholders, including $905 million in share repurchases and $342 million in dividends. For the year, we returned over $6 billion to shareholders, equaling 112% of our core earnings. This included $4.9 billion in share repurchases or 6.5% of our outstanding shares and dividends of $1.4 billion. As of December 31, $2.6 billion of the share repurchase authorization remains. In November, we issued $600 million of 30-year debt and $1 billion of 40-year debt at a very attractive weighted average cost of under 3%. The proceeds will be used to fund up to $1.1 billion of the purchase price of Cigna's business in Asia Pacific. The remainder will be used for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of $475 million of debt due in March 2023. Book and tangible book value per share increased 1.7% and 2.7%, respectively, from last quarter and 6.1% and 7.6%, respectively, from last year and now stand at all-time high of $139.99 and $94.38 per share, respectively. Our reported ROE for the quarter and the year was 14.4% and 14.3%, respectively. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 17.7% and 15.3%, respectively. While our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 11.6% and 9.9%. Adjusting for the mark-to-market gains on our private equity portfolio, our core operating ROE was 13.1% for the quarter and 13.6% for the year. As I have noted in the past, our investment income is based on many factors. We met our quarterly investment income target of $900 million this quarter after a few quarters of exceeding it, reflecting slightly lower distributions on our PE portfolio compared to recent quarters. We continue to expect our quarterly run rate to be approximately $900 million in 2022. Pre-tax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $275 million, primarily from weather-related events, with about $214 million in the U.S. and $61 million internationally. We had favorable prior period development of $145 million pre-tax, which included $364 million of favorable development for direct COVID-related liabilities from accident year 2020. We recognized a net charge of $375 million related to the $800 million pending settlement with of Boy Scouts of America that we previously announced. The net charge takes into account reinsurance and our previously carried reserve. We also recognized $53 million of adverse development related to asbestos as part of our annual reserve review. Excluding these items, the remaining development was essentially all favorable development in short tail lines principally in our property and A&H lines. Our reserve position remained strong, with net reserves increasing by $3.8 billion or 7.4% in constant dollars for the year. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 98%, primarily reflecting significant net catastrophe loss payments, the seasonality of our crop insurance business and favorable prior period development. Adjusting for these items, our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 78%. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 81%. Our core operating effective tax rate was 15.7% for the quarter and 15.4% for the year. For 2022, we expect our annual core operating effective tax rate will increase slightly to be in the range of 15.5% to 17.5%. I'll turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Hey good morning everybody. I guess, my first question goes back to Evan's comments on tightening terms and conditions and commercial lines and how it's impacted, I guess, a higher quality, but at the same time some premium pressure. Can you maybe talk about -- is this a step up in tightening of terms and conditions that you had this quarter, or were some of the offsets -- favorable offsets you had in prior quarters, have those diminished to some extent? Maybe we can better understand what drove you to call this out this quarter? Evan Greenberg : No. I just gave you -- there's actually -- it's something that happens every quarter and has been happening every quarter. We've been -- terms and conditions have been -- along with pricing are have been a reality for the last couple of years. And the only thing we did was I just refined to give a better sense when I listen to discussions about exposure, there is simply discussion about economic exposure changes generally, and I thought it might be helpful to just, not for the sake of the number, but to sensitize you investors better to the fact that there are two kinds of exposure changes that take place. So I was just I was just doing that not because there was anything particular this quarter, but better for your education. That's it. And it's not something I intend to always do. I haven't done it really in the past and I don't know, I was more ambitious. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And trying to tie it back to the premium growth numbers then, why would have commercial lines premiums slow down sequentially then? Evan Greenberg : Well, why would it slow down sequentially? I mean, it was a great growth quarter. It was a double-digit quarter in commercial lines growth. Wow, that's the eight out of nine quarters. And by the way, the fourth quarter was one of the strongest quarters we've had for growth. And there's a certain seasonality that occurs in commercial lines. But you know what, overall, I think it was an outstanding growth. So there you go. And the market, the market is -- you're in an acute phase of hard market and then you go into different phases of the hard market where it begins to heal, others start writing business and there you go, but an outstanding growth. Yaron Kinar : Right. No, I'm not challenging that. I think -- I certainly didn't want it belittle the growth that you guys achieved. My second question, many insurers are building some extra conservatism into loss trends. I think some management teams have started to quantify that recently. Can you maybe talk about your approach to be the loss trend and whether you're building an extra cushion? Can you quantify that? Evan Greenberg : I'm not going to quantify any of that. What I'm going to say is this, a couple of points. Number one, we have always managed our reserves prudently, conservatively. As you know, we recognize bad news early. We're slow to recognize good news, understanding the development patterns that occur and are not 100% predictable with precision in our business. Secondly, COVID, and we've said this for many quarters, impacted the reporting and the incurred pattern of claims : courts shut down, businesses shut down, et cetera. And to be able to accurately project that is a fool's errand. And so, we've taken the approach since the beginning of COVID that the ultimate trend pattern doesn't change, the reporting pattern may change. And that naturally, as we look at prior year reserve developments as well as our current year picks, is impacted by that. I think, I answered your question. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Thanks for the color. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Mike Zaremski from Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Mike, you maybe on mute. Evan Greenberg : Let's move along. Mike Zaremski : Is it working now? Evan Greenberg : Yes, it's moving. It's working. Mike Zaremski : Sorry about that. So a question on loss cost. Thank you for the color about loss cost. It sounds like it didn't change much sequentially. Curious if there are kind of any major loss cost level distinctions between very old vintages, which seems to be popping up in the news about material losses coming from business written well over a decade ago, kind of versus the more recent five, six, seven-year vintages? I'm wondering if there's any distinction there we should be thinking about? Evan Greenberg : No, not that I -- no. Mike Zaremski : Okay. Evan Greenberg : In a simple word, no. Mike Zaremski : Okay, great. My follow-up question is on capital. Maybe, kind of, post the Cigna deal and the announced Huatai increased stake, if you can update us on the excess capital position and whether the buyback expectation is going to continue in terms of the expectation for the repurchase authorization to be utilized? Evan Greenberg : I'll let Peter answer that. Peter Enns : Sure. Look, for both Cigna and Huatai, in terms of how we're going to finance them, we expect to finance them using existing cash resources and cash flow. We do not expect to issue any additional debt nor issue any equity. And we don't expect either to have any impact on our dividend nor our buybacks. Mike Zaremski : And so no -- is there still an excess capital drag post that or is most excess capital being utilized? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : We don't call it a drag. We maintain our capital position. Our philosophy doesn't change. And we maintain surplus capital for good things. And we're in the risk business, so we maintain for opportunity, and we maintain surplus capital for risk. Operator : And we'll go ahead and move on to our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, you guys have shown some -- a good level of expense ratio improvement about two points over the past two years. Is there room for further improvement there, especially on the G&A side as you guys have earned premium leverage? And can you just give us a sense of where perhaps the expense ratio could go over the longer term? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. I'm not going to give you a forward guidance, Elyse. But I'm going to give you a couple of thoughts. Number one, on one hand, the acquisition ratio has also improved because consumer lines have become a smaller percentage of the total business as commercial lines has grown and consumer lines initially shrank and then has been recovering slowly. So you'll naturally see a change that way and the acquisition ratio over time as consumer lines grows more quickly. On the other hand, on the G&A side, we already run the lowest in the industry. And two things are occurring. One, we are investing for the future, and we are hardly slowing down in that -- in the digitization of the company and the transformation of how we do business. And that's going to -- that pays dividends, and we'll continue to pay dividends. So we will invest. On the other hand, we continue to achieve efficiencies as a result of things like straight-through processing and robotics and other activities. So I'm not going to forecast for the future, but I feel pretty good about where we are in G&A. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. And then my second question, S&P is in the process of rolling out changes to their capital charges. And I was hoping you guys to just give us some thoughts as we're -- I know in the review process with companies now. I think a big component of what they're looking to do relates to changes around diversification. And I would think a company like you guys and especially with the upcoming Cigna deal could screen well from a diversification and capital perspective. But if you can just provide some color there? Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Sure. Elyse, you -- I appreciate your sentiment, but you don't do the model, I would be -- I think it would be great if you want to work for S&P. But Peter, anyway, go ahead. Peter Enns : I mean, I think, Elyse we need to -- they've asked for comment mid-March. And then after that, they're going to go away and make their decisions and publish their model. So we need to let them finish getting their input and doing their work and making their decisions. Based on what we know now, we don't expect any change in consequence to our capital position. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks for the color. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Michael Phillips : Thanks. Good morning. Evan, back to your earlier comments where you\u2019ve ambitiously given the new comments on the exposure and you broke it down between economic and underwriting. How do you -- what are your thoughts on how those two pieces play out for this coming year? Evan Greenberg : I don't know. I'm not going to forecast. Sorry, I can't help you with worksheet that way. I'm not going to forecast both economic exposure change. I mean, I ask the Fed. And nor on the underwriting side, though, I do anticipate that the underwriting side is probably getting closer to a steady state. Michael Phillips : Okay. That makes sense. I get more real rates and that makes sense, I guess. And second question on your release on the COVID, can you give us some characteristics kind of what's behind that? Was that more North America release exposures there that you released reserves or were outside North America? And then what's left, I guess, I think my math says you had about $1 billion left. Is that all still in reserves, or what's the characteristics or what remains for your COVID cover reserves? Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Yeah, we'll give you a little color around that. Paul O'Connell, our Chief Actuary, I'm going to ask him to comment on that. Paul O'Connell: Sure. Thank you. So as we stated in the commentary, we recognized favorable prior period development of $364 million on our 2020 accident year reserves for direct COVID. It was a split, it was split between North America commercial and overseas general. And we had some minor true-ups in product lines like A&H and property, but bulk of it, it really was financial lines that drove the prior period development. At the outset of the pandemic, we modeled losses to these product lines and our projections didn't really anticipate the unprecedented levels of economic stimulus that occurred globally in 2020 and continued into 2021. Though we\u2019ve been observing favorable for reported loss activity that\u2019s been lower than expected but we\u2019ve been delaying reacting to those trends out of caution knowing the delays in the claims process are going to support those. But I think \u2013 and the impact that that has on reporting patterns for claims. So we feel comfortable at this point in time and so we took action in the quarter. We continue to maintain what we think is a sufficient provision for COVID in the aggregate and for these product line and there\u2019s a substantial amount of IBNR included in that carry provision. Michael Phillips : And I guess the remaining piece, is that still -- can you comment on how much of that is North America versus Outside? Evan Greenberg : No, we're not going to split it that way. Michael Phillips : Okay. Evan Greenberg : And -- but the substantial outstanding is in reserves, both case and IBNR. Michael Phillips : Okay. Thank you for comments. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Greg Peters : Good morning. Elyse is a tough competitor, Evan, so I support your proposal to move over to S&P. Sure, she is happy to hear that as well. So I want to pivot back to the top line number, which 13% for the year, we'd like to put that into our models for eternity, but that doesn't seem realistic. So there's two pieces that I was looking for further color on. First, the component of the growth that you think is due just to the reopening of the economies worldwide in 2021 versus 2020? And then secondly, it seems like consumer, there's an opportunity for that to grow in 2022 versus 2021, I'm wondering if you could comment on that as well? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. The first thing comment to say to you is, which I've said before, we each have our hell to live in. I certainly got mine and you've got yours, too. So I can only do so much and you have to divine Oracle, what you think. Look, I can't give you -- I don't have in my head, none of us sitting here right now having our head or actually would be able to guess with any precision how much of the growth was due to economic activity reopening, except as we look at exposure change. And that's not -- we don't have a good handle on that outside the US with precision. And -- on one hand. But the vast, vast majority of our growth was market share and rate and that's just all there is to it. And Chubb is firing on all cylinders that way, and we are dominant competitor to reckon with across geographies and portfolio segments. When I get to the consumer business, the consumer business is going to continue in my judgment to improve as the year goes along. And I tried to give you some color of signs of that that we see. Travel is picking up in most of the regions of the world. Consumer spending and financing activities are returning. Purchases are returning. I mean, we're one of the -- we're the largest cell phone insurer in Europe from what we know and growing quickly in other parts of the world, as an example, we see that beginning to recover and do better as people go to stores to buy cell phones. But I can't predict with any precision because there's a certain volatility to it. So how it's going to move quarter-by-quarter, I can't predict that to you. But what I can tell you is, in everything we see and all of our planning, and then I look at all the new partnerships we put on and continue to put on that open up further strength to it, consumer lines is going to be return as a growth engine as we go forward. What that level is, I can't predict with precision. Greg Peters : Got it. The second question would be on inflation. And I know you commented on it -- well, in your opening comments and then in previous calls, but -- it certainly seems to be consuming a lot of oxygen on conference calls, especially in the personal auto space. And whether it's wage inflation for employees, repair cost inflation, you mentioned housing -- the inflation trends in your home business. What's your -- when you think about this in 2022 and 2023, maybe give us some additional color on your interpretation of what you're seeing in the marketplace and its impact on Chubb? Evan Greenberg : We -- it's interesting. I'll give you a comment on short tail and long tail and that's why I also said, it's not -- the loss environment is hardly benign and then throw into that, you have inflation, you have social inflation or, as you know, and I'm using that word though, I think it's too blunt instrument a word and I disaggregated, but it's casualty-related. You have natural cat and climate change that is causing loss inflation, modeled and non-modeled on the cat side, on the property side of the business as well. And you have cyber, which is a growing exposure in a very hostile environment and that the industry has to continue to come to grips with. At Chubb, I feel good that we're managing and vigilant. And all of our management and vigilance turns into action and continued action because otherwise, it's just a bunch of talk. And I feel good about that in our businesses. When I look at inflation, the way you're asking it, when I look at short tail, it shows up in homeowners. It's not showing up to the same degree in aggregate in commercial property. On the other hand, we see inflation in -- that shows up in severity of loss. And on the other hand, we've seen benefits from frequency of loss ex-cat, and some of that is COVID related, et cetera, we have in our own pricing. So I gave you a loss cost number that is the observable inflation we see today, but we do anticipate and have been anticipating that, of course, what you see generally and general inflation will find its way more into commercial property, and we have considered that in how we reserve claims that come in. Number two, in casualty, on the casualty side, severity in a number of classes continues to increase. And on the other hand, you have had the benefit of reduction from in frequency due to COVID in certain classes of business. We think that is -- it's obvious. The amount of claims per exposure -- per dollar of exposure over time is going to revert to the mean unless something so fundamental in society has changed and that's nothing we can see. And so we continue to recognize that in our pricing and reserves because it's a timing question. And there, I think I gave you a mouthful, Greg, and hopefully\u2026 Greg Peters : You did. Yeah. I mean the other piece would just be on compensation for employees for seeing -- that's being reported that there's inflation pressures there. I'm just curious on your comment on that? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Look we're off the marketplace and over the world, and we\u2019re competing for talent. And I want the best and brightest to work here, and it's a marketplace for that. And certainly, compensation is one of the drivers, also culture and working for a winner and a place that gives you opportunity is also compelling to the kind of person we want to attract. But we have wage inflation, no different than the kind of inflation others are talking about. In aggregate, I see it in the 3.5%, 4% range. Greg Peters : Thank you. Operator : And we'll move on to our next question from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Hi, David. Good morning. David Motemaden : Just a question on the Huatai. Good to see you guys taking your ownership stake or put an agreement in place to take your stake up to 86%. How should we think about the capital that will be deployed in that if it does get approved in 2022? Evan Greenberg : First of all, let's keep in mind, and you said it right, that we have agreements in place. It does require regulatory approval that is not a quick process in China. And it's always fraught with sensitivities. And I can't predict the geopolitical, but I feel good about receiving approvals, and there's a lot of goodwill towards us. In terms of capital, what do you mean? How much have we spent to purchase Huatai, or what are you asking me? David Motemaden : Yeah. Is the price based on the initial deal that you guys struck in 2019 and we can just sort of use that as a guideline or is it something different than that? Evan Greenberg : No. Each tranche is different. I had to negotiate each shareholder differently. David Motemaden : Got it. Yes, and I guess -- okay, so I guess that's still TBD and depends on each tranche, I guess, yes. I guess, we'll just wait and see there. Evan Greenberg : It does. And we'll update you more later in the year about Huatai as we get closer to approvals and all that. We'll give you more information. David Motemaden : Okay, great. And then, maybe there's been a lot of talk on inflation in this call. And I just wanted to just ask a question on the North America personal lines where the current accident year loss ratio had the second straight quarter where it was under 51%. Was there anything one-off in those results or specifically in the quarter's results like non-cat weather, light non-cat weather, or is that representative of a sustainable level just as a result of some of the actions that you've taken there over the past year or so? Evan Greenberg : Yes. So let's -- you're focused on the current accident, year ex-cat in that comment, right, in that question? David Motemaden : That's right. Evan Greenberg : Okay. Look, you set it right on one hand. And -- but let's just extend the thought a little bit. We've taken much rate in portfolio underwriting action over the past few years and that includes much more sophisticated pricing capability. On 2021, get -- don't look at the quarter, look at the year, is an excellent result. And I'm not going to provide forward guidance, as you know. But we do expect the combination and so it's really a combination of continued benefit from our actions, but coupled with some reversion to the mean, given likely beneficial impacts from frequency due to COVID in 2021. And I think that answers your question for you. David Motemaden : Yes, it did. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : We'll move on to our next question from Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. I was hoping to ask a big picture question. Retentions by virtually every company I cover are still at incredible highs, which is unusual for the hard market. But Chubb has taken share. Where do you think, just broadly speaking, the kinds of companies that Chubb is taking share from? And maybe more focus on North America as we -- I know that a little bit better. But I'm just curious as to where you think you're having the most effectiveness from a competitive perspective? Evan Greenberg : We're an equal opportunity competitor. We're taking share -- have been increasing share. And in particular, we're increasing our writings, that's what I care about. Across the board, it's been in most all product lines. It's been most all customer segments, most all geographies, North America and internationally. And it's not -- it's a combination. And remember, when you're looking at high retention rates, and that's why I gave you two numbers, well, it's pretty easy to look at a high retention rate when the level of -- on a premium basis when the level of rate increases are running as they are. And so you get that as a financial number, but it doesn't really tell you on an operating, the operating answer. That's more based on unit retention. And I gave you that, which is very high. So you probably want to be poking around on that. And -- but we have -- we came into this market with a clear mind, knowing our mind, knowing our sense of risk appetite, pricing requirements and across segments, across geographies, and we are ready to jump off the mark. And when we could see that it was conditions that were favorable to our view of risk adjusted return, and that's all we've executed on. And we're doing it relentlessly. COVID be damned. Paul Newsome : Great. Second question\u2026 Evan Greenberg : Chubb has been present in the marketplace. Though all the time or not, it's not a question, but we are present. Paul Newsome : It's been a good year. There's still a question about it. M&A thoughts on the current environment, again, with commercial insurance margins improving as much for most insurers, I think. Do you think there's any change in what you think the sellers will be willing to sell or the environment in general from\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m sorry Paul. Paul Newsome : \u2026pipeline? Evan Greenberg : You didn't come through really clearly to me there. Can you just repeat that? Paul Newsome : Sure, I just asking about the M&A environment and what you think is the current situation in the context of that commercial insurers, for example, are generally seeing some better margins. And I would imagine that means the sellers are less willing to sell every hard market is different. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. I don't know. I'm pretty at rest at the moment. And I don't notice a lot of activity out there at the moment. This is a great time to grow. And we've made a couple of moves that I'm very focused on. And of course, stay tuned. Paul Newsome : Absolute. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Please go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Just also another question on Huatai. Congrats on your progress so far. I'm wondering if you could share with us early thoughts on what you could do as a majority owner in terms of having an immediate impact and what your vision is over the long-term? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Tracy, I don't see it as really an immediate impact. I don't think of it that way. This is a very rare asset for a foreigner to be able to purchase. It has a lot of potential with it. When you think about its non-life, it's life, it's asset management, mutual funds, retail and institutional, have licenses to manage pension money, have a license to manage insurance companies' assets. It has 600 offices throughout the provinces. It's reasonably small, $1.25 billion, $1.5 billion of P&C premium, about $1 billion of life premium with now 35,000, 40,000 agents. The growth potential, if you believe, which I do, that China will continue to grow and we'll continue to emerge, though it won't be in a straight line, but that as a society and the size and scale, it requires a much larger insurance and financial services industry and requires much greater private sector participation. They can't do it in a state-controlled manner or just won't sustain the kind of growth that it requires. And that over time, China moves to the left, it moves back to the center, a little more to the right, that will occur. And then when I look at Huatai itself, its potential within any of its businesses is huge, but it takes time. It takes time to effect strategy, train people, implement strategy and be patient that you take risk when you can get adequately paid and you don't break discipline. All of that is in front of us. And I look at it over a five to seven-year time horizon. And it's the -- it's one of the next great peaks for Chubb to climb and we will. Tracy Benguigui : That was great color. I realize you've been asked a number of questions on excess capital and there's always complexities like S&P capital model. I have my own views. I published that. I know you have future capital commitments like Cigna and Huatai. Maybe an easier question to ask and you've announced this before. Just looking at the fourth quarter ROE, could you just remind us this quarter how many points you would attribute to excess capital? I know last quarter, you said 1.5 points. Evan Greenberg : It's about a-point-and-a-half. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Scott : Hi. Good morning. First one I had is just on the paid claims. I heard the paid-to-incurred ratio that you referenced. And I just -- I thought I'd ask if you can frame for us how much, if it all, paid claims are still coming in below where they would normally be in a non-pandemic environment? And over what time period do you expect that to normalize? Evan Greenberg : No, we're not going into any detail like that. Alex Scott : Got it, okay. And then maybe a different question on the Cigna business. Can you just give an update on the time at closing? I know you mentioned first half, I think there's a series of countries with approvals. And if there's any update to your thinking on earnings contribution and there's any lingering COVID impacts to think about as that comes online? Evan Greenberg : No, I don't see -- not that I noticed some lingering COVID impacts. And timing is going to be in the first half of the year. That's as far as we're going to pin it. And we'll update you a bit more when we close on an updated view of what we might expect. Alex Scott : Got it. Evan Greenberg : But we're not going to do it maturely because then I'm speculating, and we're not going to do that. The one thing I will tell you is there's not going to be a rolling close. There's going to be one close. Alex Scott : Understood. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : That's why -- thing you're saying is not exactly relevant tangentially so, but not in the way you might be thinking. Alex Scott : Got it, all right. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : And we'll go ahead and take our last question from Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Just, I guess, one more follow-up on Huatai. And I guess I was just thinking, in a lot of the countries you're in, you really understand the tort environment, your underwriting environment, the legal environment, risks like that. How do you feel about insurance contracts, things like that, tort law in China relative to some of the other places you're operating? And is it mostly property coverage at this juncture in non-life or is it casualty, too? Evan Greenberg : Well, every country -- I mean, if you ask me the -- my confidence in the rule of law globally. Well, there's a wide spectrum of variation among all the countries of the world, including starting right here in the United States, where people legally torture the contract to death for getting the intent of coverage. So I wouldn't throw a stone at China on that basis. And I'd say that China fits right into the spectrum of countries that way. We've been doing business there. I've been doing business there for 30 years, and the company has been doing business there for 20 years now. So we know something about it. With that said, casualty related coverage is no different than the court system in China. And commercial law and law around individual responsibility that is evolving and has been evolving and those portfolios have been growing as well. And we underwrite though, understanding the risk environment. As an example, and I'll just give you one example and just to add a little color to it. You're going to underwrite D&O in the United States, well, you get pretty darn good accounting disclosure. And if I'm going to underwrite D&O in China, buyer beware, there's not the same level, nor veracity in many instances to accounting disclosure. We understand that. It doesn\u2019t mean that it's a binary answer either. So I will leave you with that to chew on, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Appreciate. Thanks for the color. I know oftentimes, you don't talk a lot about what you're doing with reinsurance. But, yeah, I guess I was just curious, getting to the 1/1 renewal, is there a potential that next year you might retain a little bit more and that could be an additional net premium growth tailwind? Evan Greenberg : Yes, things are pretty steady. That's as much as -- Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : And with that, that does conclude our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Karen for any closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thanks, everyone, for your time and attention this morning. We look forward to speaking with you again next quarter. Have a great day. Operator : And with that, that does conclude today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]  Now for opening remarks and introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome to our March 31, 2022, first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer; and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had an excellent start to the year with record per share operating earnings and underwriting results, double-digit global P&C commercial lines premium growth, accompanied by rate increases in excess of loss cost, and improving growth in our consumer business globally. Core operating income in the quarter was $1.64 billion or a record $3.82 per share, up 52% on a per share basis over prior year. In the quarter, we produced simply outstanding underwriting results. $1.28 billion of underwriting income was more than double prior year with a combined ratio of 84.3%, both records. Our P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding catastrophes, was 83.5%, a 1.7 point improvement over prior year, with about 1 point from loss ratio improvement and the balance, expense driven. On the investment income side, adjusted net investment income was circa $900 million for the quarter. We are predominantly a buy-and-hold fixed income investor. And given rising interest rates and widening spreads, we expect investment income to increase from here. Every 100 basis points increase in interest rates for us is worth, on an annualized basis, about $1.2 billion in pretax investment income. We have a portfolio duration of about 4 years. So a rise in rates begins to earn in reasonably quickly. Peter will have more to say about other financial items. Let me say a few words about the Russian-Ukraine war. The events unfolding before our eyes are a human tragedy of epic proportions with profound geopolitical implications. Our actual incurred losses to date from the event are de minimis. And from all we know today, while additional losses may develop over time, this will not represent a meaningful event for Chubb. Integration planning around the Cigna transaction is quite active and remains on track. We expect to receive regulatory approvals leading to a close during the second quarter. There are no changes of substance to the guidance we gave you, and any changes are modestly positive. We will update you after closing. Now turning to growth. The rate environment and inflation, global P&C premiums, which exclude agriculture, increased 8.8% in the quarter on a published basis or 10.7% in constant dollars, with commercial up 12% and consumer up 8%. Growth in the quarter was broad-based with contributions from virtually all commercial businesses globally. From large corporate to middle market to small, from traditional to specialty in most all regions of the world, commercial P&C premiums, excluding agriculture for North America were up 10.5%, while in overseas general, they grew 13 in constant dollars, but we then had 5 points of FX impact to the published results. Agriculture premiums were down in the quarter because of a return of premium to the government. It's based on our level of profitability for the '21 crop year. This is a favorable and expected development. You will recall that crop insurance is a business where revenue and losses are shared with the government. For the '22 crop year, we will have a substantial increase in premium revenue over last year, given commodity prices and other factors. Most of this will be recognized in the third quarter. Returning to commercial P&C. In terms of rate, the level of rate increase remains strong, and as I have said before, is naturally moderating as individual portfolios achieve adequacy and additional rate is then required to keep pace with loss costs. The rate environment is reasonably orderly. And in aggregate, rate increases remain in excess of observed and projected loss costs. In the quarter, in North America, total P&C premiums, excluding agriculture, grew 9.6%, again, with commercial up 10.5%. Growth this quarter in commercial Lines was led by our middle market and small commercial business with premiums up almost 12%, followed by our major accounts in specialty division, which grew 9.5%. Total exposure change was a positive 1 point in the quarter, a combination of an increase in economic exposure of about 3.2% due to higher payroll, sales and other economically sensitive activity, and on the other hand, a decline in exposure due to underwriting changes, such as increased attachment points, and higher deductibles, which is a good thing. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses is 100% on a premium basis, very strong. Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines 8.7%. Major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased 9.3%. General casualty rates were up over 15.5% and varied by class of casualty, while risk management-related primary comp and casualty rates were up 3.7%. Property rates were up 9.1%, and financial lines rates were up 13.9% and varied by subcategory. In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by more than 11%. Rates were up 13.3% in casualty, about 10% -- sorry, in property. Casualty was up 10%, and financial lines rates were up 15.4%. And in our middle-market business, rates increased 7.7% or 9.5% excluding comp. Rates for property were up over 8%. Casualty rates, excluding comp, were up 8.5%, and comp rates were down 1.5%. The comp pricing, which is rate plus exposure was up over 9%. And finally, financial lines in middle market were up 17%. We are trending loss costs at 6%, and it varies by line. In general, we're trending loss costs in the rates we charge for short-tail classes just over 6.5%, though the actual is running lower. In long-tail, excluding workers' comp, we continue to trend at a 6% rate overall. And our first dollar workers' comp book is trending between 4% and 4.5% In short-tail classes, we are actively monitoring property valuations, loss costs as they develop and the real-time drivers of cost or changes in inflation, labor, parts and supplies as well as the delays caused by supply chain disruptions given the length of time to repair or replace. This can add additional pressure on costs. In long-tail lines, we actively monitor and study both frequency and severity of each class. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Retail commercial P&C premiums grew 15.5% in constant dollars, while our London wholesale business grew just over 5.5%. Retail and commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up 18.5% in Latin America, followed by growth of about 16.5% in our U.K. and Europe division, and Asia-Pac was up 14.5%. Internationally, like in the U.S. We continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, rates increased in the quarter, 10%. While in our London wholesale business, rates increased 9%, both varied by class and by region as well as country within region. Outside North America, loss costs are currently trending about 4%, though that varies by class of business in country. In general, loss costs for short-tail classes are running just under 4%. And we anticipate this to increase. In long-tail, we are trending at about a 4.5% rate. International consumer lines growth in the quarter continued to recover from the pandemic's impact on consumer-related activity, and premiums increased about 9.5%, though FX then scrubs 6 points off the growth rate. Premiums in our International A&H business grew 8.6% in constant dollars. Our international personal lines business grew over 10%. Latin America led the way with A&H and Personal Lines growth of over 18% and 17.5%, respectively, while Asia-Pac's growth for these two product lines was over 6% and 24.5%, respectively. Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up about 7.5%. Last year's reinsurance reinstatement premiums, due to cat losses, had a negative impact on growth. Adjusted for that was other onetime items, our underlying growth was about 5.5% in the quarter. Our true high net worth client segment, the heart of our business, grew over 13% in the quarter, driven by a flight to quality of competitors leaving certain markets, while overall retention was very strong at nearly 99%. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing, which includes rate and exposure of 12.3%, while homeowners loss costs are running in the 11% range. In our Asia-focused international life insurance business, net premiums plus deposits were flat in constant dollar, but will increase in future quarters. While net premiums in our Global Re business were up 22%. In sum, we had an outstanding quarter all around, and we are off to a great start to the year. As I look ahead, I remain optimistic and confident in the things we can control by way of naturally growing more cautious given the world around us. Economic growth, general inflation and central bank actions and the war come to mind. We will continue to capitalize unfavorable underwriting conditions for our commercial P&C businesses globally. Consumer lines growth should continue to recover. As interest rates rise, our investment income will as well. And as I stated last quarter, our strategic investments, including the acquisition of Cigna, and likely later in the year, Huatai, will provide us with greater revenue and earnings growth opportunities. I'll now turn the call over to Peter, and then we'll be back to take your questions. Peter Enns : Good morning, everyone. As you've just heard from Evan, we are starting the year with an exceptional quarter with strong top line growth and record P&C underwriting results that produced operating cash flow of $2.4 billion for the quarter. Turning to our balance sheet and capital management. Our financial position remains exceptionally strong with $73 billion in total capital. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of over $5 billion. I would note, S&P and Fitch both reaffirmed our AA ratings and stable outlook, reflecting our strong financial position. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.3 billion or 82% of core earnings to shareholders, including $1 billion in share repurchases and $340 million in dividends. As of March 31, $1.6 billion of the $5 billion share repurchase authorization remains available through June 30. We plan to seek authorization from our Board for our annual share repurchase program prior to that date. During the quarter, rising interest rates caused a mark-to-market pretax unrealized loss of $4.7 billion or 4.5% of our fixed income portfolio. As a comparison, the Barclays Global Aggregate Bond Index declined by 6.2% for the quarter. This adverse mark-to-market movement of $3.8 billion after tax or 6.5% of our book value drove the decline in book and tangible book value per share of 4.4% and 6.8%, respectively. Excluding the unrealized mark-to-market in the investment portfolio, book and tangible book value per share increased by 2.1% and 2.9%, respectively. As noted in our supplement, the market rate on our fixed maturity portfolio was 3.4% for the quarter end, exceeding our book yield of 3%. As of last Friday, the market reinvestment rate had increased to 3.8%. Reflecting this rising rate environment, we now expect our adjusted investment income for the second quarter to be in the range of $915 million to $925 million, and then it will go up from there. Our reported ROE for the quarter was 13.6%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 17.1%. Our core operating ROE was 11.3%. Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $333 million, including $138 million for Australian storms, $65 million for wildfires in Colorado and $130 million for other global weather-related events. We had favorable prior period development of $240 million pretax, essentially all in short-tail lines of $228 million, principally in A&H, property and surety. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 91% or 80 in prior period development. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 16.9%, and we continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for '22 to be in the range of 15.5% to 17.5%. Now to finish with a couple of discrete items. First, relative to our exposure in Russia. Our Russian entities have been separated operationally from Chubb and are managing their affairs independently and have been deconsolidated. During the quarter, we impaired the full carrying value these entities and have recognized a realized loss of $87 million. Relative to Cigna, we have amended our purchase agreement to remove the joint venture in Turkey. This amendment will have a de minimis impact on the transaction. As Evan mentioned, we will provide an update with more specifics on the acquisition during the second quarter earnings call. I'll now turn it back to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will begin with Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : And congratulations on the quarter. I know I've asked similar questions in the past, so I hope you have a little bit of patience this time around. You have, what, the investment environment, adding a good 150 basis points ROE for every 100 basis points of interest rate improvement. The loss ratios look great. You're still earning well over trend. At what point do you start taking the foot off of the rate cut off or go after more exposure as opposed to pushing for rate? Evan Greenberg : We don't think of it that way exactly. I mean, first of all, the market itself is a governor on rate. We're in the competitive market. We pursue the rate we think we need, and that actually, it's the other way around, that actually determines the outcome of growth. We're underwriters first. And the rate we require for both exposure and adequacy of rate to exposure plus inflation as part of that, that's the starting point for us. Yaron Kinar : And then my second question, I think for the last several quarters, if we look at the rate environment in commercial internationally, it's been higher than in North America, yet the loss trends are lower internationally. Can you maybe help us think through why that would be? Is it because of the lower interest rate environment overseas? Or are there other drivers there? Evan Greenberg : Well, you know what? You have 55 countries that we're operating in around the globe. So there is no one neat simple answer. On the long-tail side, most countries don't have the kind of legal environment that we have. There are a few that come to mind that are similar like Australia and the U.K. The balance, it's a much lower inflationary environment on loss costs for long-tail lines of business. And then short tail, it really varies by jurisdiction. And Europe is very different than Australia, which will be very, very different than, say, Malaysia or Korea in terms of parts and supplies and the nature of short-tail losses. So it's a mixed bag. And that's why we're on the ground operating locally in every jurisdiction around the world. We know the markets. We're part of the market. And so we approach from the idiosyncrasies of that local market when we think about adequacy of pricing and underwriting. Operator : We'll now move to our next question, which will come from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Evan, as you just said, you're part of a pretty competitive environment and that kind of government and a lot of things. Given the decelerating rate environment for the industry, and I think it's pretty unique times with loss trends that are accelerating pretty rapidly. Do you think there's an opportunity for that for the industry to find pockets where rates will actually convert and accelerate again sooner than they otherwise would have? Evan Greenberg : Look, it's certainly possible that as losses in certain areas or exposures increase, certainly the industry -- and you see it in different areas. Look at personal auto right now, industry responds. Look at commercial auto, industry responds. Look at cyber, industry responds. So as loss costs show themselves or the spector is on your doorstep, the industry does respond. Look at property, property continues to increase at a -- overall, a double-digit rate. Part of that is a reflection of a revised views of cat exposure, given climate change. And that is pretty universally recognized by good underwriters in model changes that drive inflation and loss cost. So, I'm answering your question by giving you tax that, I think, make it self evident. Michael Phillips : This is more for actually for you in your book and specific to your North American Commercial Lines book. When you look at that book, Evan, do you step back and say, \"Gee, I wish we had more of this.\" Or either there's holes of opportunity in holes -- too strong of a word, but pockets of opportunity, either size of accounts or lines of business where I wish we did more of this in North American partial lines. Evan Greenberg : It's more of a personal question. If you know me, you know my natural stage is not at rest. And we're an ambitious group. And we have, let's call it, 1% or less of the global insurance market. We're rounding that. We're still in that regard. There's plenty of growth opportunity for this company. And we're not -- really under everything we do, there's plenty of opportunity to improve ourselves. So we're on an endless posh. Operator : Now moving to Greg Peters with Raymond James. Greg Peters : So the first question, and I know you mentioned this in your comments and then in your letter, the political, the war, political tensions, lockdown, supply chain issues. I think you mentioned in your letter, the potential for a new world order. So my question is the strategy difference of being a global reinsurer or not reinsurer, global insurer, versus being more -- having more of a regional focus. And I'm wondering if that narrative has changed or your thinking has changed because of all of these wild swings and what we're seeing in the press in reality. Evan Greenberg : Nothing. Nothing has changed. We take a medium-term and longer-term view of opportunity and strategy when we think about growth for the company. Let's take Asia. Asia is where probably more than one-half to two-thirds of the world's growth will likely take place over the next decade, two decades and longer out. Chubb's presence and increasing presence there is a good thing. It will allow us to capitalize on those opportunities, and that means that's where the insurance industry is going to grow. When I think about Latin America, yes, it has a volatility signature to it that is more extreme, but we recognize that and how we approach the business. But the trend line over time is increased growth opportunity for a number of reasons in particular. And so no, it doesn't give me pause for thought on the underlying thesis, but the world goes through periods of greater volatility in rest and sometimes a little less. You recognize that and you build that into your thinking when you approach your strategy and tactics and how you expose your company, but it is a natural consequence of the strategy you take on when you go global that you will expose yourself. I would also say this, I don't think that any country or region of the world, given the interconnectedness of the globe is immune. We're certainly not immune at home. And if you're in the United States as a U.S.-only insurer, you haven't insulated yourself from the global issues by any means. Just look at inflation. And by the way, the war in Ukraine, with cyber that goes across border. So we all live on the same planet, nowhere to hide, but Greg Peters : Peter, in your comments, you talked about the capital returns in the quarter. I think you said 80-plus percent of the earnings was returned to shareholders. When we think about how -- and obviously, it's going to ebb and flow between quarters, but is that sort of like the general framework that you guys are thinking about absent some major M&A opportunity on a go-forward basis? Peter Enns : I'd say that was just an outcome I was indicating, and we have a capital framework, which Evan has been clear on the past, which is we will hold capital for risk and opportunity and return capital beyond that to shareholders. So we will reauthorize with our Board's permission a new program in the second quarter, and we'll report on that on that basis. But there's no change to anything, and that 83% or 82% was an outcome. Operator : We'll now hear from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Evan, in your annual report, you also talked about achieving an ROE of about 13% in 2023 and kind of heading north from there. So when you make that statement, how are you thinking about the rate versus trend environment playing out over the next couple of years? Do you see it still a good glide path for written rate to rain in excess of loss trend? Evan Greenberg : I didn't -- we did all our inputs. I'm not -- at least I'm not going to go to specific items, but all of the -- our own view of market outlook is baked into that statement. Glide path, I think, is right that rates will continue to moderate, but with an asteric on it. It depends on the line of business, and it depends on the loss cost environment. And I would expect that the industry would respond. And then keep in mind, if there are -- if there were any classes where rates are in excess of that, which is required to earn an adequate risk-adjusted return on capital, then you might see in some of those classes, and you see it. You always see it. You see it now that there is a little rate giveback, which is natural also. So we imagine in a word, a fairly orderly marketplace. But it's a marketplace. And we also now a marketplace always has a certain signature of chaos to it. And that's baked into our thinking. Elyse Greenspan : And then in terms of growth, right, you guys saw almost 11% global P&C that's ex add growth in the quarter. Obviously, there was some impact of FX there. But as we think about the global economies improving, consumers is bouncing back, would you expect premium growth to remain kind of within that level or perhaps pick up from here? Evan Greenberg : Nice try, Elyse. You know I don't give forward guidance, but I remain quite confident in Chubb's ability to outperform. Elyse Greenspan : But am I right in thinking that consumer just has some tailwinds, right, just given the environment and the headwinds that, that business, I guess, has faced over the past couple of years? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I think you're reasonably right. It varies by region, but you see the trend, follow the footprints and where we have been going quarter-on-quarter. And I think that's a reasonably good way to think about it. Operator : Our next question will come from David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Evan, I just had a question a bit on the exposure change, specifically in North America commercial. It sounded like that detracted around 2 points from growth this quarter, which obviously at close to 11% was still good. But I'm wondering if you could talk a bit more about some of the underwriting actions that you've been taking. I know this is something you constantly work on, but it feels like it was a bit more of a concerted effort or it has been more of a concerted effort over the last year or so. So just wondering where we are in this exposure management. And is this something that is going to continue to be a drag going forward? Are we through most of it? And maybe secondly, if we could think about how to quantify the benefit to margins from these changes, whether that be on both underlying or cat load? Evan Greenberg : Yes. So I think, David, you didn't get it quite right. It didn't detract 2 points. In fact, it added about 1 point. What I gave you was 1 point of exposure growth in commercial lines, North America. I told you about 3.2 points of that was economic. And then there was an offset from underwriting, which we can measure, and that it was a change in terms and conditions and deductibles, et cetera. And it's not some event over the last year. It's over a more extended period of time. In the hard market, you can wanted the tools you have and that the clients want because they're getting a lot of price and rate increase. Deductibles and attachment points as an example, they don't move for years during a softer part of the market cycle, yet inflation is relentless, even if it's 2 points or 3 points. It's year on year on year. And so what a $1 million deductible was worth 10 years ago is hardly what it's worth today, and so you go. And clients in a hard market, they understand dollar swapping. They don't want to swap dollars. And so you correct for that. It's not just a rate that occurs. There is this rational correction of structural terms with your clients. And that's the change in deductible and attachment points as just to cite those in particular. So you got mental model. In terms of margin, nice try. I'm not going there. And though we do quantify it quite precisely to ourselves in most classes. And I think I answered it. I want to go back on Elyse's. And Elyse, not to -- being gauging. I expect consumer to continue to recover and to continue to show improved growth. The only thing I can't control is a war and any area that may go into recession. But from what I can see right now, I expect it to continue to recover. Peter Enns : Anything further, David? David Motemaden : And I guess, have you seen any, obviously, higher rates, higher interest rates is helping ROEs across the industry. Have you seen any competitors picking up their aggressiveness in terms of pricing, just as we've had interest rates move higher here? Or has that -- obviously, it's still a very uncertain environment. Inflation is still very high. Has that -- have you seen any evidence of the competitive environment picking up? Evan Greenberg : David, think about it. They've just started rising relatively short period ago. Portfolios have to turn over to actually earn it in. And they moved very, very quickly. And by the way, on one side is interest rates. And on the other side is inflation, and the industry needs to stay ahead on inflation. So no, the answer is I have not seen that. Operator : Moving on to Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Ryan Tunis : I don't want to -- the rest in Ukraine conflict, Evan. In the annual letter, one thing that stood out to me was the fact that here, in terms of market leader in a lot of political risk class, as you mentioned, you remote subsidiary. I think it's called sovereign risk. So I guess I was pleasantly surprised, but in a good way, that losses from Russia and Ukraine were de minimis. So first part is can you just help us understand how you managed to avoid losses tied to that? And second of all, what are the types of opportunities you're seeing on the back end of it? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Opportunities begin to emerge in political risk, but we're pretty conservative and cautious underwriters in the class and the way we approach it. We know our minds clearly. Look, more loss may develop in that area. I can't tell you. If I knew, we would have taken -- we would have recognized. And -- but given events, losses and further exposures may develop in the political risk area, given confiscations or ex appropriations or inability to use an asset. We are in touch with all our clients. And so far, to date, we don't see circumstance, individual circumstance that translates possibly. If it does happen, given our aggregate of exposure in total, because we watch and always have our aggregations by country, by industry, by type, whether it is ensuring debt or it's ensuring equity, whether it's ensuring currency and convertibility. We're very careful in how we think about the construction that way. And so -- and if there is loss to emerge in the future, which I just don't know, it will be -- it won't be a big event for Chubb. We don't have huge limits on any 1 client on a net basis. And so in aggregate, that's why I made that statement that it may develop. If it happens, it happens over an extended period of time. And the aggregate amount, it won't be a big event for Chubb. Ryan Tunis : And then my follow-up, I guess, very strong underlying loss ratio improvement in the commercial segments. Is it fair to say that pretty much all that is from the earned pricing versus loss trend dynamic? Or was there anything else that you'd point to that might have made that outside first quarter? Evan Greenberg : No, no, nothing, no. It's really in long-tail lines, you're in the first quarter of the year, it's based off of peg-loss ratios that you select. And in short-tail lines, virtually the same. And there's nothing we see underlying, and there was -- there were no onetime or anomalous items that contributed. Very broad, it was the resilience of it and the quality of it, I was -- I'm gratified to see. And it's a testament to all my colleagues is the broad-based nature of it. Operator : Now moving to Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Paul Newsome : Congratulations on the quarter. The 6% loss trend that you were talking about, does that include the A&H book? And I am just wondering if you make -- if there's a difference or you can contrast the claims inflation trends you're seeing on the property casualty -- pure property casual book versus what we're seeing on the A&H book. I guess sort of the corollary question to that is if there is a difference. Does the way we think about sort of aggregate, can host trends change from Chubb when you closes deal with you. Evan Greenberg : Paul, let me help you with that. What I gave you was the commercial lines business, and I gave you short-tail. Included in the commercial business is a very small A&H book. Actually, I think you can virtually see the premiums. So it hardly swings any stick. Beyond that, I'm not going into any more parts and pieces. In fact, I think I was more transparent than most are who are reported. So I've gone as far as only we go in terms of individual minds or any of that. But again, A&H is -- hardly swings any stick in the trend numbers, because the 6 was in North America now, and it was North America commercial. Operator : Next question will come from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Alex Scott : First question I had for you is just to see if you could describe what you're seeing with court reopenings? And if that's having any impact, I guess, either positive or negative on just the updated view of loss cost trends that are sort of separate from the CPI-type inflation? Evan Greenberg : What did you just say? I'm sorry. What was the first part of that? Alex Scott : Sure. I'll repeat it. Sorry. I was interested if you could describe what you were seeing with court reopenings? And how that's impacting loss cost trends, either positive or negative? Evan Greenberg : We're not -- we're seeing in an increase in frequency what we would expect with court openings, and we're seeing more adjudication of claims given court openings. Nothing is impacting trends. Alex Scott : And the second question I had was just on the cyber insurance. And I guess a, are you seeing anything there? And b, the war exclusion language you have in your policies. Could you just describe if that's changed at all since sort of 2017 and things maybe learned from the outcome with Merck? And whether the language would be more protective against events like what happened in 2017? Evan Greenberg : First of all, let me work backwards, and then I'm going to come to the first part because let's be precise with each other. First of all, Merck. Merck was not a cyber insurance policy. Merck was a property insurance policy. And I wish those who are thinking about this or writing about this externally would put their heads around that, that it was property insurance, not cyber insurance, huge difference. And I hope that helps you. Secondly, when you started by saying, am I seeing anything there in cyber, what do you mean, am I seeing anything there? Help me and then I'll help you. Alex Scott : Sorry, have you received any claims that are at all associated with the conflict in Ukraine and Russia? Evan Greenberg : The largest single factor territory of attack into the United States for the last number of years has been Russia. Clearly, when it comes to ransomware attack, more comes out of Russia than any other jurisdiction in the world. In fact, China is not a source of that. China's more a source of espionage. And so it hasn't abated, and it hasn't increased actually from what we see. And when we talk to the experts, those in the cybersecurity industry, there are certain changes of patterns that I won't go into. But overall, it was a hostile environment and it continues to be in that regard. It has a certain frequency and severity signature to it. We haven't seen anything systemic. And I think you probably know that because otherwise, you'd have been reading about it in the New York Times. Operator : Next question is from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Evan, I'm trying to understand with the Cigna businesses, when -- or if interest rates rise in those markets, does that get typically offset by more aggressive pricing? Or does that translate into higher returns? Evan Greenberg : In which businesses? Meyer Shields : In the businesses that you're buying from Cigna. Evan Greenberg : No. Pricing doesn't really change. It's very independent of interest rate environment. This is not long -- this is not savings-oriented business. For the most part, it is fundamentally a risk business. It's a morbidity business, to be clear, and the vast majority of it. Think about supplemental health-related, dread-disease related, there is an element of ROP, of which is a return to premium power. It has a savings element to it. But that is -- that's a filed rate and it changes very slowly. So no, it's not an interest -- to put it in a word, Meyer, it's not an interest-sensitive business. Meyer Shields : And then I don't know if it's too early for this. I suspect not. Has the -- has Chubb's prop book changed at all this year because of the commodity prices? In other words, the mix by state, by commodity? Evan Greenberg : No, it has not. We have 20-some-odd percent market share in crop in the United States. That's a huge tanker. That thing moves pretty slowly if you're thinking about change and exposure, which in that sense, you'd be thinking about change in mix of crop. You'd be thinking about territory change. And the only change in mix of crop comes in the aggregate to the degree that farmers change their behaviors, and it aggregates to something significant like a change from corn to soybeans, et cetera. But we generally see that most every year, a bit of that on the margin. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will now hear from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : I have a couple of quick questions here for you. First, I'm just curious, looking at the ceded premium in your North American business, up pretty large on a year-over-year basis. Was that just a timing issue? Or is there something else going on? Maybe more of an opportunity here to buy some less expense in reinsurance and put some good margin in place. Evan Greenberg : Always looking for that. But no, there was nothing -- it was just a mix and an anomalous in the quarter. It bounced around a little bit, as you know. Brian Meredith : And then I guess my second question, I'm just curious, looking out over the next kind of 6 to 12 months, balance sheet is obviously in much better shape for a lot of these P&C insurance companies. Pricing maybe we're kind of in the seventh to eighth inning. What's your view with respect to the M&A environment out there and the opportunities that may be presented to you? I know you've got a couple of larger ones internationally, but I'm sure you've got the capabilities to do lots of M&A. Evan Greenberg : Yes. I -- and I gather you're talking about the industry, Brian, my view of it, not Chubb. Brian Meredith : Yes. Evan Greenberg : I don't have a firm view about it, a clear view. I would say, on one hand, cost of capital has gone up. And so the bar goes up. Most companies or lot of companies their balance sheet learning powers are in pretty good shape. And most of the M&A in the industry, in my mind, cloaked in the word strategic is actually more done out of weakness where people feel pressured, and they want to continue growth. They have a balance sheet whole problem, et cetera. And I don't see a lot of impetus for M&A in a broad sense. And there's more risk in the environment right now, remember that. And so people will be a little cautious. You'll see -- where you'll see it will be more in small and midsized I doubt you'll see much in anything of a large size, but who the heck knows. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this will conclude your question-and-answer session for today. I'll be happy to turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for any closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Thank you. Operator : With that, ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude your conference for today. We do thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions]. For opening remarks and introduction, I would like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer. Please go ahead, ma'am. Karen Beyer : Thank you and welcome to our June 30, 2022, second quarter earnings conference call.  Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters.  We will also refer today to non-GAAP measures -- financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement.  Now I would like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team.  And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had a very strong quarter with record operating income driven by outstanding underwriting and investment results as well as double-digit, constant dollar P&C premium growth. Pricing was strong and exceeded loss costs in commercial lines, even as we increased the inflation factors we are using in our loss ratios in anticipation of future increases to loss cost.  Meanwhile, growth in our consumer businesses continued to accelerate. Core operating income in the quarter was a record $1.8 billion or $4.20 per share, up 16% over prior year. For the year, we have produced over $8 per share, up nearly 31%. Our second quarter underwriting results were simply lights out : $1.4 billion of underwriting income, which was up 21% over prior, with a published combined ratio of 84%, both record results; catastrophe losses in the quarter were reasonably right -- light relative to our expected losses and virtually flat with last year's second quarter; the P&C current accident year combined ratio, excluding cats, was 83.5%, a nearly 2-point improvement over prior year.  On the other side of the balance sheet, adjusted net investment income was a record $950 million for the quarter. As you know, we are predominantly a buy-and-hold fixed-income investor. Given rising interest rates and widening spreads, investment income is and will continue to rise.  Our reinvestment rate is now averaging 4.7% against a portfolio yield of 3.2%. We've begun to thoughtfully and meaningfully accelerate the turnover of our portfolio in a targeted manner so that we can put cash to work more quickly at higher yields.  Spreads have moved to more historical averages among the various fixed-income classes. And the wind-down of QE could create more volatility and put more pressure on spreads in the future, which would benefit us. Peter will have more to say about these and other financial items.  As you saw, we completed the acquisition of the Cigna business. As we had previously announced, the addition of Cigna's A&H and life business in Asia will be immediately accretive to core operating income per share and ROE. We have spent the past 6 to 8 months planning the integration to generate the revenue and earning power the combination of our businesses together in each country should achieve. We are off to a rapid start and are beginning to execute.  Having just come back from Asia and met with the teams in Korea and Thailand, morale among our new and existing colleagues is quite high, and there's a great sense of optimism in what the future holds for our business in the region. Our Cigna colleagues who are joining us, starting leadership, are a great fit with Chubb and our culture. Now turning to growth in the rate environment. Total P&C premiums globally increased 9% in the quarter on a published basis or 11% in constant dollars, with commercial up 12% and consumer up 8%. Growth in the quarter remains broad based with contributions from virtually all commercial businesses globally, from large corporate to middle market to small, from traditional to specialty, and most all regions of the world. Commercial P&C premiums for North America were up 12.5% or 8.7% excluding agriculture. While in Overseas General, commercial lines grew 13% in constant dollar. And we then scrub 6 points of FX to arrive at the published result.  Agriculture premiums were up 44% in the quarter driven overwhelmingly by crop insurance growth. Commodity prices plus growth in market share produced this result. Looking forward, we will have a very strong crop insurance revenue growth in the third quarter as well.  In terms of the Commercial P&C rate environment, market conditions overall remained favorable, while the level of rate increases is moderating. The vast majority of our portfolio is achieving favorable risk-adjusted returns, and additional rate is therefore required primarily to keep pace with loss costs, which are hardly benign.  The rate environment is naturally becoming a bit more competitive, particularly in certain casualty-related classes as more carriers seek to now grow. The market is reasonably disciplined, and I expect it will remain so given not only the specter of loss cost inflation, but the presence of other risk exposures such as climate change, the war in Ukraine, the litigation environment, cyber and the overall cost of reinsurance. Plenty of reminders to managements to get paid for the exposure underwritten.  In the quarter in North America, total Commercial P&C premiums, excluding agriculture, grew 8.7%. Growth this quarter in commercial lines was led by our Major Accounts & Specialty Division, which grew about 10.5%, followed by our middle market and small commercial business, which grew about 6.5%. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was a very strong 101% on a premium basis.  Overall rates increased in North America commercial lines 7%, while total pricing, which includes rate and exposure, increased over 10.5%. Remember, most but not all of the exposure change helps to ameliorate loss costs.  In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased over 8% with pricing up 11.6%. General casualty rates were up nearly 13% and varied by class of casualty. While risk management-related comp in GL were up about 4%. Property rates were up around 9% and financial lines rates were up nearly 7.5%.  In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased by just under 10% with pricing up over 14%. Property rates were up over 13%. Casualty was up 8.5% and financial lines rates were up 9.5%.  In our middle market business, rates increased nearly 7%, excluding comp, with pricing up about 9%. Rates were -- for property were up 5%. Casualty rates were up over 7%. And comp rates were down 4.3%. However, comp pricing was up over 5% when taking into account exposure change. And finally, financial lines rates were up over 10%.  Turning to loss costs for a minute. We increased our loss cost trends in North America to 6.5% in anticipation of rising costs, meaning the actual trends we are observing at this time are lower. Again, the 6.5% is compared to pricing that was up over 10.5%. In general, we are trending loss costs for short-tail classes close to 7%, up from 6.5% last quarter. In long-tail, excluding workers' comp, we're trending at 6.5%, up from 6%. And our first-dollar comp book is trending between 4% and 4.5%. These trend factors are contemplated in both our pricing and in our accident year loss picks in the quarter.  Turning to our international general insurance operations. Retail Commercial P&C premiums grew 12.5% in constant dollars, while our London wholesale business grew over 10%. Retail commercial growth varied by region, with premiums up 14% in Asia Pacific, followed by growth of over 13% in Latin America. Our U.K. and Europe division was up nearly 12%. Internationally, like in the U.S., we continued to achieve improved rate-to-exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international business, rates increased in the quarter about 9.5%, while we estimate pricing was up about 12%. Rates varied by class and by region as well as country within region. Outside North America, we are currently trending loss costs at about 6.5%, up from 4%, though that varies by class of business and country. Loss cost factors we are using for short-tail are now running over 7. And in long-tail, we're trending at about 6. Again, these factors are contemplated in both our pricing and in our accident year loss in the quarter and, like in North America, are higher than actual observed trends.  International consumer lines growth in the quarter continued to pick up momentum as premiums increased over 12%, though FX then scrubbed about 7.5 points off the growth. Premiums in our international A&H business grew over 12% in constant dollar, with Latin America up over 19% and Asia Pacific up 13%, while our international personal lines grew 12%.  Net premiums in our North America high net worth personal lines business were up 4.7% on the back of record new business activity. Our true high net worth client segment grew 12%, while overall retention was very strong at nearly 98%. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 10%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10% as well.  To sum it all up, we had simply an excellent quarter. And as I look ahead, I am mindful of the world and the conditions in which we operate, including inflation, the specter of recession, the war and energy and food security problems globally.  With all that, we have a lot of broad-based momentum and earning power in our organization that gives me confidence. Commercial P&C growth and pricing are favorable, our consumer lines business growth is accelerating, our life company revenue and earnings will accelerate with the addition of the Cigna business in Asia. Asia is now a $7.5 billion region for our company. Our underwriting margins are excellent, and our investment income will grow nicely due to rising rates and strong cash flow. We are well positioned for continued excellent EPS growth well into the future.  I'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we'll come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Good morning, everyone. As you just heard from Evan, we had another excellent quarter. In addition to the record results, we ended the second quarter in a position of exceptional financial strength. Our strong underlying performance produced operating cash flow of $2.7 billion for the quarter and $5.2 billion for the first 6 months.  Our balance sheet remains strong. We have $68 billion in total capital. We continue to remain extremely liquid with cash and short-term investments of $10.6 billion at quarter end or $5.2 billion after accounting for the cash that was paid on July 1 for the Cigna deal.  Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1.5 billion to shareholders, including $1.1 billion in share repurchases and $348 million in dividends. Through the 6 months ended June 30, we have returned $2.8 billion to shareholders.  The current quarter included after-tax realized mark-to-market losses on our private and public equities of $489 million compared to gains of $794 million last year. Also included are after-tax losses on sales of fixed maturities of $279 million, in part to advance our portfolio turnover strategy. Book and tangible book value per share decreased 7.7% and 11.6%, respectively, from last quarter driven by the continuing impact of rising interest rates on our investment portfolio and unfavorable foreign currency movements.  Net realized and unrealized losses for the quarter were $5.4 billion after tax. In the quarter, adjusted net investment income of $950 million was above the top end of our estimated range and benefited from higher interest income from floating-rate securities and higher reinvestment yields resulting from portfolio turnover in this more attractive interest rate environment. We are remaining consistent and conservative in our investment strategy with 82% of our fixed-income portfolio rated investment grade, and we intend to maintain our historical allocation across investment assets.  As Evan noted, with rising rates, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased year-to-date from 2.3% in December to 4.7% at June 30. Our current book yield is 3.2% versus 3% in the first quarter. As a reminder, every 100 basis point increase in our investment yield generates approximately $1.2 billion pretax of net investment income.  Updating our quarterly guidance, we now anticipate adjusted net investment income over the next quarter to be in the range of $980 million to $1 billion. And we expect the quality of this income to be high as the vast majority of it will be predictable yield-oriented income and very little from more volatile sources like PE distributions and call premiums.  Our reported ROE for the quarter was 9%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 18.6%. Our core operating ROE was 12.4%.  Pretax catastrophe losses for the quarter were $291 million from weather-related events globally with approximately 79% in the U.S. and 21% internationally. We had favorable prior period development of $247 million pretax in the quarter, split approximately 1/3 in long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2017 and prior, and 2/3 in short-tail lines. The current period included a charge for molestation claims related to reviver statutes of $155 million. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 83%.  Our core operating effect tax rate for the quarter was 17.7%, which is slightly above the high end of our previously guided 2022 annual range of 15.5% to 17.5%. This was due primarily to growth in higher-tax jurisdictions and the negative impact of adverse market conditions on assets supporting certain employee benefit programs. With an updated forecast of income jurisdiction, along with the closing of the acquisition of Cigna's business, we now expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 16.5% to 18.5%.  As you saw, we completed the purchase of Cigna's A&H and life businesses in Asia. Our expectations regarding the earnings and expense synergies from Cigna remain consistent with or better than previous disclosures. As a reminder, we reported an expected $450 million of core operating income, assuming a close date of January 1, 2022. With the acquisition completed July 1, we will have a full quarter of earnings in the third quarter. We now expect expense synergies to reach a run rate of about $100 million pretax, which is higher than our initial estimate. To achieve the run rate savings, we expect onetime integration costs over the next 2 years to be about $140 million. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we will be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We take our first question from Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Michael Phillips : Congrats on a solid quarter again, guys. First question is on -- particularly around accident years '20 and '21 with the nuances from COVID. So Evan, any concerns there of more higher-than-average, I guess, late reported claims coming in down the pipe later than you otherwise would expect for these two accident years? Evan Greenberg : I'm sorry, accident year 2020 but related to what again? Michael Phillips : Yes, those two accident years because of COVID may be impacting late reported claims. And so are you -- or do you have any concerns that, that might be -- we might be seeing some more claims reported later than otherwise would be the case for those 2 years? Evan Greenberg : No, no. Not at all. Michael Phillips : Okay. Evan Greenberg : I'll remind you, quite the opposite. When we booked the '20 and '21 accident years, we imagined that those years would remain on trend as we trend years forward with inflation costs, et cetera. We didn't -- we just expected that the reporting pattern of claims, and therefore the payments of claims, might come later. But that those accident years would behave reasonably normally, we just didn't come off trend. So our reserves reflect all of that. I've been saying that for the last couple of years. Michael Phillips : Yes. Okay. And then just a particular question on the segments, if I could. In Overseas General, I guess their production in Europe seems to be down a bit, and I just wondered if there's any particular nuances there in the quarter. Or maybe just some outlook in Europe for Overseas General? Evan Greenberg : Yes, Europe grew -- I'm sorry, we might see it a little different. Europe grew 12% on a constant dollar basis. You then have foreign exchange, of course, the impact of the euro and the pound. But the underlying health and growth, very strong. Michael Phillips : Okay. So underlying is still strong in Europe and more just FX impact there as well? Evan Greenberg : Yes, you can -- and by the way, you could see it all in the supplement. Look on the Overseas General page. I can't recall the page number, but you can look in the lower left-hand corner and you'll see by region growth. I can't remember kids' birthdays, but I can remember stuff like that. Operator : We're moving forward to David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : Just a question on North America commercial. The underlying loss ratio there, very strong improvement. Was most of that pricing coming in above the new loss trend assumption? Or was there anything else in there related to structured transactions or noncap property losses that impacted that ratio? Evan Greenberg : Yes. And remember, you're looking on an earned basis, not a written basis. So I just want to give you a nuance that when you talk about coming in above the new loss cost trends and all of that, this is the earned, not the written we're talking about when you get to loss ratio.  And it's broad based. It's across most -- all product lines contributed to the improvement. And the difference in structured transactions -- its impact was really de minimis, tiny. This was just broad-based improvement of rate that exceeded trend across our portfolio and as it earns in. David Motemaden : Got it. And then, I guess, just maybe -- hoping maybe to get -- and thanks for the color on the loss ratio -- or, I'm sorry, on the loss cost trend changes. I was just wondering on the long-tail lines, changes in both North America and in Overseas General. Was there anything specific in the environment outside of just general inflation in the environment such as court reopenings? Or any sort of -- anything you're seeing in the legal environment that led to that change? Evan Greenberg : No. None. Just our judgment around the general loss cost environment, both the trend we have observed, been observing in legal and in nonlegal. And then you have inflation in wages and medical costs and all of the inputs that would go into this. And again, it's not the -- it's not what we're observing today, but we're just looking ahead and trying -- and anticipating and staying on top of it. David Motemaden : Got it. And a follow-up, I guess, is, is it a wide difference between what you're observing and what the new trend is? Or any sort of quantification on that, on how big the difference is between observed and actual -- or, I'm sorry, actual and projected? Evan Greenberg : It really varies by line of business. And you have both frequency and severity inputs into loss cost trends in any one line of business, and it does just vary. So -- but overall, what I'm -- for proprietary reasons, I'm not going to go into the actual that we are experiencing, but I'm giving you what we're using this trend, which is, I think, better than you're getting anywhere else. Operator : We take our next question from Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : Evan, I was hoping to get some forward view just on the pricing environment, right? You guys said loss trend around 6.5%. The disclosure you gave on your pricing, right, is still above that trend level. And you pointed to concerns about inflation. We also have to deal with courts reopening, Ukraine, right? You listed things that you guys are concerned about. As you think out, how long do you think the pricing momentum and rate can stay on top of that loss trend? Evan Greenberg : Well, look, Elyse, if I had a perfect crystal ball, I wouldn't be in this business. I'd go do something else. I can't predict the future. But my sense when I look at the tone of the market and the kind of indicators my colleagues look at and that I look at, the market I think there -- and I said it in my commentary. I think the market is, on one hand, becoming more competitive as companies rationally want to grow in what is an adequately rated environment. On the other hand, I see the -- or it can have a sense of the kind of reactions companies are having themselves to loss cost and inflation. It's very transparent -- reasonably transparent in pricing, in values selected in short-tail classes that they apply price against : so inflation factors and property values, et cetera.  And the market is reasonably -- is rational to me at this time, and -- even though it's becoming more competitive. And rates naturally, like in anything else, they -- trees just don't grow to the sky. And so they've achieved adequacy in most all of our portfolio, so rates need to -- fundamentally, rate and exposure together, pricing needs to keep pace with that. And I see the market at this time rational that way.  And I don't see signs that it's going the other way. I see rates people are charging are reasonably -- should -- ought to produce reasonable results. On the margin, there's -- there are people doing dumb things. And you see it, but it's anecdotal. And you always see dumb things. So I feel reasonably confident, but that's as far as I can give you. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then now that you guys have closed on the Cigna deal, do you have a sense -- can we get a sense of what the excess capital impact on your ROE is following that transaction? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, we're not going to update it every bloody quarter. It doesn't move around that much. We gave you -- in the first quarter, we gave you a number. We also said that it contemplated the Cigna deal. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then one last one. Did you guys release any COVID reserves this quarter? I don't think you called that out, Peter. Peter Enns : No. Operator : We take our next question from Greg Peters with Raymond James. Charles Peters : I guess I'm going to pivot to the investment income commentary. Evan, in your comments, you talked about being largely a hold-to-maturity investor or having that strategy. And then you also highlighted the sale of some fixed-maturity securities to take advantage of the new yields. You talked about the book yield being at 3.2%.  If I were to infer from your commentary, it sounds like you might be accelerating the sales and shifting your strategy from the hold-to-maturity to more like a trading just to upgrade on the yields. But I want to put words in your mouth. Maybe you can give us some color on that. Evan Greenberg : I'm going to turn it over to Tim Boroughs in a second and Peter. But I want to straighten out one thing in your mind that I've also read that 1 or 2 of you wrote.  Held to maturity, if you're going to use that term, is a very specific accounting -- GAAP accounting term. And there are rules around it. If you have something in the held-to-maturity portfolio, which we have a held-to-maturity portfolio, that is a security that, as designated, will not be sold. And you can only sell it under very prescriptive circumstances, i.e., an impairment, avoiding and around managing impairment. And I'm looking at my Chief Accounting Officer who's surprised. I can recall those rules. But that's held to maturity. We're a buy-and-hold portfolio predominantly. What that says is our intention, all things being equal, is we hold to maturity, but we have the ability to trade.  And by the way, we do trade and -- to take advantage of yields. But overall, the portfolio is held. And so losses will amortize back to par over time. And that's the overall portfolio statement.  Now about where we are beyond that, I'm going to turn it over to Tim and Peter. Timothy Boroughs : Yes, this is Tim, Tim Boroughs. In this environment, with rates rising, first of all, as Evan and Peter mentioned, we have a gap of about 150 basis points between our book and market yield. And this is like Nirvana for bond investors. We're happy campers, right? As new cash flow and maturities come in, for the first time in almost 10 years, we're actually picking up yield. So that's a good thing.  I think in this environment, we're going to focus -- I want to emphasize, we're going to focus on risk-adjusted returns. We're not going to reach for yield and will remain -- we're going to maintain a very high-quality bias.  When we talk about accelerating the turnover, as Evan emphasized, this is going to take place in the same sectors for which those securities are sold. So these tactical moves are incorporated in the investment income guidance that Peter provided, and they're not going to have any material impact on the average credit quality of the portfolio. And obviously, they're going to help to accelerate the rise in book yield. Charles Peters : Got it. I guess just as a follow-up on that answer, just trying to understand the magnitude and the timing. I'm not sure you're prepared to give us much on that, but I had to throw it out there as a duty. Can you give us some sense of the magnitude you're talking about? Timothy Boroughs : I would say, as I said, anything that we now contemplate is incorporated in the guidance that Peter gave. Charles Peters : Got it. Timothy Boroughs : And the preponderance of the increase in the guidance, Greg, comes from net interest income. So I think that's the point. Charles Peters : Got it. Okay. My second question... Evan Greenberg : The only other thing I will add is it'll continue to accelerate from there. Charles Peters : All right. The second question will be on Cigna and Asia. We've observed some other large public companies in the insurance market, either accident health, supplemental health, struggle to generate growth in Asia in the last several quarters, if not the last couple of years. So you've talked about the return factor for the Cigna transaction. Can you talk about how you think about growth of that business over the intermediate term? Evan Greenberg : Yes. First of all, I think what we just told you is, is our A&H business, which is not a small business in Asia, the Chubb A&H business is close to a $1 billion business. That business grew a healthy double digit in the second quarter. We just gave you that number. So let me start with that perspective.  And secondly, our strategy for Cigna-Chubb together, the value creation is going to come from two things. The efficiencies/expense are just one part. That's not the interesting part to make, it's the ability to create revenue, and therefore earnings growth, from the combination of the two companies. And it's the -- it's -- we're the only company I know of in Asia that has a unified life and nonlife joint approach that is going to together -- and it's a country-by-country strategy, pretty granular to how we're going to accelerate growth faster than either one would have been standalone.  The combined companies, the customer -- remember, these are direct marketing companies. And the customer database of each together is an asset for cross-sell. The ability to approach and to develop a new product approach of unified life and nonlife products which will be unique in the marketplace, and we're already planning, is another source. Our ability to approach more sponsors and get more share of marketing space because of our life and nonlife together. So our plans are whatever each one was naturally growing, the growth is going to accelerate. And it takes a little time. We'll see it in a modest way in '23. We're going to see much more in '24 and '25 as we go out.  And finally, beyond what has been predominantly telemarketing and independent agent in the Cigna side, like with the Chubb side, a greater emphasis on the mixing and matching now, which is the Asia trend, of digital and telemarketing. So it's -- this goes across Korea, Thailand, Taiwan in particular, and, to a degree, Hong Kong. And I just came back from the region, and plans are granular and people are off to the races in execution. So there you go. Charles Peters : There was some feedback at the beginning of your comments. And maybe the moderator has the mic open. It wasn't on my end. Just FYI. Evan Greenberg : Yes, I think there are some window washers actually outside my window, which really you can't make this stuff up. Charles Peters : Perfect timing on that, Evan. Evan Greenberg : Oh, I didn't know. If I was garbled, you just tell me what I didn't get and I'll give it to you. Charles Peters : No, no, I heard you fine. I just heard the window washers in the background, and I didn't know if that was the moderator that had... Evan Greenberg : Yes, yes, I mean, I got you. You just can't get any respect around here. Okay. Operator : We take our next question from Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Yaron Kinar : I guess my first question, I don't think you mentioned any Russia- or Ukraine-related losses. Are you seeing any of those and they're just not large enough to call out? Or are you just waiting to see kind of how this situation develops before putting up along? Evan Greenberg : They're not large enough to call out. Year-to-date, they're just -- it's a de minimis amount. And that's losses that we have enough information to judge as incurred and put a dollar amount. Of course, we have more exposure than that, that we're watching and observing, but I'm comfortable that our loss picks will contemplate those. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then with regards to raising the loss trends, it seems to me -- and I don't know this for a fact, but it seems to me like you're actually ahead of a lot of your peers with raising the trends to where you took them to. Does that challenge your ability to grow at the piece that you want to grow? Evan Greenberg : Well, first of all, I don't know what my peers are raising their loss trends to. So I don't know. And I don't know that they're not raising them and have them in the same levels. So I can't speculate that way. What I do know is on -- no different than any other period we've ever been in. We're going to charge what we think is the right rate to produce a reasonable risk-adjusted return. If we can't get paid, we don't write the business. Do I feel like that's going to put me at a competitive disadvantage? Not at this point in the cycle, I don't see it. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Evan Greenberg : As you go forward and things become competitive again, when and if it happens in the future, then of course, I'll trade growth all day long to be sure that underwriting continues to grow book value. I have not changed in 45 years. Operator : We take our next question from Meyer Shields with KBW. Meyer Shields : Two quick questions. First, Evan, in your prepared comments, you mentioned food and energy and security. And I was hoping you can give us a little bit more commentary on maybe the regions where that represents underwriting risk. Evan Greenberg : Well, I don't know that it presents an exact underwriting risk. It's not a one-for-one direct relationship, but it all feeds the backdrop of the environment we're in, whether it is inflation, whether it is recession because how it impacts people, whether it is social and political strains that lead to instability, whether it is the political strains that lead to geopolitical instability.  You have to consider all that. It's the -- it's part of the -- it all feeds into the background noise and of the risk environment. And so you got to put a broader lens on it when you start, and then you come down to the very specific correlations when you're thinking about individual risk.  And I was bringing it also in context of that it's hardly that we're pollyannish when we're bullish about the future of the company. And as we look forward, we're bullish about the things we can control and that we see in our sites. We try to put all that and remain bullish in context of the external environment as we see it today. And that's my point. Meyer Shields : No, understood. That's very helpful. A second question. Just in terms of the reserving process for recent accident years, how much of the increased cost trend that you talked about is -- shows up on your -- the current valuation of those accident year reserves? Evan Greenberg : Can you repeat that? I'm a little -- I'm not sure I got exactly what you said. Meyer Shields : Yes. No, that's the -- I garbled it a little bit. You talked about including the newer loss trend in pricing and accident year results. Does the reserving process also tweak up accident year 2021 when a line's loss trends are raised? Evan Greenberg : Well, as we do individual reserve studies on each line of business, everything comes to play. So you first start with, how is it performing against frequency and severity, et cetera, against what you expected when you put it up? And also your future loss cost on that accident year, what are the trends you used versus your view of trends today? So all of it gets mixed into an analysis when you're looking at the study of any one cohort of business as we review them.  I say it to you that way because you can't spike one thing out and then use some simplistic way to imagine because you're trying to go to adequacy versus inadequacy or any of that, and I'm trying to pierce through to that thought, if you're following me. Operator : We take our next question from Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Two of them here for you. First one, hopefully pretty quick, for Peter. I'm just curious, FX had a little bit of a headwind here from an earnings perspective also. Should we expect something similar here in the third quarter given where FX rates are? Peter Enns : Very hard to say, Brian, just because of the volatility around it. We obviously have a substantial international operation. You saw that in the revenue and the operating income numbers. I really can't judge. We don't hedge the operating businesses for FX. So what happens, happens. We do, do some hedging around debt and some of the other aspects. Brian Meredith : Got you. And then, Evan, I was hoping we'd dig in a little bit into the whole loss trend situation you were talking about and the increase here. Is there any specific area that you're more concerned about? I mean if I think about it, there's been conversations about medical cost inflation ticking up, tort inflation as the court systems reopen. Any kind of signs that you're seeing that you say, wow, this is an area that we're concerned about and why we increased our trend assumption more? Evan Greenberg : Brian, I'll repeat myself. We're not seeing -- across our business, it's -- we're not seeing the trends that we're actually using -- we're anticipating and increased those in anticipation of future because our business -- the insurance business classically lags. And rather than be lagging and get caught, we try to -- we've all been through this a number of times in inflationary periods. And so it's to anticipate ahead.  And you know what? There are no areas that concern me. I don't think of it that way. We're just vigilant about everything. Or we try to be. Brian Meredith : Got you. So does that mean that your business today, you would kind of view as rate adequate, but you still want to kind of be careful about what's going forward? Evan Greenberg : And I said it in the commentary, and I know you listened, that our -- that the rates we're charging -- our business is -- the vast majority of it is achieving an adequate risk-adjusted return. And that means that pricing and rate is adequate. Now you need -- what you really need in particular, and it's not true of the whole portfolio, but the vast majority, you need rate that will keep pace with loss cost. We're anticipating about loss cost, not trying to anticipate and not simply use lagging of what we see because what we see is a combination of frequency and severity, and it varies by line. And that is a bit of a lagging indicator. Operator : We take our next question from Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Tracy Benguigui : Could you walk us through your process of setting combined ratio target to your underwriters? I'm thinking it's some derivative of ROE. So when you're coming up with these targets, are you basing that on new money yields or portfolio yields? Evan Greenberg : The portfolio takes a long time to turn over. So you know what? It's based on portfolio. And I'm not going to go through it, no. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Got it. All right. No, that's very helpful. I mean this is where I was going with it. According to broker pricing surveys, in your own book, you called out deceleration in casualty-related classes. So I was just trying to get a sense if part of the equation of casualty deceleration is because maybe others are pricing based on new money yields and they're weighing more in future investment income. But it sounds like you're taking a more measured approach, looking at the portfolio yields. Is that fair? Evan Greenberg : No. I think you're way overseeing this. I think that's an academic approach, not a practitioner's approach. If you think the marketplace today is pricing underwriters and the day-to-day trades are pricing based upon some view of combined ratios where it's been calculated with new money versus portfolio yield, let me disabuse you of that. It is not that finally or I'm disciplined in the way that the marketplace actually works in pricing.  And how long it takes for others to review portfolios, see results, make judgments, then have that passed down to the trading level of how does it impact how we see rates, well, that's a ways out there, and it doesn't really work in that buttoned-up way in most of the world -- the vast majority of the world of insurance. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Based on some conversations I've had, it sounds like a mix by others. But you guys are definitely thinking about it, I think, in the right way given everything that you just mentioned. So I appreciate you providing that color. Evan Greenberg : Well, it's interesting. People say one thing and then you observe something else. But anyway. Operator : We take our next question from Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Alexander Scott : First one I had was on personal lines. The underwriting has been holding up quite well relative to what we're seeing across the industry. So I was just interested if you could provide any color on what you're doing that's allowed that to happen and if the maybe better price adequacy than some of your peers have will allow you to pivot harder to growth. Evan Greenberg : Well, first of all, we have a different kind of portfolio. We're not general market homeowners or auto, it's high net worth, as you know. And so it's a segment of the marketplace, number one.  Number two, look, we took a lot of pain in the last couple of years in adjusting how we price in the absolute rate we charge, in how we think about it by parrel, how we think about it by territory. And that's never ending. But we had gotten -- the company in total had gotten behind a few years ago in overall pricing and price adequacy. And so we took pain in terms of growth for that.  And I -- my own sense -- and we've seen it in the high net worth category. It's not just rate but price, how you view the values of individual homes and the inflation factors you use, how you do that in fine arts and in other valuables within homes. We've been very disciplined to adjust to inflation that has been running hot in that area for a while. Competition -- competitors have been slow to do that. And again, we gave up some business at times for that. I think it serves us well at this time, and we're just steady as she goes. Alexander Scott : Got it. Second question I had for you is on capital management. I know you guys just closed the Cigna deal, so maybe a little early for me to be asking this type of question. But at this environment, it seems like the returns are quite strong, you're generating a lot of capital. I was just interested if you could update us on capital deployment priorities. Evan Greenberg : Capital deployment is steady as she goes. We will retain capital for both. We run a conservative balance sheet. We're in a balance sheet business. We're in a risk business. And we will retain capital for risk and volatility, and we will retain capital for growth opportunities, organic and inorganic. And the money doesn't burn a hole in our pocket, and we've been awfully good stewards of capital. I think our history shows that. No change to policy. Peter Enns : Hello? Evan Greenberg : We went blank. Karen Beyer : Yes. Okay. Well, thank you. At this point, we want to thank everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your calls. Enjoy your day. Thank you. Operator : And this concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn today\u2019s call over Ms. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, and welcome to our September 30, 2022, third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. And now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had an excellent quarter in spite of cat losses with terrific underwriting results, including outstanding combined ratios, record net investment income, double-digit constant dollar P&C premium growth, well-balanced between commercial and consumer. And finally, surging Life division revenue growth with the addition of Cigna's Asia business. Commercial P&C pricing was strong and exceeded loss costs in aggregate and in most individual lines of business. Core operating income in the quarter was $1.3 billion, or $3.17 per share, up 20% over prior. In the quarter, we produced $710 million of underwriting income, up 15% with a published combined ratio of 93.1%, pre-tax catastrophe losses were $1.2 billion, of which $975 million was Ian. For the year, record underwriting income of $3.4 billion was up more than 40% or $1 billion leading to an 87.5% combined ratio, an improvement of nearly three points over prior year. Underpinning the published combined ratio was the ex-cat current accident year combined ratio, which was 84% for the quarter, adding to a record 837 for the year, simply stunning. Hurricane Ian was a large event distinguished by its size, wind speed and amount of water, both surge and flood. The models we use contemplate a cat three or greater event striking Florida about every three years. We are fully prepared to take cat risk and the associated volatility. After all, it's what we do for a living. As long as we are adequately compensated and the concentration of exposure is within our balance sheet wherewithal. In my judgment, current pricing for cat is inadequate in many portfolios, and property pricing should continue to adjust to the realities of the nat-cat [ph] environment, as well as the increased cost for reinsurance protection and potential lack of availability. Returning to the quarter. Investment income was a record $1.1 billion, up over 12% from prior year, topping $1 billion for the first time. As I noted in our recent calls, with rising interest rates and widening spreads, investment income is and will continue to rise. Our reinvestment rate is now averaging 5.8% against a portfolio yield of 3.4%. During the quarter, we continued to accelerate the turnover of our portfolio in a targeted way, so that we could put cash to work more quickly at higher yields. Investment income will make up a growing percentage of our company's earnings, as we look forward. Obviously, rising rates have produced a sizable negative mark on our invested asset. But as a reminder, we were a buy and hold fixed income investor and the market is transitory. To put a point on that, our portfolio credit quality is high, and we expect about half of the mark will accrete back to book value over about a two-year period. As you saw, the addition of Cigna's business in Asia, which we closed in the quarter is making an immediate contribution to revenue and earnings in line with what we expected. It is accretive to our consolidated results, including operating income and ROE. Peter will provide more information around the financial items. Turning to growth and the rate environment. Total P&C net written premiums globally increased 8.5% in the quarter on a published basis, or 11.2% in constant dollar, with commercial up 11.7% and consumer up over 9.5%. Consolidated net premiums for the company, which include our Life Insurance segment, increased 17.3% in constant dollars, reflecting the consolidation of the Cigna Asia business. P&C premium growth in earnings in the quarter were again balanced and broad-based, with contributions from virtually all our commercial businesses globally. Total North America premiums were up over 10.5% with commercial up 11.4% or 8.1% excluding agriculture and our high net worth personal lines business, up over 7% in the quarter. Overseas General grew 11.7% in constant dollars, but only 2% after FX, with commercial up 11% and consumer up 12.7%. With the strongest US dollar in 20 years, the negative impact of FX masks the real strength of our business. Agriculture premiums were up nearly 22% in the quarter, driven overwhelmingly by crop insurance growth, as a result of commodity price increases and market share gains, we produced near record underwriting income off the back of what we project to be a decent growing season. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market conditions remain quite favorable for most lines of business. The vast majority of our portfolio is achieving favorable risk-adjusted returns. So additional rate is required, primarily to keep pace with loss cost which, as I have been saying, are hardly benign in both long-tail and short-tail lines. The market is reasonably disciplined. But given loss cost inflation, and what will be slowing growth and exposure in the future given economic conditions, casualty rates in most classes will need to rise at an accelerated rate or else the industry will fail to keep pace. In North America, growth this quarter in Commercial Lines was led by our Major Accounts and Specialty division, which grew 9.7%, followed by our Middle Market and Small Commercial business, which grew 5.7% and our Middle Market division, P&C lines grew almost 9%, while Financial Lines declined about 5.5%, primarily due to a lack of IPOs, M&A activity and new business. Renewal retention for our Retail Commercial business was virtually 100% on a premium basis. Overall rates in North America Commercial Lines, excluding comp, were up 5%, while total pricing, which includes rate and exposure increased 8.5%. We are staying on top of inflation in terms of pricing and reserving. In North America Commercial Lines, we assume loss cost trends of 6.5%, the same as the second quarter. In major accounts, which serves the largest companies in America, rates increased 5.3% with pricing up $8.6 and General casualty rates were up 8.7%. Property rates were up 9.7% and financial lines rates were up 4.3%. In our E&S wholesale business, rates increased 9%, with pricing up nearly 13%. Property rates were up about 11.5%. Casualty rates were up 8.5% and Financial Lines rates were up almost 9%. In our Middle Market business, rates increased 4.2%, excluding comp, with pricing up about 6.5%, rates for property were up over 6% and pricing was up double-digit, casualty rates were up 6.5%, with pricing up over 8% and comp rates were down 3.8%. However, comp pricing was up 6.5%. Financial Lines rates were up just over 1%, with pricing up about 2%. Our North America high net worth personal lines business had a very good quarter, with net premiums up over 7%, driven by strong new business activity. Our true high net worth client segment grew 12.5%, while overall retention was very strong at over 98%. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 11%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10.5%. Turning to our International General Insurance operations. In constant dollars, if you haven't noticed, 2022 is the best organic growth we have experienced in nearly a decade. In the quarter, retail commercial P&C premiums grew 12.3%, while London wholesale grew over 9.5%. Retail commercial growth was led by Latin America with premiums up 23.5%, followed by growth of nearly 15.5% in Asia Pacific and over 10% in our UK and Europe division. Internationally, like in the US, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our International Retail business, rates increased in the quarter 9%. While we estimate pricing was up about 12%. Rates varied by class and by region as well as country within region. Outside North America, we are currently trending loss costs at about 6.5%. Again, similar to the second quarter, though that varies by class of business and country. Like in North America, these trends factors are contemplated in both our reserving and in our accident year loss picks. International consumer lines growth in the quarter picked up considerable momentum with premiums up over 13%, though FX scrubbed about 11.5 points off the growth. Our international A&H division had an exceptionally strong quarter. Premiums grew over 22.5% in constant dollar with Asia Pac up over 34%, the UK up over 26% and Latin America up 17%. Our international personal lines business grew more modestly in the quarter, with premiums up 4.5% in constant dollar. Premiums in sub-life were up 117% in constant dollars and impacted heavily by the Cigna acquisition. Cigna's operation contributed about $740 million in net premiums written and $160 million in income to the Life segment this quarter. We have hit the ground running in terms of integration and execution of our growth strategies in Asia. So to sum it all up, all of our businesses across the globe contributed to growth and earnings in the quarter. We are firing on all cylinders. We are operating in a challenging economic environment, given inflation, the specter of recession and financial market volatility, as well as the geopolitical environment and the evolving risks from climate change. Despite all of that, looking forward, we are quite bullish on the future, given our growth and exceptional underwriting margins in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses, the strong trajectory for investment income and the contributions from the Cigna acquisition to our growing Asia Life business. We expect EPS to continue to grow at a healthy rate into the future. I'll turn the call over to Peter and then we're going to come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan. Good morning. Our strong underlying business performance continued in the third quarter, producing operating cash flow of $3.4 billion and contributing to a record $8.6 billion through nine months. We remain in a position of exceptional financial strength with over $63 billion in total capital and strong liquidity and with cash and short-term investments of $6.7 billion at quarter end, and this is after paying $5.4 billion cash for the Cigna business on July 1. Among the capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $1 billion to shareholders, including $685 million in share repurchases at an average price of $186.22 and $346 million in dividends. Tangible book value per share decreased 15.2% since June reflecting changes in AOCI, which includes realized and unrealized losses of $3.6 billion after tax, resulting from rising interest rates on our fixed income portfolio and foreign currency translation losses of $466 million. Additionally, the increased goodwill and intangibles of $1.5 billion related to the Cigna acquisition, represented 370 basis points of the decrease. Excluding AOCI and Cigna, the tangible book value per share increased 0.4% since last quarter. We continue to expect to recover the Cigna dilution within six months, as we said when we announced the acquisition. Book value per share declined 7% for the quarter, reflecting those same AOCI factors. As you saw, the addition of Cigna's A&H and Life businesses in Asia are making an immediate contribution in line with what we expected. For the quarter, the acquisition contributed 7% accretion to operating EPS, 50 basis points to our annualized core operating ROE of 9.4% and 110 basis points to our tangible ROE of 14.4%. Our integration efforts are progressing well, and we are on track with expected expense synergies and net integration costs, as we previously announced. Almost all of Cigna's businesses are part of our Life segment. And going forward, we will not report on a stand-alone basis. We remain consistent and conservative in our investment strategy with 82% of our fixed income portfolio rate investment grade and do not contemplate any major change to our current asset allocation. The Cigna portfolio of approximately $4.3 billion is also high quality with an average credit rating of A+ and 96% of the fixed-income portfolio rated investment grade. As Evan noted, as rates continue to rise, our portfolio's reinvestment rate has increased from 2.3% in December to 5.8% on September 30, while our current book yield is 3.4% versus 3.2% in the in the second quarter. With market rates above our book yield, we have tactically taken advantage of opportunities to increase the portfolio's yield. We have been selectively utilizing gains from equity-related investments and interest rate hedges to fund turning over parts of the fixed income portfolio in this higher rate environment. This, along with the normal turnover of our portfolio, the addition of Cigna's investments as well as certain other items contributed to adjusted net investment income of $1.50 billion in the quarter. Updating our quarterly guidance, we now expect adjusted net investment income to be in the range of $1.40 billion to $1.60 billion. Relative to Hurricane Ian, approximately 77% of the pre-tax catastrophe losses were incurred in the commercial lines, 23% in personal lines. We had favorable prior period development in the quarter of $222 million pre-tax or $162 million after-tax. This is net of $73 million pre-tax adverse development from our legacy runoff exposures, principally environmental related. The remaining favorable development of $295 million is split approximately 11% long-tail lines, principally from accident years 2018 and prior and 89% in short-tail lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 75% or 79% after adjusting for cats and PPD. Our core operating effective tax rate for the quarter was 19.3%, which is above the high end of our previously announced annual range of 16.5% to 18.5%. This is primarily due to the Cigna acquisition and catastrophe losses in lower tax-paying jurisdictions in the quarter. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year 2022 to be in the range of 17.5% to 18%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. And at this point, we'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Phillips with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Michael Phillips : Thank you. Good morning, Evan. Good morning everybody. Evan, I wanted to draw down on your comments on the loss trends in North America at 6.5%, your pricing and reserving above that. You talked about in the second quarter that what you're actually seeing in the market is somewhat below that. I assume that's still the case, but I wonder if that's narrowed a bit this quarter? Evan Greenberg : It's similar. Michael Phillips : Similar. Okay, great. And then industry level question. I was just curious your thoughts here. With all that's going on in the property category insurance market. Does that extend to other areas? Does that extend to primary casualty? And will that help lengthen the hard market? And how about in primary markets there? Evan Greenberg : I don't see it that way. It's not a capital question for the reinsurance industry. It's a risk question. And do you want to deploy your capital against it? In casualty for the reinsurance industry, it's a different question. And that is -- they, too, their ability to recognize that on the casualty side of the business, loss cost trends are hardly benign for all the reasons that we know, and that pricing and rate needs to keep pace with that. So the industry stays on top of it. Reinsurers lag in their recognition of loss cost exposure. And that's at their own peril. They're not careful. So they need to recognize the environment. And I begin -- I believe we're beginning to do that in terms of the terms and conditions they provide insurers and that's more the response I see from the reinsurance industries -- the reinsurance industry in terms of casualty versus property. They both have their own dynamics. Michael Phillips : Yeah. Okay, great. Thank you Evan. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Evan Greenberg : David Motemaden, it's nice to hear from you. David Motemaden : I've heard a lot of pronunciations over the years. So never seize this to amaze me. Evan Greenberg : I get about -- it's been a while, too, by the way. I guess, strange pronunciations. David Motemaden : Both tough ones. I was hoping just to get an update on the growth prospects for Chubb in the property market. You mentioned you have the capacity to grow here as long as you're compensated but some pricing still needs to accelerate from here. I guess, how should we think about the runway you have to capitalize on this? But I think is -- I think it's around 16% of your book right now, if I look across the P&C business. If I just thought about property as a percentage of total. Is there a -- is there a ceiling that you think about in terms of introducing too much nat cat risk into the earnings, or yes, I guess, just wondering how you're thinking about how much -- how big you want that to get? Evan Greenberg : David, the 16% is a global number. And I think that's, first of all, the right way to think about it. We're a global company. And so when we think about property and growing property, it's a global opportunity to us. And so in that respect, absolutely, and it's -- it remains and is a growth area for us. What you then balance it against is we have a finite balance sheet. So we can only take so much concentration in any one geographic area when you imagine that the PML or the loss -- that concentration will produce over certain return periods against your capital. And then it's simply the question, are we paid adequately for the risk and for the volatility we take. And then the last item is reinsurance. And not just the cost of it, but availability because that's renting additional capital and our ability to do that. So -- and that is what impacts certain territories and that's not new. That's standard in how you shape your portfolio and think about concentration of exposure, but we're playing a global opportunity here. David Motemaden : Got it. That's helpful. And then maybe if I could just follow-up on the casualty rates. You mentioned that you think that rates need to increase at an accelerated pace or else the industry will fail to keep pace with trend. I guess -- could you just talk about what you're seeing across the various lines? It looks like Fin Pro [ph] or Professional Lines, Financial Lines might be taking a step down. It looks like you guys are remaining disciplined just based on your premiums growth and Financial Lines. But maybe just talk a little bit about that and how you think the market is placed and competitiveness in that line? Evan Greenberg : Yes. So I gave you kind of a breakdown in long-tail lines, and I won't give a further breakdown that way. But -- two or three points. One, when it comes to fin lines, experience has been quite good. Overall, when I look at our pricing, it produces favorable risk-adjusted returns. Market competitiveness has been in response to the absolute pricing levels and to experience, but there's plenty of risk out there. And while it's become competitive and is reasonably rational, it can't continue this way into the future or else, frankly, it becomes irrational and would be naive. We have remained disciplined and we are disciplined. There are certain pockets where we deem pricing and it's on the margin to be irrational and therefore, we walk away. On the other hand, what is impacting growth and I reiterate it, remember, you're coming off of a very hot market last year. Interest rates were low. Equity markets were elevated. There was so much money around. There was a ton of M&A and IPO and that produced more exposure. We're in a different world today and so that exposure has shrunk, and that does impact growth as well. David Motemaden : Got it. That make sense. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning everybody. Maybe following up on a couple of the previous questions. With the reinsurance market hardening, what is the opportunity set that you see for Chubb as a result of this hardening in? Are you going to lean further into reinsurance? Are you going to take more net on the primary side? How are you thinking about the dynamics there? Evan Greenberg : Well, I'm hardly going to read my playbook to you for broadcast out there. In that regard, just stay tuned. But beyond that, property cat is not a growth area for Chubb. Property cat re is not a growth area. Not of any significance. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And maybe changing direction a little bit here. I was curious as to your stated thoughts on China and the opportunities out there, especially with Huatai in the face of the political and economic changes there? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. First of all, we expect to announce the Huatai approval from the China regulator of the Huatai transaction imminently. So that will be shortly. Secondly, look, I see China as a long-term, medium and long-term opportunity for Chubb and you got to be patient. Of course, and I'll say it right upfront, the trajectory of China from a geopolitical perspective, wilderness [ph] authoritarian, political system, United States and Europe, so the Western world, democratic, individual rights oriented and the geopolitical aspirations of China and versus the balance of versus the US. If we don't find a way to coexist, we're on a path towards conflict. That risk is out there, and you know that. The party and with now the full consolidation of power under sheet, that's not a surprise. It's just the curtain was pulled back on it and it was crisply displayed over the last 1.5 weeks. But that's not a surprise. The consolidation of party control over the economy and industrial policy, and the notion of ideology and security over-economic growth as a priority, in my judgment, will ultimately be against China's own interest. She has an ambitious agenda and to fulfill that and address financial market and economic weakness, you got to have economic growth. The pie has to grow. And my own view is over a reasonable period of time, I don't know, is it one year? Is it three years? They will -- they will be forced to moderate their approach to economic policy -- their ideology, but their approach to economic policy. Practically in their own interest because they need economic growth. And so when it comes to what I [ph], in the short term, we face those economic headwinds there without a doubt. We had a sense of that. But in time and over the medium and longer term, if we don't get in a shooting war, we're optimistic and about the long term that we're making. It is the second largest economy in the world and the need for insurance will continue to grow and that we control. We are the first foreigner to control of financial services holdco in China, I think, is a long-term asset for the company and we're stewards of long-term capability for this organization. And so I'm balancing the risk and the reward. In the short-term, I don't expect it to be a major contributor to Chubb's growth and earnings. But in the longer term, I do. And finally, on a micro level, I'd say this. Our ability to operate in China, Chubb as a foreigner, we have a good reputation. And I -- and I see that we won't face any more regulatory issues or discrimination from all I can see that Chinese companies themselves will face. And in that regard, I see us on a level playing field. Yaron Kinar : Thanks for that comprehensive answer and looking forward things to come. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi thanks. Good morning Evan. My first question, in your prepared remarks, you pointed to casualty rates needing to go up because you said that there could be slowing exposure. So -- and you also see positive on pricing following the hurricane. So, I know you gave us a lot of color on North America commercial pricing? So, is the overall view that, that 5% rate, which I know excludes exposure that that's going to start to trend up in the fourth quarter? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, your two-pin quarter-to-quarter on data point. I'm looking over -- I'm giving -- I picked my head up and try to give an overall landscape, longer term view without pinning to this period or that period precisely, I think it misses the point. That's the best I can give you. The fact is inflation and loss cost trend is there. The fact is I don't know what quarter, but exposure growth, the industry lags, exposure growth is likely to come down because economic growth is shrinking. And that's just going to equal exposure growth shrinking. So, if you look out in the future, not necessarily the fourth quarter. I'm not prognosticating quarter-to-quarter. The rate is going itself is going to have to rise if the industry is going to stay on top of loss cost. And I guarantee you one thing, Chubb is going to stay on top of loss cost. Elyse Greenspan : That's helpful. And then my second question, you guys completed the Cigna deal, Evan it sounds like you're close to announcing approval for Huatai -- increase in stake in Huatai. Can you just give us an update on the M&A pipeline and how that's kind of, I guess, changed over the past year? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, as you know, I don't -- I don't talk about what we're looking at or not looking at on that. What I can tell you is right now, Chubb is at rest. And M&A is not something that's on my immediate radar. Building our balance sheet, having flexibility of capital is on my radar. And I believe we're in a period where weakness will show over time in the future. Given economic and financial market and on conditions and as I look out into the future, and we are quite patient people. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks Evan. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Good morning Evan and Peter and several members of the management team. Evan, in your previous answer on China, maybe you can pivot to other areas of the globe, Europe and other areas. And I guess what I'm trying to think about or understand how you're thinking about growth, especially when there's things -- the emerging energy availability crisis, supply chain issues, food security, and you've posted some substantial growth numbers this year. Just trying to think about, how to frame it for next year with all these headwinds? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It's -- it's not a clear picture. And every area of the world is behaving a bit differently. You see the idiosyncratic nature of the US economy that relative to other places, it's got a lot of resilience to it. Employment continues to grow, the economy is intrinsically strong on a broad-based basis and consumers thank the US government have a lot of money in their pocket. That part will be transient. And with the Fed's actions, which I think are the right actions, and I believe the set is going to be patient and stay high for longer. I think they know the lessons, and they're going to make sure inflation is running out of this. The US economy will slow down. No doubt and whether -- and you already see it. And whether we go into a recession or not is a question mark. And my own belief is, if we do, it will be relatively mild. You go to Europe, and Europe is a different picture. They were not experiencing strong economic growth prior to Ukraine. They have the war in Ukraine and energy availability and what that is doing is they start to ration energy on what it's doing to industry and to growth. But at the same time, for the insurance industry in certain areas, the risk environment has changed. And that benefits pricing and rate environment. And I think it benefits opportunity for us, even in the face of all of that. I turn to the Lloyd's [ph] market, that is so heavily reinsurance levered and with reinsurance market contraction and our balance sheet capability, and it's another window to look on the world, and so I see opportunities as we go forward. I moved to Asia, where recession has not bitten in most of Asia. You don't see that. You see inflation picking up on what the future looks like really varies by country. But overall, Asia growth is pretty good. And what I see for our business is a lot of opportunity to continue to grow. It's a very balanced business -- jobs business in Asia between consumer and commercial, between accident and health, whether it's in life or non-life, and our consumer businesses there versus P&C and middle market versus large commercial, it's actually our most balanced business in Chubb around the world. And the opportunities there, I see, whether there's a short-term impact here or there based on economic activity, I can't see that yet, but whether there is or not is transient to me. And I see through that, I see a lot of growth opportunity. So, when I add it all up on balance and given the broad nature of our business, I'm pretty bullish on growth as we go forward, though, of course, I'm cautious as I'm aware about the external environment and the recessionary conditions and inflation, which no one has a perfect handle on. Greg Peters : Yes, that makes sense. Thanks. I guess I'll pivot and... Evan Greenberg : You got it. The number. That's your job, not my job. I got \u2013 I feel really optimistic about the company. Greg Peters : When you're growing your gross premium written at 11-plus percent, it's not a bad stat to throw out there, at least for this year so far. I'd like to -- as I've asked in previous calls, the expense ratio improvement. And if I just look at the year-to-date, just not the quarter number, but the year-to-date number, I assume some of that's a reflection of the growth and the leverage you have off the top line that you're generating. Can you give us a sense of what's transient and relates to growth? And then what's actually permanent in terms of true improvements in efficiencies? And maybe give us some color on what's actually driving that improvement? Evan Greenberg : I'm not going to answer it that way for you, but I'm going to try to give you a little more color around it. Let's see if I can frame this, though, for you, which is what you really need is a framing of how we think about it. Aside from the business mix, and seasonality, which impacts the ratio a little bit quarter-to-quarter. The company, an OpEx portion, in particular, is going to continue to improve over time. And I think about that as over a longer period of time. We already run a world-class ratio of efficiency. So let's just start with that. And it's like interest rates dropping percentages that they turn out to be smaller and smaller basis points over time. But so success can be your enemy a little bit. But it's in our culture and operating guidelines that we -- and this has always been true. We grow revenue faster than expense. Now I balance that, though, on the other side, that we -- it's balanced against adding investments in our business to constantly improve our capabilities and efficiencies for future periods. So on one hand, the discipline is we grow expense. We start out growing expense slower. And I'm not going to give -- I'm not going to disclose inside baseball, but we actually have ironclad, reasonably ironclad parameters around that of how much we'll grow expense relative to revenue. But then we balance that against investments we also make to improve efficiencies for the future -- for future periods. So it's the point that while it's efficient, it will continue to improve, and by the way, particularly in our COG operation. That's where I think there is real room for that. And I'm looking at right at Juan Luis, who feels the heat, and there you go. Greg Peters : I can use some of that. So thank you. Evan Greenberg : Which part can you use? Greg Peters : The heat for, Juan Luis. Evan Greenberg : Oh, Juan Luiz. Do you want to add to that? Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Evan Greenberg : Hi Tracy. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Good morning. Hey, turning to investments. It looks like you've been slightly extending the duration of your assets in the last few quarters. It's now at 4.5 years. I think historically, it's been closer to four years. I'm wondering if you're still at or below the duration of your liabilities. Or should we expect further extension of asset duration from here given the Cigna acquisition? I guess, I'm just trying to get a sense of where you're seeing investment opportunities given the shape of the yield curve, which is less kind of at the longer end, than what we see? Evan Greenberg : Tracy, our assets, our liabilities our -- the duration of our liabilities is greater than our asset duration, right now, our invested asset duration by actually a comfortable spread. And no, we don't expect at this moment, we don't see extending duration. And we're not paid to extend duration. And we're not doing that. But mix of business, Cigna has impacted it too. And Peter, did you want to add? Peter Enns : Yeah. Tracy, the vast majority of the change you saw relates to two on. One is the Cigna assets coming on, which had a slightly longer duration, which reflects their underlying business. And secondly, mortgage-backed securities, extending out just with a higher rate environment. So there's nothing that we've done proactively or decisively to affect that ratio. Tracy Benguigui : Perfect. Thank you for confirming that. On the Cigna earning contribution of $160 million, that's tracking ahead of your $450 million annual run rate. So is $450 million still the right run rate, or are you more constructive, you could earn more on a quarter basis? Peter Enns : So what I said was consolidating this into our Life segment going forward. We provided guidance on the initial announcement, and then we gave an update around the earnings accretion. So we don't want to provide ongoing guidance around what that income is going to look like. We just wanted to give you comfort that we were hitting our numbers. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great. Thanks. Two -- hopefully two questions. First, in the Life Insurance segment, is there anything unusual in Cigna's results from seasonality or anything other that wouldn't recur, or is this like a reasonable depiction of the earnings flow? Peter Enns : There was nothing unusual in the earnings. There was a slight increase on a relative basis for some COVID charges in the prior year, in the other international businesses, not Cigna. So the current is what it is. Meyer Shields : Okay. Perfect. Thanks. And then, Evan, I think this is a big picture question. You talked about casualty rates needing to pick up some steam. Does the industry face sort of irresistible momentum that will make that difficult or impossible or am I too pessimistic on its agility as an industry? Evan Greenberg : Can you say that again? Meyer Shields : Yeah. I'm wondering, so right now, we're seeing some signs of competition emerging in some commercial -- in some casualty lines. And historically, obviously, this industry has been tremendously cyclical, which means things get a little worse and then they get a little worse from that. And I'm wondering whether your perception of the industry, I'm not worried about Chubb, but is your perception of the industry that it has the agility to resist that momentum this time around? Evan Greenberg : Look, I can't prognosticate the future. I think rationally, major players have the same kind of data that we do, and they have experience and they see the same trends on the casualty side. And I'm not ringing an alarm bell so that we keep perspective here. Pricing is staying ahead. I'm looking longer into the future and anticipating not what we're seeing at the moment and that it doesn't take a genius to imagine that exposure growth will not continue to benefit that. So the industry will have to get more rate. And we're in a loss cost environment where inflation, it's an inflationary environment. Inflation is running higher than it has in the past. So it will get away from the industry at a much more rapid pace at their peril. If they don't get this, anticipate it and operationalize it in a reasonable period of time so that rate responds. And at the moment, I just play by the facts, and I am dead neutral about it. But I think most -- look, I look where Chubb's combined ratios are and then I look where others are. And there's not a lot of room for forgiveness in most companies' combined ratios. So I have to believe they will be rational. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Hey thanks. Good morning, Evan. Couple for you. First one, combined US, it's been trending downwards here all year. I know you've got a recession coming up, which probably is tough from a growth perspective. But what's going on there, and are there any kind of fixes going on? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. And it's a great question. I'm glad you actually asked that question. Combined US is actually -- I'm quite optimistic about it. Here's a deal. COVID really, really impacted it because of two things. Individual -- it's individual agency sales business, going small business by small business or individual by individual, and they pay you monthly premiums. Agency sales during COVID just dried up. And then it's worksite sales, worksite benefits, voluntary benefits to small and medium-sized businesses in particular. And during COVID dramatically hit. And again, that's monthly pay business. We're actually investing. And I'm actually investing money in combined retooling both agency and worksite, which we've done in a very dramatic way. And we're seeing the improvement begin to show to us in new business sales. Now frankly, it's going to take Route 23, before it really shows or before new business on the monthly volume of that and how it turns into renewal business to really show against the total base that has a natural lapse rate in it. And I see combined as a growth business. And for myself, where it will really show to you is 2024 onwards. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. And then second question\u2026 Peter Enns : That's the boiler room facts around it. Brian Meredith : Got you. That makes sense. A second question, Evan, can you remind us how much of your Commercial business is, call it E&S or non-admitted? And do you ascribe to the theory that the E&S market, so the non-admitted markets will continue to grow at a faster rate than the admitted markets here, just given the complexity of risks? Evan Greenberg : Well, it's going to vary by line of business. If you're going to get a property cat exposed, yeah. Though I think the E&S market is going to have pressure because of reinsurance availability and capital that uses E&S to front for it. I think that's going to -- I think that problem is in front of the E&S market overall. But rate, while that may impact its overall exposure growth, I think rate is going to overwhelm it. On the other side of the coin, I think on the casualty side, the admitted market is -- which gave up a lot of volume to the E&S side of the house. I see that actually probably growing faster on the admitted side than the E&S side as we go forward. Brian Meredith : Interesting. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : I can only be wrong. From my point of view, I'm playing both tables aggressively where I see opportunity in rationally. So whoever wins the race, wins the race. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. Good morning. I had a follow-up on the reinsurance cost, potentially going up and you talked a lot about the opportunities. I just thought I'd ask about Chubb is a buyer of reinsurance. Could you provide any information on the cost of your current catastrophe reinsurance programs? And anything you might add that help us think about how those prices may go up at the end of the year? Evan Greenberg : No, I'm not answering that question. The only thing I'm the answer is we're not a January 1. We don't renew our catastrophe reinsurance January 1. Thank you very much. Alex Scott : Okay. And maybe just one quick one on the Life Insurance business, I mean, do you anticipate any kind of change to the run rate of earnings from the accounting changes that are going into effect at the end of the year? Peter Enns : Nothing we can disclose at this time. Alex Scott : Okay. All right. Thank you. Operator : I would now like to turn today's call back over to Ms. Karen Beyer. End of Q&A: Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your calls. Enjoy the day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Fourth Quarter 2022 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Karen Beyer : Thank you and welcome everyone to our December 31, 2022 fourth quarter and year end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, financial supplements which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplements. Now, I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then we will take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had a strong finish, which contributed to another record year. Our quarterly underwriting results were excellent, with an 88% combined ratio despite a true-up to the projected \u201822 crop insurance full year results. We had good growth in net investment income that led to a record result and double-digit premium growth with strong contributions from our commercial and consumer P&C lines globally and our international life business. More important, the quarterly results led to what was the best full year financial performance in our company\u2019s history, including record operating income on both a per share and dollar basis from record P&C underwriting and investment income and another year of double-digit premium revenue growth, including the best organic growth in our international P&C business in a decade. All areas of the company contributed to the outstanding results last year. And I want to congratulate and thank so many of my colleagues around the globe. Core operating income in the quarter was $1.7 billion or $4.05 per share. Crop results reduced our expected agriculture earnings by $0.39 per share. For the year, we produced core operating income of $6.5 billion or $15.24 per share, up 21% and again, a record. Quarterly P&C underwriting income of $1.1 billion was impacted, as I said, by an underwriting loss from crop as we trued up our projection for the \u201822 crop year. This change of view for the full year result was due to the late season emergence of losses from drought conditions in certain corn belt states, which overshadowed average to excellent growing conditions in many other areas, leading to what we now know is a below-average year overall for that business. Agriculture is a weather exposed business with nat cat like characteristics. It\u2019s about growing conditions and commodity prices. And each year, you start over. For the year, we performed well, all considered. We published a 94.2% combined ratio and produced $165 million in agriculture underwriting income. Back on the quarter, excluding agriculture, the combined ratio was 85.9% and speaks to the strong broad-based underlying performance of our business, which produced an amazing 82.9% ex-cat current accident year combined ratio. Full year P&C underwriting income was a record $4.6 billion, up 23%, with a published combined ratio of 87.6% and that\u2019s with $2.2 billion of catastrophe losses in what was one of the costliest years yet for the industry in terms of cats. On the investment side, adjusted net investment income topped $1.1 billion for the quarter, up about $215 million from prior year and $4 billion for the year, both records. Our reinvestment rate is now averaging 5.6% against a portfolio yield of 3.6% and that\u2019s translating into annualized run-rate growth, simply going into the first quarter of 13%, which will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates. Our operating cash flow for the quarter and year was $2.7 billion and $11.2 billion respectively. For perspective, I want to touch on capital management. As you know, our policy is to maintain, is to manage for capital flexibility. After all, we are a balance sheet business in the risk business and we are a growth company. We maintain flexibility for risk and opportunity and return the balance to shareholders simple and consistent policy. The last 2 years are instructive. We have organically grown our P&C premiums 21.5% and that requires capital. We have deployed $5.4 billion for the Cigna acquisition and invested a further $1.4 billion and increasing our Huatai ownership together key strategic acquisitions with an emphasis on Asia. And at the same time, we have returned over $10.5 billion of total capital to shareholders through buybacks, over 9% of outstanding shares and dividends all the while maintaining capital adequacy for risk and future opportunity and we have capital flexibility given our strong earnings generation power. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and ROE. Now turning to growth in the rate environment, consolidated net written premiums for the company increased nearly 12% in the quarter on a published basis or 16% in constant dollars to $10.2 billion. This includes growth of 9.8% in our P&C business and over 100% of growth in life premiums, reflecting the addition of the Cigna Asia business. P&C premium growth in earnings in the quarter were balanced and broad-based with contributions from virtually all commercial and most consumer businesses globally. Agriculture aside, North America commercial premiums were up almost 9%, while our high net worth personal lines business was up 6%, a very strong result. Overseas general grew 9.7% in constant dollars, but declined 1.3% after FX, with commercial up 9.4% and consumer up 10.3%. We are a major multinational company and are impacted by currency movements. After reaching a 20-year high in September, the dollar has been weakening and that will benefit our growth in the future. In North America, growth this quarter in Commercial Lines was led by our major accounts and specialty division, which grew 9.1%, followed by our middle-market and small commercial business, which grew 8.7% and renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses, was over 96%. In our international general insurance operations, retail commercial P&C grew 9% in constant dollar, while our London wholesale business grew about 7.5%. Retail commercial growth was led by Latin America, with premiums up nearly 13%, followed by growth of 8.5% in Asia-Pac and 6.5% in our UK, Ireland division. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, pricing conditions remain favorable for most lines of business. The vast majority of our portfolio is achieving favorable risk-adjusted returns. So like I said last quarter, in most lines, additional rate is required primarily to keep pace with loss costs, which again are hardly benign in both long-tail and short-tail lines. To illustrate, in the quarter, pricing for total North America Commercial P&C which includes both rate and the portion of exposure that supports rate increased 6.5%, with loss costs up 6.5% as well. Now that\u2019s the headline. And let\u2019s drill down further, because I think it\u2019s more insightful. Pricing for commercial P&C, excluding financial lines and workers\u2019 comp was up 10%, with loss costs trending 6.9%. Breaking P&C down a step further, property pricing is firming in response to catastrophe exposures, inflation, reinsurance pricing and availability. Short-tail pricing was up 14.7%, while loss costs were up 6.8%. Property insurance is an opportunity for us. For the majority of casualty lines, pricing is adequate. In the quarter, pricing for North America Casualty was up 7.5%, while loss cost trends were 6.9%. Now given casualty loss cost trends, rates in most classes need to rise at an accelerated pace. There is little to no room for forgiveness. And here a special mention to excess casualty and auto-related liability is warranted. For Chubb, our minds are clear, and our playbook is consistent. In some lines like professional liability and workers\u2019 comp, which includes risk management, the competitive environment is quite aggressive and rates have been falling for a number of quarters now in recognition of favorable pricing and favorable experience. However, if not careful, the market is in danger of overshooting the mark. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines in aggregate were essentially flat. They were up 0.2%, while loss cost trends were up 5%. And in workers\u2019 comp, which includes both primary comp and risk management, pricing was up 2.3% against a loss cost trend of 5.5%. Internationally, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, pricing was up about 9.5%. Rates varied by class and by region as well as country within region and loss costs are trending 6.2%. Turning to our consumer businesses, in our North America high net worth personal lines business, again, net written premiums were up about 6%. Our true high net worth client segment, however, grew 12.5%. There is a flight to quality and capacity. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 12.5%, while the homeowners\u2019 loss cost trend is running about 10.5%. International consumer lines premiums grew over 10% in the quarter, again, in constant dollar. Our International A&H division had another strong quarter, with premiums up about 21%. Asia-Pac was up nearly 40%, with half of the growth coming from the Cigna acquisition, while Latin America and the UK each were up about 13.5%. Premiums in our international personal lines business were up less than 1% in constant dollar. In our international life insurance business, premiums doubled in constant dollar while life income overall was also up over 100%, both positively impacted by the addition of the Cigna Asia business, which is on track. As we enter \u201823, while early days, growth in our Asia consumer business including non-life, life and A&H is widespread and strong, a combination of a strong external environment and our capabilities and presence. Consumer lending, increasing foot traffic across retail and banking operations and the resurgence of leisure and business travel are all contributing to strong growth. Leisure travel alone was up nearly 400% over prior year. And as China reopens from its strict pandemic controls, it will further stimulate growth in the region. Think trade, which benefits commercial lines and business travel and think tourist travel as the Chinese begin to travel again on holiday. As regards China, as you know, last quarter, we have received regulatory approval to increase our ownership in Huatai Insurance Group, to 83.2%. Since then, the transfer of shares from a number of separate shareholders has taken place and we have increased our ownership to 64%. The remaining 19% is expected to close in the next weeks or months. In summary, we had an outstanding year. And looking ahead, we are starting off on a strong foot in the first quarter overall. Conditions remain favorable in terms of continued growth for our businesses globally and then add the strong trajectory of growth from investment income. Despite the challenging macro environment, I am quite optimistic about our future and confident in our ability to outperform. I will now turn the call over to Peter and then we are going to come back and we are going to take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan and good morning. As you have just heard, we continue to deliver strong underlying business and investment performance in the fourth quarter, leading to another year of record results. Book value and tangible book value per share increased 6.2% and 9.5% respectively since September. The increase reflects strong operating results, $544 million in dividends and share repurchases as well as net realized and unrealized gains of $1.6 billion after tax, including $1.3 billion in this income portfolio from declining interest rates and foreign currency translation gains of $594 million. This quarter\u2019s mark-to-market investment gains follow prior quarter\u2019s losses from a rising rate environment, reinforcing our view that these fluctuations in valuation, particularly on a high-quality fixed income portfolio are largely transient and don\u2019t represent real economics for a buy and hold insurance company like Chubb. For the full year, book and tangible book value per share decreased 12.9% and 23.5%, whereas excluding AOCI they increased 5.3% and 3% respectively, including the dilutive impact on tangible equity of the Cigna acquisition. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 18.6% and 17.2% respectively, while our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 11.9% and 11.2%. Turning to investments, adjusted net investment income for the quarter of over $1.1 billion topped last quarter\u2019s record by more than 6% and was 24% higher than the prior year quarter. We anticipate this to continue to increase in 2023 through portfolio growth and a continuing attractive rate environment. And as such, we expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to now be in the range of $1.135 billion to $1.155 billion. The quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $400 million, principally from winter storm Elliott. There were other weather-related events in the quarter, offset by changes from prior quarter\u2019s cats. However, there was no change in our aggregate Hurricane Ian estimate. Catastrophe and crop insurance underwriting losses together added 6.6 percentage points to our P&C combined ratio. We had favorable prior period development in our active companies in the quarter of $254 million mainly in the short-tail lines, primarily from commercial P&C lines of property, marine and agriculture from 2020 and 2021 accident years. In addition, there was adverse development of $87 million in our legacy runoff exposures, including $62 million related to asbestos, which was recognized as part of our annual reserve review. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 102% of which about 8 percentage points related specifically to payments in our crop insurance program, which are typically higher in the fourth quarter each year. The paid-to-incurred ratio was 85%, excluding crops, cats and PPD. International Life Insurance segment income post the Cigna acquisition is as expected, except for an adverse non-recurring $52 million adjustment in the quarter related to Huatai, the company\u2019s partially owned insurance entity. This adjustment was to better align our accounting policies and procedures. In addition, the Life Insurance segment in total benefited from a reserve release of $60 million in the quarter related to our combined North America business. Our core operating effective tax rate was 17.5% for the quarter and 17.8% for the year, in line with previously guided range. Our expected annual core operating effective tax rate for 2023, we expect to be in the range of 18% to 19%. On a final note, Chubb is adopting long-duration targeted improvement accounting guidance, or LDTI, as of January 1, 2023. This changes the accounting for long-duration contracts, which relates to our Life Insurance businesses. And this is an accounting change only, having no impact on the underlying economics. In the 10-K, we will disclose the historical book value impact as of 1 and 2 years ago, but as of year-end \u201822, we expect a net favorable but immaterial impact to book value. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. And at this point, we\u2019re happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hi, good morning. Thanks for the detail on the rate by line of business and loss trend by line. I thought that was helpful. I\u2019m interested in the casualty market where it sounds like price is still above loss trend. Hearing again the need for additional rate here. I\u2019m wondering if you\u2019re seeing what the market\u2019s discipline is in terms of getting that additional rate? Or if competition is picking up here at all, interest rates are higher. We\u2019re obviously seeing some competition picking up in professional liability. So just wondering what you\u2019re seeing in North America casualty. Evan Greenberg : Yes. Look, I don\u2019t think there is an increase in competition related to interest rates. And remember, look at the yield curve, what the market expect rates to be going out a couple of years. No one misses that. And rates are not at such a level that it would have a material impact, if you were thinking about cash flow underwriting the business and you have liability durations in your question that runs somewhere between 7 years and 25 years, depending on the line of business. So I would \u2013 I don\u2019t think that\u2019s \u2013 I\u2019m taking time to talk about that because I listen to those \u2013 that kind of thinking, and you\u2019re a smart guy, and others are I think you guys should think that through a little more. It\u2019s more to do with them. And I don\u2019t see an increase in competition. I see a pretty steady market. But what I do note in certain lines of business is either a lack of recognition of the loss cost environment naive at around loss cost environment, or just a failure of management to be in touch and drill in and show leadership, take action. And I just am concerned about that in certain lines where \u2013 when you think about it on a risk-adjusted adequate return basis, and that\u2019s why I spiked out two lines in particular. I don\u2019t think there is a recognition among most that to maintain discipline, you better keep pace with loss cost because there is no room and, in some cases, overshooting the mark and this can get away from you pretty quickly. We\u2019re not in a benign inflation environment in casualty, and that has nothing to do with general inflation that has to do more with everything around so-called social inflation. And you can see it. It\u2019s a trend that has footprints that go back a number of years, and it\u2019s very, very clear. Then you have a couple of other lines, which I spike out separately from casualty where market condition \u2013 where pricing has been very good. And loss cost has been reasonable. And so you can understand rate adjustment, give back but be careful. It\u2019s not endless. David Motemaden : Right. Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I appreciate that answer. And then just following up, maybe a question for Peter, could you talk about the drivers of prior period development in North America commercial between short tail and long tail lines? Peter Enns : I think all I\u2019d say is if you looked at the prior year quarter there was a significant COVID-related release. So if you\u2019re comparing, I think you just need to adjust for that. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Peter Enns : Last year, last quarter had a large COVID adjustment. So that\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to compare. You can\u2019t compare quarter-on-quarter that way from year-to-year within North America commercial. David Motemaden : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, good morning, Evan. My first question relates to your own reinsurance book. We\u2019ve heard about some pretty strong rate increases at January 1. Did you guys choose to write more property cat reinsurance yourselves? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Elyse, just so you know, you\u2019re breaking up a little bit. I think I got it, but you\u2019re just be aware that it\u2019s hard. You\u2019re not coming through really clearly. I think you were talking about property cat and whether we see it as an opportunity. Look, we have a very clear mind about our standards, adjusted returns we would expect to see in property cat to increase our exposure. And we\u2019re in the middle of the market. And so I\u2019m not going to comment any further than that, except that if the conditions are right, from \u2013 in both terms and in pricing, then Chubb is a risk taker in property cat. We will increase. However, it\u2019s not a business we need to chase by any means. And so we will only deploy additional capital to take more exposure if we like the trade. Beyond that, I know you want to know specifics and I\u2019m hardly going to look forward and talk about it while we\u2019re on the field of play. You\u2019ll see the footprints after the fact. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. And then my second question, Evan, you mentioned commercial property rates picking up following Hurricane Ian. I would think as reinsurance rates move, there would be a trickle-down impact and perhaps rates get better there as we move through \u201823. Would you agree with that statement? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, I think if you listened to my commentary, I just said that. When I talked about the 14.8%, I believe it was increase in pricing. I mentioned the cat environment, I mentioned availability, I mentioned reinsurance availability and reinsurance pricing. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And do you think \u2013 as you think out, do you think property is probably one of the stronger growth opportunities within your commercial book in \u201823? Evan Greenberg : I think I already made my comment about that property is an opportunity for Chubb is what I said only 10 minutes ago. I can\u2019t stand on it any further than that. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome from Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Thanks for the call rest of the year. I was hoping you could give us a little bit of additional color on what we\u2019ve seen at Chubb from exposure changes over the last, say, couple of quarters, is that we move into 2023. And there are some folks including our strategists, that thinks we\u2019re going to be in a recession sometime this year. I was wondering if \u2013 so what are the sensitivities among your books, what parts of your business would we see if it happens in the future and what parts would be less sensitive to assessments and exposure changes? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I\u2019m not going to go deep into that, but you \u2013 I will relate you back in my commentary where I said that the industry in casualty needs to get more rate to keep pace with loss cost and one of the things that is in my \u2013 on my mind in that regard is you can\u2019t rely on price as much going forward in casualty, which is about sale, you rate off of sale or you rate off of payroll, you rate off of human for business-related exposures. It could be square footage and to measure traffic of consumers coming through. These are all economically related exposure movements. And that will \u2013 whether we have recession or we don\u2019t have recession, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the point. The point really is as economic activity relative to \u201822 and \u201821, certainly, is going to be slower. And so you need rate, pure rate and can rely less on the exposure on the percentage of exposure to help the performance when you think about rate to exposure and inflation and loss cost. That is more of what\u2019s on my mind when I think about exposure. I don\u2019t think about it as much in terms of growth overall and the support of our growth rate. And I think our growth rate will be just fine. Paul Newsome : Then maybe as well, can you talk a little bit about the ability of both Chubb and the industry to pass on higher reinsurance costs to sort of primary commercial lines. Things have changed a little bit, I think, structurally over the years. And I think I\u2019m not sure what the sensitivity is today in terms of how quickly the primaries lines will respond to higher reinsurance costs in today\u2019s environment. But any thoughts there would be great, I think just to help us out? Evan Greenberg : Well, I can\u2019t speak to everybody else. And so you\u2019ll just have to stay tuned and figure that out, Paul. But beyond that, I know when I think about short tail lines where you\u2019re seeing reinsurance price increases, I\u2019m not worried from a Chubb point of view of achieving rate and price to both keep pace or exceed loss costs. What we expect for cat and to manage increased reinsurance costs. I think that \u2013 and that\u2019s why I gave you the fourth quarter pricing I think it\u2019s \u2013 I think that speaks for itself that way. Paul Newsome : Thanks a lot. And I will appreciate. That will help as always. Evan Greenberg : You are welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Greg. Greg Peters : Good morning, everyone. So obviously, you commented this on your comments. So just letting you know I heard your comments, but I\u2019m looking for further clarification. Evan Greenberg : I can just repeat myself. Greg Peters : Well, you didn\u2019t say much about this. So hopefully, I can get a little more out of view. But I was I intrigued by your comment about the retention in commercial at 96%. And maybe you could give us some historical context and then more importantly, you talk about the moving pieces of the market, financial lines, workers\u2019 comp? Do you have a view of how that might trend over the near-term? Are you willing to share with us should add? Evan Greenberg : Yes. On your first question, it\u2019s on a premium basis, the 96%. So it\u2019s both policy count, customer retention in terms of unit count, and it has the impact of price of rate in there in the 96%. So on a policy count basis, on a customer retention basis, it is a lower number, but it\u2019s \u2013 but on historic earns basis, it\u2019s very high. It\u2019s very stable our renewal book of business. And I think that\u2019s reasonably true for the industry given where you are, there was so much movement of customer during the hardest part of the cycle in COVID and all of that. And as people pulled back capacity and so many accounts had to find a new home. And then you find that there is more stability in retention of customers, both distribution do they want to move it, the customers themselves don\u2019t want. And so you have more of a stability that way. So, that\u2019s running at a high level. When I look forward on financial lines and comp, look, I can only give you \u2013 if I am going to prognosticate to you, I can only prognosticate what I would think would be logical and markets are never logical. There is all kinds of players. I do see in financial lines, more of the established players really know the businesses are more stable and showing more stability and recognizing that, okay, there has been \u2013 where are we on a risk-adjusted and at an expected loss cost basis. They have more insight into that and then a lot of small one of Visa [ph]. And so it creates a little chaos in the market that way, but I see a little more stability that way right now beginning to emerge. In comp, I don\u2019t know what to tell you. The market has to draw a line and I think that moment of truth is coming. Greg Peters : Yes, that makes sense. Another area that Peter commented on, it seems kind of important. And I am going to have to review the comments in the transcript. But Peter, maybe you can go back. The gives and takes out of the life insurance, you talked about assimilating the accounting and then you talked about some other headwinds that happened in the fourth quarter. Can you go through that and maybe give us a little additional color on that? Peter Enns : So, the one-time charge I have mentioned, and it\u2019s a non-recurring charge was related to Huatai as it relates to aligning our accounting policies as our ownership levels increased and that was $52 million. There was an additional, which I didn\u2019t say about $8 million of FX impact. And so that\u2019s how I think about it. If you are looking at the international life insurance business, the reported income and adjusting for those two things, that would give you more of a sense of how we view ongoing income coming out of that business, which is why we spiked out the largest of the two, and I will just highlight the one other one. Evan Greenberg : So, in our minds, that\u2019s like that brings you to about $175 million. Peter Enns : It\u2019s about $60 million putting the two together. Greg Peters : Okay. Got it. Peter Enns : Excellent what it will be. But to be very clear, the $52 million, we view very much is one-time to align policies as we have gotten closer to and more insight. Greg Peters : Got it. Thanks for the answers. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui from Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Good morning. I would like to go back to the discussion on casualty. I fully understand that rate needs to increase to keep up with loss cost trends. But there are things you could do on the structural side, are you making any meaningful changes in attachment points or deductible? One of your competitors mentioned an inflation is causing more losses to creep into the excess layer? Evan Greenberg : Yes, of course. That\u2019s all that \u2013 listen we can track attachment point changes and all of that and ventilating of layers and all that good stuff. So, yes, and that\u2019s all baked into our thinking, of course. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, got it. And we actually got more color from you on loss cost trends by business line this quarter. And you mentioned just sticking with North American casualty that loss costs were 6.9%. Can you give context how that\u2019s trended versus prior quarters? And if you could also see\u2026. Evan Greenberg : Stable. Tracy Benguigui : Stable, okay. And if you could tease out if this is a level you are observing right now, are you using a higher projected loss trend when you think about risk-adjusted returns? Evan Greenberg : I am really not going to overly dwell on this subject now. So, I am going to move along. But what \u2013 the only other piece of information I will give you is that the loss cost trends we have, I gave you an overall and that means it is a mix of primary in excess and all of that baked into it. It is stable. Our view is stable at this time and we constantly look at it, and I gave you a lot of information in the second quarter and third quarter around inflation and how we adjusted for our views and forward views on inflation, both in the pricing and in our actual reserving. And so I am going to stop right there. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Hey, thanks. So I am just curious, given where your rate is and loss trend is there more room here as we look into 2023 for underlying margin improvement in the business, or are we getting close to kind of a good, solid acceptable return in the business? Evan Greenberg : I think you \u2013 I mean look at it by ratios, Brian. I think they are just stellar. They are world-class returns and I am very happy with the returns in our portfolio. And as far as whether they would get any better, well, stay tuned. Brian Meredith : Okay. Thanks. And then the second question\u2026 Evan Greenberg : You know, I don\u2019t give forward guidance\u2026 Brian Meredith : I was hoping. Evan Greenberg : I know you guy. I love you dearly. It\u2019s a good try. Brian Meredith : Okay. The second one, I am just curious \u2013 thanks for the comments on capital management. I know you guys have done a ton this year, and it\u2019s great, but it did slow in the fourth quarter. Was there anything going on? Anything with respect to thoughts that\u2019s why you slowed the share buyback in the fourth quarter relative to call it the third quarter? Evan Greenberg : No. And that\u2019s why I really did want to take time and step back and we all look at perspective together of our capital management policy and how it translated to numbers. And I mean it\u2019s a stunning amount of capital that we have used. I mean it speaks to our stewardship of capital and our earning power over the couple of years. And I wanted to create that context and perspective, nothing has changed at all in how we manage, think about managing capital and buybacks is just one dimension of that as you know. And we have a buyback authorization. And we have a bunch remaining within that. And we say that as we do, when you read it, that we will repurchase up to that amount. And we are just steady as she goes. Nothing has changed about how we view it. Peter Enns : Brian, maybe to revisit the context just to what Evan said, so we have about $1.6 billion left, so up to $1.6 billion through the first half of this year. And one more point in context as we looked at it. And this is not the framework we use this has come up on a prior call. But buybacks and dividends of $4.4 billion aggregate to about 75% of our income for the year, which we think is a reasonable way to compared to others. But it\u2019s not actually how we manage it. Brian Meredith : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hey. Good morning. First one I had is actually a follow-up on the last question. On the capital front, when you think through how strong the margins are, as you pointed out, and price adequacy across a lot of your business in a pretty strong place balanced with some of the comments you are making about the forward-looking casualty markets and so forth. How does that make you feel about your capital and your willingness to deploy into organic business at the moment, when we think about strong starting point, and the comments you have made about the next year in casualty potentially? Evan Greenberg : Look, we have plenty of capital and firepower to support organic growth on our appetite, and I already said it around property, and it extends to any line of business. If we like the terms and the pricing on a risk-adjusted basis, we will grow our exposure period. Is that something to say. Volatility, if I am paid to take it. Alex Scott : Understood. Second question was also a growth question, but on the life insurance business. Just wanted to see if you could help us think through now that you have completed the Cigna acquisition and you get into some of the integration and so forth, what does that look like and thinking out over the next year or 2 years in terms of being a growth engine for the company? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I think it is both in earnings and it is both a source of earnings growth, and it is a source of revenue growth, particularly in Asia. And it is in both the risk ends of life insurance, which think about more accident and health oriented, which I have gone into detail about that. As well as protection, more traditional protection and savings business, think about it through a variety of distribution channels, agency direct marketing, telephone-based and the fast emergence of digital channels. Think about it in partnership with our non-life business, which are very active that way and that\u2019s a competitive advantage for Chubb in life and Asia\u2019s. Our integrated capability and distribution and product among life and non-life together to the same customers. Think about the growing consumer base. Middle income, in particular, and then high net worth, particularly in certain territories, China and Hong Kong based and the middle income from Korea to Thailand, Vietnam, Indonesia and think about this is the most dynamic region in the world when you think about long-term wealth creation. And I think the next 1 year or 2 years, sure, look good, but that\u2019s not what\u2019s on my mind. It\u2019s the next 5 years to 10 years and how it\u2019s now 20% of our business, Asia, and the majority of it is consumer, not commercial. And when I think across all lines, including the life and that business, to me, will represent a greater percentage of Chubb. And over time, you can\u2019t measure it just quarter-to-quarter. But over a period of time, when you look at it, we will out \u2013 its growth trajectory will outpace the rest of the company. Alex Scott : Got it. Very helpful. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey. Good morning. First question is on the helpful paid-to-incurred ratio comments you provided us on the call, and obviously, we get them from the Qs and Ks too. But I was looking back, I can see that the underlying paid-to-incurred the items you called out has increased to 85%, up year-over-year from 81%. But if I look kind of back at pre-COVID years, pre, I guess substantial rate increases in terms of conditions changes, too, obviously, it was running in the low-90s. So, just curious at a high level, if you feel this ratio is kind of running kind of a little better than you expected? And maybe that\u2019s for a good reason given the substantial changes in the marketplace over the last few years. Evan Greenberg : Well, I think it tells you a few things. We have grown our exposure a lot. And your first incurred losses and we are in a fast, we have been in a faster growth trajectory. So, when you conceptualize, we have grown more quickly exposure, incurred losses come and grow at a certain pace before the paids come through. So, on one hand, you have that. And then on the other hand, you have the strength and maybe it speaks ultimately to the strength of our reserves. And let\u2019s just wait and see over time. It\u2019s nothing, but good news. Mike Zaremski : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. Follow-up is just I am curious if you could provide us with a kind of update on strategic priorities as regards to North America commercial kind of moving down market into small, medium-sized employer competitive sandbox. Is that still an inorganic strategic priority? And is M&A also on the table there? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : I will try to have M&A on the table. No, there is no M&A. I am looking at a table that is empty at the moment. It\u2019s organic growth and we are endeavoring along and it is very digital and modern centric. And in concert with our middle market and lower middle market business. And the two of those, while the small commercial itself gets modernized into a digital enterprise, it is a consistent and very intense strategy in terms of management focus, resource and attention. I am looking at John Lupica, I am looking at John Keogh and we have the most senior executives with their eyes and Julie Dillman, who runs all of our IT and Ops and drives our transformation. From that end, we have got so much executive talent just focused and committed that this is an important future business to Chubb. And it is just \u2013 it\u2019s consistent and it\u2019s \u2013 you grind it out, yard-by-yard. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Ms. Karen Beyer, I will turn the call back over to you for some closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you everyone for joining us today. And if you have any questions, follow-up questions, we will be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited First Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome, everyone, to our March 31, 2023 first quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplements. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had an excellent start to the year, highlighted by double-digit operating earnings growth that led to record results. We had double-digit premium revenue growth that was global, broad-based and driven by strong results in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses and our International Life business. World-class underwriting results with an 86.3% combined ratio, record net investment income and life income that more than doubled. North America P&C rate and price increases reaccelerated in the quarter, it was an word standout performance that I expect will continue. We grew operating income almost 12% to $1.8 billion, and that drove a 15% increase to $4.41 per share, both records. In context, of what was an active CAT quarter, our published combined ratio reflects simply outstanding underwriting performance from our P&C businesses. The 83.4% ex-cat current accident year combined ratio was a record. On the Investment income side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up over 30%. Our portfolio yield is now 3.8% versus 3% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.5%. Our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates. Life Insurance premium revenue more than doubled, while Life earnings doubled to $244 million, driven by our business in Asia and predominantly the addition of the Cigna operations which are mostly A&H and product makeup. In this time of economic and financial market volatility and uncertainty, Chubb is a safe haven. Our business model and the fundamentals of our business are very strong and broad-based. Our earnings and revenue are growing. We have an exceptionally strong capital position and a conservative level of leverage and our operating cash flow of $11 billion in '22 and over $2.25 billion this quarter speaks to our strong liquidity. Our unrealized loss as a percentage of tangible equity is 17% and will amortize back to par over a short period. Rising interest rates of our brand and most important, as you know, you can have a run on the bank in our business. So again, this speaks to an attractive profile that distinguishes Chubb. Peter is going to have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and a rising ROE. Now turning to growth and the pricing and rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased over 16.5% in the quarter on a published basis or over 18% in constant dollars, comprised of 11% growth in our P&C business globally and 129% growth in life premiums. P&C premium growth in the quarter was balanced and broad-based. North America, Europe and Asia, all produced double-digit growth. Beginning with North America, commercial premiums were up almost 12% or 6.2% excluding Agriculture. Adjusted for the impact of one-off loss portfolio transfers in our major accounts division, year-over-year North America regular commercial flow grew 7.6%, which is representative of the minimum rate growth we expect for the balance of the year. And by the way, the 7.6% is broken down as 10% growth in P&C and minus 2% growth in financial lines. Our major accounts and specialty division grew 6.3% or 8.7% adjusted for the LPTs. And that was 11.4% P&C and minus 7% financial lines. In our middle market and small commercial business, premiums were up 6.5% or 7% in P&C and up 2% in financial lines. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was 97%. On the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business was up almost 10%, an exceptionally strong result. And in fact, the strongest organic growth in over 15 years. Turning to our International General Insurance operations, net premiums were up 10% in constant dollars or 6% after FX impact with commercial up 10.8% and consumer up over 8.5%. Growth was led by our Asia Pacific region with premiums up over 18.5%. And with commercial lines up about 15% and consumer lines up over 22%. And Europe produced overall growth of over 10%. In terms of the Commercial P&C rate environment, rate and price increases reaccelerated. Pricing for total North America Commercial P&C, which includes rate of 6.4% and exposure change of 4.5% increased 11.2% against a loss cost trend of 6.7%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty, excluding financial lines and workers' comp was up 16.9%. Property pricing was up 27%, with rates up 16.4% and exposure change of 9.1%. Casualty pricing was up 9.9%, which includes 7.4% of rate and 2.3% of exposure. As I said last quarter, for professional lines and workers' comp, which includes risk management, the competitive environment is aggressive and rates have continued to decline in recognition of favorable experience. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America, financial lines and aggregate were down about 2% and in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and risk management, pricing was up 6.4%, with rates down 0.5% and exposure up about 6.8%. Internationally, we continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our commercial portfolio. In our international retail business, pricing was up about 8%, with rates up 4.8%, and exposure change of about 2.9%. While loss costs across our international commercial portfolio, or trending at 6.5%. Turning to our Consumer businesses. In North America, high net worth personal lines business, again, net written premiums were up almost 10%. With our true high net worth client segment, up over 15%. Retentions were 104% on a premium basis and about 91% or on an account basis. We continue to benefit from a flight to quality and capacity. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of about 13%, while the homeowners loss cost trend is running about 10.5%. International consumer lines premiums again grew over 8.5% in the quarter in constant dollars. Our international A&H division had another strong quarter, with premiums up about 20%. Asia Pacific was up 34.5% while the U.K. was up over 12%. Premiums in our international personal lines business were down 1.5 points, and it was impacted by our business in Europe. In our International Life Insurance business, again, premiums and income overall more than doubled. Our business in Korea and the majority of Asia is off to a good start to the year. I was just in Korea two weeks ago, our leadership, the franchise, the strategy, the execution and the growth are all in really good shape. And this is a very large business for Chubb. In summary, we had an excellent quarter and have had a strong start to the year with a lot of momentum heading into the second quarter. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and operating earnings, which in turn drive EPS through the three engines of P&C underwriting income, investment income and life income. Add to that our business model, financial strength, stability and liquidity, and I believe you have in Chubb, both the reassurance of safety, and the attractive prospects of a long-term growth company. I'll turn the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan, and good morning. Before we begin, I want to note that previously reported numbers in the financial supplement we just filed were adjusted to reflect the impact from the adoption of LDTI accounting, which primarily relates to our Life Insurance business. The cumulative impact of LDTI on our book value and overall results is immaterial. Please refer to Page 31 of the financial supplement for detailed information. Turning to our first quarter results. As you've just heard, we are starting out the year an exceptionally strong financial position. Our P&C divisions, expanding life business and strong investment performance produced operating cash flow of $2.3 billion. We grew our assets to over $200 billion, and this includes invested assets of about $116 billion that continued to benefit from the current rate environment and generated our fourth consecutive quarter of record net investment income. I would note S&P and Fitch both reaffirmed our AA ratings and stable outlook, reflecting our strong financial position. Relative to capital-related actions in the quarter, we returned $772 million to shareholders, including $428 million in share repurchases at an average price of $212.81 per share and $344 million in dividends. Book value and tangible book value per share increased 5% and 8.7%, respectively, from last quarter. The increase reflects our record core operating income and net realized and unrealized gains of $1.7 billion in the investment portfolio, partially offset by the capital return to shareholders I already mentioned. Our core operating ROE for the quarter was 12.6%, and our core operating return on tangible equity was 19.4%. A year ago, Evan stated our target for 2023 core operating ROE, excluding excess capital or on a deployed capital basis to be 13% and core operating return on tangible equity to be 20%. In this first quarter of 2023, we estimate the deployed capital ROE results to be in the range of 13.5% to 14% and 23% to 23.5%, respectively. Adjusted net investment income for the quarter was $1.2 billion and topped last year's record quarter -- last quarter's record by over 7%, reflecting higher reinvestment rates that impact recurring income as well as certain items totaling approximately $35 million, including higher-than-expected private equity distributions that vary from quarter-to-quarter. We now expect our adjusted net investment income on a recurring basis to rise from this quarter's 1.165 to 1.2 to 1.22 next quarter and we expect it to continue to rise from there for the remainder of the year given our positive cash flows, portfolio turnover and the current reinvestment rate environment. Let me make a few more comments on investments given recent economic and market events. We continue to maintain our consistent conservative approach to our investment process and our portfolio remains high quality with an average rate A rating. Our overall exposure to banks is 8% of invested assets with two-thirds of that -- two-thirds of that in G-SIFIs. We have no exposure to Silicon Valley Signature or First Republic Banks. We have no exposure to Credit Suisse contingent capital securities and do not invest in Tier 1 bank Cocos as an investment policy. Our exposure to regional banks is less than 1% of our portfolio and is in high-quality names. Our total direct exposure to commercial real estate is 4% of invested assets and 87% of that total is in investment-grade securities with an average rating of AA. This portfolio is skewed to multifamily and industrial sectors with under 20% related to the commercial office segment. High-yield credit is currently 14% of our portfolio and is targeted to the upper tier of the high-yield market, rated BB with a current average rating of B+ broadly diversified with over 900 issuers and mandated to outperform in down markets. Back to our underwriting business. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $458 million split 76% in the U.S. and 24% internationally. In the U.S., the loss activity consisted of winter-related storms and other severe weather events. Internationally, results were primarily impacted by storms in New Zealand and Australia. Prior period development in the quarter was a favorable $196 million. Included in that total is adverse development of $6 million related to the 2022 accident year cat losses comprised of $119 million adverse development from Winter storm Elliott, and $113 million favorable from Hurricane Ian. Excluding cat-related development, we had favorable development of $202 million across all lines, commercial and consumer, with $228 million favorable related to short tail lines and an adverse development of $26 million in long tail lines, $10 million of which was from corporate runoff lines. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 92% or 82% after adjusting for cats prior period development and a large payment related to the Boy Scouts of America settlement. Our core operating effective tax rate was 18.1% for the quarter at the low end of our expected annual range. I would highlight the first quarter often has a lower tax rate than the full year, and we continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for this year to be in the range of 18% to 19%. Lastly, relative to Wati, we closed on some of our outstanding shares during the quarter, which brought our ownership interest to 64%. We continue to apply equity accounting for the first quarter, and we'll consolidate Wati once we go over two-thirds ownership, which we think will likely occur in the second quarter when we anticipate exceeding 80%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, David. David Motemaden : Good morning, Evan. So really encouraging to see the reacceleration in North America commercial pricing. It sounds like most of that was rate versus exposure. I guess I also heard that you said you expect a 7.6% sort of minimum growth in North America commercial throughout the course of the year. So wondering if you could just unpack how you see that progressing between both rate on existing policies as well as just growth in terms of adding new incremental units of exposure? Evan Greenberg : Yes. No. David, as you know, we don't give forward guidance really. And I gave you a little flash, but I'm not going to go further than that. I was pretty clear, I expect the trend you see in pricing, and I expect the trend you see in sort of pattern and growth to continue. And you got a sense of P&C lines growing and you got a sense of professional or financial lines. And beyond that, it's not simply about North America and look at the company globally, and frankly, look at the International P&C and I expect the pattern to continue, look at consumer lines, and I expect the pattern to continue. Look at life, and I expect the pattern to continue. Investment income, and I expect the pattern to continue. David Motemaden : Okay. Great. I appreciate that. And then as my follow-up, Evan, in your letter, you spoke about how Chubb enhanced its ability to collect and assess loss cost at more quickly and accurately and then that helps you be more insightful in pricing and reserving. I was wondering if you could just elaborate on how you enhance the stability. And if that played in, I heard you may have ticked up the loss trend a little bit in North America commercial. Wondering what insight gave you to do or this enhanced ability to view loss trend data, how that played into potentially changing? How you're viewing trend going forward? Evan Greenberg : Yes. And I talked about this, you're right in the letter and on previous calls, and that is like so many businesses. If you take a bigger picture view of it, insurance and among other financial companies and nonfinancial, we're coming out of a -- and have come out of a period of very low inflation. Zero cost of money fundamentally are overwhelmed by liquidity. And in the low inflation environment, you don't have to be necessarily as insightful on loss cost any -- at a particular moment in time, lag has less of an impact on you. You have to watch it very carefully, and we always -- but the time element of date of when of data when you get it, you could be a little more relaxed. It's a quarter old -- two quarters old, less important. In an inflationary environment, which we experienced and began while ago, that's a killer. And for those of us who've experienced inflation at time values can mean everything in accuracy. And that's where we really immediately when we saw it jumped on it and measured that time lag in data, which you have to get to the source of input when you're looking at inflation, whether it's on the physical side of when a repair is actually occurring to an automobile or a home or it's on the liability side very quickly in the development of that. You have to be on top of the trend and you really have to unpack severity from frequency and then you had the impact of COVID on frequency. So -- and then you add to that the tools we have available terms of external data and the use of it and our ability to manipulate and use data internal and external more insightfully and more quickly. You add the capabilities and analytics of this organization with claims and actuarial and underwriting together, and I think it's a competitive weapon and advantage particularly the speed at which we can react. And I think any modern financial organization that distinguishes itself. That's part of the action. David Motemaden : Great. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Good morning. First question on reinsurance costs. Any -- given industries experiencing higher reinsurance costs, both on property and on the casualty side and maybe that's not the case for Chubb. Feel free to correct me. Is Chubb contemplating any changes in its strategy, maybe retentions? Or is this still TBD as things progress? Evan Greenberg : No, no material change. And we obviously aren't going to -- as you can appreciate, I'm not going to discuss our own reinsurance program. That's for our own protections, that's proprietary. But our retentions have not changed in any material way. And we've got a big balance sheet. We take a lot of risk net. And we really don't buy reinsurance for earnings protection so much. We buy it for -- more for balance sheet protection. And depending on the line of business volatility and that's been a steady policy of ours and we maintain it regardless of cycle. Mike Zaremski : Got it. Follow up on market conditions. You gave us a lot of good color. If we -- the acceleration in pure rate accelerated a lot more than I think there might have been a tad bit of a loss cost pickup just on the North America commercial side. But maybe you can kind of lend some more color on, do you feel the markets being more rational in terms of kind of adjusting to loss cost trends and also higher reinsurance pricing? And it sounded like you were optimistic that things have -- competitive conditions have gotten a little bit better quarter-over-quarter. Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Yes. I think it's a little bit of a mixed bag. Property, certainly and short tail certainly responding. I think in larger account business, responding a little better than in middle market, though middle market has a stability to it. It's more in P&C lines. I think that financial lines, certain areas of financial lines, it's -- and so in those areas, I generally like the tone. We're seeing excess casualty, particularly in larger comp business respond. I'm imagining in time, middle market will need to and will. So rate is pretty -- our rates are increasing there. When I look at professional lines, and you have to unpack it between financial lines between professional liability and there are all kinds of classes in D&O, both private and public D&O. I think public D&O market, there are a lot of players with no data and no experience and they're receiving many of them capacity by those who don't seem to have their eye on the ball. And there's an area where I think the market is overshooting the mark and of course we'll always trade in that case, volume for and under the right underwriting. And it's not an area that I think is devoid of risk, particularly as you look forward, everything from recession and volatility in financial markets to climate change and claims of greenwashing and all of that. So it doesn't that -- and that's just a line on the margin. So it's a mixed bag. Comp is overall experience is good. Exposure is growing. And on the other hand, you got to be careful on exposure because wages are rising. That means indemnity, severity, prize and I've said it before, I point the market could shoot the market comps. So you got to be a little cautious. But overall, in direction, you see the direction in P&C lines. And I think that direction is a tone that will continue and a pattern that I expect will continue. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. My first question, I guess more specifically to North America commercial. Do you see the overall book -- Evan Greenberg :  -- but anyway, go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Well, I could do that, but I'm not sure we have enough time. With North America commercial, do you see the book overall as rate adequate today? Evan Greenberg : Yes. Yaron Kinar : You do. So with that in mind, I guess, why would we not see more acceleration of premiums given that rates are adequate and picking up, why wouldn't you lean into that a little more with greater exposure? Evan Greenberg : What you said overall. And so that's overall. And then -- and so I'm happy to answer overall. And by the way, I said to you 10% growth in P&C lines. And I said financial lines, professional lines, financial lines in aggregate down. So I think in areas where we like the pricing, you're seeing the business grow And I'll leave it at that. I'm not going to go deeper than that. I think I gave -- I just gave what investors need to know. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And then my other question was on the G&A expense side. Seem to be a modest pickup in North America, both personal and commercial. Are there any specific platform investments you can call out? Or is it just wage inflation hiring? Evan Greenberg : No. The expense ratio, you'll know -- was up because pension expenses -- fundamentally is pension expenses with the rise in interest rates that picked up. And that's just -- that's something that you can't control really. It's just -- it's an accounting adjustment for future pension costs on. We have a defined benefit pension plan that's closed for many years, it was legacy Chubb that had that and so that's the impact. That's all. Yaron Kinar : Got it. So is that a reasonable run rate to think of for the rest of the year? Evan Greenberg : Yes, reasonable. You'll note the pattern of expense ratio. It's usually a little higher this quarter than in future quarters when I look at it. Peter Enns : I think the pension will be consistent each quarter. And then there's other stuff around it. Yaron Kinar : Got it. Peter Enns : For this year. Yaron Kinar : Thanks so much. Peter Enns : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Excellent. Good morning, everyone. Evan, in your prepared comments, I think you mentioned a recent trip to Korea. You talked about the Life results. Maybe you can give us an update on the Cigna acquisition, how the integration is proceeding and if there's any update on sort of ROE targets related to Cigna now that it's in the Chubb family? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I'll just take the last part first. As you know, the egg is scrambled now. And so we don't really spike that part out. But look, I'm -- I am energized by what I see in Asia and what we have bubbling. And by the way, I'm going to do third quarter earnings from Asia. I'm going to do it from Singapore because I'm going to spend six or seven weeks out there. The integration is going so well. And we're so energized by what we see in the power of the organization with the two parts pulled together. The integration has gone extremely well. And of course, all the efficiencies, that's the easy part in a sense, that's all right on target. But it's the -- growth and the breadth of capability, our direct marketing business. We're the largest direct marketers of insurance in Asia. There's not a doubt to me, both through telemarketing, through digital, life and non-life, the breadth of product there. The number of partnerships that we have between the organizations and the compelling offering, given the breadth and the ability of our life and nonlife together, work together like one organization. No one else really has that. The customer database we have between the companies that numbers in the millions of customers to cross-market and cross-sell to that we're just actively doing through telemarketing and digital. The growth of our agency organization, whether it's in Korea through independent life agency distribution or in places like Thailand and Vietnam with tens of thousands of agents that are growing. When I look across Korea, Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, even Hong Kong, that's small, but the combination of the two and growth is accelerating in these areas, the number of partnerships that we have. So when I add it all together, I feel really good about what we have as franchise and capability and the potential of it over time. And by the way, a lot of the same features I see in Latin America, a much smaller region just the geography and the size of economies. But wow, it's excellent. And then by the way, I'm sure you noticed that in the quarter, Europe grew 10%. That's 40% of their business renews in the year and they do in the year, and they grew at 10%. So it's really broad-based, and I like what I see. Greg Peters : Yes, the Europe numbers are kind of surprising against the backdrop of the macros news that we read about here and there. I spent some time during the discussion talking about all the data resources, the analytics you have. And one of the topics that's become more popular and more recent is this ChatGPT. So maybe you can segue and talk about how you're deploying AI across your organization and the opportunity you have to drive further efficiencies as you utilize these types of tools? Evan Greenberg : Yes. I'll touch on it a little bit. ChatGPT is generalized AI, which is text-based analytics and deep thinking. We use other kinds of AI, deep learning, and others beyond that, that are numbers-based, math-based as well. We've been experimenting in the use of various forms of AI is the point against different areas of our business, depending on the kind of opportunity or problem or enhancement of power that we're trying to address from underwriting and insight in risk cohorts to claims to -- cut to marketing and analytics for customer interface and customer service or telemarketing. And we've been doing this for the last five years. We have a variety of use cases that have proven themselves out. And we continue to iterate with it. We have a lot of data, and we have an ability to enhance that data with external data. It's not simply about AI tools. It's about data and your ability with that. So therefore, you keep pulling a string in your data infrastructure becomes so important. And data engineering becomes so important because it's a fuel that AI needs to feed on itself in all its varieties to become insightful and powerful to you. And in most cases, it's not going to replace our highest skilled knowledge workers. We won't do that for quite a while. But it certainly enhances the abilities and the capability. I'm not worried about my job. It certainly enhances their capabilities. And now we're in the dawn of the period where we use these tools at scale. And the things that we have built and experimented with, the momentum builds and they start rolling out at scale. And that means insight. That means speed, that means accuracy, that means cost, that means momentum. And think of that in terms of a number of years, it's not months. Greg Peters : Great. Thank you for the answers. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning, Evan. My first question is on the reinsurance market. You guys saw some growth in your reinsurance segment. But it sounds like from your commentary, you're seeing better opportunities. It sounds like on the primary property side than perhaps to write more property reinsurance business, but I was hoping you could just expand on that comment and correct me if I'm wrong. Evan Greenberg : Yes. No, you're correct. We're -- we got a finite balance sheet. We can't take infinite amount of risk. And we like the risk reward and the total opportunity. On the primary side, we're much more biased on the primary side than we are on the cat REIT side. And so that is correct. So our cat REIT and CAD and property excess and property quota share business. So not just straight cat REIT. Those are areas where we're taking more exposure. But -- you're right, overwhelmingly, when we look at the market and the risk reward, we're more primary oriented. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then my second question, Peter, I know you said that you guys will consolidate the Wati ownership when it goes above 80%. I'm not sure if Chuck has disclosed like the earnings from Huatai historically? Or can you just give us a sense of the expected contribution on once that is consolidated or any help you can provide there? Peter Enns : Yes. We typically don't -- we have not disclosed Huatai's earnings specifically. We'll have more comments after it closes and we consolidate it. And what I've said historically is it won't have a material impact on a net basis to us in terms of earnings. Evan Greenberg : What we say -- is it will be pretty neutral initially. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. A quick question. Do you manage your business more on net growth than growth? Or is that vice versa? I'm just thinking about capital consumption, if you're retaining more, could that dampen how much you want to grow growth premium? Evan Greenberg : No. You -- frankly, we disclose our net to gross. And you see that's pretty steady. And we manage -- we measure both, and we use both gross and net for different reasons, different purposes. When I'm going to manage the balance sheet, it's net. When I'm going to look at marketing and swinging a stick on our capacity, et cetera, it's growth. It's a much more complicated answer -- question, but it's when you get to operating but it's both. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. So I just wanted to make sure that I understood prior comments correctly. So the 4% growth in gross premium written we saw in North America commercial lines, which was lower than we've seen in prior quarters, that had to do more with business? Evan Greenberg : It has more volatility to it because of risk management business and certain kinds of businesses that have a gross line component to it. But in that case, I'm driven an ROI and all our discussion when we look at stick to the bones is on the net basis. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. I am also curious to... Evan Greenberg : \u2026companies talk net, not gross. But both are important to us as operators for different reasons. Tracy Benguigui : Got it. I'm also curious, did you increase your loss picks from banking D&O claims activity this quarter? I noticed that your North America commercial lines underlying loss ratio improved both sequentially and year-over-year. So I'm wondering if that improvement would be in spite of any raise and off-peak? Evan Greenberg : No. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi, good morning. First one I had was just to see if you could give us some context for where court reopening is that? And just sort of the timing of how the backlog is progressing? And maybe even how that's informing some of the analytics and things you're doing around loss costs? Evan Greenberg : Look frequency of loss and casualty is just has been on March where it's rising and reverting to the mean of pre-COVID. It varies by line of business in some lines of business, the frequency of loss is still below pre-COVID and some others, it has reverted to pre-COVID trend. So it varies. And -- but overall, frequency has been increasing, and that's a proxy that -- and that's been going for a while. So that's a little bit of yesterday's news that the courts -- they've been reopened over a year or so. There you go. And the lawyers are all active. Alex Scott : Got it. And then maybe a little bit more of a housekeeping question for you. But on the Life Insurance segment, I mean, should we think about LDTI moving the run rate up or down at the margin, just a little difficult to tell from the outside because we only have a couple of quarters of Cigna and so not too long of track record to look at under the recasted financials. Peter Enns : Alex, the way I would think about it is, and you pointed out between Cigna coming online purchase gap and LDTI, there's been movement in the numbers. The first quarter of this year, things are settling and we think are representative of a run rate going forward. Alex Scott : Got it. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Thanks. Can I just quickly clarify something. I get a bunch of questions on it. The 7.6% growth rate that you mentioned, that's premium growth for the remainder of your minimum premium growth you expect for the remainder of the year. Is that correct in North America commercial? Evan Greenberg : It's -- I gave you a feeling of a forward view that I would expect it to be no less than that. And then I gave you a breakdown to the 7.6% that was 11% in P&C lines and was negative in financial lines. Brian Meredith : Yes, makes sense. So it's premium growth, great. Evan Greenberg : That was not radar trend or anything. That was premium. Brian Meredith : That's what I thought. That's what I thought. I just wanted to clarify. Sorry, I was going to get a bunch of questions on it. The second question, I'm just curious, I'm trying to kind of do some mental math here on this, and that can be dangerous, but looking at your 11% and change pricing in North America commercial versus the 7.6% premium growth, was there something going on with mix or something would cause pricing to be greater than the premium growth? Evan Greenberg : There's always something going on with max. Brian Meredith : So is it a mix issue or something going on? Evan Greenberg : And remember, I gave you, I gave you P&C growth versus financial lines growth. And I didn't give you any more than -- I'm not going to go deeper than that. And then I gave you rate and trend and you have renewal retention rate, I gave you that. New business varied by area. So the -- is there anything more to it really? Not really. Now in property, and I should say this to you, as you ask it. In property where you see the rate, rate includes -- because we can measure it so accurately. The change in terms and conditions, so of deductible changes, that's worth rate. And so you could exceed this exposure actually go down there. And if you're following me. Done so, that also when you want to roll around math in your brain that may help you a little bit. Brian Meredith : That's really, really helpful. And then can I just one follow-up. Cyber market. Can you just tell us kind of what your thoughts are there now in the cyber market. Is that an attractive market at this point from a pricing and what's happened with term condition in the last couple of years? Evan Greenberg : Yes. The terms and conditions, there's a lot of noise in particular, it's around cat exposure and war and definitions of war or I think war is a misnomer. It's hostile actions by nation states. And that would be more of the term and conditions of what's going on. But beyond that, the cyber loss environment is not benign. Ransomware frequency of loss and severity is picking up, it was temporarily down. Cyber pricing and underwriting has responded to the external environment, I think, reasonably well. And if it maintains discipline, then I'm not concerned. But I would assume that all cyber underwriters see what we see in terms of the loss environment, and you're going to be aware of it. But other than that, it's -- I think, reasonably disciplined in underwriting and pricing. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hi, guys. Good morning. Yes, I mean, I guess, just taking a step back, it's a life related question. I'm just curious, like over the past, call it, five years or so, if you could -- just kind of walk us through how your thought process has evolved? We appreciate that business a little bit more. I guess it comes from a place where the Cigna deal, it felt like a nice little financial acquisition, but I didn't think it was going to put you in Singapore for seven weeks. So you're clearly more enthusiastic about this business. So yes, how has your thinking evolved to really think that's a growth hedging for Chubb? Evan Greenberg : Yes. First, I want to take a step back on that and say, Asia is on my mind. It's not simply the life business. Half of the business is P&C, that is robust. Asia itself, I don't hold me in the number. I have it in my head, but it's roughly a $10 billion region for us. Important, it's massive, region and scale. It's the greatest -- it has the greatest growth potential economically. I think, of any region in the world over the next decade, two decades. So it has a volatility to it, naturally. India, China, Southeast Asia, the dynamism of developed Asia, Korea, Japan. It's just -- it's massive. Australia is part of Asia to us, back to the Australians. And it's non-life and life. And I look at it as one organization, it's Chubb. The way they work together is awesome. We began our life business about a decade -- I began it over a decade ago. I mean, heck, I was pounding on the door of Vietnam to get one of the few life licenses they gave out in 2002. 2003, I was banging on that door. And we've been at it since growing organically and then through acquisition and the Cigna just turbocharged it. At the same time in our non-life business. We are growing from dust and A&H business that could have been incubated in a life company or a nonlife company. Cigna's to a large degree A&H business. Our Life business is a combination of agency distribution on direct marketing and the direct marketing is non-life and life. And the life products themselves are much more back to the future. It's because Asia is different and their traditional life products that have much better ROE characteristics to them. They have very low guarantees. They have traditional savings. They have a lot of risk element to them that we like, A&H, in particular, whether it's dread disease or hospital cash. Very limited basic medical. The customer buys along with savings and savings rates are high in Asia. You have a very young population. The youngest in the world and a growing labor force. And it's combined with a very family-oriented culture and ethic and that drives long-term savings. And you have low social safety net. And so private insurance means more. That all plays to life and to non-life. And frankly, operating my office from there and I'm going to be out of both Hong Kong and Singapore is simply there is such opportunity, and I travel back and forth have for decades a few times a year, but this is just to be more insightful and deeper about it in terms of strategy as we go forward. And my colleagues, many of them will do the same -- global company. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. And just quickly, I guess this is more nuance might be for Peter. But you mentioned some LPT activity in North America commercial. Just curious if that had any impact on the loss ratio year-over-year? Peter Enns : Very -- it was minor in terms of its impact that the loss ratio down expense ratio up. That's what happens with it. But very, very minor. You can measure it at 10%. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Beyer. Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And if you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Thanks. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome to our June 30, 2023 second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix. Actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. Now it\u2019s my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As I mentioned on our last call, I\u2019m coming to you this quarter from Singapore, our regional headquarters for Asia Pacific. The outlook in Asia for growth across our businesses - commercial P&C, as well as consumer, non-life and life, both short and long term is significant. The region is simply energizing. We have a large organization of talented executives and a strong, diverse capability focused on the execution of a broad set of strategies throughout the region. As you saw in our press release, we had a simply outstanding quarter; in fact, another record quarter performance with double-digit premium revenue and earnings growth as a result of world-class P&C underwriting results that produced an 85.4 combined ratio, record net investment income and a doubling of our life earnings. Our premium revenue growth was so well spread and broad-based, driven by outstanding double-digit growth in our commercial and consumer P&C businesses in both North America and internationally, and over 100% growth in our life business. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.8 with a return on tangible equity of 21%. Core operating income topped $2 billion, up 14% or 16.5% on a per-share basis. Both were record results. For the first six months, we produced operating earnings of $3.9 billion or $9.32 per share, up 13% and 15.8% respectively. Our underwriting performance resulted from a combination of strong premium growth, excellent current accident year margins with a combined ratio of 83.3, and favorable prior period reserve development particularly in North America.  On the investment side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.2 billion was up $290 million or 31% over prior year. Our portfolio yield is now 4% versus 3.2% a year ago, with our reinvestment rate averaging 5.8%. Our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flow at higher rates and compound income without changing our risk profile, and then life earnings doubled to $254 million, driven by our business in Asia, which is overwhelmingly supplemental A&H. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior period development, investment income, book value and ROE. Now turning to more color around growth, pricing and the rate environment, consolidated net written premiums for the company increased 16.1% in the quarter on a published basis, or 16.8% in constant dollars, made up of 10.5% growth in our P&C business globally and almost 130% in life premiums.  Global P&C premium growth in the quarter was very well balanced and broad-based; in fact, our strongest quarter for growth since the third quarter of \u201921. North America, Asia-Pac and Europe all produced double-digit growth. It\u2019s worth noting since 2019, we\u2019ve grown our commercial P&C business by 50%. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines were strong in the quarter in both North America and internationally, while financial lines globally continued to soften. We have been diligent about staying on top of loss costs and our positive prior year reserve development reflects a steady conservative approach to reserving. Beginning with North America, commercial premiums excluding ag were up 10.5%. P&C growth was 14% excluding financial lines, while financial lines premiums decreased, reflecting the disciplined response to the underwriting environment. Total premium in our E&S business, the Westchester, grew 12%, while our major accounts division grew 14%, or 11% excluding loss portfolio transfers. In our middle market division, premiums were up 5% with P&C growth of 9%. Our middle market workers comp book was flat and financial lines premiums in middle market declined about 1.5%.  Overall pricing for total North America commercial lines increased 12.8%, including rate of 8.7% and exposure change of 3.8%. Pricing for commercial property and casualty excluding financial lines was up 17.7%.  We are trending loss cost in North America at 6.7 and it varies by line. In general, we are trending loss cost in short tail classes at 5.8. In long tail, excluding comp loss costs are trending at 7.3 and our first dollar workers comp book is trending at 4.7. Let me provide a bit more color around rate and growth. Property pricing was up 31.5% with rates up 22% and exposure change of 7.8%. Major accounts and E&S property together grew premiums over 40% in the quarter, while middle market property grew 11.4%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.3% with rates up almost 9% and exposure up 2.2%. We grew casualty in the quarter 8%. In workers comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up just over 5% with rates up 5% and exposure up 4%. Primary workers comp premiums declined 2.9% in the quarter.  For financial lines, the competitive environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&O, and rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North American financial lines in aggregate were down about 4.5%. Our fin lines book shrank 3.7%. Renewal retention for our retail commercial businesses was very strong at 98.5%. On the consumer side in North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another strong quarter with premiums up almost 11%. Our growth was balanced across a broad range of geographies and our retention was very strong at 104% on a premium basis and over 90% on an account basis. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 14.7% while the homeowners loss cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. There is a lot of attention placed on consumer auto experience, so I thought I would comment briefly on it. For us, auto is a small part of our high net worth business, and you may have noticed that we had a modest reserve release in our prior year\u2019s reserves for our North America personal lines segment in the quarter. This release was primarily in auto, and we are comfortable with our reserves and loss PICs for auto. Turning to our international general insurance operations, net premiums were up 11% in constant dollars, or 9.3% after FX. Our international commercial business grew 12%. Consumer was up 9.5%. Our international retail business grew over 10.5% while our London wholesale business grew about 14%.  In our international retail business, growth was led by Asia Pacific with premiums up 17.5%, made up of commercial lines growth of over 12% and consumer P&C up more than 23%. Europe produced overall growth of 10.5% with the continent up more than 12%. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across international commercial portfolios. Our retail business pricing was up 8.9% with rates up 5% and exposure change of 3.7%, while loss costs across our international commercial portfolio are trending at 6.6%. Our international A&H division had another strong quarter with premiums up over 16%. In Asia, our A&H business grew 31% driven by our direct marketing and travel insurance business and the consolidation of Cigna Thailand. In the U.K. and Europe, A&H premiums were up 11.5%. In our international life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums tripled to over a billion dollars. Since I\u2019m here, I want to conclude with a bit more about operations in Asia, which have very strong growth and momentum across our businesses, both consumer non-life and life, and commercial P&C. We have significant opportunity for growth, both short and long term, in a broad variety of markets across a broad range of customers and distribution channels. Our total premium in the region is about $9 billion and well balanced with half non-life split 50/50 consumer and commercial, and the other half life. Our overall presence and capabilities in north, Southeast Asia and Australia are spread across 11 markets with distinct and significant areas of growth opportunity in each. Across the region, we have a broad range of product capabilities focused on different customer segments with varied and meaningful distribution strength, including the diverse and growing list of partnerships with financial institutions and e-commerce leaders that give us access to hundreds of millions of consumers.  We have strong digital capabilities and a fast-growing digital insurance business encompassing more of our products. We are the largest direct marketers of insurance, mostly A&H products to consumers in Asia through both non-life and life companies that are unifying to offer more products to more customers. From a macro perspective, the region is so dynamic and vast with a diversity of cultures and large economies, some with large young populations, some with large aging populations that have a different set of needs. Broadly speaking in Asia, there is an innovation-oriented mindset, a strong work ethic and a deep dynamism. Supply chains and capital flows are growing deeper across the region. There is growing infrastructure investment. As a result, regional commerce and trade is growing and becoming more connected between Southeast Asia, North Asia, India and Australia. There is a lot to be optimistic about. Summary - we are having an outstanding year with record quarterly and first half financial results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way and underwriting conditions are favorable in a lot of areas of our business. We have a lot of momentum heading into the second half, and as I look ahead, we again are confident in our ability to continue this pattern of growth in revenue and earnings and in turn drive double-digit EPS growth.  I\u2019m going to turn the call over to Peter and then we\u2019re going to come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you Evan, and good morning. As you\u2019ve just heard, Chubb delivered another quarter of strong underwriting and investment performance, leading to record results which generated $2.5 billion of operating cash flow this quarter and $4.8 billion through the first half of the year. We returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $724 million in share repurchases at an average price of $197.04 per share, and $354 million in dividends. Book value and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.2% and 3.1% respectively for the quarter and 4.3% and 6.5% respectively through the first half of the year, reflecting record core operating income net of the capital returned to shareholders noted earlier. In addition to the quarterly ROEs Evan just gave you, our year-to-date core operating ROE and return on tangible equity of 3.2% and 20.2% respectively exceed the target range Evan has laid out in the past.  Adjusted net investment income from the quarter was $1.24 billion or $20 million above the top end of our guidance, primarily from higher private equity income. The increase over last year of 30% was driven by strong cash flow, our accelerated portfolio turnover, and higher reinvestment rates. In the third quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to rise from $1.24 billion this quarter to around $1.27 billion on a recurring basis, and to continue to grow from there. Relative to our invested assets, we continue to tactically execute our portfolio turnover strategy while maintaining a conservative credit posture. During the quarter, we reclassified our $8 billion held-to-maturity portfolio to available for sale, to have even more flexibility to put money to work at higher yields. These securities had $397 million after tax of net unrealized losses that reduced book value at the time of the change. It\u2019s important to note that the transfer itself has no economic impact as the underlying securities remained unchanged and are of a very high quality, with an average rating of AA. We will look to sell parts of this portfolio only where and when we think it makes economic sense, and not all of the unrealized loss will become realized. Turning to our underwriting business, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $400 million principally from weather-related events in the U.S. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $260 million pre-tax, which was split about evenly between short tail and long tail lines and included $146 million for North American commercial and $61 million for overseas general. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $60 million principally related to molestation claim development. As I noted, the PPD and overseas general for the quarter was $61 million versus $173 million last year. The larger favorable PPD in the quarter last year was concentrated in the 2020 accident year and included favorable development from COVID-related economic shutdowns. The year-to-date favorable PPD for overseas general was $204 million, comparable to last year\u2019s $233 million and $181 million in 2021, all in short tail lines for these years. Our paid to incurred ratio for the quarter was 89% or 83% after adjusting for cats and PPD.  Turning to our life segment, year-over-year segment income growth came primarily from the acquisition of Cigna. Our core operating effective income tax rate was 19% for the quarter, which is at the top end of our guided range of 18% to 19%. We now expect our annual operating effective tax rate for 2023 to be in the range of 18.5% to 19%, excluding the impact of consolidating Huatai. On July 1, we completed the acquisition of additional shares of Huatai Group, increasing our aggregate ownership to 69.6%. We expect the closing of additional shares this quarter, which will bring our ownership up to 83.2%.  Beginning in Q3, we will consolidate Huatai\u2019s results within our financials. We currently estimate consolidation will result in a small amount of accretion to operating income and EPS, book value and ROE, and a modest amount of dilution to tangible book value which we estimate will recover within the next few quarters. However, I would note we are still working through our purchase accounting analysis. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator instructions] Your first question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, great. Good morning.  I guess first question would be on the--thanks for the commentary on loss trend in the commercial side. It sounded like it stayed flattish and yet the rate environment accelerated sequentially. I\u2019m just curious, any context on why the rate environment is accelerating if loss costs are kind of staying steady - I know that\u2019s just for you, and does your loss cost, also PIC include higher reinsurance costs, if you\u2019re experiencing higher reinsurance costs? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : Well you know, the rate, it\u2019s all baked into it, of course; but the rate environment accelerated in property, and I think that speaks for itself, as you know, where it\u2019s about the loss environment particularly around cat and inflation costs and property generally, and reinsurance costs have moved up in property, and I think that\u2019s a--you know, in total that\u2019s a very rational response. In casualty, loss cost trends have been moving higher and I think it\u2019s reflective of the trend we\u2019ve been observing over the last number of years. It\u2019s not a new story, it\u2019s a story we\u2019re aware of and on top of, but I think it\u2019s rational. You know, you see comp and professional lines, I talked about going the other way, so I think the market frankly and the reacceleration is a rational response to the external environment. Mike Zaremski : Okay. My one follow-up is on--you touched on catastrophe losses. They actually looked a bit lighter than at least what the consensus models for kind of a normal 2Q for Chubb, whereas some other competitors, maybe more regional based, have experienced much, much higher than, quote-unquote, normal catastrophe levels. Any commentary on your cat load this quarter, was it just--was it kind of in line with expectations? Evan Greenberg : You know, cat losses are never in line with--particularly with expectations. They\u2019re either greater or less than you might imagine in any quarter on the average annual loss PIC you would choose for that. This was a very heavy cat quarter for the industry, and I think most companies have reported significantly higher cat losses than average. I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any particular magic as to why Chubb\u2019s was lower. We underwrite well, we have a good spread of business, we select risk well; but that doesn\u2019t mean we choose where a--it translates to we choose where a tornado is going to land and come down. If it had moved 10 miles to the east or west, we could have had greater losses. It\u2019s a variation. It has variability quarter on quarter, and we had a very good experience this quarter. Thanks for the question. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. Good morning everybody.  I guess my first question, just looking at North America, commercial\u2019s underlying loss ratio, the improvement there, is there a mix component there? Is it mostly rate over trend? Could you maybe elaborate on that a bit? Evan Greenberg : The current accident year loss ratio, it reflects the totality of the commercial business, so it\u2019s a mix of all the lines, right? Property and casualty rate and price exceed loss cost, and that is potentially a positive to the ultimate loss ratio margin. In the case of comp and financial lines, rate and price lag the selected trends, and in that case the ultimate margin is potentially shrinking or it\u2019s neutral. Our loss PIC reflects all of that, and we\u2019re patient and we lean towards conservatism in our loss PICs. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Then my second question, just with regards to rate adequacy particularly in financial lines and property, just because of the very different directions we\u2019re seeing rates moving in those lines, are the rates adequate in both of those today? Evan Greenberg : I think for the business we\u2019ve written, yes, the rates are adequate for our portfolio, and our loss PICs reflect that. The kind of combined ratio we\u2019re putting up has a mix of all of that in there and it speaks for itself. Yaron Kinar : Thanks so much, and good luck. Evan Greenberg : Does that make sense to you? Operator : Your next question is from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Well, I think it might be close to, what, 8:30 pm your time, Evan, so I\u2019m going to say good evening to you and your management team. Evan Greenberg : Thank you very much. It is - it\u2019s about 8 :30. Greg Peters : It\u2019s almost bedtime, right?  For my first question, in your prepared comments, you spoke about innovation and specifically in Asia, and there\u2019s been a lot of rhetoric in the marketplace--you know, it\u2019s been ongoing, but it seems to have accelerated this year around artificial intelligence, large language models, generative AI, and we obviously closely monitor your expense ratio, so maybe you could spend a minute and talk about your perspectives on these very important technology developments and how you think about it for your company, not only in North America but on a global basis. Evan Greenberg : Yes, and thanks for that question. We\u2019ve been employing AI for quite a number of years now - five or six years, anyway, and particularly it\u2019s algorithmic AI, not generalized or large language models. It\u2019s employed in the operations side of the business, to a degree in the underwriting and claims side and the marketing side, chatbots, etc. There have been a lot of experiments and use cases that prove themselves out, and we\u2019re now in a stage where we\u2019re scaling and will over the next two or three years to receive what we think are significant benefits out of that, insightfulness and abilities in underwriting and in claims in discrete areas in the service side of our business where we see cost and lower level work that can come out or improve in its accuracy. All of that is things we know and we\u2019re scaling the tools. At the same time, as you can imagine, we are on the large language models and the potential benefit that that will ultimately bring beyond algorithmic, particularly in underwriting and claims and the ability to work--either replace work that is done or make it more accurate, or work alongside underwriters. It\u2019s not a silver bullet, and we\u2019re doing this on a global basis, some regions more in marketing, some more focused on portfolio underwriting. But yet, whatever anyone is doing spreads to the other, and it\u2019s just where we start on one and end with another. The generalized and large language is going to be iterative, it will be over time. If you think about insurance and the parameterization risk or factor around what we do, how many lines of business, the exposures, the geographies you cross, and so by its nature it\u2019s going to be iterative and take longer than some of the breathless rhetoric that I hear, but we\u2019re focused on that as part of what a modern insurance company is going to look like and is looking like. Greg Peters : I feel like we could probably have a long conversation on that topic. Appreciate the comments. I need to pivot as my follow-up question to the reinsurance business-- Evan Greenberg : Come and see me sometime, we\u2019ll talk about it. Greg Peters : Okay, let me know when you\u2019re available. Evan Greenberg : Tomorrow for breakfast, if you want to show up! Go ahead. Greg Peters : I don\u2019t know if I can make it there tomorrow. Reinsurance - you know, you look at what\u2019s going on in the market, and I know you\u2019re very close to it, it seems like especially in property cat, it seems like these conditions, some of the hardest market conditions we\u2019ve experienced in 20-plus years, and yet if I look at your global reinsurance business and look at the growth, it seems like you\u2019re not really growing your exposures, you\u2019re just growing your rate. Maybe you could provide some perspective on how you\u2019re looking at the reinsurance business in the context--and maybe your perspective is the rate\u2019s still inadequate, but give your perspectives on the reinsurance market. That\u2019d be helpful. Evan Greenberg : Yes, look - I don\u2019t disagree with anything you said, but you\u2019ll notice at the same time, our property insurance business is growing, like, 40% right now, and that\u2019s a combination of rate and exposure, and some of that exposure is not premium, by the way, it\u2019s structural changes and it\u2019s unit count. It\u2019s a lot of exposure growing.  In property cat, that\u2019s growing more exposure as we grow that, and it\u2019s growing it in the tail. When we look at the risk-reward--and by the way, the property insurance as we grow it across geographies is also growing exposure in the tail. We prefer to put our emphasis on the property insurance business, and the spread of risk we\u2019re getting, we\u2019ve never seen better pricing and better risk-adjusted returns than we see right now in large account, E&S, middle market, in a variety of geographies across the globe. We\u2019re putting more emphasis on that than we are on property cat. We don\u2019t think the risk-adjusted returns are as favorable - plain and simple. Greg Peters : Thanks for the answers. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. Evan Greenberg : Morning David. David Motemaden : Hey, good morning Evan, or good evening for you, Evan. Just wanted to ask, I guess sort of related to the last question, just about premium growth in North America commercial and the difference between the 14% growth excluding financial lines, and I think you said it was about 18% increase in price excluding financial lines. Maybe you could just talk about the drivers of that disconnect. Evan Greenberg : Yes. You know, there has been a lot of chatter I\u2019ve noticed about that in the last number of months. It\u2019s actually pretty straightforward - the majority of the difference between the two numbers is a result of structural changes. Included in our price is the impact of things like deductible changes and attachment points, where we can put a value on it, and so it acts like rate or it acts like exposure. It doesn\u2019t add to premium necessarily, that portion of it, but it adds to potential margin, or another way of saying it, it supports loss cost.  The point of talking about rate and exposure that way, rather than by the way putting exposure over into loss ratio and saying, here\u2019s the loss ratio trend, which is different than loss cost trend, is to give a sense about that, and so here is the price we get, rate plus the trend, and yet a portion of the rate, depends on line of business, or of the exposure is actually not premium. As I said, it acts like premium but it\u2019s not premium. That\u2019s the difference between the two. Did I say that clearly for you? David Motemaden : Yes, yes. That makes sense. I guess maybe just a quick follow-up on that, any way to size terms and condition changes versus, I guess, the premium increase change, or if I were to look at the rate increase? Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s in rate or it\u2019s in exposure. We look at it, but we don\u2019t go that far and start disclosing that. What you\u2019ve got to know is look at our overall premium growth, our retention rates that we give you - it\u2019s very healthy, and then what you can see is, wow, this is the amount of rate and price that goes against loss cost, so you can get a transparency around that. You don\u2019t add the two together, they\u2019re not comparable that way. They\u2019re answering two different questions. David Motemaden : Got it, okay. Yes, that makes sense. I appreciate that. That\u2019s helpful. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. David Motemaden : Then I guess just maybe on the North America commercial current accident year loss ratio ex-cat, was there--I know the second quarter tends to be an LPT--you know, heavy LPT quarter. Was there any of that or anything else, like non-cat property losses either way within the 70 basis points year-over-year improvement? Evan Greenberg : No, and it\u2019s interesting - we\u2019re kind of looking at each other like, we haven\u2019t noticed that the second quarter in particular is a heavy LPT quarter. They kind of come lumpy through the year. David Motemaden : Great, thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good evening Evan. My first question - you know, last quarter, sticking with North America commercial, you had pointed to premium growth for the balance of the year kind of being above 7.6%, and you guys exceeded that margin by a good amount this quarter - as you said, good property growth. It seems like that was a good driver there. Can you just give us a sense of how you think premium growth can transpire over the balance of the year relative to your expectations last quarter? Evan Greenberg : Elyse, I\u2019m feeling pretty good. I\u2019m feeling good. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, I had to try.  My second question - you know, we saw-- Evan Greenberg : [Indiscernible] but you know, we\u2019re feeling good. You saw what I said in the commentary and what I said in the press release, that we\u2019re going to continue in this sort of pattern. I\u2019m not putting a number on it. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. My second question - you know, we saw share repurchase improve, go up this quarter. I think you guys obviously had a new authorization and are sitting on a good amount of excess capital. Anything to read into the number and just how we think about level of--anything new in terms of thinking about the level of capital return from here? Evan Greenberg : No. We thought we were undervalued. We think we\u2019re undervalued. We\u2019re buyers. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, got it. Thanks Evan. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, good evening Evan. First question I just had on cyber. First of all, where exactly does that live in the disclosures - is that in financial lines as well, and curious if you could give an update on the size of that book and how you\u2019re feeling about that business from a rate adequacy standpoint. Evan Greenberg : Yes, as you statutorily have seen, we write a sizeable book, and I don\u2019t know that we\u2019ve disclosed the total global premium but what I would tell you is, is we\u2019re one of the top--you know, I don\u2019t have the updated numbers, so I want to be careful, but we\u2019re in the top 3 of cyber writers, maybe the top 2 of cyber writers globally. The business is growing in certain segments for us, but the overall business is growing and the rate environment has leveled off. Terms and conditions on what we underwrite are form. We were first to--really leaders to roll out a form that addresses systemic risk to a greater degree and addresses the severity in ransomware and other one-offs. The underwriting, we\u2019re vigilant about it. The growth, we\u2019re growing it. The pricing, it\u2019s pretty good in most segments. There\u2019s some segments that need rate, and in those areas we\u2019re leaning back a little bit. That\u2019s what I\u2019d tell you about cyber. Ryan Tunis : Got it. Appreciated the commentary, the line-by-line commentary on loss trend, but if I heard you correctly, I think you said workers comp, you\u2019re trending at around 4%-- Evan Greenberg : I think I said about 4.7%, from memory. Ryan Tunis : Okay, well that\u2019s, I guess, a little bit higher than I would have thought that line was running at. Are you seeing any type of pick-up in inflation there? Are you trending it differently than you have in recent quarters, or--? Evan Greenberg : We\u2019ve increased it in the last--earlier in the year. You know, there\u2019s two things : one, mindful of medical inflation, and number two, payroll increases. On one hand, that benefits exposure change, as we just talked about rate and price, and on the other hand, wages go up and that translates to severity on the indemnity side. Those two things together rationally are going to push up your PIC on loss cost and comp. Ryan Tunis : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Tracy - I know your last name. Go ahead. Tracy Benguigui : Thanks Evan. As you sit right now in Singapore and you look at your opportunity set, how would you rank concerns of capital deployment priorities, underwriting capacity given your views of achieving rate adequacy versus acquisitions in emerging markets, could even be JVs? Evan Greenberg : Yes, I\u2019m not--first of all, we have plenty of capital flexibility. That is not a question. We are not constraining organic growth whatsoever, and I can tell you--I would make two comments to you. We are not on the acquisition hunt. We are focused on what we--there is so much opportunity around what we\u2019ve got and strategy around organic growth. In Asia, we are just full up, it\u2019s fabulous. In North America and other parts of the world, we\u2019ve got plenty of growth opportunity and that\u2019s what we\u2019re getting after. We\u2019ve got a great rate environment to take on more exposure in areas like property, and we are taking--it\u2019s not a question of capital, it\u2019s a question of are you willing to take on the volatility that goes along with it, and we are because we think we\u2019re getting paid well for that. It\u2019s a good thing to invest in with shareholder capital, and that\u2019s our priority. That\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on. Then, you used the word JV. I read the same article, and you know what? Don\u2019t believe what you read. Tracy Benguigui : Okay, thanks. Yes, I wasn\u2019t implying that you don\u2019t have strong capital. I\u2019ve noticed that you reported $49 million of unfavorable reserve development for molestation claims - it\u2019s not a large number, but I\u2019m curious what you\u2019re seeing right now on reviver statutes. Based on the work we\u2019ve done, are those charges reflecting the 11 states where new statute of limitation reform laws went into effect, or do the reserves also reflect the 38 states introduced new reform bills this year? Evan Greenberg : No. You know, Tracy, it\u2019s more case specific. The only thing the reviver statutes as they open up them does, it opens up the top of the funnel, so more potential losses from years past, legacies going way back, events flowing to the top of the funnel, and then eventually some ripen, some percentage of them ripen into claims and cases, and ultimately in incurred. When we see a liability, we\u2019re going to reflect it. Tracy Benguigui : Very basic question here - does statute of limitations only apply to child abuse, or is it more broad-based? Evan Greenberg : Well, it depends on the state. It varies. Some have opened it up more broadly and some, it\u2019s only about--most, it\u2019s only about child abuse. Tracy Benguigui : Got it, thank you. Evan Greenberg : Wait a minute - I think I have a colleague who may be correcting me about that. No? Okay. No. The answer was right. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Hey, good evening Evan. Evan, looking at--you know, with Huatai going to be consolidated here and ownership increasing, life insurance is becoming a pretty meaningful component of your overall earnings mix - I think you\u2019ve got north of 10%. I\u2019m wondering if maybe you could give us a quick snapshot of what the business mix looks like there, how much is savings products versus indemnity products, short tail, long tail, is much of it capital intensive? Just give us some perspective on how we should think about that life insurance business. Evan Greenberg : You know, about 80%, 90% of the business is straight up accident and health business, the same kind of business we write on the non-life side. In the life side, you write a longer duration policy, and they\u2019re all individual policies, so on the non-life side I may direct market the same kind of products and they\u2019re annually renewable and they have a certain lapse rate to them, and on the life side I may sell through them agents and/or through direct marketing, and it\u2019s dread disease and it\u2019s hospital cash and it\u2019s cancer and it\u2019s accident insurance, and it will be sold predominantly--most of the book we have are individual policies and they are longer duration, which adds great stability, a long term asset. Then there is a percentage, but it\u2019s a minority percentage of the business where it\u2019s tied to a savings and protection policy, but yet we load it up with accident and health riders, so you\u2019re going to buy a large amount of protection, the stuff we love, alongside a very traditional, much lower risk savings product that\u2019s either on a par basis, where okay, any interest rate risk is fundamentally to the customer and we share the upside with them, or it\u2019s got extremely low guarantees, like in the 1% range or 2% in a whole life policy, that\u2019s it. Brian Meredith : Great, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : The overwhelming majority of this business is risk-based accident and health business. Brian Meredith : Great, that\u2019s really helpful. Then this one is more focused, I guess, on your personal lines business. I\u2019m just curious, could you talk a little bit about what you\u2019re seeing happening in the regulatory environment, given the level of rate we\u2019ve seen going through in, like, personal auto and homeowners? Are you starting to see any pushback by regulators? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It varies by state. I think it\u2019s pretty well known to you, it\u2019s not hidden. We are employing where we want to grow exposure and we need more flexibility of terms or of rates. We are using E&S to a greater extent as a tool to be able to take more exposure and do it in a thoughtful way and shape portfolios, and we do that both in states where exposure is concentrated in cat, and we\u2019re also doing it in states where the regulatory environment doesn\u2019t allow us greater flexibility to be able to actually serve the public\u2019s need. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Thanks. I want to follow up on Brian\u2019s question, if I can. Is there a specific opportunity for Chubb\u2019s growth in North America personal because of regulatory friction that is leading a number of competitors to really pull back? Evan Greenberg : Well, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s--yes, on the margin, there is that. But we have a really distinct, strong brand, and Meyer, I think the recognition of our brand and service, all things being equal, more customers, it\u2019s proven, in our cohort want to buy Chubb, and then it\u2019s a question of price and terms. There have been competitors who have been overly competitive in the area, and I think of--you know, in the past, naively so or for other reasons, have underpriced risk. We\u2019re in a market know, I think, where there\u2019s greater discipline in the business, and that creates opportunity for us, in addition to the notion of others who may have gotten it wrong and they\u2019re pulling back. Now, we don\u2019t have an endless appetite, and we will shape our portfolio; but we\u2019re using every tool we can to take more risk and more exposure in a balanced way, not to become the cat writer of high net worth but the national writer of high net worth, balanced, and to do that in a thoughtful and sound way that is enduring. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Then just a brief question, I think I know the answer to this, but does the consolidation of Huatai impact the book value yield of the Chubb investment portfolio at all? Peter Enns : To a very minor degree. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thanks so much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hey. First one I had is on casualty in North America - you know, you all have been fairly vocal about the need for accelerating rate there. I just wanted to get your updated thoughts on is that occurring at the rate you think you need it to for the industry to have adequate pricing, and what kind of competitive environment are you seeing there on casualty lines in North America? Evan Greenberg : Well, I can\u2019t speak for the industry, but I can speak for Chubb. I like the level of rate we are securing and the terms and conditions against the various cohorts of casualty we write, and I think we\u2019re--I know we\u2019re staying on top of loss development and loss trends, and then we reflect it in the pricing and the terms. I have said in previous quarters that I thought these lines needed to move, and in fact they are. Alex Scott : Got it. The second question I had is around the casualty reserves - I\u2019m sure you\u2019ve seen there\u2019s a fair amount of chatter around the 2013 to 2019 accident years and people looking at the loss cost trend on longer tail lines and thinking through, you know, should we be confident in those reserves. I appreciate this is probably a bit of an annoying question, but is there anything you would add to that discussion to help people think through your confidence in those reserves, just in light of the environment? Evan Greenberg : Well, pretty simply I\u2019d say this - look at our track record. We\u2019ve been doing this for how long, how many decades, through all kinds of cycles, and look at our reserve policy and look at our reserving track record. And by the way, Peter just made some expansive comments around prior period reserve development, which is simply a reflection of strength of reserve. We are quite confident and comfortable with the level of our reserves. Alex Scott : Thanks. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn today\u2019s call back over to Karen Beyer. Karen Beyer : Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we\u2019ll be around to take your call. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating. This concludes today\u2019s conference call.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited Third Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. It is now my pleasure to turn today's call over to Ms. Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President and Director of Investor Relations. Ma'am, please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and welcome everyone to our September 30, 2023 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risk and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release, and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.com -- investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial statement -- supplement. And now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had another outstanding quarter. Our performance was marked by double-digit global P&C premium growth, world-class P&C underwriting results, including an 88.4% combined ratio, record net investment income, and strong life operating income, all leading to record operating earnings per share. Once again, our premium revenue growth was well spread and broad-based, with excellent results in our commercial and consumer businesses in both our North American and international operations. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.5%, with a return on tangible equity of 21.2%. Core operating income of $4.95 per share was up 58% over prior year. And for the first nine months, we have produced record operating income of $5.9 billion, or $14.27 per share, up 27.5%. In the quarter, our underwriting performance was driven by a combination of strong earned premium growth, excellent underwriting margins, which included an ex-cat current accident year combined ratio of 84.3%, or 83% excluding agriculture, favorable prior period reserve development in both North America and Overseas General and relatively average cat losses compared to our expected. P&C underwriting income of $1.3 billion was up almost 84%. Our positive reserve development speaks to the strength of our reserves and our reasonably cautious or conservative approach to reserving. As I've said for years, we generally strive to recognize bad news early and are slow to recognize good news. We're in a balance sheet business. Our loss reserves are the most important part of the liability side of our balance sheet. On the asset side, record-adjusted net investment income of $1.4 billion was up $361 million, or 34% over prior year. Our portfolio yield was 4.1% at the end of the third quarter versus 3.4% a year ago, while our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 6.2%. We have very strong liquidity, and our investment income run rate will continue to grow as we reinvest our cash flow at higher rates. We are growing income without a change to our invested asset risk profile. In the quarter, we increased our ownership in Huatai Group to 69.6% and now we're consolidating results, which were accretive to EPS and ROE. Earlier this month, we closed on additional shares and our ownership stands now at over 72%. I expect this to increase further and reach between 83% and 86%. A summary of the financial impact of Huatai is provided for you in the earnings release and the financial supplement. Peter will have more to say about financial items, including cats, prior-period reserve development, investment income, book value, ROE and Huatai. Now, turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased over 9% in the quarter, made up of 8.4% growth in our P&C business globally and about 15% in our Life division. Global P&C premium growth, which excludes agriculture, was 12.3%, with commercial lines up almost 10.5% and consumer lines up about 17.5%. In agriculture, crop premiums were lower than last year due to the timing of when we recognized them. Year-to-date premiums are in fact up modestly. As to the higher combined ratio in agriculture this quarter, we simply recognized a quarter earlier than last year what we think is the likely development for the year based on what we know today about crop conditions and pricing. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, rates and price increases in property and casualty lines, in aggregate, remained strong in the quarter in both North America and our international divisions, while decreases in financial lines in North America continued. We remain vigilant and diligent about staying on top of loss cost inflation. Beginning with North America, commercial premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 8.7%. P&C growth was 10.5%, excluding financial lines, which were up 1%. Our very large middle market division had its best quarter of the year with premium growth of 16.3% and middle market financial lines up 1.5%. Our major accounts and specialty division grew 7.2% with P&C up 8.4% and financial lines flat. Overall, pricing for total North America commercial increased 9.3%, including rate of 5.9% and exposure change that acts like rate of 3.2%. Let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Pricing for commercial property and casualty was up 13.9%. Property pricing was up 23%, with rates up 16.6% and exposure change of 5.5%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11%, with rates up 8.7% and exposure up 2%. In workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 5.5%, with rates essentially flat and exposure up 6%. We are trending loss costs in North America at 6.7%, same as last quarter. And again, that compares to pricing of 9.3%. In general, we're trending loss costs in short tail classes at 5.8%. And long tail, excluding workers' comp, loss costs are trending at 7.1%, and our first dollar workers' comp book is trending at 4.7%. For financial lines, the underwriting environment remains aggressive, particularly in D&O. Rates have continued to decline. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines, in aggregate, were down 4.8% and 3.8%, respectively. We're trending financial lines loss costs at 4.7%. Renewal retention for our commercial businesses in North America was 92.7%, and our new business grew 14%. On the consumer side, our high-net-worth personal lines business had another excellent quarter, with premiums up over 9.5%, with strong retention and new business growth. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 15%, while our selected loss cost trend was similar to last quarter at 10.5%. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Net premiums were up about 21.5%, and this includes a 7.5% contribution to growth from the Huatai consolidation. Our international commercial business grew 17.5%, while consumer was up 28.4%. In our international retail business, growth was broad-based with all major regions producing double-digit growth. Latin America led the way this quarter with premiums up 23%, made up of commercial lines growth of 16% and consumer up more than 28%. Europe and Asia Pac had strong orders with growth of 14.2% and 10.2%, respectively. We continued to achieve improved rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio, with pricing up 9.3%, rates up 5.7%, and exposure change of 3.4%. Property and casualty lines, pricing was up 11.7%, with rates up 7.1% and exposure up 4.3%. While financial lines pricing was up 2.3%. Loss cost inflation across our international commercial portfolio remains steady from last quarter, trending at 6.6%. Within our international consumer, our A&H and personal lines divisions both had strong quarters, with premiums up 16.5% and over 40%, respectively. Personal lines growth in Latin America rebounded sharply with premiums up 43% on the back of growth in our Mexican auto portfolio where we're taking significant rate actions to reflect the loss cost environment. In our international life business, which is almost entirely Asia, premiums were up nearly 20%, including the impact of the Huatai consolidation. Life segment income was up nearly 15%, $288 million. In summary, we had a simply outstanding quarter, contributing to outstanding year-to-date results. We are growing exposure in a thoughtful and balanced way, mindful of risk environment and underwriting conditions, which are favorable in many areas of our business. Looking forward, we are confident in our ability to continue growing revenue and operating earnings globally, which in turn drive EPS through the three engines of P&C underwriting income, investment income, life income. I'm going to turn this call over to Peter, and then I'm going to come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan, and good morning. First, I want to note that we completed our first quarter with Huatai Group as a consolidated subsidiary. The results of Huatai are reported at 100% within our financials, with only certain key metrics reported at the company's 69.6% ownership interest, including consolidated core operating and net income, book and tangible book value, and ROE measures. Turning to our results, Chubb reached two milestones this quarter : invested assets reached $130 billion, and adjusted net investment income topped $1.4 billion. Operating cash flow was a record $4.7 billion, reflecting our record investment income and strong premium collections. During the quarter, Moody's affirmed and moved our outlook from stable to positive. And as you know, S&P affirmed our groups rating with stable outlook earlier this year. Core operating ROE on a deployed capital basis is approximately 15.5% and the related operating return on tangible equity is approximately 27%. Book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.6% and 7% for the quarter and year-to-date, respectively, reflecting outstanding results for both periods. Tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, decreased 4.2% for the quarter with 7.5 percentage points coming from the dilutive impact of consolidating Huatai. With the consolidation on July 1, Chubb had additional goodwill and intangibles of $3.5 billion pre-tax. In Q3, we already earned back almost two-thirds of that amount and expect to earn back the rest within this current fourth quarter. Huatai had a modest impact on results this quarter in line with expectations, adding $0.12 or 2.5% to core operating income per share, third of which related to the favorable impact of purchase accounting adjustments in the quarter, which will decline over the next year. As previously noted, adjusted net investment income for the quarter was a record $1.415 billion or $140 million above the top end of our guidance, of which $100 million is related to Huatai, which was not included in our prior guidance. In the fourth quarter, we expect adjusted net investment income to be approximately $1.435 billion to $1.45 billion on a recurring basis, including Huatai, and to continue to grow from there. We remain consistent and conservative with our investments, with 83% of our fixed income portfolio rated investment-grade and an overall average credit rating of A. This quarter, we recognized an unrealized loss on our portfolio of $2.2 billion after-tax, reflecting rising interest rates. We also recognized a modest favorable $18 million recovery of expected credit losses net of an immaterial impairment charge in the quarter, which attests to the overall quality of our portfolio. Huatai's investment assets added $12.7 billion gross or $6.4 billion attributable to Chubb to our investment portfolio. With over two decades as a strategic partner with Huatai, we have deep insight into Huatai's portfolio, and it fits well with our overall conservative approach to investing. 87% of Huatai's investment portfolio is fixed income related, and is very high quality, with an average credit rating of A and with 98.5% rated investment-grade. Turning to our underwriting business. For the quarter, we had pre-tax catastrophe losses of $670 million, principally from weather-related events and wildfires in North America. Total catastrophe losses were split : 82% U.S. and 18% internationally. Prior-period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $261 million pre-tax. The PPD in our active businesses this quarter consisted of $316 million favorable development in short-tail lines and $55 million of unfavorable development in long-tail lines. Our corporate run-off lines had adverse development of $61 million, principally related to environmental exposures. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 73% and was 84% through nine months. This quarter reflects the impact of strong premium growth on reserves and the timing of our crop insurance payments. Our core operating effective income tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which is within our guided range of 18.5% to 19% for this year. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Your first question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Bob Huang : Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. My first question is actually on reserving. You obviously talked about recognizing bad news first and good news later. Curious about your thoughts on the recent development. European reinsurers have talked more about the cautionary view on the U.S. casualty reserves. Social inflation has been around for years, but this is clearly something that European reinsures are talking more about now. Just given their recent renewed caution, so to speak, on the U.S. casualty side, are there any adverse trends that you're seeing across the industry that would justify this view? Any specific factors that you would like to call out? Curious about your view on this. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Well, this is hardly a new topic, and I'm not going to really rehash old ground. We've been talking about this for a number of years. So, no, there's nothing new. And just look back on our quarters, look back on what we use for loss cost development. Reinsurers who just simply -- and we've been saying it, they've lagged in recognition. And so, they're just beginning to catch up to it. Welcome [indiscernible]. I really don't know what to add beyond that. There's no news to us. And frankly, I don't think there's really that much news to them. They've just been slow to be willing to recognize it. And when you fall behind on casualty, it's very painful. You got to catch up. Bob Huang : Okay, got it. That's actually very helpful. My second question is on cyber insurance. There has been a few very notable cyber breaches within consumer sector, casino, gaming, and more recently, a cybersecurity firm also had a pretty serious headline breach. Given Chubb is a industry leader in cyber insurance, curious -- and also given that your recent partnership with SentinelOne, curious about your view on how the recent headline news could impact pricing environment as well as the industry as a whole? And then, how you think about Chubb positioning in cyber insurance going forward? Evan Greenberg : Yeah, cyber is a relatively new line for the industry. It's been around a number of years, but when you view it relative to other lines of business, it's relatively new exposure. And by the way, it's an evolving exposure. The world is more interconnected in everything today, for example, than it even was -- more so than it was three years or five years ago. The world is a hostile environment, geopolitically and from a criminal element point of view. The ability to use cyber as a tool of mischief or worse and for ill-gotten gain is evolving. The tools that those actors use are evolving. At the same time, the industry, and Chubb included, are improving our ability to manage the risk and to underwrite and provide risk management capabilities around these exposures. So, on one hand, the criminal element is gaining more tools. And at the same time, law enforcement and those like our industry are gaining better tools and better insight. It's both. So, it's evolving. It's an active environment from a loss point of view, frequency and severity of loss. And industry pricing and industry coverage has to reflect that. I notice it in some segments of the business where I think there is discipline. And then, there are other segments of the business that I think could use more discipline. And the good news about crop, around crop cyber, unlike, say, casualty, it reveals its secrets quickly. And so, if you're too loose in your underwriting and you're just chasing the market share, you're going to get caught pretty darn quick. And I'll stop right there. Bob Huang : Thank you very much for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Greg Peters with Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : All right. Good morning, everyone. Well, I assume it's good morning, Evan, unless you're in Singapore or in Europe. Evan Greenberg : I'm right here in New York City. Greg Peters : Well, awesome. Evan Greenberg : Thank you, Greg. Good morning to you as well. Greg Peters : Yeah. So, I was listening to your comments and you mentioned -- you highlighted the Mexican auto business. You obviously highlighted the success of your North American personal lines business. It feels like we're dealing with a once in a generation hard market in the auto insurance market. And I know you have a specialty business for your personal lines in North America, but I'm wondering if you have any thoughts of branching out into other areas of the market considering all of the dislocations that are occurring there? Evan Greenberg : In general, personal lines market in North America, that's not a market for us. We don't bring anything to that party. And frankly, I think it is a well-served market. Some would suggest it's over-served. We have a -- not a -- it's pretty big niche, high net worth in the United States, and our capabilities and our insights are just so specially built for that, that we have a real true franchise advantage. We're distinctive, and that's what we look for. When you get outside the United States, general auto -- general market auto and homeowners, it's a commodity business, and most chase it for volume rather than for a decent return on underwriting. We're very selective of how we do it. We constantly search and research environments around the world where it can suit our approach to underwriting and we can bring a distinct advantage to the marketplace and build a franchise of size that has a competitive advantage. For a number of reasons, Mexico is one of those for us where we insure over 2 million autos, and we run a combined ratio that is the envy of the industry. Greg Peters : Thanks for the color there. I guess, I'm going to pivot to this follow-up question on -- back to the reinsurance business. I think I asked you about this in the previous quarter, but it's just striking to me when I look at your global reinsurance business and I don't see a lot of growth in the top-line. I know you are growing your property exposures, but where there's a lot of rhetoric in the marketplace about where we are with the 1/1 renewals with pricing and reinsurance, I thought I'd ask you about your views on how you think pricing for reinsurance is going to evolve over the next year. If I look at your top-line results, it probably isn't -- probably don't have a favorable view, but throw that out for you to comment on, please. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Greg, last year in the third quarter, so just the level set, there were, as you know, much larger cat events. And so, we collected a lot of reinstatement premium last year in the third quarter that we didn't have those level of cat events this year. So, if you adjust for that, our reinsurance business actually grew in the third quarter by 20%. So, just to level set about that, we're not running away from the reinsurance business. On the other hand, as I have said, I think it's a, for Chubb, it is a better trade to us to grow our insurance property and catastrophe-related exposure than it is to do it through our insurance -- our reinsurance operations. And so, we have put much more capital or taking more exposure on the insurance side where we've got great transparency, we've got great distribution reach, we've got underwriting expertise up and down the food chain from personalized to small commercial to large industrial commercial, the E&S, across North America, across the globe. And so, we're participating heavily and choosing to do it there. On the -- and we'll see what 1/1 produces, and if we like the risk-adjusted returns on a relative basis to insurance, then we would lean in and do more in the property cat area. But it's not -- the money's not burning a hole in our pocket by any means. On the other side, reinsurance casualty, as I just said, look, it's not a new story to us about casualty, and nor to our -- those who run our reinsurance business. They have the insights of Chubb's insurance business. And so, we've been very, very cautious and we've shrunk our market share significantly. If casualty re-improves to a point where it reflects the environment and you can earn a reasonable risk-adjusted return, you'd see us right more there. Other than that, we've got plenty of handles to pull in Chubb, and we remain patient and cautious. It's the only way to outperform in the insurance business, as far as I know, overtime. Greg Peters : Got it. Thanks for the detail. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Thanks, good morning. I just had a question on North America commercial and the growth there. Obviously, the net premium written growth is coming in just as you said it would, Evan, but I'm looking at the gross premium written growth and that decelerated a bit to 3% from 9% last quarter. I'm wondering if you could just walk through some of the moving pieces as to why that decelerated a little bit. Evan Greenberg : Yeah, thanks so much, David. Look, it's pretty simple. It was a couple of non-repeat or one-off fronted or structured deals. So, adjusting for those -- and really like two or three, the gross growth was actually in line, right in line with that. So, there's no underlying trend or broad sort of systemic. It was simply related to a couple of fronting deals. David Motemaden : Got it. Understood. And then, just on -- Peter had mentioned overall ongoing reserve development still strong on the ongoing business and all in. He had cited $55 million of unfavorable on long-tail lines, which is small, but just wondering if you could just talk about what segments that was focused in and what lines were driving that, and maybe a little bit of detail on what's going on? Evan Greenberg : It's no -- there's nothing new, no news story about it. It's auto and excess casualty, and it's those years of '17 to '19, maybe a little bit of '16, and that's about it. David Motemaden : Got it. Makes sense. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. This is -- there aren't more words for me to that -- we've all been talking about it, so, for a number of years, and it is -- just continues to develop a bit and we just strive to stay right on top of it. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey. Great. Good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Mike. Mike Zaremski : Good morning, Evan. I guess I'll ask a question specifically on the North America commercial segment, and it's kind of has to do with, I guess, reserves too, taking off with some of the other questions. But if I just look at year-to-date, and this definitely isn't a Chubb-specific phenomenon, but I'll cite Chubb stats, reserve release levels running, let's just say, 50% below last year, 50% below even Chubb's like historical five years looking at our model. I guess it implies something has changed, And I guess the question we get from investors -- and by the way I'm cognizant the absolute combined ratio is great. But the question we get from investors is, if reserve release levels have changed so much, why haven't loss cost inflation assumptions changed materially? Is that anything you'd like to comment there? Evan Greenberg : Loss cost inflation, let me tee off of that for a second. I think your mental model may not be exactly right. Loss cost inflation over the last two years and maybe longer, you've watched it step up our disclosed loss cost inflation. And when it steps up, it first impacts your view and therefore your pricing and your loss ratios for your current accident year. You then have to apply it going back on your in-force reserves. But your in-force reserves continue to develop. And as they develop, if they develop with more inflation in the current calendar year than you imagined, and you think it has credibility, then you have to adjust those reserves going back. And then, that informs your inflation factor you're going to use in the current period. And that's why you see inflation as loss cost inflation has evolved over the last few years with the notion of increase of frequency of severity in particular. You had the pandemic and those who I think were smart were careful and didn't imagine that patterns had changed even though you couldn't observe them and kept trending the same. But you trended the same and if inflation was a little worse when you look back on it, then you have to keep adjusting for that. We have produced, what I can tell, $600 million through three quarters or more of prior period reserve, positive development. That's on a trend of a net $800 million. And we've had legacy run-off exposure, asbestos, environmental, molestation, all of that included in that. I think when you look back historically on Chubb, the reserve development is pretty steady and pretty prudent there. Mike Zaremski : That's very helpful. I appreciate you partially correcting the way I was thinking about it. I guess my quick follow-up is, you've talked more than some of your peers about exposure acting as rates. And maybe it's not fair, but some of your peers say that only some exposure act as rate. I don't know if that's a conversation you want to have or you want to delve into whether you think the vast majority of Chubb-specific exposure really does act as rate more so than others, or anything you want to add there? Thanks. Evan Greenberg : No, I think both comments are consistent. It depends on what line of business you're talking about. And we adjust our exposure, it's adjusted exposure. And therefore, it adjusts to reflect only that portion of the exposure that acts like rate. And that will vary by line, different for general casualty than it is for workers' comp. Different for property, how you look at it -- how you view it. So, the percentages and the ingredients, it varies by line of business. And that's reflected in how we look at it for ourselves and disclose it to you. And then, by the way, depending on the line of business, we also, to make it one step more complicated, but you don't need to worry, we just show you a net of it, we also, there's economic, and then we have insurance adjustments that can take exposure down. We increase retentions of a client in casualty. We increase deductibles in property. That's actually reducing exposure and that adjusts and gets netted. Mike Zaremski : Very helpful. Evan Greenberg : Yeah, you can go back and chew on that one. Thanks, Mike. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Your line is open. Paul Newsome : Good morning. Congratulations on the quarter. Just a couple of maybe follow-up questions. On the crop business, was there anything that was -- that triggered the early recognition of the [indiscernible] prices or yields or anything that stuck out for the why the little bit of a change? Evan Greenberg : No, not really, Paul. We just had better information. By the nature of this growing season, for instance, winter wheat -- you know that in the third quarter, and winter wheat, as an example, is under pressure this year relatively. And so that goes into the loss ratio number. California had storm events and et cetera that revealed losses earlier. So, we just had better data to be able to adjust this year in the quarter than we -- in the third quarter than we did last year where it really emerged very late, I think tail end of harvesting. Paul Newsome : Okay, that's great. And then different topics, a little bit on the reserve front. [indiscernible] and the other peers are talking about healthcare inflation being a good guy of late and helping out workers' comp reserves, in particular. Are you seeing some of the same effects there as well where the healthcare piece, which crosses all sorts of things in your business, is coming a little bit better than expected? Evan Greenberg : No. We're -- in fact, we've used, and we -- not this quarter, we had done it in the past. We've reflected on a bit higher medical inflation trend, recognizing that medical inflation overall is more elevated. And what you see in a current period when you're booking an accident year, is only so relevant because comp has a tail to it and medical has a tail to it. And so, you reflect that -- at least here, we reflect that prudently and how we think about medical inflation when we construct our loss picks. Paul Newsome : Appreciate letting me ask questions. Thanks for the help, as always. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tracy Benguigui with Barclays. Your line is open. Tracy Benguigui : Good morning. Real quick for clarification, your commentary about 13.9% pricing increases in North America commercial, that's ex financial lines, right? Evan Greenberg : Correct. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. So keeping that in mind, it looks like we're seeing strong but sequentially less momentum in property pricing. Is there seasonality to keep in mind? Otherwise, can you shed some light on the competitive environment, writing capacity entering, ability to pass on higher reinsurance costs or, to some extent, more retention of risk by insureds to contain costs? Evan Greenberg : I don't square with that comment. I believe I gave you like 23% in property. Property pricing remains extremely strong. So, you're seeing something that we're not seeing. Tracy Benguigui : No doubt. 23% is great. I was just comparing that to 31.5% in the second quarter. Evan Greenberg : No, it's just -- no, there's nothing. This is volatility [quarter-to-quarter] (ph) depends what we might write a little more in commercial lines versus -- in middle market versus what we wrote in E&S versus what we wrote in major accounts. But on a cohort for cohort, we're not seeing a difference. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Very good. Also real quick, just a follow-up to David's question. Was there any sizable workers' comp offset to the $55 million adverse development you took for long-tail lines? Evan Greenberg : There was in middle market, workers' comp, not large account workers' comp. This is the quarter that we study middle market. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. But was it large enough where it might have been a larger charge you took in auto and excess liability, you might have seen a nice offset? Evan Greenberg : I'm not -- we don't come out with parts and pieces, and so, we look at it, we roll it all together. But there was more in auto and excess together on a gross basis, and then there are other lines that are better. And so, you add it all together and it nets. Tracy Benguigui : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. First question. So, we're hearing from some executives that they're voicing concern about medical loss environment looking ahead. While it's currently benign, there is a concern that it may be picking up. So, how are you thinking about that with regards to both kind of prior accident year reserves and forward appetite? And honestly, I'll leave it to you whether you want to discuss this on a company basis or what your views are with regards to the industry and how it has to approach this? And maybe even touch on which lines other than workers' comp, that I think we're all aware of, could be most impacted by that shift? Evan Greenberg : Yaron, I think I just answered it. So, I'll repeat myself. We adjusted our loss picks to reflect in our inflation numbers we use. We adjusted to reflect our view of higher medical inflation already, and we did that a number of quarters ago. And we're steady in the use of that because we already raised it. Yaron Kinar : Okay. And do you think the industry is in a relatively similar position? Evan Greenberg : I don't underwrite for the industry. So, I don't see what the industry fix. I don't know what each company fix. I can only manage Chubb. If everybody wants to give me their's, I'll find on it, but I don't have much. Yaron Kinar : Well, I guess I could maybe phrase it a different way. Since you have adjusted for this already, I would think that your pricing is also accordingly adjusted. Are you finding that your prices are still competitive with the industries? Or is the industry still essentially pricing for a lower loss inflation? Evan Greenberg : I don't see -- you're conflating two things. What people actually charge in the marketplace? And what their loss picks are, what their charge reflects? They may be reflecting the same things I reflect and they're willing to underwrite to 100%. And I'm not. So, I can't take that bait you're putting out there. Yaron Kinar : Okay. Fair enough. Evan Greenberg : I just don't know what they're each picking for loss cost and then how -- whether they want to underwrite to a 97% or 95%, when at Chubb, we're just not going to do that. Yaron Kinar : Point taken. Makes sense. The other question I had, North America Commercial, the underlying loss ratio improved year-over-year. Nonetheless, was a bit elevated relative to the first half. Were there any one-offs this quarter or in the first half? Or should we look at the year-to-date as a reasonable run rate? Evan Greenberg : Yaron, take a step back, if you would, with me for a second. Look at the combined ratios we are putting on, they are world-class. They are unbelievably good. They're believable, because they're real. They are tremendous. North America's loss ratio year-on-year has improved almost half of it from what is a really world-class to begin with. It speaks for itself. These are great combined ratios. And when you look at sequential this or you look at that, I just don't relate to that. Yaron Kinar : Fair enough. And certainly great combined, no... Evan Greenberg : It's like -- it's tremendous. And you take that kind of -- those kinds of underwriting margins, you add stronger premium growth to it, you look at what I think is responsible pricing across the portfolio, ex cat for an accident year for insurers right now are going to look lower because everybody is more cat-levered in their pricing -- in their combined ratio because they're writing more property and they're getting the price on -- probably they're writing more property and taking more cat exposure, of course. And the real action to me is, therefore, what's your published combined ratio? Are you charging adequately? And by the way, that includes are you charging adequately for your property and property cat exposure? There'll be volatility quarter-to-quarter, but over a period of time and masked within there, what are you picking for your casualty combined ratios? And how are you underwriting for that? And when you mix the two together, you better be running a pretty darn good current accident year ex cat combined ratio. That's more of the way I would be thinking about this if I was on the outside. Yaron Kinar : Noted. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Hey, thanks. Good morning, Evan. First one, any green shoots at all and maybe the pricing environment for financial lines here? I mean, it's been pretty competitive here for a while. I know that we've talked about the cyber losses coming through. What are you seeing there? Evan Greenberg : No, I'm not seeing. It's pretty -- this industry just has -- does what I think is a pretty dumb stuff at times. And financial lines is a very broad category. It has everything from public D&O to private D&O, non-profit D&O, errors and omissions of all kinds, cyber insurance. So, it's a real dog's breakfast of a lot of different lines. And each one goes to its own drum right now a bit. There are large pockets in there that I think are stable and/or managed adequately or handled decently. Then you have a couple where, my God, the number of MGAs that have pens today and the amount of capacity that proliferates. And by the way, a lot of that capacity coming back to the same balance sheet aggregating back, and you've got this sort of circular firing squad, which we tend to do now and again. It's in those areas that I don't see green shoots. And then the rest behaves reasonably to me. So, I wouldn't lump -- my first message to you, don't lump financial lines altogether. And then secondly, there's a couple of dumb areas. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. And then my second question, Evan, a little bigger picture here, just thinking about just generally, the general casualty lines here. As you kind of pointed out, really attractive combined ratios that you're printing and in the industry in general. And now we're also looking at long-term interest rates that are, gosh, decade high, right? Are we seeing any weakness at all from a pricing perspective? Do you anticipate that's going to start happening here in the next 12 months, just given the return profile of the business and how attractive it is? Evan Greenberg : I haven't seen it really, because higher interest rates are also a proxy for loss cost inflation. So, you've got an industry that I think is trying to stay on top of loss cost or has that impetus behind them to stay on top of loss cost in casualty. And other than in workers' comp, it hasn't been totally benign as you well know, and it's been around for a while. So, I think that higher yields are ameliorating. And by the way, if you do the math and you translate the higher yields to what it means to earn the same return, what combined ratio affect you would get to achieve the same return, it's modest in combined ratio relatively, 1 point here, 1 point there, it's not like, wow, I can raise my combined ratio as 5 points to achieve the same 15%, as an example, risk-adjusted return. No, you can't, and we run the math. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Due to time constraints, your final question comes from the line of Alex Scott with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi. I wanted to ask about the environment broadly in Asia, across the different countries. And just now that you've scaled up that business in a bigger way with the addition of Huatai being consolidated and so forth. What are you seeing in the environment? Where do you see the growth opportunities looking ahead? Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Well, we touched a bunch on it last quarter, and I'm going to just -- it doesn't change in two or three months. So, I'm going to reiterate it a bit to you. We operate in 12 countries in Asia. Half our business is commercial, half is consumer. And the consumer spreads across non-life and life. We're the largest direct marketers of insurance in Asia easily. And our life and non-life operations work closely together. We have huge digital capabilities that have grown out at dust. And the world is converting in direct response marketing from phone-based to digital to a combination of the two. Our agency operations for distribution, our brokerage operations for distribution, we play up and down the food chain of lower middle market right through to the largest corporate and we segment distribution and product that way. And it is across 12 distinct markets. Asia and North America are the two regions, I think that will have the greatest economic growth potential over the next decade or two. And Asia, get out of China, Asia is very vibrant, very dynamic. North Asia, older population. Southeast Asia with over 700 million people, young populations, and those economies are growing more quickly and they're emerging. Look at Vietnam today. Look even where Indonesia is going today. Singapore, those markets are all -- and Thailand, those markets are so dynamic with a lot of opportunity, but it's hard work. You have to really know those markets, and we've been there for decades. And we have spent the time to build and build and build capability on a local market basis. It's nothing to say you're in Asia. It's where are you in your capability in Thailand or Vietnam or any of these markets. They're distinct and you've got to have local capability, knowledge and a good command and control around underwriting. I'm very energized about what I see for this company over time in Asia. And I think it will continue to represent over time a greater share of our business. Thanks for the question. Alex Scott : Thanks. Operator : At this time, I would like to turn the call back over to Ms. Karen Beyer. Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. And then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. We had an outstanding quarter and finish to the year, in fact a record year. Our quarter\u2019s results included double digit premium growth, record P&C underwriting and investment income and strong life operating income, all leading to exceptional operating earnings on both the per share and dollar basis. Our results, both earnings and book value related were also positively impacted in a significant way, by a one-time deferred tax benefit related to Bermuda\u2019s new income tax law.  While the quarters results are impressive and important, the full year results that really matters most. All things being equal, one quarter hardly tells a story. Our full year results were simply stunning. Core operating income top $9.3 billion, up 45% or $8.2 billion, excluding the tax benefit, up 28%. P&C underwriting income was a record $5.5 billion, with a combined ratio of 86.5% and investment income was up 33% and top $5.3 billion. As you can see, the balance between underwriting income and investment income was about 50-50, a very healthy balance. Life income was over $1 billion, while consolidated premium revenue growth was 13.5% for the year.  For the year, our core operating ROE was 15.4%. And our return on tangible was 24.2%. Tax benefit contributed, so excluding that our core operating ROE was 13.6%, and our tangible ROE was 21.6%. Excellent numbers.  Finally, for the year, per share of book intangible book value each group by over 20%. All divisions of the company in major geographies contributed to these outstanding results last year. And I want to congratulate and thank my colleagues around the globe. Our results speak to the global nature of this organization, which is one of the things that distinguishes Chubb.  Our fundamentals are very strong, in the quarter itself was simply a continuation of the year. For the quarter for operating income was $2.3 billion, excluding the tax benefit, or $5.54 per share, up 36% and 39% respectively. The one-time tax benefit then added $1.1 billion or $2.76 a share. Our underwriting performance in the quarter was a result of stronger earned premium growth, excellent underwriting margins with the published combined ratio of 85.5% and a current action at year of 84.3%. We had strong prior period reserve developments in both North America and Overseas General and relatively light CAT losses. P&C underwriting income for the quarter was $1.5 billion.  Our prior year reserve development in the quarter and for the year was $177 million and $773 million, respectively, which speaks to the consistent strength of our loss reserves. At year end, our loss reserves were in an exceptionally strong position, as strong as they have ever been.  On the invested asset side, record adjusted net investment income of $1.5 billion was up $369 million, with 33% over prior year. Our portfolio yield at the end of the year was 4.3% versus 3.6% a year ago, and our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 5.3%. We have very strong liquidity and our investment income run rate continues to grow, as we reinvest our cash flow at higher rates. Peter will have more to say about financial items.  Now turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net written premiums for the company increased over 13% in the quarter, with P&C up 12.5% and life up 20%. Of the P&C 12.5%, consumer loan lines were up 20% and commercial P&C was up 10%, which is in fact stronger than the full year average of 8.6%. Our premium revenue growth in the quarter was well spread globally. And from a broader perspective, for the full year, growth was 13.5%, with P&C uptown and life up 52%. Again Chubb is a globally diversified company. And our growth last year demonstrates the broad base nature of our operations. North America, commercial P&C, a very large and important business, representing 40% of the company, grew 7.5%. The balance of the company, the other 60% grew 18%. U.S. high net-worth personal lines grew 11%. International consumer P&C grew 18%, international commercial P&C grew over 11%, and life grew 52%. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, the pattern was the same, as we have experienced all year, price increases in the quarter, and property and casualty lines exceeded loss costs in both North America and our International division. While globally, rates and prices continued to decrease in financial lines led by D&O.  Getting to the detail for the quarter and beginning with North America. Premiums were up 9.4% or 6.2%, excluding agriculture. Consisted of growth of 12.1% in personal insurance, and 4.4% in commercial insurance. Within the 4.4% P&C lines were up 6.3% and financial lines were down 2.1%. Unpacking the 4.4%, which was obviously slower than previous quarters, first, our middle market division had another strong quarter, with P&C premiums up 9.8%, while financial lines were essentially flat. Our E&S business had a strong quarter with growth of 16% in our wholesale brokerage lives. On the other hand, our divisions which serves large corporates, major accounts grew only 1.4%. Growth in Major was adversely impacted by about 7.5 points, or $125 million of premium from underwriting actions, we plan for and took in a segment of our primary and excess casualty business. One-half of the reduction in premium was the result of increased client retentions, with the balance due to loss business. For clarity, these actions in fact, contribute to future growth in underwriting income.  Regarding future, North America commercial growth, as we said in the press release, given current market conditions and our capabilities across all segments of commercial P&C, including large accounts. E&S and middle market, we fully expect to return to more robust growth, beginning with the first quarter. Overall pricing for total North America commercial increased 7.3%, including rate of 5.1%. An exposure change that acts like rate of 2.1%.  Let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Pricing for commercial property and casualty was strong. Up 12.4%, property pricing was up 17.3, with rates up 12.9 and exposure change of 3.9. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.4%, with rates of 10.8% and exposure of 1.4%. And workers comp, which includes both primary and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.6%, with rates of 1.1% and exposure up 3.5%. We are trending loss costs in North America at 6.6%, with short tail classes at 5.5% and long tail excluding comp at 7.3%. We are trending our first dollar workers comp book at 4.6%.  For financial lines, the underwriting environment remains aggressive, particularly Indiana, and rates continue to decline. We know this business extremely well, at our trading growth for underwriting margin, at income, where we need to. In the quarter rates and pricing from North America financial lines in aggregate were down 6.1% and 5.5% respectively. We are trending financial lines loss costs at 5.1%.  For our agriculture business, late season, drought related developments in crop insurance, resulted in an elevated combined ratio for the quarter in the year. For context, we published a 95.4% combined ratio for the year and earned an underwriting profit of $146 million. Similar to the previous year\u2019s result. Crop insurance is a CAT like business, by its nature vulnerable to weather volatility, but with very good risk reward dynamics if managed well. Crop insurance has been a great business for Chubb. Rain and Hail is an amazing company, and since acquiring them in 2010, for about $1.1 billion, we burned almost $2 billion in operating profit with an IRR of 26%.  On the consumer side of North America, our high net-worth personal lines business had a simply outstanding quarter and year. In the quarter, premiums were up over 12% and new business growth was up 34%. There is a continued flight through our product, service and capability. We are the gold standard period. Again for the year the business grew almost 11% and published a combined ratio of 89.7% or 80.1% on a current accident year ex-cat basis. In our homeowner\u2019s business, we achieved pricing of 17% in the quarter, while our selected loss costs trend remains steady, 10.5%.  Turning to our international general insurance operations, which had an outstanding quarter. Net premiums were 19.3% and the combined ratio was 85.9%. Our international commercial business grew 13.2%, while consumer was up 29.5%. For the year, Overseas General grew 14%. And our international business growth this quarter was broad base, with all major regions producing double digit growth, again, illustrating the global nature of the company. Asia led the way with premiums up 37%, made up of commercial lines growth of 21% and consumer up 56%. Europe and Latin America had very strong quarters as well, with growth of 15.5% above for both. We continue to achieve improved rate to exposure across our international commercial portfolio. With pricing in our retail business up over 7%, Property and casualty line pricing was up over 10%, while financial lines pricing was down about 2%. Loss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8%. The P&C lines trending 6% and financial lines trending 4.9%. Within our international consumer P&C business, our A&H and personal lines divisions, both had strong quarters, and for the year, their growth was 14.4% and 21.4%, respectively. Growth again was led by Asia. In our international life insurance business, which is basically Asia, premiums were up 26%. For the year, we reported life income of just over $1 billion or about $950 million, adjusting for some non-recurring items.  So in summary, we had a simply outstanding quarter, contributing to another record setting year and we are well positioned, to continue producing outstanding results going forward. Underwriting conditions overall are favorable, though they vary by business and geography. It\u2019s an underwriters market, and that's what we are. We have hit the ground running in \u201924, and while we are in the risk business, and volatility is a feature of that, we are confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings at a double digit pace, through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income, life income.  Now I\u2019ll turning the call over to Peter, and then we're going to come back, to take your questions. Peter Enns : Good morning. As you've just heard from Evan, our strong performance continued into the fourth quarter. And we ended the year with record results in all three sources of earnings. P&C underwriting income, investment, income, and life income. Additionally, our book value of nearly $60 billion and book value per share of $146.83 were both all-time highs.  Before I go into further detail on our results, I want to touch on the $1.14 billion, onetime deferred tax benefit recognized in the quarter. This tax benefit is a result of the Bermuda corporate income tax law enacted in December, which requires a one-time step up of the tax basis for assets in Bermuda to fair value. This one-time benefit represents a permanent increase to book value and tangible book value, and will be realized over a 10-year period starting in 2025. Please refer to Page 1b in the financial supplement for the impact of this benefit on our key metrics.  During the quarter per share book and tangible book value increased 12.2% and 20.2%, excluding the tax benefit. This increase reflects strong operating results and net realized and unrealized gains of $4.9 billion in our investment portfolio due to declining interest rates, partially offset by $1.1 billion of dividends and share repurchases. For the full year book and tangible book value per share increased 18.2% and 17.5%, excluding the tax benefit. The increase also included the diluted impact on the tangible equity related to Huatai consolidation on July 1, which has since been fully recovered.  Turning to investments our portfolio grew over 20% since last year, reaching $137 billion at year end and benefiting from record full year adjusted operating cash flows of $12.2 billion and the addition of the Huatai portfolio of approximately $7 billion net to Chubb. In addition, we experienced unrealized gains on our portfolio during the year of $3.1 million which again highlights the transient nature of these mark-to-market movements for a high-quality fixed income portfolio. This year, we continue to take advantage of an attractive interest rate environment, raising our portfolio yield to 4.3%, our highest since the third quarter of 2011. Our adjusted net investment income of $1.49 billion in the quarter included approximately $55 million of higher-than-normal dividend income and private equity distributions. Looking at, we expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to have a run rate of approximately $1.45 billion and to go up from there. Turning to our underwriting business. For the quarter, we had pretax catastrophe losses of $300 million, principally from weather-related events, split 54% in the U.S. and 46% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter in our active businesses was a favorable $323 million pretax, with 81% in short tail lines predominantly from property and 19% in long tail lines. Our corporate runoff lines had adverse development of $146 million pretax, including $99 million asbestos related. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the year was 87%. Our reported effective tax rate was favorably impacted by the Bermuda deferred tax benefit mentioned earlier. Excluding the tax benefit, our core operating effective tax rate would have been 17% for the quarter and 18.2% for the year, slightly below our guided range, reflecting higher income in some low tax jurisdictions as well as the impact of certain employee-related benefits due to rising equity markets. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for calendar 2024 to be in the range of 18.75% to 19.25%.  I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mike Zaremski : Hey, good morning. Thanks. Maybe a first question on loss cost trend. We always appreciate all the granular color you gave. So in North America, it looks like short-tail loss trend came down a little bit, whereas the long-tail loss cost trend just inched up a little bit higher. And I feel on the -- if I look back over longer periods of time, the long-tail loss trend has -- I guess, directionally been inching higher for years now, I guess, ex the onset of the pandemic potentially.  But just curious, the underwriting result is excellent. Very clear that you feel like this is a good underwriting environment. What gives you comfort that if the long-tail loss inflation continues kind of inching higher that it is still a great underwriting environment in the year to come? Evan Greenberg : Well, there's no certainty guaranteed. But, our loss cost trend in casualty, when I look at it, has been reasonably steady over the year. And you'll say it inched up really more on mix of business than anything else when I look at the individual cohorts. That's the vast majority, and it's not a material change. So -- and we have a lot of visibility on loss cost. There are some pockets that have been more elevated over the last number of years. It's nothing new. We have spoken about it continuously. But overall, I think casualty loss cost tracks while they are elevated due to the external environment, as we understand it to be, is reasonably steady elevated. And so that's what gives me a lot of confidence about it. Mike Zaremski : Okay. That's helpful color. Lastly, my follow-up, with the -- with great earnings levels, maybe Peter or Evan, you can update us on the drag from excess capital and whether we should be just kind of continuing to deploy a mix of it into to buybacks and then hoarding some for opportunistic M&A, if there's really no change to that. Evan Greenberg : So we had disclosed, I think, on the last call, the drag by showing the difference in reported ROE. I would say it's up somewhat from there, just reflecting a combination of new S&P models and some other factors. But it's somewhat above -- modestly above what we reported last quarter. Mike Zaremski : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. David Motemaden : Hi, thanks. Good morning. I just had a question around some of the moving pieces on the reserve releases in North America commercial. And if there was any impact from some of the corrective actions on reserves? Evan Greenberg : There was no connection in the reserve changes to the underwriting actions that I flagged in my commentary, and that was in the press release. And by the way, there was another question. So I've noticed was our loss ratio in the quarter impacted by those changes.  No. I'll remind everyone loss ratio is based on earned premium, not written premium. And so any benefit we might see, which is very, very modest. Look at the size of our commercial business. We're talking about premium impact of $125 million. So you think of the loss ratio impact from it, very minor, but still it contributes. And wherever you see something that is a price right, we're structured, right. It's axiomatic P&C. You address it. David Motemaden : Great. Okay. That's helpful. And I appreciate that on the go-forward impact. And then I guess, just my follow-up question, just on the growth in North America commercial on your expectations for 2024. Wondering maybe if you could just talk, I saw the casualty rates ticked up nicely in the quarter, but overall rate is down. I guess -- would you expect growth, if I were to look at 2023, 7.5% growth in North America commercial. Would you think the environment is good enough to produce higher growth than that or lower growth? Or I guess, how are you thinking about it for 2024? Evan Greenberg : David, nice try. I don't give guidance as you know around any of that. The 7.5% is an interesting. You look at the growth rate prior to the fourth quarter action, it was more robust than that. And our thinking starts from there. And then you think about -- when you said about the rate action, yes, casualty was better. Property on the short-tail classes were therefore down a little bit, but I got strong double-digit growth in the property-related lines, rate and pricing, which is keeping pace with values. That's what that exposure changes. It's about keeping pace with values. And so it's a well-priced business and a well-priced book and you're getting rate on rate on rate. So of course, that's going to slow down but the underwriting environment for it and the rate to exposure, the risk reward is quite good. If you have the balance sheet and you have the ability to take on the exposure and the confidence as we do. I feel very good about North America as we go forward. So well underwritten business. David Motemaden : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Gregory Peters : Well, good morning. In the press release and your comments, then you mentioned the fact that Chubb's loss reserves are as strong as they've ever been. So I'm curious what metrics you're looking at to make that determination. And the reason why I guess I'm asking is, I've kind of considered Chubb to always have strong reserves. So what's -- is there something that's changed inside your reserving philosophy or structure that gives you confidence that they're better now than they have been in previous years? Evan Greenberg : No, nothing has changed in that regard. You go through different underwriting environment. And the loss cost that is earned in over the years. I look at the mix of business, I look at our data and insight as the company has grown. And frankly, I just say all the loss reserve studies we do and then independently reviewed by external actuaries and by auditors. And I look at the end result and the strength of it. And it's a very simple statement to make. When I look back and track it over years that our reserves are as strong and as robust as we have ever seen. Gregory Peters : Okay. And then another calls out, you talked about the large account excess casualty business. And I know you provided some color on your comments. So just looking for a little bit more detail. There's obviously been noise in the market about casualty and maybe the success casualty is one of the sensitive subjects that's hitting the marketplace. But any additional color there would be helpful. Evan Greenberg : Sure, Greg. If you look back over time, some of the things that I have said, and I'm going to repeat them because I think they maybe to some degree for some people to go in one ear and out the other, and then there are moments where it really sticks. When you look at the external litigation environment, the target, first and foremost, is corporate America. Not small business, not midsized business, but larger business. There's a general attitude among segments of the population against corporations. Trial bar like Willy Sutton, if they're going to ask them, \"Why do you rob banks?\" he said, because that's where the money is. And so they go after large corporations. Number two.  Number three, we know there has been a trend of increased frequency of severity which hits both primary but excess casualty. Nothing new, I've been talking about it for quite some time. And then there's a lot of visibility that particularly acute in exposure that has wheels, anything with wheels. It could be logistics companies, trucking, companies anybody who's got fleet and the larger the vehicles in the fleet, the more of a target, it is and has been. That's what you're -- that story has continued. And there's been inflation in both frequency and severity in that, nothing new. And that is the theme in large accounts. And it's pretty focused and directed. It doesn't mean balance of casualty doesn't have elevated loss cost, which has been, I just addressed, which has had a lot of visibility and is steady. But it has been more acute in isolated segments. Gregory Peters : Great. Thanks for the detail. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous Research. Please go ahead. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Just I guess, following up with the large account space. So I guess I've always thought about that as a business where you guys had a competitive advantage, not a lot of players that can write the primary casualty, the primary D&O. But it's clearly been a place that's frustrated you more recently. I'm just curious, there's no risk here that any of the actions you're taking could somehow change the significance -- the strategic significance of that franchise several years down the road? Is there? Evan Greenberg : Oh my God, no. You're overthinking. No. And this is -- you look at the actions that we just flagged, half of it is exposure change and half of it is additional written premium that we lost. Since then, by the way, the market is beginning to catch up at similar actions and no impact to the franchise. It's not like we're wholesale underwriting our book of business. So a very large, very healthy book of business. Ryan Tunis : Understood. And then I guess my follow-up is just on the property side\u2026 Evan Greenberg : I'm sorry, Ryan. Ryan Tunis : Sorry, go ahead. Go ahead. Sorry about that. Evan Greenberg : No, I just editorialize that that's why it gave you an amount of money and told you how it was it just a fraction. Ryan Tunis : Understood. And then my follow-up is just on the property side, and I'm thinking more wholesale like Westchester type CAT-exposed property, probably in '23, how are you thinking about the rate adequacy in our business after that huge rate all we got last year? Evan Greenberg : I think it is radar adequacy is strong. Quite strong. I'm not going to go into any more detail other than to say that and we triangulate it numerous ways, but it's quite strong. From everything we know, all the models and the balance of input and our analysis of the portfolio, hikes of occupancies, geographies it's in, perils it's exposed to, you add it all up. We feel very good about that book of business. If you want to know more, you're going to have to join the company. That was a joke, Ryan. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields with KBW. Please go ahead. Meyer Shields : Great, thanks. And good morning. Within North American personal, I was hoping you could get an update as to how much of the business that wanted to move to E&S to actually now on E&S paper? And how much opportunity there is for that shift in 2024? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It's -- I'm not going to give you a dollar amount or a data point that way, except that directionally, we are writing more business on E&S. It is growing at a rapid clip. It will continue to. Our preference is always to offer our customer first admitted, but where the states and regulation don't allow us to tailor coverage for those who were exposed in a more outsized way to catastrophes. Remember, affluent people want to live in beautiful places that are right on the edge of civilization in nature, and its more CAT-exposed and where we can't tailor coverage in line with exposure, we'll use it and price it adequately. We use the E&S. And that's what we're doing. But again, I think that -- and I wish it was more flexibility within regulation, within jurisdictions so that we could serve this customer base on an admitted basis versus be forced to E&S to give them what they need and that they want to buy. Meyer Shields : Okay. Understood. That's very helpful. Second question is sort of the same theme. Within agriculture, at least on the crop side, can you talk about how you can manage through climate change risks where you don't have flexibility in pricing or policy language? Evan Greenberg : But there's a difference. In agriculture, we have a ton of data. We have a couple of very fundamental advantages. Number one, we can select risk. And so we can determine -- we have to take all commerce. So we can determine what risk to retain and which risk to share with the government. And that's what helps you with this election is what helps you in managing to price adequacy. And the second thing, we have scale. And you only get reimbursed so much of their expenses out of the government program because of our scale and our technology and automation, we operate efficiently. So we limit any expense-related exposure to the company. And that allows us to operate on a favorable risk. Meyer Shields : Okay. That\u2019s perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning, everybody. Evan, I wanted to follow up on your previous answer with regards to the E&S market and high net worth. And I think you said you would like to have the flexibility of continuing to offer the product in the admitted market. What's the difference from your perspective? Why would you like the admitted market over E&S? Evan Greenberg : Well, it's customer friendly. And I think just from a customer point of view, they just feel it's easier to place with us. You don't go through -- you have to go through more administrative process to place it on E&S. Remember, there are -- you can't just jump to E&S, you have to be able to leap through admitted market hurdles to get to E&S. And it's simpler and I think for them, from their own point of view, it's more comfortable. Now to keep it in perspective, the vast, vast majority of our portfolio is admitted. And then it's on the margin right now that it is not admitted. But my point is I don't like the trend. More will go on non-admitted climate change continues and states take the wrong action to try to cover up price and deflect price signals and ability to risk share with people who -- out of the well and choose to live in places that are more exposed. And I think there would be more flexibility and recognition of that consumer base and their needs and their desires and not force them to go through all they have to go through to place on [indiscernible]. Yaron Kinar : Makes sense. I appreciate the answer. And then if I could shift gears to China. I think you called out about $100 billion of AUM that are managed in China, mostly third-party capital. Just curious how you're thinking about that book in the face of, I guess, some selling consumer and business sentiment in China and maybe the equity market performance there. How do you go about -- are you making any shift in how you're managing the book with that? Evan Greenberg : Yes. It's -- first of all, let's not think of it as book. It's an asset management business, that $100 billion. We have an asset management company that does retail, does mutual fund and very large institutional money management including state pension money. The vast majority of it is fixed income. We underwrite the credit exposure extremely carefully, you don't chase yield. We do it in a conservative way the way we've been fiduciary managers of our policyholders' money. It's how we treat investors' money. And China is a lower interest rate environment now. Equity market with a lot of volatility, not a lot of confidence in the economic short-term, medium-term future among business and consumer. So it's not the best time to be managing and trying to grow an asset management business. But all of our thinking and plans of that in mind and like everything else, it's a moment in time when the country returns to more rapid growth, when confidence begins to come back because government addresses and manages sentiment and the economy a bit differently than they are today, which I think, over time, they'll be forced to. This is a great franchise to have. And by the way, if you look at its rankings, it's outstanding performance rankings in the marketplace, for its collapse of fixed income. And secondly, in its size relative to other asset managers in China. It's actually -- it's in that upper midsize category. It's a pretty cool asset. Yaron Kinar : Thank you very much. Evan Greenberg : And its capital light. Operator : Thank you. Your next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Bob Huang : Hi, good morning. My first question is regarding your workers' comp business. You mentioned that your loss trend is about 4.6%. Is it possible to maybe unpack that a little bit between severity frequency and as well as wage growth trend? And then are there any severity stress points that we should pay attention to? Evan Greenberg : No. We're not going to unpack it between frequency and severity. It's running very steady. We recognize a higher medical loss trend. We adjusted for that and disclose that a quarter or two ago. Workers' comp is behaving in a very steady way. Bob Huang : Okay. Got it. Thank you. My second question kind of is more of a geopolitical risk related question. Obviously, a large portion of your business Overseas, still performing very strong. But it feels like geopolitical risk really hasn't improved so far versus 2023. Is it possible to kind of give an update in terms of how you think about the risk associated in your business in Asia and Europe and how you think about the broader opportunities outside the U.S.? Evan Greenberg : Well, I don't think the geopolitical risk for Europe and our business in the EU. I don't think they have a political risk, geopolitical risk exposure any greater fundamentally than we do in the United States. And so if you're concerned for Europe in a significant way, then you better be concerned right here at home in America. When I get to Asia, I don't believe that the United States and China are going to war. And I think all sides seek a stability. And so while there is OEs tail risk, in Asia related to North Korea, related to Taiwan, in particular, I think it's more risk at this moment around someone making a mistake. By the way, I'm going to leave you with this. The mental model, if there is a conflict in Taiwan, where there is a conflict to do with North Korea, it is hard to believe it will confine itself to a small geography. We then have a major global issue. And I think those were in leadership position on all sides are acutely aware of us and they too, care about their children and their grandchildren. Bob Huang : Okay, thank you very much for that. Really appreciate it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question is on North America commercial. You guys saw a good level of exiting your loss ratio improvement in the quarter. I was just wondering if there was any prior quarter true-up for the prior quarters of the year or any benefit of favorable non-CAT weather. Or was it just good core underwriting results? Evan Greenberg : No, there was no true-up current accident year true-up that distorted the quarter whatsoever. It's steady. And the improvement is a combination of change of mix of business, which, frankly, at least, I would think you'd notice that everywhere because it's the more property levered portfolios are lower that current accident year. Ex-CAT is going to become number one. And then number two, beyond mix, it's rate in excess of loss cost across most of the business earning its way through. Elyse Greenspan : Thanks. And then on the tax rate side, Peter, I know you said you gave us guidance for '24. But what about in 2025 when the Bermuda tax rate goes up? How should we think about that impacting the tax rate at Chubb? Peter Enns : Yes, it's too complicated and early to know in terms of how the Bermuda law will interact with whatever gets adopted at OECD, Switzerland and the U.S., we really don't have any visibility on it. Elyse Greenspan : Okay. And then one more for you. In your press release, you pointed to growing operating earnings at a double-digit pace. I'm assuming that's a comment if we adjust for the one-off tax benefit in the quarter that you expect operating earnings can grow double digits in '24. Is that how we should take that comment? Evan Greenberg : Yes, Elyse. Elyse Greenspan : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS Financial. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Yes, thanks. I appreciate. A couple here. Just first, Evan, is this possible to get with the benefit of including Huatai was this quarter on consolidated premiums? I know you gave it last quarter and maybe on the Overseas as we get a sense of kind of the true kind of organic run rate of the business? Evan Greenberg : I'm sorry, Brian, you're kind of breaking up on. I am not able to hear it. Brian Meredith : Huatai, the benefit that, that had of including it in premium growth in the quarter? Evan Greenberg : Huatai had a premium benefit in the quarter. We didn't disclose it. We disclosed it last quarter and said from here, it's just in there. It was from memory, it's just a couple of points. We'll take it offline with you, but it wasn't -- we'll have more color in the 10-K MD&A on a couple of lines. Brian Meredith : Great. That's helpful. And then my second question, maybe bigger picture here. The trucking business in the U.S., I mean, we continue to see some really bad kind of severity in the long-haul trucking business. Is there any solution to that? Or is it simply just getting enough rate? Evan Greenberg : No. getting enough rate is -- that's what we have to do. But that doesn't solve the problem for American trucking, which we need a healthy trucking industry. And you certainly want to take the inflation out of shipping rates. And this all contributes, you end up paying for it. It's really a state-by-state solution, and that -- how they -- the amount of awards that are handed out. And by the way, look at simple laws like, who is responsible in a liability event and how it varies by state. There are states where you may have 1% responsibility. And you're the deep pocket, and you are allocated 100% of the cost. There are states that -- where there's a comparative negligence, both parties are at fault and look at how it varies, how they determine who is ultimately adjudicated to pay for the cost. When you look at those right there, you can see a part of the problem that is occurring. Particularly where trucking company is 1% or considered 2% at fault. Again, they're adjudicated 100% of the payment suffering and injury of that individual. That's a state-by-state problem. Look at litigation funding and look at what -- how many states require that you simply disclose who's funding the lawsuit. Because that has an impact on how injury will then view the injured party. They always march out the most sympathetic individual but is it all about sympathy to the individual? Or are they used as a prop to actually get a big payday for somebody who's funding the lawsuit. That's a state by state. And if you were looking for a federal solution, my God, we can't even agree on a budget and we can address the deficit or entitlement spending. Morgan would address this when the trial bar is funding half of Congress. Brian Meredith : Thanks for the answer. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead. Michael Ward : Thanks. Good morning. I was just curious if you had any kind of commentary around financial lines and in North America. I'm wondering if you have any sort of expectation for pricing to bottom out. Evan Greenberg : No. I don't have an expectation. I think when all of a lot of that naive hungry capital that is trying to make some money for themselves at the expense of the balance sheets that are funding it, when that all gets tired and loss cost catch-up, which is not far off with the level of pricing being charged, then there'll be an adjustment and Chubb is there, and we're a large writer of the business. And I don't know any boardroom where they wouldn't rather have Chubb all things being equal, handling their D&O. And by the way, another problem that's brewing as you look at the number of mouths to feed that get on a D&O tower right now. And as the losses come, good look, in many instances, I wish the brokers well in collecting from each of those players who now have remarks, because they wrote the business and now they have to pay the claims and they're losing money. But all that happens, we're just -- this is the business. There are pockets of the business that are done at times, and it's just one of those moments fine. We've got plenty else to do. Michael Ward : Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Thank you.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited First Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Good morning, everyone, and welcome to our March 31, 2024, First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com, for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. I'd like to introduce our speakers this morning. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer; followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. We'll then take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan G. Greenberg: Good morning. We had an excellent start to the year. Core operating income was up double digit, driven by all 3 sources of income. P&C underwriting income was up over 15% with a published combined ratio of 86%. Investment income was up more than 23% and life insurance income was up almost 10%. We produced double-digit premium revenue growth from across the globe with strong results in our commercial and consumer P&C and international life businesses. Core operating income was up over 20% to $2.2 billion and operating EPS was up nearly 23%, $5.41. As you saw, our earnings and EPS benefited modestly from 2 onetime items that partially offset each other. Adjusting for these, they were up 18.6% and nearly 21%, $5.33. Again, our P&C underwriting income was up over 15% to $1.4 billion, driven by strong earned premium growth and great underwriting margins. The ex-CAT current accident year combined ratio was 83.7%. On the investment side, adjusted net investment income of nearly $1.5 billion was up 23.5%. We now have more than $140 billion in invested assets, up over 19% in the last 2 years. And our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9% versus 4.4% a year ago. Our reinvestment rate is currently averaging 6.1%. Our liquidity is very strong, and investment income will continue to grow well as we reinvest cash flows at higher rates. Life segment income of $268 million was up 9.8%. Our annualized core operating ROE was 13.7%, with a return on tangible equity of nearly 22%. Peter will have some more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased over 14%. For Global P&C, which excludes agriculture, net premiums increased 13.3% in the quarter with commercial up over 11% and consumer up over 19%. P&C premium growth in the quarter again was balanced broad-based globally between areas of the globe and commercial versus consumer, reflecting favorable underwriting and market conditions overall. Life insurance premiums and deposits were up over 39%, driven by our business in Asia and came from a number of countries and distribution channels. Huatai contributed 2.9% and 20.6 percentage points, respectively, to the global P&C and life growth results. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, overall conditions were quite favorable in both property and casualty, and price increases exceeded loss cost while rate decreases in financial lines slowed. So starting with North America, premiums, excluding agriculture, were up over 10%, and consisted of 12.3% growth in personal insurance and about 9.5% growth in commercial. P&C lines up 13% and financial lines down about 7.5%. If we adjust the P&C growth to the net impact from 2 items in the major accounts division, P&C lines normalized growth was a very strong 11.6%. The 2 items were an unusually large structured transaction we wrote partially offset by the previously discussed corrective underwriting actions in primary and excess casualty that are continuing to wind down over the next few quarters. By the way, that large structured transaction negatively impacted North America commercial's combined ratio by over 0.5 point, the loss ratio impacted by over 1 point. Excluding this impact, unmasks the current accident year combined ratio run rate. Supporting North America P&C growth was record new business of over $1.2 billion at a very strong renewal retention on a policy count basis of 84.7%. Both speak to the tone of the market and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 12% with our large account retail business up 12% and our E&S business up about 10.5%. Premiums in our middle market division increased about 7% with P&C lines up 10.6% and financial lines down 6.5%. Again, the P&C market environment in North America overall is quite favorable and rational, financial lines aside. Pricing increased 12.8% including rate of 9.4%, an exposure change that acts like rate of 3.1%. From our very large middle market business to small commercial to personal lines, and driven by both property and casualty, we saw the best rates in pricing overall that we've seen in the last 4 to 5 quarters. It was one of the best quarters for large casualty pricing. In our North America business, rate increases for property and casualty exceeded loss cost trends, let alone pricing, which was even stronger. So let me provide a bit more color around rates and pricing. Property pricing was up 13%, with rates up 7.8% and exposure change of 4.8%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 13.1% with rates up 10.9% and exposure up 2%. And in workers' comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.8% with rates up 0.2% and exposure up 4.6%. Loss costs in North America are relatively stable and in line with what we contemplate in our loss specs. We are trending loss costs at 6.8%, short-tail classes at 5.3% and long tail, excluding comp at 7.6%, trending our first dollar workers' comp book at 4.6%. For financial lines, the underwriting environment and a number of classes in a word is simply dumb. Rates continue to decline, albeit at a slower pace. We are, of course, trading growth for underwriting margin and income where we need to. In the quarter, rates and pricing for North America financial lines in aggregate were down 3% and 2.7%, respectively. We are trending financial lines loss costs at just over 5%. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter. This is a powerhouse business, over $5.5 billion in premium last year and it grew over 12% in the quarter with new business growth of nearly 35%. It speaks to a franchise and a class of its own in terms of service and capability. Premium growth for our true high net worth Premier and Signature segments, the group that demands the most underwriting and servicing, grew 16.5%. In our homeowners business, we achieved pricing of 17% in the quarter, while our selected loss cost trend remained steady at 10.5%. While a small quarter, our agriculture business had a very good underwriting result as the '23 crop year turned out a bit better than we projected. Turning to our international general insurance operations. Net premiums were up 17.5% or 16.7% in constant dollars. Our international commercial business grew 11.4%, while our consumer was up over 26%.  Growth this quarter was geographically diverse with all major regions contributing, which again illustrates the true global nature of the company. Asia led the way with premiums up 40%. Excluding Huatai's contribution, premiums were up 7.7%. Latin America had a strong quarter, with premiums up about 13%, while the continent of Europe grew 10.3%. We continue to achieve positive breakthrough exposure across our international commercial portfolio. Retail property and casualty lines pricing, up 5.5% and financial lines pricing, down 2.3% million. Loss cost inflation across our international retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8%, with P&C lines trending 6.1% and financial lines trending 4.8%. Within our international consumer P&C business, our Personal Lines division had an exceptional quarter with constant dollar growth of 47%, led by Asia and Latin America. By the way, the modest increase in Overseas General's ex-CAT current accident year combined ratio this quarter was primarily due to the consolidation of our China business. In our international life insurance business, which is overwhelmingly Asia, premium and deposits were up over 50% in constant dollar, with strong contributions from Taiwan, Hong Kong, China and Korea. Excluding Huatai Life, premiums and deposits were up over 10%. Depending on the country, growth was driven by tied agency, brokerage and direct marketing distribution channels. Lastly, Global Re had a strong quarter with premium growth of almost 30% and a combined ratio of 76.9%. We allocate incrementally more CAT capacity to our reinsurance business and grew both our CAT excess and risk property portfolios, in particular, this quarter. In summary, we had an excellent quarter and start to the year. We remain well positioned to continue producing outstanding results through the balance of the year and beyond. We remain confident in our ability to continue growing operating earnings at a rapid pace through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and lifing. Now I'm going to turn it over to Peter and then we're going to come back, and we're going to take your questions. Peter Enns : Thank you, Evan. As you all just heard, we continue to build on the momentum of our record 2023 year with strong growth in top line and earnings per share this quarter. We continue to effectively manage our balance sheet and ended the quarter in a strong financial position, including book value that exceeded $60 billion in cash and invested assets of $143 billion, each topping last quarter's all-time highs. Adjusted operating cash flow was $3.6 billion. There were 2 onetime earnings items this quarter that I would like to touch on. First, we recognized an incremental $55 million deferred tax benefit related to the new 2023 Bermuda corporate income tax law. This resulted from finalizing our review of 2 smaller subsidiaries since last quarter. We don't expect additional deferred tax gains related to this law going forward.  Second, there was a contribution made to the Chubb Foundation, charitable foundation of $30 million pretax or $24 million after tax. These items provided a net benefit of $0.08 per share. Additionally, there were 2 other noteworthy items in the quarter. In March, we issued $1 billion of 10-year debt to retire existing debt due to retire -- mature in May 2024. Lastly, we closed on an additional 9% of shares of Huatai that brought our ownership interest of 85.5%. This leaves the last tranche of less than 1% of outstanding Huatai shares remaining to close. During the quarter, book and tangible book value per share, excluding AOCI, increased 2.2% and 2.9%, respectively, from December 31, driven by strong operating results partially offset by $350 million in dividends and $316 million in share repurchases in the quarter.  Turning to investments. Our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.48 billion, slightly beating our guidance of $1.45 billion. We expect our adjusted net investment income to have a run rate of approximately $1.5 billion to $1.52 billion next quarter and to go up from there.  Turning to underwriting results. The quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $435 million, which is modestly lower relative to prior year and is principally from winter storms and other weather-related events in the U.S. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a positive $216 million pretax with favorable development of $311 million in short tail lines, primarily from property and credit-related lines, and $95 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines, which was primarily from excess casualty and was within our range of expectations. Our corporate runoff portfolio had unfavorable development of $9 million pretax. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 84%. Our reported core effective tax rate was 15.2% or 17.3% for the quarter, excluding the update to our Bermuda tax benefit. As I've said before, our first quarter tax rate also tends to be the lowest of the year, due to certain tax benefits associated with equity award vesting and stock option exercises. We continue to expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for the full year to be in the range of 18.75% to 19.25%. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we're happy to take the questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. David Motemaden : First question. Evan, I just wanted to maybe get a little bit more detail on the $95 million of unfavorable reserve development on the long tail lines that you guys took this quarter? And maybe just unpack that a little bit more would be helpful. Evan G. Greenberg: Yes. Look, we recognized over $200 million of reserve releases, so to give perspective. And that included adverse development of $95 million in North America commercial lines long tail. It was not concentrated in any one period, it was spread out from '16 forward. It was predominantly large account excess casualty, auto related in areas we've discussed. Trucking, logistics companies, companies with large commercial fleets and it's the business we've been addressing in terms of rate and underwriting actions and in that case, think retentions.  And our loss picks that reflect our action. The -- in fact, when we talk about that we gave you color around that we had this large LPT that was larger than usual. And then we offset to a degree by the underwriting actions that we've been taking. You heard it all last quarter. It will run 2 or more -- maybe 2 more quarters. That's all related back to the same business as you know. So there's the mental model. The development was not a surprise because we continually track actual versus expected activity for all product lines. And we had continued to observe higher-than-expected loss activity for this business. So we study it more deeply this quarter. And we took as we always will. We took the bad news and we are slow to recognize good news, no different than I said last quarter, our reserves are really strong. David Motemaden : Got it. That's helpful. And then I did notice that the commercial casualty net premium written growth accelerated during the quarter and you mentioned -- you also mentioned the rate increases accelerated a little bit in the quarter as well in commercial casualty. Could you just talk about how you're thinking about balancing all the elevated uncertainty in the environment with leaning into growth, which it seems like you guys are doing a little bit? Evan G. Greenberg: Well, the growth is coming. It wasn't a little bit. It was a step change in the rate we got exceeded loss costs, let alone pricing, which includes exposure change. And that is what contributed substantially to the growth. We grew exposure as well, particularly in our middle market long-tail business. Though there was some growth in particular lines in large accounts as well where the pricing -- the vast majority of our book is adequately priced in casualty, and we're getting rate that recognizes loss cost trend, and so we maintain the adequacy. And then the stress classes, which need rate to hit our target combined ratios. That's where rate has accelerated in the market, and we -- because the market is also reacting, we're able to achieve and grow the business to a degree. Otherwise, we get the rate, like the business. And there were 1 or 2 classes where that's occurring. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Michael Zaremski : On the topic of social inflation, I think, I'm assuming when we think about the social inflation that the main way to tackle it is risk selection and pricing, et cetera. But I recall in your shareholder letter, Evan, you talked about working or maybe you can elaborate, you and others have talked about kind of -- it sounds like a more concerted effort to lobby efforts or to maybe state by state see if there could be some reforms. And so just curious if you could elaborate if there's anything changing there in terms of what Chubb or the industry is doing to maybe tackle it from the back end or... Evan G. Greenberg: Yes. First of all, our loss picks reflect the reality of the environment, the inflation we observe. And that includes any actions as we know them to be that might ameliorate it around tort reform. Tort reform is going to be a long-term never-ending process. As you say, it's not going to be federal. State by state, it could be county by county, depending. And it depends on the class of business as to the kind of reform that's required to bend that curve and loss cost. The insurance industry can support tort reform and does. The insurance industry can't particularly lead it. We don't have the printing press. This is ultimately paid for by corporate America, and it's paid for by consumers, by the products and the services from corporate America, it's a tax on everybody. If you look at it in a clear eye way, we reflect the inflation that we see, whether it comes from social inflation, so-called social inflation, or other causes in the prices and the rates we ultimately charge corporate America to the business. Tort reform comes and there's litigation finance where disclosure laws have to change around that and I mentioned that better. And some states require it, most don't. And it's very simple because it puts in context how sympathetic is the plaintiff. And what are the motives? There's laws around who bears liability, the responsibility, what they call joint and several laws around it. You could be 1% liable, but you're the only one with any money, so they make you 100% responsible financially. There are reasons that, that occurs, but that is also being gamed by the trial bar in how they target cases and how they target companies. It's those sorts of things. The insurance industry is hardly sympathetic. Corporate America needs to do more in this case, and we are all active. A number of companies are active in advocating for reforms, but it's not a magic, it's no silver magic bullet. It's going to take many years and it's going to require more effort than is currently being expended. Michael Zaremski : Great. Switching gears, maybe a quicker question on Personal Lines. If I look at kind of what Chubb has said about kind of loss cost inflation in personal lines and appreciating you have a different book than I guess the average of your peers. But you got -- you all have been talking about kind of close to double digit or double-digit loss cost inflation for many years now. It feels like that's been -- some of your peers have caught up to you in terms of, I think, they were underestimating it. But just curious if you can provide any context. Is the loss cost inflation more so coming from weather inflation? Or is it just as much coming from wage inflation? Or just any context unpacking that kind of 10%, 10.5% loss inflation? Evan G. Greenberg: Yes, it comes from 3 sources -- or a couple of sources. It comes from frequency of loss and from various perils. It comes from -- and so there you could think weather-related. You can also think water-related. And so the infrastructure impact to housing stock itself. It comes from wage inflation, and it comes from materials, which -- remember, we ensure not the average homeowner, we're ensuring those who are more affluent. And our product is a richer product in terms of how it responds to loss and the position it places you back in following loss. We try to duplicate exactly what you had before the loss, not sort of like it, but we duplicate it. That has an inherent inflation to it as well. And we ensure more complex properties, and we ensure more complex and expensive content. So that may contribute to a degree to a greater amount of inflation than you might see generally across. But we stay on top of it. And we have and we've stayed on top of it in terms of both pricing and the amount of coverage we give to our clients. So they don't fall behind, which for all our homeowners, in shorts, that shows up, yes, in your bill that you get once a year from us, be included. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Charles Peters : When I was looking through your results, I was particularly struck by the growth in the reinsurance lines, seems to have accelerated. And I'm just curious if there is a change in your perspective regarding leading into those market conditions. Evan G. Greenberg: Yes. Greg, keep in mind, percentages are a funny thing. It's not a big business. It's not a big book of business. We're not a large reinsurer. So the percentage growth, which is very good to see, is off of a relatively small base. So in dollar terms, it's nice. Thank you very much to all our Global Re colleagues, but it's not a large amount. We allocated given the pricing environment and given structure and given underlying pricing and structure of cedent's portfolios. We allocated more -- incrementally, as I said in the opening, more CAT capacity with 2 Global Re, which means they're writing a bit more CAT excess and a bit more property proportional and excess per risk. And it's across the globe where they see favorable conditions. That's predominantly with the CAT results. Charles Peters : Okay. Fair enough. I know -- I got to preview this question knowing that I'm probably not going to get a great answer, but I feel like it's appropriate to ask... Evan G. Greenberg: You can ask anyway, and you'll get a lousy answer, go ahead. Charles Peters : Well, the topic is M&A. I mean, you featured it. You talked about the 1 to 2 points of drag you get on holding excess capital. You mentioned that in your shareholder letter. You're generating great results. I feel like this is a time where we could see you get more active in the market. But maybe you can just talk to us broadly about what you're seeing in the market? Is there a pipeline out there? Or is it -- is there a lot of opportunities? Or give us some perspective if possible. Evan G. Greenberg: Greg, I'm at rest. And the results are terrific. We have excess capital for both risk and opportunity. It's earning -- putting money to work at over 6% right now. If you put the capital against our invested asset, it requires certainly a damn good ROE. The cash that we hold is accretive to shareholder returns. And look, we're a global company with a lot of global opportunity and our eyes are always open. But as I said, I'm at rest. Don't hold your breath. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis with Autonomous. Ryan Tunis : I guess first question, just on financial lines. I think you said that it's quite frankly, dumb. Now that's obviously like a pretty broad set of various lines within financials. I think I heard you say that you're shrinking in mid-market, too. And my perception is that, it was a little bit more disciplined than some of the major accounts. So just curious if you could just take us within financial lines, whether it's account size or D&O excess whatever, like where are folks acting more or less irrationally? Evan G. Greenberg: Yes, look, the way to think about this -- don't just think, it behaves differently to a degree in major account than it does in middle market in the cohorts that show up where market competition is irrational. I'm not going to unpack each one of those. But what I'll break down for you is this. You have publicly traded D&O. And whether it's in middle market or it's in large account, there is dumb behavior depending on the cohort. I'm not going to unpack which one of them it is that much transparency, but you see it in large accounts and you see it in publicly traded deal. There is not-for-profit D&O. We write it in both major accounts and we write it in middle market.  And by the way, we write it in E&S. And there are cohorts where market, we know because we're the largest writers of this business. We know what the experience is, what the real exposures are, where losses are coming from, market and pockets of that important buckets irrational, dumb. Employment practices liability. Again, I'm going to say which cohorts, but market is -- many are very naive and don't understand the trends and the exposures that are driving EPLI and where it's being driven, what states, where law has changed. Is it around? It's not simply wage an hour, now technology impacts it. There are those who have no idea what's catching up to them. And then you have legal changes that are occurring at the federal level that are impacting financial lines. You can see it and it's coming. So the good news about the business is, claims made reveals its secrets pretty quickly that will occur and it is a big company. We got a lot of opportunity in a lot of places. And in some of those areas, we're just not going to follow people off the cliff. It doesn't matter. Ryan Tunis : Got you. And a follow-up, just shifting gears. Just curious about priorities in U.S. personal lines. It kind of felt like you had the stuff in California a few years ago that in the past few years, it's sort of been more of a business where you've been focused more on risk selection and growth for good reason. But I mean it looks like it's more than $1 billion of underwriting earnings today. It looks a little underwritten. Just maybe if you could update us on -- yes, like what are the key sets of priorities in terms of managing that business right now? Evan G. Greenberg: Well, key sense of priorities, good question. On one hand, we can continue pushing the envelope and we're impatient about it. On the -- how we define the services and coverage is that a customer in our space are to expect from a great carrier. The kind of resiliency services and engineering services, the kinds of technology that we can use to interface with our customers, give them a better experience. How we can use technology and claims and manage a better and more seamless outcome for them. All of that is wrapped up in how we think about that part of the business. Our clients are CAT exposed. They were in a world where they choose to live where they live and know and make the choice to live where they're more CAT exposed. They will share more risk with us, but we can help them manage that risk on the portion that they share and as well reduce the exposure to loss on the portion we take. It also is allowing us, as we're doing that both through admitted and non-admitted to, in a sense, manufacture, more CAT capacity, which is really part of the ability or fuel to take on more exposure. We have a finite balance sheet. We can't take infinite risk. So we think about it in that regard. Our pricing and the rate against exposure from perils continues to improve. We can keep pushing the envelope on how granular we become in terms of risk rating, more cohorts of risk to apply rate and price against. And we're continuing to do that, but we're restless about that. We can be even better at it. That allows us to provide more coverage in areas, think about it, like flood, where we have areas where we're actually leaning in to offer more protection to clients, but be able to manage the portfolio. Maybe that gives you a few. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Brian Meredith : Evan, just curious, and I'm sure there's some moving parts here, but can you help me kind of square in North America commercial. I'm looking at gross written premiums up a little below 2% and then nets up 9.5%. And have seen your ceded premiums kind of continue to drop the last couple of quarters, is there something going on there? Is it technical? Are you buying less reinsurance? What's going on? Evan G. Greenberg: Yes. I'm going to let John Lupica give this -- it's really coming -- it came this quarter from 2 things. And that LPT, I forget had on an impact on and it distorted the gross in that. John Lupica : Yes, Brian, as Evan had noted, we had in that large structured transaction this quarter that produced net written premium with no gross written premium. In addition, we had exited 2 large MGAs or fronted programs that historically pursed a lot of gross with very little net. When you adjust for those 3 items, the gross and net are virtually identical. Evan G. Greenberg: That's really... John Lupica : That's the same answer on the net to gross ratio. Evan G. Greenberg: It's really transactional, not fundamental. Brian Meredith : Got you. No change in reinsurance by now, that makes sense. Evan G. Greenberg: I just see... Brian Meredith : Okay. Excellent. And then, Evan, I may have missed this, but you provided a lot of great kind of pricing rate and trend exposure commentary. But did you give us what the kind of total North America commercial pricing, call it, rate and trend was? And if not, could we get that, you typically provided it? Evan G. Greenberg: I did give it to you. Are you asking me to go back and do it again? Do you actually want me to look -- I'll give it to you if you want me to take my notes and do it [indiscernible]. Listen, North America, I said pricing increased 12.8% including in P&C, including rate of 9.4% and exposure change of 3.1%. Brian Meredith : Got you. And trend? Evan G. Greenberg: Loss cost. So we're trending short tail at 6.8% and long tail -- short -- sorry, overall loss cost 6.8%; short-tail, 5.3%; long tail, 7.6%. Yes, this is full service call. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Jian Huang : Hopefully, I'm not asking anyone to repeat anything. But just a quick question on the -- on your annual shareholder letter, right? You talked about the willingness to pull back on unprofitable lines a demonstration of underwriting discipline, which is kind of really curious as to how to square away that line of thinking with your first quarter results because it seems like the first quarter results continue to demonstrate a lot of strength, a lot of growth. Is the financial line somewhere you're looking at as a... Evan G. Greenberg: Hey, you're not listening. Not listening. Did you see that -- so I'm going to interrupt you. Are you really -- financial line, [ frank, ] number one. Number two, I said right upfront in major accounts in certain areas of casualty, where we're taking action. And we saw it last quarter, saw it this quarter and it impacts growth. And then there are other areas growing. Those are 2 that are visible. Jian Huang : No, that's... Evan G. Greenberg: By the way, look at our 20-year track record over any period of time, where we have shrunk our business, cut businesses in half over periods of time when we couldn't earn an underwriting profit and then triple the math to that. Do you have another question for me? Jian Huang : No, I think that's very helpful. Yes, it helps me contextualize things. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Robert Cox with Goldman Sachs. Robert Cox : A high-level question. So Chubb produced an 86% combined ratio, which has continued to improve and net investment income contributions to ROEs have gone up. I know there's more bifurcation than ever with respect to pricing adequacy by line of business. But I'm curious when do you think the market will sort of dictate the matching of rate and loss trend versus the excess margin you're generating now? Evan G. Greenberg: I'm not sure I understand your question. Sorry. Robert Cox : So I'm curious -- yes, I'm just curious when you think basically rate and loss trend will be at similar levels versus rate exceeding loss trend. Evan G. Greenberg: I have no idea. It depends on when the market -- and it will never really happen. But I'm seeing you're asking in a very theoretical way. There's something neat in what is a market, so it's always inherently messy. But when typically, when rate and price are adequate or in excess of what's required to earn a reasonable return then the market in time notices and responds and becomes more competitive. And at that time, rate and price stay steady with loss cost. And then the market begins to go soft. And when that part of the cycle happens, it means the rate on price are less than loss cost. And that is not terrible until rate and price versus loss cost is not enough to achieve a reasonable return on capital. Robert Cox : And maybe just a follow up on that. Curious if you think that with data and analytics, these cycles are becoming less volatile over time. Evan G. Greenberg: In some areas, yes. Some areas, absolutely not. Because the loss cost environment, which data and analytics cannot [Technical Difficulty] is not less volatile. When the loss cost environment is more specific i.e., loss cost inflation, then with data and analytics in steady periods like that, then the amplitude of cycles is different. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Jimmy Bhullar with JPMorgan. Jamminder Bhullar : I had a question on just your comments on dumb behavior and financial lines. I was wondering if you could talk about who it is that you're seeing being undisciplined. Is it companies that are established, that are large peers in the market? Or smaller competitors, new money that's come in, just some color on who's driving because it's been going on for a while, so. Evan G. Greenberg: Next question, Jimmy. Jamminder Bhullar : Not going to comment? All right. Evan G. Greenberg: No. Jamminder Bhullar : So -- and then on cash, there's been a lot of talk about post -- or pre-COVID, you're starting to emerge negatively and a few companies have seen post-COVID adverse development as well. So any comments you can make on your view of casualty reserves overall for the industry and for your own book? Evan G. Greenberg: We did expect a change of loss cost pattern frequency in particular. And we have talked about it during COVID that we didn't take the head fakes that loss costs during shutdown, obviously, courts are closed, frequency plummets and as does severity. And at that time, we maintained our view. We saw right through it and said, trends aren't changing, so we continue to trend. It's just a question of reporting on what period does it get reported in? So we expected that the trend doesn't change, but the reporting pattern changes. So therefore, if you really want to look at it in a correct way, you'd say, it went down during COVID to reaccelerate after COVID and then the expected cohorts of claims in aggregate still appear, and that's what we've seen. The pattern post COVID is not out of line with our expectations in our pricing and loss picks. Jamminder Bhullar : Okay. And just for Peter, what do you expect your tax -- do you expect a change in your tax rate next year given what's the changes in Bermuda? And to the extent you can quantify the expected tax rate. Peter Enns : For next year and after, it's just too early to say. There's too many moving parts in terms of how the different countries are going to adopt and we're looking at it closely, but it's just too early to say. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Cave Montazeri with Deutsche Bank. Cave Montazeri : There was nothing called out this quarter with regards to the Baltimore bridge losses? I appreciate it's early days, but is there any color worth sharing with us on this topic? Evan G. Greenberg: Our policy is, we do not report on individual claims, but I've noticed a lot of commentary on this. Look, it's a tragedy that an accident like this occurs, and it's done a lot of damage. However, when it comes to Chubb, it's another large loss. There is nothing -- yes, of course, we have exposure, but the exposure is within what we would contemplate and there's nothing outsize to us. And so another large unfortunate claim, that's all there is to it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan with Wells Fargo. Elyse Greenspan : My first question, Evan, I was hoping you could just provide some more color on what drove the sequential acceleration in exposure growth that you pointed to within Property Casualty as well as within workers' comp? Evan G. Greenberg: Well, what I said, Elyse, thank you, is the premium growth because we don't really disclose exposure, but the premium growth came from, a substantial portion of it came from rate and price, which were very healthy across the portfolio. Property grew nicely. Property was our biggest growth area. Casualty grew, particularly in our middle market area and E&S. And rate and price had a substantial contribution to the growth, though we also grew new business where pricing versus loss cost is healthy to us. Elyse Greenspan : And then my follow-up, you highlighted some planned reunderwriting within North America commercial. I believe you had also told us about that last quarter, and it sounds like we'll have that work through for the next couple of quarters. So is it right way to think about, I guess, the growth in North America commercial ex the LPT and just the reunderwriting as kind of the baseline of growth for the year. I know you don't like to guide, but you seem pretty positive about just casualty pricing and things like that, just trying to pull it all together. Evan G. Greenberg: I'm not going to help you with your worksheet, I'm sorry, Elyse. I don't guide. We don't guide growth for the year. What we did tell you is excluding the LPT, excluding the unusual size of the LPT because we have LPTs virtually every quarter. But excluding the unusual size of it, and what we view as the unusual, the onetime underwriting action in large account that I described, the net of that, we gave you a growth rate, and we said that's the underlying growth rate for that quarter. That is not -- we didn't say that's a run rate for the year. This is a diversified commercial and personal property casualty book of business. And you're hardly -- we don't give guidance on growth for the year. Operator : I will now turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Thank you.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Chubb Limited Second Quarter 2024 Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to our June 30, 2024, second quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic and market conditions, which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now, I'd like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer. Then, we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions are several members of our management team. And now, it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you saw from the numbers, we had another great quarter. We produced core operating EPS of $5.38, up 9.3%. Premium revenue growth reflects strong results in our businesses around the world. North America P&C, International P&C and Life Insurance demonstrates the broad-based diversified strength of our company. Our underwriting results were simply excellent. We published a combined ratio of 86.8%. We grew investment income more than 25%. Life segment income was up 8.7%, with International Life up double-digit. Core operating income for the quarter was $2.2 billion, bringing year-to-date operating earnings to $4.4 billion, up 13.5% and a record six-month result. P&C underwriting income in quarter of $1.4 billion was essentially flat as a result of higher cat losses globally. As you know, it was an active quarter for the industry. Our losses of $580 million compared with $400 million prior year, and they were in line with our modeled expectations, while last year's second quarter losses were light. On an ex-cat current accident year basis, underwriting income of $1.8 billion was up over 11% with a combined ratio of 83.2%, both were record underwriting results. Investment income topped $1.5 billion, up nearly 26% and a record as well. At June 30, our reinvestment rate is averaging 5.9% and our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9% versus 4.5% a year ago. Our liquidity is very strong, and investment income will continue to grow as we reinvest cash flows at higher rates. Our invested asset now stands at $141 billion and we expect it to continue growing. Life segment income of $276 million was right in line with our plan. Our annualized core operating ROE for the quarter was 13.3%, with a return on tangible equity of over 21%. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to other matters, growth, pricing and the rate environment. Consolidated net premiums for the company increased 11.8% in the quarter or 12.3% in constant dollars. We are a large diversified global insurer and our growth this quarter is again a reflection of who we are. Growth was broad-based geographically by product and customer segment, both commercial and consumer, from North America commercial to North America consumer, international commercial, Asia, Europe and Latin America to international consumer, particularly Asia and Latin America. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, overall conditions remain favorable in both property, which is naturally more competitive, and casualty, which is firming in those classes that require rate. Loss-cost inflation remains steady within what we have contemplated in our pricing and our reserving. Property has become more competitive as more capital is entered. Our book is well priced, and terms and conditions remain steady. Casualty is firming in the areas that need rate, and we see this trend in casualty enduring, and I'm going to give you some more color by division. So, let's start with North America. Premiums, excluding agriculture, were up 8% and consisted of 12.3% growth in personal lines and 6.7% growth in commercial, with all P&C lines, including comp, up 8.7%, and financial lines down about 3%. We wrote over $1.3 billion of new business, which is a record, and our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 90%, both speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 6.5%, with P&C up about 8% and financial lines down 2.5%. Our E&S business grew about 8.5%. Premiums in our middle market division increased about 7.5%, with P&C lines up almost 11% and financial lines down 4.5%. Again, the underwriting environment in North America is generally favorable and rational, financial lines aside. P&C pricing, excluding financial lines and comp, was up 8.3%, with rates up 5.5% and exposure change of 2.7%. Financial lines pricing was down 3.2%, with rates down about 3.5% and exposure up 0.3%. In workers' comp, which includes both primary and large account risk management comp, pricing was up 4.2%, with rates up 1.6% and exposure up 2.6%. And breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 5.3%, with rates up about 1.1% and exposure change of 4.2%. Large accounts shared and layered in E&S property pricing was flat to down, while in the middle market, rates continue to rise, about 7%. We are big in all three, and again all three are priced adequately. Casualty pricing in North America was up 11.7%, with rates up 9.9% and exposure up 1.6%. Loss-costs in North America remain stable, in line -- and in line with what we contemplate in our loss picks. Loss-costs for P&C, excluding financial lines and comp, are trending at 7.3%, with short-tail classes up 5.3%, and casualty, excluding comp, at 8.6%. We are trending our first dollar work comp book at 4.6%. As I said, when it comes to financial lines, the underwriting environment in a number of classes is simply not smart. We are trading growth for a reasonable underwriting margin. We are trending financial lines loss-costs at just over 5%. On the consumer side of North America, our high net-worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter, with premium growth of over 12%, including new business growth of 30%. Premium growth for our true high net-worth segments, the group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we are known, for grew 17%. These numbers are really impressive. When you consider our high net-worth personal lines division, it's almost a $7 billion business. Our homeowners pricing was up 14.6% in the quarter, while the loss-cost trend remains steady at 10.5%. Turning to our International General Insurance operations, net premiums were up over 16.5% in constant dollar. Our International commercial business grew nearly 14%, while consumer was up almost 21%. Asia Pacific led the way with premiums up 36%, and excluding China's contribution, premiums were up over 9%. Latin America had a strong quarter, with premiums up about 12%, and Europe retail grew over 9%, with the continent up 11%. 41% of our Overseas General division's premium is consumer, both A&H and personal lines, and it's growing at a good clip. In the quarter, premiums in our International A&H business were up over 10.5%, led by Asia Pacific and Europe. Our International personal lines business had another excellent quarter, with growth of 32%, led by Asia Pac and Latin America. We continue to achieve positive rate to exposure across our International commercial portfolio, with retail, property and casualty lines pricing up 6.1% and financial lines pricing down 4.1%. Loss-cost inflation across our International retail commercial portfolio is trending at 5.8% with P&C lines trending 6.1% and financial lines trending 4.8%. In our International Life Insurance business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums were up 31.7% in constant dollar. Excluding China, life premiums were up almost 10%. Depending on the country, growth was driven by tied agency, brokerage, bank assurance and direct marketing distribution channels. International Life earnings grew over 15% in the quarter in constant dollar. Lastly, Global Re had a strong quarter with premium growth exceeding 40% and a combined ratio of 72.7%. Growth was property-driven, both risk and cat. And in the quarter, we wrote more one-off structured transactions, which contributed to our growth. In summary, as you could see, we had a great quarter, and again, our results reflect the strength, the breadth and the depth globally of the company. We are confident in our ability to continue growing our operating earnings at a superior rate through P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and life income. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter and we're going to come back and take your questions. Peter Enns : Good morning. As you know, our balance sheet and overall financial position are very strong and just got stronger, benefiting from our first half results. Our underwriting and investment results continue to generate substantial capital and significant positive cash flow. Our book value reached over $61 billion or $151 per share, and adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter and through six months were $3.6 billion and a record $7.2 billion, respectively. We returned $939 million of capital to shareholders this quarter, including $570 million in share repurchases and $369 million in dividends, and $1.6 billion in total through six months. [indiscernible] tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.6% and 3.1%, respectively, for the quarter, and 4.9% and 6.1%, respectively, year-to-date, benefiting from core operating income partially offset by capital return to shareholders noted earlier. In addition, we closed on two small acquisitions this quarter Healthy Paws, a pet insurance business, and Catalyst Aviation, which together diluted tangible book value by about $300 million. Core operating ROE and return on tangible equity were 13.3% and 21.1%, respectively, for the quarter, and 13.6% and a record 21.6%, respectively, year-to-date. Turning to investments, our A-rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.56 billion, which included approximately $30 million of higher-than-normal income from private equity and other areas. We expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to average approximately $1.57 billion to $1.63 billion for the remainder of the year. Regarding underwriting results, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $580 million, which were principally from weather-related events, with 75% in the US and 25% internationally. Prior-period development in the quarter in our active companies was a positive $285 million pre-tax, with $144 million in North America Commercial, $64 million in North America Personal, $61 million in Overseas General and $16 million in Global Retail. The $285 million was split 35% long-tail lines predominantly in North America Commercial and 65% in short-tail lines. Our corporate run-off portfolio had adverse development of $93 million, mostly coming from molestations-related claims development. Our paid-to-incurred ratio for the quarter was 71% and 77% year-to-date. Our core effective tax rate was 18.8% for the quarter, which is within our guided range. We continue to expect our core effective tax rate to be within 18.75% to 19.25% for the remainder of this year. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. We'll be happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Michael Zaremski with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Michael Zaremski : Hey, guys. Good morning. Most of the focus, as you know, and you guys -- you gave good commentary, Evan, as you usually do on loss-cost trends. I'm trying my best to use the live transcript to true up some of the quarter-over-quarters, but I believe you made commentary about loss-cost trend in North America, specifically being stable and kind of in-line with your expectations, but I think you said there was a -- it was, excluding comp, in the 8%s, and I believe last quarter was in the 7%s. So just curious, is loss-cost trend changing a bit in terms of the trend line? Evan Greenberg : No, there wasn't a change of loss-cost, and frankly, it was 7.3%, is what I said for P&C lines, which excludes financial lines and comp. I think that's the way to look at it. And the 8% was pricing, was up 8.3%. Pricing exceeded loss-costs P&C lines. As we... Michael Zaremski : Would you say -- got it. Okay. Thanks for the clarification. So, just sticking with that and I guess this will just be my follow-up, there's a number of indices out there which kind of show that pricing in certain parts of the marketplace, even ex-financial lines are sub-6%, sub-5%. Would you say that -- I know you've talked about not accepting all business, that's not priced adequately. Would you say that Chubb's kind of in a doing that more so today in terms of kind of saying no to more business than it usually does in order to kind of make sure you're keeping pricing above loss-cost trend, whereas maybe others don't appear to be doing that when we see their trend lines on their loss ratios? Evan Greenberg : Well, I think I understood what you just said. Let me answer this. We wrote $1.3 billion of new business. That's a record. We grew in our P&C business 8% or so, and we gave comps separately, gave financial lines separate. The market overall, those numbers, as I said, I'm repeating myself, speak to the tone of the market, which is overall quite good. We published a combined ratio of 86.8% with higher cats and 83.2% current accident year combined ratio. I'm hardly wringing my hands. Our results are outstanding underwriting results. The pricing in the market is reasonably rational, financial lines aside to me. Good areas -- and we're only writing business where we can earn an underwriting profit, and in all classes, we strive to earn an underwriting profit that reflects a good return on capital that we're deploying against that line of business. In some classes, they're well priced and getting rate that equals loss-cost, brilliant. In some classes, there is pricing below loss-cost, because the margins are so decent. And in other classes and they're casualty-related, we're writing the business because we're getting rate while in excess of loss-cost as those lines approach their adequacy. I hope that answers your question. Michael Zaremski : Okay. It does. Appreciate it. Evan Greenberg : Then, if you look at something like financial lines, there is a glaring example hiding in plain sight that demonstrates we are shrinking when we can't earn an adequate return, which is what we have done consistently for 20 years. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Paul Newsome with Piper Sandler. Please go ahead. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Meredith : Thank you. Evan, I'm just curious... Evan Greenberg : Good morning, Brian. Brian Meredith : Hey, good morning. Given the good pricing you're still seeing in [casualty] (ph) lines right now, I'm just a little surprised that we aren't seeing more growth in that area from y'all. And, actually, if you just look at your pricing versus where the kind of premium growth was, it almost looks like you're shrinking a little bit on a absolute unit basis. Maybe correct me if there's something else going on that I'm just not seeing in the numbers. Evan Greenberg : No. We're growing property, and the unit count grew well. So, I don't -- and I don't know what -- we don't have any that reflects unit count. Brian Meredith : That was in casualty. Evan Greenberg : You can't see number of policies. And you're talking property, right? Brian Meredith : No. My apologies, I said casualty. I'm just looking at your commercial casualty numbers that you gave us. Apologies. Evan Greenberg : No, casualty is growing, and it's growing in the areas that we think we should be growing. And then, we have some areas, remember, in large account where we have been restructuring, in troubled classes and increasing retentions and we have accounts we've gotten off of or who have left us because of change of terms and all of that, it was worth about $50 million in the quarter. And that will run its string. It's particularly auto liability related. And -- but other than that, certain classes grew, some stayed flat, but overall casualty was up. Brian Meredith : Makes sense. Thank you. And then, Evan, just second question, and I appreciate all the color on loss trend and stuff, but given some of the uncertainty that others in the industry are talking about on what's going on in the social inflation environment, are you all kind of thinking about maybe or are adding some additional IBNR to perhaps loss picks and stuff, or are we not at that point of this right now? Evan Greenberg : That's a strange way of framing for me. You're either raising your loss pick, which is IBNR, it's IBNR in casualty, generally you're -- if it's on a more recent year, it's all IBNR. If it's case -- if it's due to case reserve on recent years, then hang on to your hat. And if you're -- whereas on older, older years, you could be raising your loss pick based on the actual incurred claim. So, to me, it's just simply another way of saying are you raising your loss picks on more recent years. We already have raised our loss picks. It's already been baked into our business as we've gone along, and we've raised our loss-cost trends and we take rate against loss-cost and on a written basis and then to earn through, we pick -- we've been picking higher loss ratios over the last few years. And that's just steady. We haven't adjusted our loss picks this year for what we see in loss-cost trends. The loss-cost trends, as I said, remain steady with what we have contemplated. Now, as you do reserve studies, there are individual classes where if you're taking reserve charge, you're taking reserve charge because that, by its nature, means you're raising the loss picks, which includes IBNR on a cohort of years. It may be that you're raising it just because of development you see on older years, it may be that you see that flowing through to more -- to change your view in more recent years and in which case you raise them, but that's study by study. I hope that answers your question. Brian Meredith : Yeah. It was very helpful. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Bob Huang with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead. Bob Huang : Hi, good morning. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Bob Huang : Yeah. Good morning. Just want to shift gears a little bit to personal line. You grew in pretty incredible 42% premium year-to-date. Can you maybe talk about the driver of this growth in North America personal? And also, how should we think about just the growth trajectory of this line going forward? I understand, obviously, homeowner and auto is going to be very different, but just curious your thoughts going forward. Evan Greenberg : Did you -- we did not grow North America personal lines 42% year-to-date, but we've grown it double-digit year-to-date. And so just -- so we level set between each other, the line is growing at a very healthy rate. And look, it's for -- there's a combination of reasons. It's broad-based growth. We're not growing simply in -- okay, cat-exposed stressed areas. We're growing where high net-worth customers have homes. And so that would of course have a strong cat-exposed element to it, but we're growing at a broad variety of geographies across the United States. We're getting improved rate to exposure. Our pricing -- and we've worked on it for years now, our ability to price the business is far more sophisticated and our by-peril pricing is very sophisticated. The services we provide and the richness of the coverage, if you are a customer whose profile meets our product, we're who you want, because the richness of the coverage and the way we administer it, that's what our brand is well known about. And there is a real increase in demand for Chubb. We are not the cheap guys on the street. And in fact, there are many who I personally will tell them, if you're looking for a cheaper price, let me give you the name of three other insurance companies. But no, they want Chubb and the renewal retention rate and the growth in new business, it's very gratifying that way. And we're improving our services and constantly improving our services and in the way we communicate with our customer. And that is in front of us. We can continue improving this and improve the -- which is the competitive profile of the product area. So -- and then, yes, in cat-exposed areas, we're getting well paid for the business we're writing. I don't mind saying we're reshaping and have been shaping in cat-exposed areas to a healthier portfolio in terms of the quality of risk and whether they're just given us cat business or they're giving us a broad base of business beyond cat exposure. And we're shaping that portfolio and getting priced reasonably for it and we're purchasing enough protection to protect the balance sheet as we grow accumulations. So, all in all, our personal lines business is in a very healthy place. Bob Huang : Great. Thank you. Yeah, the 42%, personal auto, I misspoke there. Yeah. So, the second question is, in the press release, you talked about, you're seeing a broad set of opportunities in accident and health and personal lines across the globe, right? Can you maybe expand on where you think that opportunity resides? It feels like your European business is doing well. Your Asia business is doing well. Is this globe -- are you referring to more broadly speaking, or is it more Southeast Asia, South Asia? Can you maybe give us a little bit more details there? Is it more organic, inorganic, things of that nature? Evan Greenberg : Love the question. Thank you. Okay. So, let's take accident and health. The combined insurance company in North America, which I'm going to start talking about more soon, but we've been a little quieter about it. It is growing at double-digits. It is a worksite voluntary benefits business and it is growing at a very healthy double-digit clip, and that is traditional -- our traditional accident and health. We're growing it for small-account companies and middle- and large-account companies, one through brokerage, one through agency. Our accident and health business in Asia Pacific has grown because we're the largest direct marketers of insurance in Asia for sure and maybe the world. It's over a $4.5 billion portfolio. And our direct marketed A&H business growing in Korea, growing through Southeast Asia is an excellent contributor. Our digital distributed consumer lines business, A&H and personal lines with over 200 digital platforms from the grabs of Southeast Asia to the new banks of Latin America for -- in what we call embedded or in path selling for accident and health and simple consumer products, think householders, think term life insurance, think device coverage for protecting devices, is growing at a -- that's our digital business, growing at a very healthy double-digit clip. Travel insurance in Asia growing well. In Europe, employer, employee and direct marketed A&H growing very well. I could go on and on, but that's a flavor of how it's -- maybe giving you a sense granularly of how it is across the globe. Bob Huang : Really appreciate that. So, I think we'll look forward to more commentary down the road about this. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Thanks for the questions. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead. Evan Greenberg : Good morning, David. David Motemaden : Good morning, Evan. I had a follow-up just on the North America P&C long-tail ex-comp... Evan Greenberg : Of course. David Motemaden : ...loss trend. It sounds like that increased about 1 point sequentially. Just wondering what you saw in the quarter. Evan Greenberg : No. It did not -- no. I'm going to cut you. It did not. It -- didn't it go ahead, Paul? Paul O'Connell: I think last quarter, we had given casualty number, which was 8.6% in comparison, that's standalone casualty number. The number you just cited was P&C ex-financial lines and ex-workers' comp, it didn't change that quarter. Evan Greenberg : Did you hear that explanation? Did it help you? David? David Motemaden : Yeah. I did. It was a little faint, but I think I got most of it. So, it just sounds... Evan Greenberg : No, you want to -- let's repeat it. Paul, go ahead. Paul O'Connell: The numbers didn't change sequentially. It might have been a different mix or different combination of product lines. So, the 7.3% that we cited was total ex-financial lines and ex-workers' compensation. Evan Greenberg : Which is -- which we think is the purest way for you to hear casualty. Paul O'Connell: Property and casualty. Evan Greenberg : Yeah, property and casualty. And then, we gave casualty separately, right? And the casualty separately hasn't changed. Paul O'Connell: No. Evan Greenberg : I mean, I'm looking at my Chief Actuary, so I'm scratching my head. We haven't changed it. David Motemaden : Got it. Okay. That's helpful clarification on that front. I guess, we've obviously heard a lot of noise this quarter from just across the industry on more recent accident year casualty reserves. Doesn't sound like there's been any big shifts in the claims environment just based on what you guys have done, but I'm wondering if you might just give some of your observations in terms of how we should be thinking about just the loss environment as the claims environment sort of normalizes following COVID. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. Look, let me observe this way to you. On the loss side of it, we have been talking for many quarters for years now about the inflation in the casualty loss-cost environment. I won't go into all the reasons, but the litigation. We have talked about the reasons and we have talked about some of the areas, whether it is excess casualty related, auto liability related. And that's just not new noise or new facts. That's been for a long time we've been talking. We've talked about how inflation in that area has accelerated over a period of time. We talked about how the court system was closed down and how you had to be careful in not taking the head fake and continuing to trend up. We've talked about how companies have managed this and some have been quicker, some have been slower to recognize development. Though everyone is in the boat of struggling to stay on top of it, some have reacted more quickly and their recognition in reserves and loss picks than others. So again, everyone struggles to stay on top. We've talked about how reinsurers are late -- are the latest to the party. And those who may not have as good a data set or be as activist and intrusive in how they use data and interpret it for management information, all of that rolls together to make the soup everyone is obsessed about at this moment about casualty, and I understand it. I say it that way, because when it comes to Chubb, we have almost $65 billion of loss reserves, very broad-based. We study them all on an annual basis, and we watch them all on a monthly and quarterly basis. There's always something developing well and something not developing as well as you imagine. It's never a precise science. On balance, our reserves are as strong. And frankly, we said this at December and I can tell you as of June 30, our loss reserves are stronger than they were in December in aggregate when we look at them today. And that is with staying on top of the positive development in casualty, i.e. comp and other areas and the negative development that is occurring in auto liability and access and umbrella, et cetera. David, I hope that's as much as I can say on the subject. David Motemaden : I really appreciate it. Thanks, Evan. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar with Jefferies. Please go ahead. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. I want to maybe take a broader view here, specifically on North America commercial. So, I think you've been running at a low 80%s underlying, combined mid-80%s reported in recent years, including year-to-date. That's a whopping improvement relative to where it's been historically, right, 5 points to 10 points better I think. So, how do you think about the balance of protecting these margins and risk-adjusted returns on the one hand and pursuing growth on the other in the context of maybe elevated market uncertainty, but these terrific margins? Evan Greenberg : Well, let's see. I think it speaks for itself. We grew at a pretty healthy clip when you look at it. Our middle market P&C business grew at 11%. Our E&S business grew at 8.7%. Our large-account business grew a little slower clip. Our financial line shrank, while P&C grew. I've gone through that where rates achieve a risk-adjusted return from everything we can tell, that we contemplate achieving, we're growing that business as fast as we can. Where it's not achieving it, we're striving to achieve it. Where we can't earn an underwriting profit, we're shrinking. Where it's adequate, we're growing as fast as we can. And we have the capital, the depth of balance sheet and an appetite and knowledge and geographic reach and the distribution brand, the underwriting capability to grow in those areas where we want to grow. And there are times we'll trade rate for growth and we'll -- there are times we'll trade growth for rate. We're doing both. And when it comes to the current accident year combined ratio, I've said before and I've written this, it's very interesting about the industry's current accident year combined ratio ex-cat. Property is a much larger part and a growing -- everybody is more cat-levered because of the changes in the [reinsurance] (ph) market, the rates and terms. And we take the cat loss out of the numerator, but in the denominator, we leave all the premium, that naturally drives down our current accident year combined ratio in mix of business all else being equal. So, it's -- I look -- that's a part and parcel of the published combined ratio, which is the primary number that everyone should look at. And the current accident year to look through volatility is a secondary indicator. And that's how I think of about. And I think what we published of an 86.8%, which has higher cat losses than prior quarter -- prior year's quarter because volatility in property is simply an outstanding number. I hope that answers your question. This is a company with big appetite and -- but a big appetite and an ambition to grow when we can earn a reasonable return. Yaron Kinar : Got it. And maybe to follow -- sorry, go ahead. Evan Greenberg : No, I'm done. Yaron Kinar : So, maybe to follow-up on that. So, in lines where you are getting rate in excess of trend, is it reasonable to think of an acceleration of growth in those -- premium growth in those lines? So essentially policies in-force increasing or accelerating at a faster pace? Evan Greenberg : There is. We've met -- you can't see it, and we're not going to disclose anything like that. But it is apparent to us, again, we wrote $1.3 billion of new business, a record. And we had a renewal retention rate policy cap of 90%. I rest my case. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Ward with Citi. Please go ahead. Mike Ward : Thank you. Good morning. I just -- I was wondering on the prior-period development, I don't think this has been asked, but I was hoping you could maybe break down the -- I think it was $144 million in North America commercial. Just sort of curious, if there were any notable movements within that, including long-tail casualty versus workers' comp? Evan Greenberg : Yeah, sure. We studied large-account comp this quarter, and we studied auto liability across the organization, large, medium, small, all added together. Among other casualty lines, that we studied a variety of GL, general liability-related ones, comp produced about $287 million release and the auto liability studies produced about $116 million of charge and not concentrated in any one year spread out. And that was the major piece. Mike Ward : Okay. That's really helpful. Thank you, Evan. And then maybe kind of on a similar theme, but I saw some media sort of reporting on, an executive that you hired specifically to handle inflated jury verdicts. Just wondering if you could expand on that role and how you expect the industry to actually... Evan Greenberg : Yeah. He's not going to handle inflated jury verdicts. That sounds like I hired somebody out of the mafia, because I don't know any other way except with a mask and a gun. But what he's -- what we're focused on is the litigation environment and what we can do to help galvanize and lead in that lead efforts among corporate America to pool our influence and our resources to impact the litigation environment, which is going to be impacted through the political arena and the regulatory arena. You going to get some laws changed, and it's a state by state when you get down to the critical issues, whether you're talking mass tort or you're talking individual large awards or you're talking litigation funding, any of that. And so, we're going to double down on focusing on that to work with corporate America that is waking up and becoming more energized about this. And I will in the future, I'm sure have more to say about it. And right now, we'll just go to work on it. Mike Ward : Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. So, you started to touch upon this in the last question, but I wanted to step back. In the last 90 days, it seems like there's been a flurry of announcements from the company on management changes and promotions. And I'm curious, Evan, if you could just step back, give us a snapshot of what's going on behind the curtain. Evan Greenberg : Sure. Behind the curtain? No curtain. What an energizing thing for this organization. These -- we have a very well-oiled and effective succession management and key employee process. We've been engaged in for over 18 years. And at my level, it involves keeping our eye on about 500 people across the company. The people who were promoted and the change of responsibilities is a reflection of that succession management process. This was -- these changes were planned over 18 months ago. The individuals, [John Keogh] (ph), and we had planned it. John Lupica, and we had planned for it. It's very orderly. It was individuals who've had long history with the company. They're of our culture. They have the talent, the capability to do more. The company, to state the obvious, look at the size and scale of it, it's growing. And therefore, the structure has to adapt and the talent that you put in place has to reflect the opportunity set and all of the dynamics around management of the organization that you need to address all at once. We have bigger strategic issues that have to do with opportunities and we just talked about litigation. These massive structural things in front of us that Chubb is a leader, as it has a responsibility and an opportunity, participate in, and we need leadership that can address that. All the day to day of our business and managing the day to day of our business grows more complicated and is more diverse. And so, part of my job is to reflect on all of that and to use the succession process we have that produces a deep, well-diversified bench of talent to match up against all of that. And that's what it reflects. And what's so great is everyone who was on that -- those announcements know each other well, have been together well for a long time, and it just -- it means the team just gets stronger. Gregory Peters : Great. I'm going to, for my follow-up question, get out of the North American commercial liability reserve sandbox and jump into the agricultural business. I was watching -- I think I checked... Evan Greenberg : I think we dug all for the sand out of that box. So, I'm like, I'm done, but go ahead. Gregory Peters : I figured. It's exhausting. Evan Greenberg : I'm so known for my patients. Gregory Peters : You handled yourself very well, so congratulations on that. For -- I checked the spot rate of a bushel of corn, looks like it's down, what, some 30% year-over-year. So, not that that's an arbiter of the outlook for your agricultural business, but maybe if you could give us an update on how this year looks to be shaping up? Obviously, I know the harvest season is still emerging, but any color there would be helpful. Evan Greenberg : Yeah. I'm going to be very careful because I'm not going to jinx myself in the middle of the game. But where we have concentration of exposure, it is a very good growing season so far, particularly for corn and soybean. We have a well-diversified book. We're heavier, and we've always been west of the Mississippi, but in a very broad swath of geography, Midwest, upper Midwest, in particular. And the growing conditions are very good. When you see spot markets at this moment and it just -- it's not something to obsess about or look at really because it reflects what people were imagining. It's a speculative class and they're imagining what the -- what's the government going to say about growing and they're all out there looking at the years of corn on -- counting the years on stocks right now. And that's what's driving price at the moment. We'll see how it pans out, but right now, it's shaping up well. Gregory Peters : Got it. Thanks for the answers. Evan Greenberg : John, you wanted to say something about base price? Unidentified Company Representative : Yeah. Just you noted a spot price below last year, but I think the more important number is what the base price was and it's only off 10% from base price, which is a good spot for us right now. Evan Greenberg : Yeah, which was in within a lot of the deductible. Frankly, if you -- and is a little outside deductible averages, but, look, who knows, we'll see. Gregory Peters : Thank you. Operator : I'll now turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for closing remarks. Please go ahead. Karen Beyer : Thanks, everyone, for joining us today. If you have any follow-up questions, we'll be around to take your calls. Enjoy the day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's call. Thank you all for joining, and you may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen Beyer : Thank you and welcome everyone to our September 30, 2024 third quarter earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities and economic market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement which are available on our website@investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most direct comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings Press release and financial supplements. Now I'd like to introduce our speakers. First we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we'll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions today are several members of our management team and now it's my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. As you've seen, we had another really great quarter with strong double digit growth in both P&C underwriting and investment income leading to core operating EPS growth of over 15.5%. Global P&C premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, grew 7.6% or 8.5% in constant dollars, which is the clearer way to view intrinsic growth and once again reflected the broad and diversified nature of our company and the opportunities we're capitalizing on around the world with strong contributions from our North America P&C International, P&C and life insurance businesses. Core operating income for the quarter was $2.3 billion, up 14.3%. Earnings for the year are currently at record levels with net and operating income up 16.9% and 13.8% respectively. The three sources of earnings growth, P&C underwriting, investment income and life income each delivered a strong result. Our published combined ratio for the quarter was 87.7% with P&C underwriting income of 1.5 billion up over 11.5% despite an active quarter for the industry globally in terms of natural catastrophes, hurricanes, floods, fires, tornadoes and other severe convective storm activity. On an ex-cat current accident year basis, a secondary measure of underwriting, we produced record underwriting income of $2 billion up 11.5% with a combined ratio of 83.4%. For the year, we have produced record underwriting income on both a published and current accident year basis. As a company in the business of risk, we pride ourselves on being world class underwriters. It's who we are. We're also asset managers with an excellent long-term record of invested asset allocation and risk adjusted returns. Our invested asset now stands at 151 billion and it will continue to grow as a consequence of our basic business of insurance. For the quarter, adjusted net investment income topped 1.6 billion up 15.9%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 4.9 versus 4.7 a year ago and our current new money rate is averaging 5.5%. In our judgment, given the broad based health of the U.S. economy and the pattern of inflation when one reads past the headlines, the Fed will likely take a reasonably cautious approach to lowering rates. Given the size and continued growth of our federal deficit, which is simply unsustainable, we believe the yield curve will steepen and that too will support our future reinvestment rate. We remain confident in our ability to reinvest our cash flows at rates that will continue to accrete to the overall portfolio yield. Life insurance segment income of $284 million was ahead of plan and while you know it's our policy to generally refrain from guidance, we are well on pace to exceed our life division income target of a billion for the year. Our annualized core operating ROE for the quarter was 13.9% with a return on tangible equity of 21.7. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment, Global P&C net premiums, which excludes agriculture increased 7.6 in the quarter were again 8.5 in constant dollar with commercial premiums up 8.1% and consumer up 9.4%. Again, growth was global and broad based geographically by product and customer segment. North America, Europe, Asia and Latin America all contributed favorably. Life premiums grew 10.6% in constant dollar with growth of 10 in international life and 15 in combined North America. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market trends were consistent with those of the previous quarter. Overall conditions are favorable in both property which is incrementally more competitive in certain areas and casualty which is incrementally firmer. Loss cost inflation remains steady and within what we have contemplated in our pricing and reserving pricing for both remains ahead of loss costs. Property has become more competitive in the large account and EMS segments while middle market property pricing was in fact up over prior quarter are large in all three segments of the market. Our property book is well priced and terms and conditions remain steady. As with prior quarter casualty is firming in the areas that need rate and we see this trend in casualty enduring. Overall, our casualty rate and price were up over prior quarter. Let me give you a little more color by division. Beginning with North America premiums excluding agriculture were up 7.8% and consisted of 10% growth in personal insurance and 7.2 in commercial with P&C lines up nearly 10% and financial lines down about 5%. We wrote more than $1.2 billion of new business up over 18% versus prior year and our renewal retention rate on a policy count basis is 89.6%. Again, both speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market, the power of Chubb and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major accounts and specialty division increased 7.2 with P&C up 9.5% and financial lines down over 6%. Within major and specialty, our E&S business grew 11% with strong contributions for both property and casualty related lines. Premium in our middle market division increased just under 7% with P&C up 10.7% and financial lines down 5.7. Again, the underwriting environment in North America is generally favorable and rational. Financial lines aside, pricing for property and casualty excluding financial lines and workers comp was up 9.9% with rates up 8% and exposure change of 1.8 again with both rates and pricing up from second quarter. Financial alliance pricing was down 3.2% with rates down about 3.4%. In workers comp which includes both primary and large account risk management pricing was up 4.2% with rates up 1.4 and exposure up 2.8. Breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 6.7% with rate of 3.7% and exposure change of 2.9%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.7% well in excess of loss costs with rates up 11.9% and exposure 0.7%. Our loss cost in North America again remains stable, no change and in line with what we contemplate in our loss events. In agriculture, where we are the market leader, we gained increased market share and wrote more policies insuring more farmers and fields. Though premiums were down from prior year primarily due to lower commodity prices than last year. Commodity prices are used to price the premiums we charge farmers. Far more importantly, our crop underwriting results this quarter were excellent and from everything we know now, 24 is shaping up to be a very good underwriting year. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter with premium growth of 10% including new business growth exceeding 25%. Premium growth for our true high net worth segments, the group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we're known for was 16.8%. Our homeowners pricing was up 13.7% in the quarter and ahead of loss cost trend which remained steady. Turning to our international general insurance operations, it was a decent quarter. Net Premiums were up 4.9% or 7.5% in constant dollars. Our international commercial business grew 6.7% while consumer was up 8.5%. Asia Pacific led the way with premiums up 9.2%. Latin America grew over 7.5% while Europe grew over 7% with the continent of Europe up 8.7%. Premiums in our international retail commercial P&C business were 6.5% in constant dollar. P&C lines were up almost 11% and financial lines were down 10%. It is worth noting adjusting for a one time premium benefit we received in the third quarter of last year underlying growth was over 14% in P&C lines internationally with financial lines down 3.8%. We continue to achieve positive rate to exposure across our international retail commercial portfolio with P&C lines pricing up 6.3% and financial lines pricing down 3.5%. Premiums in our international wholesale business grew about 8% in constant dollar. As is typical, the London wholesale market is growing more competitive and frankly for me is exhibiting classic London underwriter and broker behavior. Generally speaking, underwriting prosperity likely won't endure over time and London will underperform in due course. Except for those few real underwriters who know how to manage what is simply a trade. I have seen this movie many times. Our international personal lines business had an excellent quarter with growth of 12.7% led by Asia Pacific and Latin America. And our global reinsurance business had a strong quarter. Premiums were up about 35%. We had a combined ratio of 94.4% which included a more active cat loss quarter. Again, in our international life insurance business which is fundamentally Asia, premiums and deposits were up about 21% in constant dollar. International life earnings grew over 9% in the quarter in constant dollar. So that's a lot of news and in summary we had another excellent quarter and having a record earnings year. While we're in the risk business and volatility is a natural feature, we are very confident in our ability to continue growing our operating earnings and EPS at a superior rate. P&C revenue growth and underwriting margins, investment income and life income. I'm going to turn the call over to Peter and then we're going to come back and take your question. Peter Enns : Good morning. As you have just heard from Evan, despite an elevated level of industry wide cats, we had another strong quarter that generated adjusted operating cash flow for the quarter and through nine months of $4.6 billion and a record $11.7 billion respectively. Our results further strengthened our overall financial position, ending the quarter with all-time highs in book value of nearly $66 billion and invested assets of $151 billion. On July 31st we issued $700 million of 5 year debt and $600 million of 10 year debt at an attractive weighted average cost of under 5%. The proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes including a repayment of 700 million of euro denominated debt due in December. We returned $782 million of capital to capital shareholders this quarter including $413 million in share repurchases and $369 million in dividends and $2.4 billion in total. Through nine months, book and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI increased 2.7% and 4.3% respectively for the quarter and 7.7% and 10.6% respectively year-to-date benefiting from core operating income partially offset by the capital returned to shareholders. Core operating ROE and return on tangible equity were 13.6% and a record 21.5% respectively year-to-date. Turning to investments, our A rated portfolio produced adjusted net investment income of $1.64 billion which included approximately $40 million of higher than normal income from private equity. Regarding underwriting results, the quarter included pretax catastrophe losses of $765 million of which $250 million was related to Hurricane Helene and the balance principally from weather related events split 70% in the U.S. and 30% internationally. Prior period development in the quarter interactive companies was a favorable $299 million pretax with favorable development of $358 million in short tail lines primarily from property and $59 million of unfavorable development in long tail lines which was primarily from general casualty. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $55 million primarily environmental liability related. Our paid to incurred ratio for the quarter and the year was 77%. Our core effective tax rate was 17.7% for the quarter which is below our previously guided range due to shifts in the mix of income as well as certain discrete tax benefits recorded in the quarter. We expect our fourth quarter core effective tax rate to now be between 19% and 19.25% [ph] with the full year between 18% and 18.25% [ph]. We expect to provide guidance on the 2025 tax rate as part of our fourth quarter earnings at the end of January. I'll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. And at this point we're happy to take your questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Bob Huang from Morgan Stanley. Your line is open. Bob Huang : Good morning. So first question is on the North America commercial. I think if we like you said before, right. Pricing, Ex Financial Alliance, Ex Workers comp continue to be very strong over the last few quarters and you had really incredible margins in this business. Just given the pricing and the growth, should we expect growth to accelerate from here or how should we think about growth in this business? Ex Financial Alliance, Ex Workers comp going forward? Evan Greenberg : Yes. First of all, we don't give forward guidance, as you know. So I'm not going to answer that in a specific way. You see the amount of new business we run, you see our retention rate. You see we're in a healthy market and we're in an underwriter's market. Risk selection, structure of risk, how you structure it and pricing matter. All underwriters aren't created equal. So we compete for business. And some areas of business have become more competitive, naturally. Speaking to property, I'm confident when I look forward at Chubb's ability to continue to grow above trend, when I look at longer term trend and as I look forward over a period of time, and I'll leave it at that. Bob Huang : Great, thank you. Second question is on the international business. Apology in advance if I misinterpreted your commentary, but it sounded like what you're saying is that in London there could be more competition. Does that imply that a lot of the international growth going forward will be driven by Asia and elsewhere? If that is the case, does the upcoming election potentially have an impact on the growth in that area? Evan Greenberg : Wow. First of all, our London wholesale business is proportionately is not the overwhelming part of our international business. It's about 10%. And so put that in perspective, 90% is our global retail international Europe grew eight and a half. Latin America grew seven and a half. Asia grew in the nines. So it's that vast territory. And then the U.K. itself rose well, and then which is U.K. retail, which is a big business. And then you have the London wholesale market, where business comes to London to get placed. And that's what my comment was referring to. The classic London market competition that I just thought I would call out because you start to see the behavior that is classic of London. The election, I'm not sure how you linked it to the election and the election outcome. You'd have to enlighten me, but does that help you? Bob Huang : Okay. No, no, I think it does. Really appreciate the U.K. comments there. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. I feel good about our international growth capabilities. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS Financial. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. Evan I'm just curious, given the hurricane activity we've seen in the elevated call it cat losses, what are you seeing in the property lines, right now? What's your expectations if we go into 1 :1 renewals both on the primary and reinsured side? Evan Greenberg : Yes, on the primary side in the middle market, small commercial, which is really the vast majority of business in insurance in North America. Overall when you look at the industry, pricing remains firm and prices continue to go up and it's both hurricane and active SCS activity, modeled, non-modeled loss and the market needs the price and it continues to move in that direction. Would you get to shared and layered particularly whether it's large account or it's E&S related. That's where there is more -- the business is well priced but there is rate pressure. Rates are coming down though they remain at good levels and because there's more capital that's entered the market, more competition and again in particular I call out London behavior that is almost aberrant relative to everybody else. But it remains a robust market. Brian Meredith : Great, thank you. And my second question Peter, you mentioned there was 59 million of call it general casualty adverse development in North America. What accident years was that coming from? And maybe break it down a little more. Was it GL commercial auto? What's driving some of that development? Peter Enns : Yes, it was 19 to 22 years and it was in the general casualty areas, the negative and look, we do a lot of studies in the third quarter of casualty in the U.S. and it was. There were puts and calls so that you really have a clearer view of it. There were a number of long tail classes in the quarter that had positive results and then there was in particular excess casualty that produced a negative result. So it's a, it's a kind of a mixed bag. It's not all in one direction and that is what all added up to the North America casualty reserve charge which was... Brian Meredith : Thanks, I appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from a line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Thanks. Good morning Evan. I think you know over the last several quarters you guys had called out some troubled classes in North America commercial that you guys were reworking. I think it was a $50 million drag last quarter. I know there was also some of that in 4Q23. Is that largely behind you at this point? Aside from just sort of the normal course managing the book where we should see continued acceleration in some of those commercial casualty lines. Evan Greenberg : We have another quarter or two to go before we finish. We began fourth quarter last year in most of it. We have a part of it that we began really in first quarter. So we have, we had about another 50 or so million this quarter, and it'll continue into fourth and a little bit into first. But, in the grand scheme of the total premiums we write, it's just not that significant. And remember, it's not. It's a combination of, whether some business moves to others who just don't get it. But a lot of it is due to how we change terms and attempts. This is large account related comments. And then of course the excess areas are getting a lot of rate that help to ameliorate. So maybe that helps you with it. David Motemaden : Yes, thanks. That's, that's helpful. Evan Greenberg : When you look at the broad nature of our business, I mean, let's just keep a perspective. We write 20 some odd billion of net premiums in North America. Personal lines is about 7 of that. So all the rest is commercial. Massive number two middle market player, a large E&S player, major agricultural writer, large major account writer. And so when you start hearing numbers like, that we're talking about this area in large account casualty, well, it's not unimportant relative to the business keep perspective. It's small. David Motemaden : Right. No, that's fair. And I see the rate is also accelerating there in casualty, so that's good to see as well. Maybe just moving on the property side. The catastrophe losses over the last several years and in the third quarter, this third quarter, were definitely surprisingly low just given the mix shift to property that you guys have had over the last several years. I guess I'm wondering if just from your perspective, is this third quarter sort of in line with sort of a normal third quarter that you would expect? And I guess as you think about the mix of property and casualty business, is this sort of -- are you still comfortable shifting more to property? Or is that something where, just given the market dynamics, it should stabilize at this point? Evan Greenberg : Yes, the cat losses were a bit lower in the quarter than we would have modeled than our modeling that we contemplated pricing would have produced. So in our annual expected, that to me is just lost volatility. We're in a business that in a risk business there's volatility and there's two sides to the volatility. There's a favorable side and an unfavorable side. Because your average expected loss that you divide into four quarters is just an average. It's just that. And it contemplates all return periods in the loss and in the pricing. So you know, that makes sense to me that I'd see volatility. You're not going to hit the number. You're either up or down from it. And number one, number two, we have, we have a lot of capital flexibility. I think we're good underwriters of the business. So our risk selection and portfolio construction and ensuring we have good pricing I think contributes to Chubb's overall results in a major way versus the industry. And we're going to write the business whether it is property or casualty. We have an appetite for the volatility. We are going to write the business wherever it is. If we understand it, we can price it, structure it and assume. And so we're continuing to lean into property, we're continuing to lean into cash and personal lines and all other areas where we see there is growth potential. And frankly, the most frustrating thing inside our own organization, we can't get after opportunity fast enough and execute efficiently enough for our own appetite and expectations. David Motemaden : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you. Good morning. And maybe just continuing on the previous questions. So when we look at North America casualty, it is where you're getting the most rate, I think based on the data I quickly charted jot down and definitely exceeding loss trend. But that's also where the exposure growth has been less pronounced. I'm guessing that's because of the work you're doing on fixing the trouble classes that you referenced. So without asking for guidance here, but just based on the data, is it fair to think of a growing appetite for casualty coming through in results as the troubled lines are fixed? Evan Greenberg : I don't know where you're getting that picture, but I can tell you that our casualty lines are actually growing quickly. And I'm not going to give you a breakdown, but our casualty lines are actually growing quickly. And in North America, in the areas where we see decent pricing and I don't see much of an overhang of $50 billion, hardly much of an overhang. So I can't agree with you. Your line of logic and I have to leave you to think your own thoughts. Yaron Kinar : I'm just referencing the exposure growth of 70 basis points you called out in casualty pricing in North America. Evan Greenberg : No, you're missing it. That's not growth in premium. That's okay. I have a store, My store sold more goods this year than last year. It sold 1% more in goods. My theater sold 1% more tickets than last year. That's exposure growth and we rate off of that. That's how you get to price. You're confusing price and rate with growth in premium. Two different things. My unit growth of number of customers I wrote is totally different. Yaron, you got to go. Just learn those basics. Sorry. Yaron Kinar : Okay. All right. And then in the London behavior that you have referenced, is that the competitive nature true in both casualty and property? Evan Greenberg : Yes, across the board. Yaron Kinar : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Gregory Peters : Good morning, everyone. Evan, for my first question, I want to go back to your comments around the life insurance business. As you pointed out, you rarely give forward guidance, so this is somewhat of a departure. Looking some of the statistics with the growth and constant dollars and the growth in deposit assets, just curious why we're not seeing that translate to more income growth. Is there something going on inside there other than currency or just some clarification on that would be helpful. Peter Enns : Hey, it's Peter, Greg. The top line growth on total Life and on international as you know and as I said was around 10% the income growth in international was just over 9% so pretty much tracking. The combined insurance business in the last half of last year, I called out in the fourth quarterly earnings call had a bit of a non-recurring or oversized item, so if you back that out the growth rate would be relatively consistent for all of life with International. Gregory Peters : Great thanks for the reminder on that. Appreciate that. The second question I had was on capital. Noted your comments around dividends and share repurchase in the third quarter. The results of your company are outstanding. The free cash flow is really strong. Curious if you have any changed view on share repurchase versus shared special dividends as the stock price appreciates or given the results if there's any change on your views on capital management. Evan Greenberg : No it's steady as she does. We're returning a healthy amount of capital to shareholders and the balance of capital that we hold, we can put to work at good risk adjusted returns that well exceed our cost of capital. And we're -- that's the balance. Gregory Peters : Fair enough. Thanks for your time. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ryan Tunis from Autonomous Research. Your line is open. Ryan Tunis : Hey, thanks. Good morning, Evan. I guess on your comments about competition in London wholesale, typical behavior there. I guess my concern, maybe you can talk me off the ledge on this a bit, but to me that market is London wholesale is pretty intertwined. When I hear commentary like that, I start wondering a little bit about like what might be coming next. I mean, is that a fair concern or when you say that, are you really just honing in on just strictly London? Evan Greenberg : No, I think it's, I'm saying it particularly about London. And look, the business in London, overall the market is profitable. But my real point was the kind of behavior I'm seeing them exhibit, the way they're trying to attract more capital to a finite amount of business. The behavior of the capital as I look at it and the guises that it's in it just sets the table for the same movie I've watched that will occur over a number of years many times. And they just can't ultimately stand prosperity. And so I'm just calling it out because I'm seeing it or I'm seeing it begin and it is peculiar in particular to the London. Ryan Tunis : Got it. And then I guess just a follow up thinking about international life. So it took more than a decade to get to a billion dollars of premium. Any, any, any suggestion you want to give us on how long it's going to take to get the next billion of operating earnings there? Evan Greenberg : In Life International? In International, I think it's Life. Did you say international Life, Ryan? Ryan Tunis : I did, yes. Evan Greenberg : Yes, stay tuned, buddy. It ain't going to take a decade. Ryan Tunis : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking the question. First one I had for you is just on the casualty pricing dynamics we're seeing in the market. I mean, on one hand we're seeing some unfavorable here or there in some of these specific product lines like excess liability and so forth. But overall profitability seems pretty good when we look at overall ROEs across many of these businesses. And I just wanted to get your thoughts on price adequacy in general across some of those casualty lines and how much need is there for the industry in your view to keep pushing price and casualty. Evan Greenberg : Yes, there is no general statement. It varies by area of casualty by customer, cohort by geography. There is no simple and that's why it's always an underwriter's market and you got to have the data, you got to have the experience and then you got to have the command and control to actually put them to work, and you got to have the analytics and actuarial to back it up. So there is no general statement that could put casualty which is a massive class of insurance in a neat box and on a bumper sticker. Alex Scott : Understood. And sorry for the more broad based question it's just something I grapple with. Looking at the specific products versus like the overall profitability of companies. I honestly, I give it I'd help you out and give it to you. Understood. Next one I have is just on the asset base I guess is we're seeing I guess lower paid claims relative to incurred sort of an elongation of the claim cycle and casualty we're seeing asset bases kind of grow more than they otherwise would, which the good part about that is you get more net investment income potentially. I mean how should we think about the growth in the asset base? Evan Greenberg : I think you just said something that you're going to have to think about how you connected those dots. You just said elongated payout pattern. And I don't relate to an elongated payout pattern. I do relate to strength of reserves that all things being equal paid to incurred can point to. And I do understand growth in business and in longer tail areas and mix in that regard. But I don't relate to a notion of elongated payout pattern generally speaking. And I don't know, I got the data, at least when it comes to Chubb. Alex Scott : Can I. I mean the invested asset base growing at a pretty strong clip. I mean what's the underlying driver? Evan Greenberg : Our business has been growing. And our margins have been good, and so our invested asset base, yes, continues to grow and our capital has been growing and that invested asset is a source of income and at superior returns on a risk adjusted well in excess of cost of capital. So that is a source of strength for the company. And we will continue to grow the invested asset on purpose and we will continue to focus on returns within that portfolio as a good asset allocator would, which is my earlier comments about us as an asset manager. We're a manager of capital and claim reserves. That's third party and that will continue to grow. Alex Scott : Thanks very much. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Hey, good morning. Just thinking about the financial lines where premium was down 6.2% and I think you highlighted rate off low single digit but you still generated about a billion and a quarter of premium. So I'm wondering how much of that was D&O? Can you still make money in D&O and just how are you thinking about the outlook there? Evan Greenberg : I'm not going to give you a breakdown of how much was D&O, that's proprietary. But I am, what I will tell you is we're not writing the business if we can't make money, and we have a very large installed customer base. We have a long storied reputation in G&O and financial lines. We're a major brand in it. And when they're looking for someone to write their primary that is manage their risk, more often than not they want Chubb on that and the competition then is more in the excess layers. And yes, we're writing D&O because where we are, we're making. Andrew Kligerman : That makes a lot of sense. And then just maybe to kind of follow on that London movie commentary that you gave. You're doing such exceptional underlying combined 80.8 in North America, 84.8. And overseas, Evan, could you see an environment where, it just gets more competitive globally and these excellent, these exceptional combines maybe erode a little bit. You still do great. But it's five years into the hard market already. Didn't we see? Evan Greenberg : Here's what you're missing. You're looking at it on an ex-cat basis. When everyone is cat levered, look at published bind ratios. That's what tells you you can't chuck out the losses and leave the premium in the denominator. I reject that discussion because that's just not, that's just not understanding risk. And so what those ex cat look like and then ask yourself in and you have to do the work. But when you look at various companies, you look at various markets, you got to understand how much is cat levered, how much is not cat levered to get a real the health. And then that's why I continue to say published combined ratio is your most important indicator. And then after that a secondary indicator, all things being equal, is ex-cat. It tells you some things. But don't over read it. Andrew Kligerman : So what I'm right, so what I should just simply read in is that the combines on an absolute basis are still very high for the industry and the outlook is good for Chubb. Evan Greenberg : They're good. They're delivering good returns for the industry overall. And it varies by company. Some companies it's delivering good returns, some it's not. They're decent. There's not a lot of room to move. If you're thinking about pricing adequacy, it's not like industry ROEs are off the charts. They're decent, they're good on a risk adjusted basis. And then loss trend is relentless. Every year you have loss trend. See, you can't just stand still just to stay where you are. You got to get rate or price. Andrew Kligerman : Makes a lot of sense. Evan Greenberg : You got it, buddy. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, you guys said right there was 59 million of I guess strengthening on long tail reserves. I know in response to an earlier question there were some pushes and polls. Can you guys give us a sense of, what was released in workers comp versus what was added to excess casualty in the quarter? Evan Greenberg : No, we've given. I gave as much color around that there was in long tail, there was both positive and negative and negative was more excess related. And beyond that we're not giving detail. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thanks. And then you guys typically provide an investment income guide. I don't think that was given this quarter. Any color you can provide there just relative to, fourth quarter and forward. Evan Greenberg : Yes, Elyse, and last quarter I gave last six months guidance. So what I would say for the fourth quarter is we will be at the high end of that guidance for the fourth quarter on a recurring basis. Obviously there's things that are harder to predict. Like I spiked out the 40 million in the third quarter that was higher than normal on PE. But I'd say the high end of the guidance rate guidance level on a recurring basis for the fourth quarter. Elyse Greenspan : And then on tax you said you would give us right next year with Q4, but given, just Bermuda tax changes going into effect, just directionally, would that imply you guys would think the tax rate would be higher next year relative to this year's guide? Evan Greenberg : We typically give the full year guidance in the fourth quarter. That's as far as we go. There is uncertainty, so we're not giving any more specific. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from a line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thanks. If I can go back to the division of pricing to rate and exposure unit, to the extent that more of pricing is coming from rate rather than exposed units, does that have implications for loss ratio progress? Evan Greenberg : Does it, what? Meyer Shields : Does that have? Well, if more of pricing comes from rate than exposure units, does that imply a difference in terms of how when these premiums are earned, the loss ratio will move. Evan Greenberg : No, no, not at all. Look, be careful. I didn't say exposure. Maybe we're using different terms. An exposure unit to me would be that I wrote more policies, I took more insureds. That doesn't go into price. We're only talking rate and price times exposure. And so we have rate and then we have a certain kind of exposure that equals price. And you apply it against units of exposure which is insured. And so the exposure part of price is just like rate. It acts like rate. The portion of it that we count, and that has nothing to do with it all earns exactly the same way. Meyer Shields : Okay. Evan Greenberg : Because driving both premium. And if it's an annual policy, it's earned 1/12 a month. One, three. Meyer Shields : No, I think I understand that. Yes. I apologize for the terminology issue. Second question, though to the extent that that component of pricing is slowing down, to the extent that that reflects maybe slowing economic growth, does that itself have implications for underwriting profitability? Evan Greenberg : Not that we. No, not as we see it, no, not all things. And that's a whole different theoretical discussion that depends on the line of business, what we're talking about, so, Oh my God, no. If you want to sit in and have a gestalt [ph] discussion about that sometime, Meyer, I'll do. Meyer Shields : All right, I'll bring the herring. Evan Greenberg : No, no, only in sour cream sauce. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open. Michael Zaremski : Hey, good morning. So just kind of back to the casualty competitive marketplace. So casualty pricing has accelerated in recent quarters to approximately 12%. And as you state too, that's well above what most companies publicly stated their loss cost assumption. I guess I'm just trying to understand why pricing would be accelerating all the way up to 12, especially in today's higher interest rate environment, which is good for long tail lines. If loss costs are indeed below, then well below that number. Evan Greenberg : Yes, so. Yes. So what I've been clear about, and that you're trying to be too simplistic, there are many cohorts of casualty, the majority significant. The vast majority of our portfolio is adequately priced. There are areas where price has had to accelerate to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return. It's those everyone's book of casualty is different. And our portfolio of casualty has produced these kinds of rate increases which were made up of just to keep pace with loss costs where we are adequately priced and greater levels of rate increase where we're pushing to achieve price adequacy and it all mixes together. And by the way, what's producing outstanding combined ratios. And that's as far as I can take it. Michael Zaremski : Okay. Okay, that's understood. Maybe just switching gears. Lastly, since you were willing to offer some color on your guidance on life insurance. So if the target this year was I guess a billion or so. Evan Greenberg : No, Mike, it's not going to happen. I'm not giving you forward guidance. The only thing I was doing is because it was a year where it's the first year and I was just doing it for all of you because this was our first year where you didn't have noise of acquisitions and that in it. And you're trying to get it. Where are we relative to where we think we should be? That was why I gave a comment about the 2024 full year where our own target was, I just said in excess of $1 billion for operating income and that we are well on track to achieve that or exceed that. And that it was just to give you guys a sort of a landing place and then from there we don't get forward. Michael Zaremski : Okay, got it because last year was over a billion. But yes, there was definitely some noise and obviously earnings there have been great. So, okay. Thank you for taking my questions. Evan Greenberg : You're welcome. But by the way, it's a growth area. Michael Zaremski : Thanks. Karen Beyer : Thank you everyone for joining us today. If you have any follow up questions, we'll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day. Thanks. Operator : This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question and answer session. If you would like to ask a question at that time, simply press star followed by the number one on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question, again press the star, one. Thank you. I\u2019d now like to turn the call over to Karen Beyer, Senior Vice President, Investor Relations. You may begin. Karen Beyer : Thank you and welcome to our December 31, 2024 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. Our report today will contain forward-looking statements, including statements relating to company performance, pricing and business mix, growth opportunities, and economic and market conditions which are subject to risks and uncertainties, and actual results may differ materially. Please see our recent SEC filings, earnings release and financial supplement, which are available on our website at investors.chubb.com for more information on factors that could affect these matters. We will also refer today to non-GAAP financial measures, reconciliations of which to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and related details are provided in our earnings press release and financial supplement. Now I\u2019d like to introduce our speakers. First, we have Evan Greenberg, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, followed by Peter Enns, our Chief Financial Officer, and then we\u2019ll take your questions. Also with us to assist with your questions this morning are several members of our management team. It\u2019s now my pleasure to turn the call over to Evan. Evan Greenberg : Good morning. Before I begin, I want to take a moment to speak about the terrible tragedy surrounding the California wildfires - the live lost and tremendous loss of property, a major disaster still unfolding. Our job and the role we play in society is to support our policyholders. Our colleagues have been on the ground, supported by Chubb colleagues throughout the U.S., endeavoring to assist those clients who have lost property, been displaced from their homes and businesses, and had their lives severely disrupted. While it doesn\u2019t erase the enormous difficulty they have and will continue to experience, we\u2019re doing all we can in small and big ways to ease their burden. Our thoughts are with those who have suffered, and our gratitude goes to those firefighters and emergency workers who serve tirelessly. From a financial perspective, our current estimate of the cost of supporting our customers and helping them recover and rebuild from their catastrophe is $1.5 billion net pre-tax and is a first quarter 2025 event. Now turning to our results for the fourth quarter \u201924, which you have all seen, we had a great quarter which contributed to an outstanding year; in fact, the best in our company\u2019s history. For the quarter, record P&C underwriting income with a world-class combined ratio of 85.7, together with another quarter of record investment income led to core operating income of $2.5 billion. Operating earnings were up 9.4% on a pre-tax basis or 10.5% per share, though after tax they were distorted by the one-time tax benefit we received last year. Looking through that, operating income was up over 7.5% after tax. Global P&C premium revenue, which excludes agriculture, grew 6.7% in the quarter with good contributions from our P&C businesses globally of North America and overseas general. Premiums in our life insurance division grew 8.5% constant dollars. For the year, we generated operating income of $9.1 billion, up 11.5% adjusted for the one-time tax benefit and 13% on a per-share basis. Looking more broadly, over the past three years core operating income has grown over 65% and is nearly double the amount from pre-COVID 2019. All three major sources of income for our company produced record results last year. P&C underwriting income of $5.9 billion was up over 7% with a published combined ratio of 86.6. Adjusted net investment income grew 19.3% to $6.4 billion, and life insurance income topped $1 billion. For the year, we grew global P&C premiums 9.9% and life premiums 18.5% in constant dollars. Shareholder returns were strong. Our core operating ROE was about 14% and our return on tangible equity was 21.6. Per-share book and tangible book value grew 8.8 and 14.1 respectively. Our results top and bottom line continue to demonstrate the broad and diversified nature of the company and the consistency of contributions from our businesses around the world - North America, Asia, Europe, Latin America, both commercial and consumer. As we look forward to 2025, we have good momentum and are optimistic about the year ahead, both top and bottom line, cat losses and FX notwithstanding. Returning to the quarter, our underwriting performance was outstanding while absorbing a more normal level of cat losses. P&C underwriting income was $1.6 billion and the current accident year combined ratio excluding cats was 82.2%, more than two points better than prior year and also a record result. Our prior year\u2019s reserve development in the quarter and for the year was $213 million and $856 million respectively, and speaks to the strength of reserves and conservative nature of our loss reserving practices. On the asset side, we\u2019re investment managers, our other business, and we had another excellent quarter in terms of performance. Our invested assets now stands at $151 billion, and it will continue to grow. For the quarter, adjusted net investment income was a record $1.7 billion, up 13.7%. Our fixed income portfolio yield is 5% versus 4.8% a year ago, and our current new money rate is averaging 5.6%. Peter will have more to say about financial items. Turning to growth, pricing and the rate environment, again global P&C premiums increased 6.7% in the quarter, with commercial up 6.4% and consumer up 7.5%. All regions of the world contributed favorably. Life premiums grew 8.5%. In terms of the commercial P&C rate environment, market trends or themes were consistent with those of the previous quarter. Property has grown more competitive and large account shared and layered at E&S while pricing was favorable. Casualty is stable or firming, depending on the class, and overall pricing is ahead of loss cost tracking. Financial lines, particularly D&O and employment practices liability is where more competition is reaching for market share at the expense of current accident year underwriting margins. Overall, market conditions are favorable and we see good growth opportunity for over 80% of our global P&C business, commercial and consumer, as well as for our life business. North America and overseas general, Asia, Europe and Latin America, each with many areas of favorable growth opportunity. Our middle market and small commercial businesses globally, our U.S. E&S business, our U.S. high net worth business, global A&H and life, international personal lines, our digital business and specialty businesses such as our growing climate plus business. Now turning to the quarter, let me give you some more color by division. Beginning with North America, premiums excluding agriculture were up 6.3% and consisted of 10% growth in personal insurance and 5.1% growth in commercial, with P&C lines up 7.2% and financial lines down 2.9%. We had another strong quarter for new business, up over 22% versus prior year, and our renewal retention on a policy count basis was 90.4%. These again speak to the reasonably disciplined tone of the market and our excellent operating performance. Premiums in our major account and specialty division increased 4.6% with P&C up 5.8% and financial lines down 1.7%. Within major and specialty, our Westchester E&S business grew 8%. Premiums at our middle market division increased 6.2% with P&C up 10% and financial lines down 5%. Pricing for property and casualty excluding financial lines and comp was up 9.9% with rates up 8.2% and exposure change of 1.6%. Financial lines pricing was down 3.3% with rates down 3.6%. In workers comp, which includes both primary comp and large account risk management, pricing was up 4.7% with rates up 2.5% and exposure up 2.1%. Breaking down P&C pricing further, property pricing was up 6.9% with rates up 3.5% and exposure change of 3.3%. Casualty pricing in North America was up 12.7% with rates up 11.8% and exposure up 0.8%. Loss costs in North America remained stable - no change and in line with what we contemplate in our loss PICs. Our North America commercial lines business ran an amazing 83.9% published combined ratio for the year - again, an amazing result. In agriculture, where we are the market leader, our crop underwriting results this quarter were excellent, and we finished the year with $354 million in underwriting profit. Premiums were down from prior year due to lower commodity prices and the formulas for risk sharing with the government. On the consumer side of North America, our high net worth personal lines business had another outstanding quarter with premium growth of 10%, including new business growth of 34%. Premiums in our true high net worth segments, a group that seeks our brand for the differentiated coverage and service we are known for, grew 17.6%. Our home owners pricing was up over 12% in the quarter and ahead of loss cost trends, which remained steady. For the year, we ran an outstanding 83.6% combined ratio in our high net worth personal lines business. Turning to our international general insurance operations, premiums in the quarter for our retail business were up 7.7% with commercial lines up 10.3% and consumer up 4.7%. From a region of the world perspective, Asia Pac led the way with premiums up 12.2%. Europe grew 8.2%, including growth of 12% on the continent. Latin America grew just 2.5% and was impacted by foreign exchange. If you adjust for that, Latin America was up 11.5% in constant dollars. In our international retail commercial business, P&C pricing was up 3.7% and financial lines pricing was down more than 6%. Premiums in our London wholesale business were essentially flat. They were up 1.1% with prices down 4% as the London market continued to grow more competitive. For the year, our overseas general business ran an excellent 86.4 combined ratio. Our global reinsurance business had a strong quarter with premium growth of about 20% and finished the year with premiums up 32% and a combined ratio of 85.9, reflecting a more disciplined reinsurance market, both property and pockets of casualty. In our international life business, which is fundamentally Asia, premiums and deposits were up over 26% in constant dollar. In combined insurance company, our U.S. worksite business grew 17.8%. Our life division finished the year with pre-tax income of $1.1 billion, which was ahead of what we originally projected for the year. We have good momentum in our life business, which continues to build. In summary, we had a great quarter and a great year. While we\u2019re in the risk business and there\u2019s plenty of uncertainty in the world, we\u2019re confident that our ability to continue growing operating earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate, cats and FX notwithstanding. Our earnings growth will come from three sources : P&C underwriting, investment income, and life income. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Peter. Peter Enns : Thank you Evan, and good morning. As you just heard, we concluded the year with another strong quarter, contributing to record full-year results across our three primary sources of earnings. Our balance sheet finished the year in an exceptionally strong position with book value of $64 billion and total invested assets of $151 billion. The quarter and full year produced adjusted operating cash flow of $4.2 billion and a record $15.9 billion respectively. It\u2019s also worth noting that during the quarter, AM Best affirmed our company\u2019s rating and stable outlook, and in January S&P affirmed our rating and stable outlook. During the quarter, we returned $1.1 billion of capital to shareholders, including $725 million in share repurchases and $367 million in dividends. We returned $3.5 billion in total for the year, including $2 billion in share repurchases and $1.5 billion in dividends, which represented approximately 38% of our full year core operating earnings. The average share price on repurchases for the year was $269.23. Book value for the quarter and the year was adversely impacted by unrealized mark to market losses on our high quality fixed income portfolio due to interest rate changes, which we expect to amortize back to par over time, as well as foreign exchange losses. Book and tangible book value per share excluding AOCI grew 2.9% and 4.3% respectively for the quarter, and 10.8% and 15.4% respectively for the year. Our core operating return on tangible equity for the quarter and year was 22% and 21.6% respectively, while our core operating ROE for the quarter and year was 14.3% and 13.9%. Turning to investments, our A-rated portfolio, which now has an average book yield of 5%, produced adjusted net investment income of $1.69 billion, which included approximately $25 million of higher than normal income from private equity. We expect our quarterly adjusted net investment income to have a run rate between $1.67 billion and $1.75 billion over the next six months. Regarding underwriting results, the quarter included pre-tax catastrophe losses of $607 million, of which $309 million was from Hurricane Milton and $140 million from Hurricane Helene. The remaining balance was principally from weather related events split 31% in the U.S. and 69% international. Prior period development in the quarter in our active companies was a favorable $352 million pre-tax with favorable development split 17% in long tail lines, primarily from general casualty, and 83% in short tail lines, primarily from property and agriculture. Our corporate runoff portfolio had adverse development of $139 million, primarily asbestos related. Our paid to incurred ratio for the year was 83%. Our core effective tax rate was 18.2% for the quarter and 17.5% for the year, which are below our previously guided range due to shifts in mix of income. We expect our annual core operating effective tax rate for 2025 to be in the range of 19% to 19.5%, including the transition cash tax benefit provided on the adoption of the new Bermuda income tax. I\u2019ll now turn the call back over to Karen. Karen Beyer : Thank you. At this point, we\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now begin the question and answer session. [Operator instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Meredith from UBS. Your line is open. Brian Meredith : Yes, thank you. A couple questions here for me. Evan, I\u2019m wondering if you can dig into a little bit the Cal fire loss estimate that you\u2019ve given out there. Does it include assessments, subrogation, kind of ground up? Maybe give us a little context on how we should be thinking about the $1.5 billion number. Evan Greenberg : Yes. First of all, it\u2019s a ground-up number. It\u2019s our own losses. We don\u2019t go off of what we imagine as a total industry wildfire loss and a market share - this is our number that our adjusters on the ground have been able to estimate property by property. It does include an assessment for--our projection of an assessment from the fair [ph] plan, and we don\u2019t take credit in ours for subrogation. Brian Meredith : That\u2019s helpful, thank you. Then my second question, Evan, I\u2019m just curious, looking at 2025, still getting some solid growth in commercial lines, call it mid to high single digit organic growth here in premium. But if you think of 2025, is that kind of a good number to target organically, and then is this kind of the period that we\u2019re looking at, that maybe you should start looking a little bit more at inorganic growth opportunities? Evan Greenberg : I love you, Brian. Yes, you know, I don\u2019t give--we don\u2019t give guidance on forward-looking, but your first statement--you know, your logic sounds pretty decent to me. I didn\u2019t say it, you said it. As for inorganic growth, money is not burning a hole in our pocket and, as you know, it\u2019s opportunistic and it\u2019s in support of our organic strategies, and it\u2019s got to be the right thing at the right price. We\u2019re always looking. Brian Meredith : Great, appreciate it. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of David Motemaden from Evercore ISI. Your line is open. David Motemaden : Hey, good morning. I had a question on the--for Peter and Evan on the favorable long tail reserve development, the 17% of the 350 or so on the active companies. It sounds like that was driven by general casualty. That\u2019s a bit of a change versus what you guys have experienced over the last several quarters, so I\u2019m wondering if you could elaborate on the favorable development that you\u2019re seeing there, because that\u2019s quite different than what you and others have been reporting, and any clarity on what sort of accident year it\u2019s coming from too would be helpful. Evan Greenberg : Well, I\u2019m going to correct your mental model to begin with. Our casualty, we study different portfolios of casualty each quarter. Some casualty portfolios, we have taken reserve strengthening, some portfolios we\u2019ve taken no action, some portfolios we\u2019ve had reserve releases, and there has not been a consistency per quarter except the consistency is the portfolios is we study each quarter, and so a cohort of casualty we studied this quarter had favorable development given the reserve strength in that portfolio. David Motemaden : Got it, helpful. Thank you for that. Then maybe--you know, obviously strong results in North America commercial, that included a little bit of a headwind from the structured transactions too. Could you--of that 40 basis point headwind, could you just help me think about the impact that had on the loss ratio and how we should think about the durability of that loss ratio going forward? Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re saying on structured transaction, what\u2019s its impact in the quarter on loss ratio? David Motemaden : Yes. Evan Greenberg : Structured transactions typically run off favorable. Now, we don\u2019t break down the pieces and going to give you each--you know, the component of that exactly, but they--what you should know is they run a higher loss ratio than the average portfolio does. David Motemaden : Got it, okay. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : David, does that help you? David Motemaden : Yes, yes, that does help. I mean, I guess you guys had given the 40 basis points just on the total combined ratio. I guess I can just use that, sort of as a placeholder for what sort of impact that may have had on the--maybe a little bit bigger on the loss ratio, maybe [indiscernible]. Evan Greenberg : We don\u2019t have it at hand, but it\u2019s probably--you know, it\u2019s in the range, okay? David Motemaden : Got it, understood. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : It\u2019s a fucking basis point, so it\u2019s easy for me to tell you you\u2019re in the range. I mean, it could be 10 basis points up or do, but we\u2019ll take it offline with you and help you. David Motemaden : Thanks. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gregory Peters from Raymond James. Your line is open. Greg Peters : Well, good morning everyone. Evan, in response to Brian\u2019s question, you said you love him. I don\u2019t recall you ever saying you love a sell-side analyst, so the new year\u2019s definitely starting off good for us! Evan Greenberg : Don\u2019t mess it up, Greg! Greg Peters : All right. I\u2019m sure I can. Anyway, in your press release, you say you\u2019re growing operating earnings and EPS at a double-digit rate. You talk about the three buckets - PC, investment income and life insurance, so maybe you can, from a big picture perspective, unpack life insurance and talk about where you see the growth coming next year--or this year, I should say, \u201925, and how it might compare with how the growth came out for \u201924. Evan Greenberg : Yes, you know, there was a lot of consolidation impact on the life income in the \u201923 year and a little bit of noise in \u201924. There was one-time stuff in \u201923, so to look through the underlying growth rate of that, it produced a really solid double-digit growth rate in income. When I looked through it, it was in that 12% to 14% range. When I look forward, I see that continuing and even strengthening. We have good momentum, and it\u2019s obviously Asia, and it\u2019s both north Asia and it\u2019s Southeast Asia. Our business in Korea, while the revenue growth is not overly exciting, the margin of that business continues to expand and our overall income is growing. It\u2019s a ballast of the business. It\u2019s supported by then faster--countries that are growing much more quickly - Hong Kong, Taiwan, China now growing more quickly for us, and each of those producing improved margin and therefore faster income growth. Southeast Asia, with Vietnam and Thailand, they had slower growth this past year, and they\u2019re accelerating as we go forward. Finally, we have two other businesses in Indonesia and in New Zealand that are good businesses, picking up momentum. It\u2019s in direct response marketing, it\u2019s in agency, and over 60% of the business, about 70% of it is really accident and health and risk-based type products, and the rest is very conservatively structured savings-related products, because people in Asia, you have two themes, you have an aging population in the north that requires a certain kind of savings and health-related product, and then you have people in Southeast Asia, where it\u2019s a younger population, family oriented, there are no social safety nets, and so they rely on these kinds of products much more than they do in other parts of the world. I\u2019ll remind you, unlike many regions of the world, these parts of Asia are growing, particularly Southeast Asia. The economic growth is multiples of what we\u2019re seeing in the West, and that just means a rising middle class. Greg Peters : Thanks for the perspective and detail. I guess pivoting to the other bucket, which is PC, it seems like the broader market is producing some pretty good results relative to longer term averages, and we\u2019re hearing about increased competition across a broader set of lines of business, even you, in your comments, talked about financial lines, so maybe you could spend a minute and give us some perspective on how you think where we are in the cycle and how Chubb is going to be positioned to come out of it. Evan Greenberg : Yes, it goes to my comment, about 80% of the business growth, and where you therefore see the pockets of competition. As a backdrop and in the way you think about cycles--and I\u2019ve been thinking about this for a while, we\u2019re in a more inflationary period in the insurance industry, and it\u2019s a prolonged one, than we have seen in a very long time. We went through decades of really relatively low inflation, on the short tail class side virtually pretty flat, and on the long tail side, there\u2019s always been pockets but it was running at a lower level. We\u2019re in a period of sustained inflation, so to just stay in place, rates have to move. It doesn\u2019t mean margins improve if they just keep pace with loss costs, so a certain amount of industry growth is just to reflect inflation. The competition, it\u2019s increasing in shared and large account business, so first large account will grow more slowly because you have a couple of lines of business where competition increases - property, shared and layered property, but it\u2019s well priced and it doesn\u2019t mean that there\u2019s a decrease in margin. It means that to retain business, you become a bit more competitive, it\u2019s harder to grow. More want that business, so you\u2019re not going to see growth but you\u2019re going to see good results from all we\u2019re imagining as we go forward. E&S property, same thing. Financial lines in large account, same thing; and then primary casualty is not a real growth business, but it\u2019s a ballast that supports growth of many other lines for large account, so large account, not so much. In middle market and small commercial, growth opportunity, and it\u2019s a growth opportunity across many segments. By the way, there\u2019s certain secular change taking place in that business, and by the way, it\u2019s not simply in the United States, it\u2019s global; and then the consumer lines business from high net worth to personal lines outside the United States to our accident and health businesses, particularly with middle class in Asia and in Latin America on both the life side and the non-life side, when I add it all up--anyway. Does that give you a sense? Greg Peters : Yes, it does. What did you mean by the secular change comment? Evan Greenberg : When you--particularly in middle market in the United States, I\u2019ll take that as an example, with all of the change in climate and cat activity, and with the change in the legal environment around the trial bar and social inflation, regional and mutuals have a harder time. They\u2019re not equipped with the data, with the balance sheet, with the depth of business in reinsurance relationships to be able to--and with the technology to be able to compete the same way. That over time is shifting market share, and it advantages a few larger players. Greg Peters : That makes sense. Thanks for the answers. Evan Greenberg : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Meyer Shields from KBW. Your line is open. Meyer Shields : Great, thank you. Good morning. First, I was hoping you could walk us through any changes to your reinsurance purchasing at January 1. Evan Greenberg : None. Meyer Shields : Okay, that\u2019s pretty easy. The second, I don\u2019t know if this is significant, but-- Evan Greenberg : Yes, I would have done--it did nothing [indiscernible]. Meyer Shields : That\u2019s fine, makes [indiscernible] there. There was a little bit of an uptick in administrative expenses in North America commercial, and I was hoping you could walk us through that. I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s incentive compensation or something else. Evan Greenberg : A little uptick in what in North America? Meyer Shields : The admin expenses. Evan Greenberg : No, it\u2019s just--oh my God, it\u2019s 0.1%. It\u2019s just noise. Meyer Shields : Okay. Evan Greenberg : Meyer-- Meyer Shields : I\u2019m sorry, go ahead? Evan Greenberg : [Indiscernible] Meyer Shields : Yes, I was looking for dollars, not the percentage. Evan Greenberg : No, it\u2019s just--it\u2019s just--no, nothing. It\u2019s just variability in the quarter. Meyer Shields : Okay, perfect. Thank you so much. Evan Greenberg : There\u2019s not a trend in that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mike Zaremski from BMO. Your line is open. Mike Zaremski : Hey, morning. First is a follow-up to your insights about the secular change in the U.S. middle market space. If I think through your comments in the past, Evan, you\u2019ve said that Chubb has aspirations to move more down market, and your definition of mid market or small market might be also different than some of the peers. But just curious if you\u2019re painting a picture that Chubb\u2019s competitive advantages are growing versus some of its peers, would you still have aspirations to do kind of inorganic things in the small midmarket space in the U.S., or less so as time goes on? Evan Greenberg : Our focus is on organic SME - small and middle market, and it\u2019s organic. That is our focus and has been our focus. Anything that\u2019s inorganic is simply opportunistic, and that\u2019s not our focus. It\u2019s opportunistic. Mike Zaremski : Okay, and lastly switching gears, on the investment portfolio, there\u2019s been a bit of an increase in equities over the last couple quarters - we\u2019re up to about $9 billion. Anything changing there in terms of over the next year, you expect to see a different mix shift in the investment portfolio? Thanks. Peter Enns : Mike, it\u2019s Peter. First off, that specific $5 billion shift relates to us actually moving about $5 million of investment-grade corporates into a fund for, call it investment efficiency purposes between different entities. The underlying is still investment-grade fixed income, but because of GAAP, we have to show it as equity, so there\u2019s no underlying change in that. In terms of the going forward, we\u2019ve spoken about our strategy--you\u2019ll see it in the investor presentation, there will be a change in investment allocation, slight change which we put out there in that investor deck. Mike Zaremski : Thank you Peter. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Andrew Kligerman from TD Cowen. Your line is open. Andrew Kligerman : Thank you, good morning. Evan, in casualty lines, you mentioned the 12% rate increase for North America - that sounds really solid. But in reinsurance, you said there were pockets of strength, and I\u2019m hearing overall in reinsurance casualty, there\u2019s a lot of softness going on. One, why the disconnect; and two, what are those pockets of weakness in casualty reinsurance? Evan Greenberg : No, I said there\u2019s pockets of opportunity in reinsurance casualty. You have to be very select, and I\u2019m not going to go into more detail than that; but let\u2019s be clear, we have not been significant, by any means, reinsurance casualty writers, and in fact we shrank and shrank and shrank over quite a number of years because we didn\u2019t see the market producing an underwriting profit. We see select--you know, the market is stressed in reinsurance casualty, and we see--you know, we see selective pockets. I\u2019m not going to overstate it. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Evan Greenberg : Relative to travel, it\u2019s not big money. Andrew Kligerman : Got it, got it. Then with regard to the financial lines-- Evan Greenberg : [Indiscernible] it\u2019s opportunistic trades [indiscernible]. Andrew Kligerman : Got it. Then with regard to financial lines, it looks like that\u2019s the area where you\u2019re seeing premiums decline across the board. It\u2019s been about three years now of continuous decline, particularly in public D&O. What is it that players like about it, that they continue to go after it and you just don\u2019t think it\u2019s good business at this point? Evan Greenberg : Well, we love the business. It\u2019s the pricing. Andrew Kligerman : Yes. Evan Greenberg : You know, look - during the pandemic, there was a significant drop-off in securities class actions and in other forms of loss - let\u2019s call it employment practices liability during the financial crisis, so those years are producing favorable results. The head fake around it, which is why I used the words, current accident year, is in terms of loss, the number of securities class actions, the frequency of loss is reverting back to the mean. In some areas, like employment practices, in fact frequency of loss is increasing pretty quickly. Severity of loss continues to trend, and so I think what they don\u2019t see or they ignore is what\u2019s coming about current accident year margins and pressure. We know this. We have a big book of this business, and Chubb is a leader in this business across classes, and so we--we\u2019re patient. We know how to ebb and flow in a period, so it\u2019s--you know, it\u2019s not something you like looking at, but on the other hand we\u2019ve got plenty of other tables to play. Andrew Kligerman : Makes a lot of sense, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Scott from Barclays. Your line is open. Alex Scott : Hey, good morning. First one I had for you all is on sort of the fallout from what we\u2019re going to see in California from the wildfires, and I guess specifically, what will your approach be to the market going forward? Will you have to make any changes in the way you approach that market, and just interested in any thoughts you have on what needs to be done to sort of stabilize the insurance market there. Evan Greenberg : Yes, thank you for that question. Look - California is a difficult market for insurance companies, and it has only become more difficult over time. The state along with the pressure it receives from consumer advocacy groups suppresses the ability to charge a fair price for the risk and tailored coverages to improve availability and affordability of insurance for the citizens of the state. Insurers are unable to generate a reasonable risk-adjusted return commensurate with the risk of ensuring natural perils such as wildfire and the cost in California associated with reconstruction following a disaster. This suppression of pricing signals, which are rising, encourages more risk taking by individuals and businesses as to where they choose to live or work, and it encourages less risk management or loss mitigation activity, and they\u2019re part as well by federal and state and local governments, who all have a hand in loss mitigation activity that actually is occurring, or not occurring. In a word, economics incent behaviors, and California is impacting those economic signals. As insurers have reduced their exposures in the state, the state has offered more under-priced coverage through its own insurer of last resort. Frankly, it\u2019s an unsustainable model, and one way or the other, the citizens of the state pay the price for coverage. California is not alone in this regard, but it certainly stands out. We\u2019ve been shrinking our exposure in California for some time; for example, in the area where the wildfires occurred, our exposure has been reduced by over 50%. We\u2019re not going to write insurance where we cannot achieve a reasonable risk-adjusted return for taking the risk. Alex Scott : That\u2019s really helpful. Maybe just a follow-on question to that, would you expect what\u2019s going on in California and sort of the fallout from that to affect property pricing more broadly? I mean, it seems like the world\u2019s becoming a riskier place and certainly price adequacy has seemed pretty good in property and other areas, but will this be enough to change thinking, whether at the primary or reinsurance level, in your view? Evan Greenberg : You know, it\u2019s too early to tell. I don\u2019t know yet. As the loss, the magnitude of this loss emerges and grows, more of it begins to find its way to reinsurance balance sheets and to other balance sheets, and that\u2019s going to be the question, is what is the ultimate size of the loss and where does it end up? That will give us--that will determine whether it has a broader impact on overall property pricing, which in my judgment overall is adequate. This is a reminder of why the industry needs to maintain pricing adequacy. Alex Scott : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Elyse Greenspan from Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Elyse Greenspan : Hi, thanks. Good morning. My first question, can you guys provide, I guess, what the current excess capital drag on your ROE is? Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m sorry--? Peter Enns : The current excess capita ROE drag. Yes, we haven\u2019t disclosed that in a while, Elyse; and again, how we\u2019re thinking about things, consistent with what we talked about in our investor presentation, is looking at our capital as also a source of investment as we gradually and incrementally increase our asset allocation towards alts. That\u2019s just starting, so I\u2019ll say right now, looking at the year behind us, it will be in a range similar to, call it a year ago that we discussed and people backward computed, so. It was in the range of ROE looking backwards of around 2% on ROE and 6% on ROTE. Elyse Greenspan : That\u2019s helpful. Then my second question, you provided tax guidance, and I think you had said that it considers some transition cash tax benefit from Bermuda. I had also thought that there was some--the potential for some reversals of the DTAs that were set up, so I\u2019m assuming--I think that might not take place this year, but it might be a couple years out. Are you guys just assuming there\u2019s no change in the DTA structure of what was set up a year ago? Peter Enns : Yes Elyse, from an accounting perspective, it\u2019s based on Bermuda law, and Bermuda law isn\u2019t expected to change. If it changes, we\u2019d have to look at it. OECD came out with some administrative guidance a couple of weeks ago that has to be reviewed and see how it applies. As you may have seen, the new administration has come through with saying they\u2019re not going to participate in the global minimum tax of OECD and are vacating on that basis, so we have a sense of where--we have a very clear sense of where we are for \u201925 and \u201926, and one thing we know is longer term, it\u2019s very uncertain, particularly with the new administration along with China, India, and some other very large countries not being involved at all as well. Evan Greenberg : It never involved Swiss law-- Peter Enns : Swiss law, yes. Evan Greenberg : Yes, it\u2019s messy. Elyse Greenspan : Then on--I\u2019ll throw one in for Evan. You guys have been talking about competition in financial lines for some time, and obviously pulled back there. Do you--what do you think it takes, I guess, for things to get better there? Is there something--are you not expecting conditions, I guess, to change at any point in the near term? Evan Greenberg : I think there\u2019s some--I think as losses emerge and it re-normalizes, that will be an ameliorating factor. Elyse Greenspan : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Yaron Kinar from Jefferies. Your line is open. Yaron Kinar : Thank you, good morning. Evan, at the risk of maybe changing your sentiment around the sell-side analysts here so quickly, I do want to go back to something I asked last quarter with regards to North America commercial premium growth, which was 2% on a gross premium basis. I\u2019m just trying to reconcile that with the pricing environment, which seems to be ahead of that, and the opportunities that you\u2019re seeing and the appetite that you have. Maybe you can walk us through the puts and takes there. Evan Greenberg : I\u2019m not sure what you--can you be more clear? Yaron Kinar : Sure. Your premium growth, gross premium growth was 2%. I think the pricing environment in North America P&C, if we take the bits and pieces of pricing that you offered, is north of that. It seems to also be a bit of raw trend-- Evan Greenberg : I think you have to start with net premium growth, not gross premium growth. Net premium growth-- Yaron Kinar : Why would that be? Evan Greenberg : Well, because net--gross premium growth has too many distortions of transactions that we do, that frankly distort that number, large transactions, where it may be a self-insured program or it\u2019s a structured program, so gross has puts and calls based on the premium flows with our clients. If you get to a middle market business, it\u2019s more steady; but when you have large account and then you have gross line, even in E&S business with a client, that\u2019s what makes a lot of noise and a lot of difference. You\u2019re never going to get there. You have to start at net premium. Now, I could just tell you that, and I\u2019m giving you that as an explanation, not as a--this is nothing to debate. Yaron Kinar : Fair enough, and if we take the net premium growth, which was 5%, versus roughly 7% pricing? Evan Greenberg : Well, it\u2019s a mix of--there\u2019s a mix of business, there is a retention. It doesn\u2019t translate directly, it never does. You start with a retention rate, you then have to add new business, you have to do it line by line and the mix of it, so you\u2019ll hear overall pricing, but now take overall pricing and you have to adjust for the mix of business. When you\u2019re trying to translate to revenue [indiscernible]. If you want, offline we will give you a simple math lesson of that and take you through it. Yaron Kinar : Great, I\u2019m always-- Evan Greenberg : I don\u2019t mean a lesson in a bad way. We\u2019ll take you through and give you some--you know, maybe another way to help you think about it. Yaron Kinar : Great, always eager to learn. Thank you. Evan Greenberg : You got it. Operator : That concludes our question and answer session. I will now turn the call back over to Karen Beyer for closing remarks. Karen Beyer : Thank you everyone for joining us today, and if you have any follow-up questions still, we\u2019ll be around to take your call. Enjoy the day, thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",
