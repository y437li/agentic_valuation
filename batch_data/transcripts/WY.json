Davidson Chip Dillon Colin Ming - Raymond James Operator :  Good morning. My name is Carmen, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the First Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. (Operator Instructions) I will now turn the conference over to Kathy McAuley, Vice President, Investor Relations. The floor is yours. Kathy McAuley : Thank you, Carmen. Good morning. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's First Quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found at our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer. Now, I will turn the call over to Doyle. Doyle Simons :  Thank you, Kathy and good morning everyone, earlier today we reported first quarter net earnings of a 183 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of 2 billion. Excluding special items we achieved solid first quarter net earnings of a 153 million or $0.26 per diluted share as our businesses delivered strong operating results despite unusually severe winter weather throughout much North America in the quarter. Special items in the quarter included a gain resulting from an amendment to a post retirement health care plan, a gain on sale of a non-strategic asset and restructuring charges associated with our previously announced SG&A cost reduction initiative.  I will begin this morning with a few comments on the housing market and overall economic conditions before turning to a discussion of our business results. The unusually severe winter weather dampened market momentum early in the year and housing starts in January and February declined slightly on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with year ago levels. As the winter weather is moderated markets are improving, in March single family housing starts increased to 635,000 on a seasonally adjusted annual basis, 2% higher than a year ago. Single family also comprised a greater percentage of total housing starts in March, compared with February.  Prices for existing homes are 13% higher than last year, and fundamentals of job growth and improving household formation support our expectation for continued recovery in the housing markets. Although the weather\u2019s disruption experienced during the past few months has slightly diminished the overall housing outlook for 2014, the market consensus continues to forecast significant growth compared with 2013 and we are planning for approximately 1.1 million starts including over 700,000 single family starts. Globally Chinese demand for our logs and pulp remains strong as the pace of orders rescinds following a normal seasonal slowdown associated with the Lunar New Year.  Orders from our Japanese customers weakened slightly at the conclusion of the first quarter due to uncertainty regarding the effect of the increased consumption tax. However Japan remains a very strong customer for our logs and we expect that demand will remain generally solid overall. Let me now turn to our business segment starting with Timberland, charts three to five, Timberlands had an outstanding quarter, contributing a 164 million to earnings, an improvement of more than 20% compared with last quarter, demand for western logs was strong in the quarter and prices rose in export and domestic markets. Operating margins improved due to higher harvest volumes and our operational excellence initiative. The strong performance of our western Timberlands business also reflects increasing benefits from the Longview timber acquisition which contributed 53 million of EBITDA in the quarter an improvement of 18 million from the fourth quarter.  In the south, log prices rose modestly, continuing the slow upward trajectory we observed in the fourth quarter. Wet weather resulted in lower southern sea harvest volumes as well as reduced silviculture spending. First quarter earnings from disposition and non strategic Timberlands are usually minimal and as expected, dispositions declined to 4 million in the quarter. Excluding dispositions, the segment earned a $160 million. This is the highest quarterly Timberlands\u2019 earnings excluding land sales since the second quarter of 2006.  Wood products, charts 6 and 7. Wood products earned 64 million, an improvement compared with the fourth quarter despite the effect of severe winter weather. Weather resulted in reduced sales volumes for most products as demand stalled and transportation challenges related to Canadian rail car and trucking availability made it harder to deliver products to our customers. Adjusted EBITDA in the quarter improved to 93 million, compared with 88 million in the fourth quarter. In lumber, EBITDA improved by 17 million. This improvement is primarily attributable to increased lumber sales realizations which more than offset lower sales volumes and higher western log cost. Operating rates improved and the business did a good job of controlling cost in the quarter despite weather related disruptions. In OSB, EBITDA declined by 10 million, as our prices fell by 3% and sales volumes declined by approximately 5%, manufacturing cost rose slightly as the business incurred higher energy and maintenance cost as a result of the extreme weather.  EBITDA for engineered wood products fell slightly compared to the fourth quarter due to cost associated with the startup of the Evergreen Alabama mill, and EBITDA for the distribution business improved by a $1 million despite a significant number of lost days due to weather related closures. Operational excellence efforts for all our wood products businesses remain on track and we expect to see additional benefits as the year progresses.  Cellulose fibers, chart 8 and 9, cellulose fibers contributed 54 million to earnings down from 65 million in the fourth quarter, despite the harsh weather, the mill system ran very well in the first quarter, average pulp price realizations rose as markets tightened due to lower levels of supply. Energy costs were higher as a result of the weather and pulp sales volumes declined due to timing of shipment and Canadian transportation issues similar to those that affected our wood products businesses. As expected, maintenance expenses also rose due to an increase in a number of scheduled annual outage days.  Real estate \u2013 charts 10 to 12. WRECO contributed 12 million to first quarter earnings, down from earnings from four special items of 71 million in the fourth quarter. First quarter earnings included 2 million from land sales. The first quarter is typically the weakest quarter for our real estate business and home closings declined seasonally, this is partly offset by an 8% increase in average prices and lower selling expenses due to the decreased closing volume.  Gross margins were approximately 21%. During the first quarter we made significant progress against our SG&A initiative to reduce costs by 75 million by 2014 year end. We incurred 18 million of restructuring charges in the quarter primarily for severance as efforts to simplify and streamline our processes and operations reduce our staffing needs, we are highly confident we will achieve our target run rate by year end 2014.  I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook. Patty Bedient : Thanks Doyle, and good morning everybody. Although the housing market has gotten off to a slow start in 2014, we expect to see demand pick up as we move to the quarter. The harsh winter weather has now dissipated and the strength of underlying market fundamentals should begin to yield better results in the second quarter. The outlook is summarized on chart 14 and I\u2019ll begin my comments with Timberlands.  In the west, export prices are expected to soften somewhat but overall, demand and prices remained at favorable levels. The effect of the increased consumption tax is causing Japanese demand to weaken compared to the first quarter. However we expect that volumes to China will increase in the second quarter as activity returns to pre-holiday levels. Demand from domestic sawmills is also anticipated to increase as home building picks up, although prices will likely be somewhat softer. We expect increased log and haul costs as we begin to harvest sites with higher elevations and longer hauling distances. Silviculture costs are also expected to increase. In the south we expect pricing to continue its slow but steady upward direction. Volumes are expected to increase slightly offset by higher silviculture costs. Dispositions of non-strategic land sales will be higher in the second quarter compared to the first with anticipated Q2 sales at approximately $20 million which will be substantially completed by the end of this month. Including the effect of these land sales, we expect that second quarter earnings in the Timberlands segment will be comparable to the first quarter.  In wood products, we expect that the seasonal pick up in home building will result in increased sales volumes across major product lines resulting in improved earnings in all businesses. Lumber sales realizations have softened thus far in the quarter, however they should stabilize as demand improves throughout the quarter. OSB prices appear to have bottomed out and we anticipate slightly improved realizations for the second quarter compared to the first.  Demand in engineered wood products is improving and we expect higher sales realizations during the quarter. In addition, our Evergreen Alabama plant is scheduled to begin shipping commercial product, high choice and microlam in May.  In our distribution business, customers are continuing to express signs of optimism and channel inventories are still at relatively low levels. On the cost side of the equation, we expect lumber manufacturing cost to improve with the higher production volumes and log cost will likely increase marginally due to seasonally higher log cost in Canada offsetting favourable variances in the west and south. OSB manufacturing costs are expected to remain flat as the positive effect of higher productivity is offset by slight increases in resin in some planned annual maintenance downtime. Engineered wood products manufacturing cost should improve especially for veneer cost, which were negatively impacted by adverse weather in the first quarter. Cost should also decrease as our Alabama plant moves from start-ups to production next month. Weather related transportation issues should moderate now that the extreme winter weather conditions are behind us. We anticipate overall earnings in our wood product segment to increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first depending on the strength of the spring building season. Sales realizations in our Cellulose Fibers segment are expected to continue to improve. Global softwood pulp inventories were below normal at the end of the first quarter. Liquid packaging realization should also improve primarily due to higher grade mix. We expect lower energy and fiber cost given more favourable weather conditions compared to the first quarter. Maintenance costs are also expected to be slightly lower this quarter. Earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment should increase significantly in the second quarter compared to the first. We expect improved results in our Real Estate segment as we move into the seasonally stronger second quarter and weather improves. We expect to close approximately 650 single family homes in the quarter, up from the 508 closed in Q1. We anticipate higher average home prices with margins similar to the first quarter of around 20%. Selling cost will increase due to the higher closing volume. Earnings from land and lot sales are also expected to improve moderately compared to the first quarter income of $2 million. Overall earnings in our Real Estate segment are expected to increase in the second quarter compared to the first. The earlier announced combination of our single family home building business with TRI Pointe Homes is on track and we anticipate closing just after the end of the second quarter. The decision of whether to distribute the shares using a spin or split will be made by the Weyerhaeuser Board likely later this quarter. We remain excited about the benefits of this transaction which should create an even more powerful homebuilder with additional long-term growth potential. Now, I would like to refer you to chart 13 and make some comments regarding unallocated items. As discussed in our earnings release three special items in the first quarter accounted for $49 million of pre-tax earnings. These items included a restructuring reserve of 18 million for our SG&A and R&D cost reduction initiative that we announced in December. Most of the first quarter reserve is for severance for identified personnel reductions across the company. The majority of these reductions are taking place over the remaining quarters of this year. As a result, very little benefit is in the first quarter operating result. We expect additional restructuring expenses of approximately $10 million to $15 million as we complete the overall cost reductions and we expect to achieve our targeted run rate by the end of this year. Special items also included a benefit for $45 million for one quarter of the amortization of the reversal of liability associated with the postretirement amendment. We expect each quarter of this year to have a similar amount. The final special item was a $22 million gain related to the sale of nonstrategic property. Unallocated G&A expenses for the first quarter as shown on chart 13 totalled a positive $1 million. The change when compared to the fourth quarter is primarily the result of income from changes in share based compensation which is driven by the change in order in stock price well as a shift from unallocated pension expense to pension credits due to the performance of the pension assets and a change in the discount rate. Unallocated function expenses were also somewhat lower than normal. I\u2019ll wrap up with some overall financial comments and I\u2019ll refer you to chart 15 for these comments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $780 million down from the $835 million at yearend. The first quarter is typically our lowest cash generation quarter due to the seasonal build in working capital as well as lower housing market activity. Cash flow from operations was $109 million which included income tax related receipts of approximately $60 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $65 million and we expect total expenditure for the year of approximately 400 million. Our long term debt was unchanged from yearend and we have not maturities until 2017. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Patty. I am pleased with our first quarter results as we delivered strong operating performance despite unusually severe winter weather, significantly increased EBITDA from our Longview Timber acquisition and took actions against our commitment to reduce SG&A cost. We are beginning to realize the initial benefits of our operations excellence efforts and I look forward to sharing additional progress with you as the year progresses. We are relentlessly focused everyday on growing a truly company by driving superior operational and financial performance to increase cash flow, grow our dividend, and generate additional shareholder value. With that comment, I think, we will open it for questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions) Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research Group. Mark Weintraub - Buckingham Research Group : Thank you. Congratulations on a very good quarter. You ended the first quarter with 780 million of cash and I believe you\u2019re going to have some more cash coming in as part of the TRI Pointe acquisition as well. Can you give a sense as to what you think is the necessary or the right amount of cash from a longer term basis to run the business that you would tend to want to have recognizing where the first quarter might be different than a different quarter? What order or magnitude? What type of cash level do you typically like have to run the company? Patty Bedient : Good morning, Mark. It\u2019s Patty and I\u2019ll take that one. I think as we think about the cash balance, there are a number of considerations to think about. One of course is where we are in the cycle and we believe we are still in the early innings of the homebuilding recovery, but also what we need for our working capital to support the increased activity.  The other thing of course is what is the level of liquidity? And we have very good liquidity. One of the things I didn\u2019t mention was that we have our line of credit for $1 billion that we have no borrowings outstanding. So as we look at cash going forward, we wouldn\u2019t anticipate that we would need the level of cash that would be indicated by the $780 million that you\u2019ve referenced at the end of the first quarter as well as additional receipts from the TRI Pointe acquisition. The other thing that we will not have going forward of course is the cash generated from income from WRECO, so that\u2019s the other offset to that. So a lot of things that go into that number and so those are the things that we are looking at in terms of what is the best use of that cash going forward to build shareholder value. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Mark Connelly - CLSA: Thank you. Doyle, as we think about operational excellence, should we expect there to be any meaningful impact in your Timber rotations or your harvesting plants in general. Obviously Longview has caused me to have some optimization, but if we leave Longview out of it, is there a meaningful effort that\u2019s going to change in the way you\u2019re managing your Timberlands? Doyle Simons : : Mark, we\u2019re applying our operational excellence within lands across our entire company including Timberland both the Legacy Timberland as well as the Columbia Timberland what we called Columbia Longview Timberland. And just as an example Mark, I would say that in this quarter while we clearly benefited from the higher volume and prices in the quarter, part of the strong quarter in Timberland was a result of the operational excellence initiative that we have put in place specifically in logging and trucking cost improvement and merchandising. And also making sure we get the right log to the right customer to capture the full value. So we\u2019re looking across through an operational excellence lens across all of our businesses including Timberland. And while I can\u2019t speak specifically to the exact impact on the harvesting and that type of thing, I can tell you we have already started to see improvement in our timberland operation as a result of our operational excellence initiatives and a little bit of that showed up in the first quarter. Mark Connelly - CLSA: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful and just one thing. It sounds like you\u2019re going to see the log shift towards China away from Japan a little bit overall year-over-year. What\u2019s happening to the China margins? You\u2019ve talked about improvement in some of your China margins in past quarters. Is this shift going to push the overall margin down or are we seeing China pick up? Patty Bedient : So, Mark, this is Patty. As we think about China, the difference in margins I would say come from some softening in Japan, so as you know, a grade mix that goes to Japan is a little richer grade mix. That also in terms of their competition for that log goes into the overall volume that goes into Asia. So we expect the China margins will see some pressure in terms of just the overall amount and I think I referenced that in our outlook comments, but from a perspective of overall demand from China, we believe that will continue to stay strong. And then as we go forward and get more of the pickup in housing domestically, that domestic log, saw log competes with the China demand, so those two will put tension on each other in terms of the pricing. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merill Lynch. George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Thanks. Hi guys, good morning. Congratulations on the progress. I guess first question on RICO, what would be your interpretation for us in terms of the fact that you do have closings now picking up and cancellations down. And in particular, are you seeing, Doyle, a pick-up in the first time home buyer in the market because that seems to be what's been missing here in the cycle, in terms of extending it going forward? Doyle Simons : George, I agree with you. I think that is what's been missing and for this housing to get back to the 1.5, 1.6, 1.7 level that we've seen historically, we're going to need to see the first time home buyer start to gain some traction. I think we're starting to see a little bit of that, but there's still some challenges in the mortgage market regarding loan availability and the amount that's required to be put down and just the credit scores that are currently required.  Encouragingly I think we're starting to see a little bit of loosening of some of those standards which I think is healthy and that will prompt more first time home buyers into the marketplace. So we are cautiously optimistic that we're going to start to see more and more first time home buyers stepping into the market and we think that's what's going to take this housing starts to the next level. Patricia Bedient : Yeah, George, kind of the other things that is just holding back a little bit that first time home builder or buyer is the fact that the FHA limits have also been reduced somewhat, so I think that's putting a little pressure on that marketplace as well, but as Doyle said overall, as we look forward for housing, we're optimistic about what will happen for the rest of 2014. George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Patty, the FHA limits has been a much discussed topic and it's a good thing you are bringing it up. Do you think that that won't be a burden or an in pediment for a year or do you think if you're through a quarter or two down the road, we should have already had the impact of that in terms of demand? Doyle Simons : Well, I think it's yet to be seen and I think it's one factor in the first time home buyer. I think the other pieces of the overall mortgage availability, as well as just what's happening with consumer confidence and economic activity overall. So, I think if that continues to improve even slowly, but subtly that will overcome some of that pressure that comes from the FHA limits. George Staphos - Bank of America Merill Lynch : Thanks. My last question and I'll turn it over. Within EWP, can you comment or maybe provide a little bit more granularity on why you feel you're on target with some of your operational improvement programs. And Doyle you mentioned you expect or Patty mentioned you expect sales realizations to be up, I guess marginally in the quarter. Is that because of the tail effect from last year or is that because there's some new price increases in the market? Thanks. And good luck in the quarter. Doyle Simons : Good question, George. And on ELP specifically, what we saw in the quarter was we had some start-up costs as we mentioned associated with our evergreen, Alabama mill. We also had some weather impacts in the quarter. We, like I said, remain confident that we're going to increase the earnings in that business by $30 to $40 million EBITDA in 2014 compared with 2013. We also to your point are encouraged and confident, we're going to see some price increases and are already starting to see those in the second quarter versus the first quarter, some of that due to mix, but some of that due to just overall improvement in prices as we move into the stronger spring seasonal period. Operator : Your next question is from the line Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: I guess before I ask my question, Patty, just want to acknowledge the retirement best of luck and I guess we'll have you for another quarter on the call, but thanks for all your help. Patricia Bedient : Thank you. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: I guess just starting with timber, results were higher than what you might have suggested last quarter and I'm just wondering what surprised you in the quarter, where the upside came from relative to what you might have expected? Doyle Simons : Gail, we were encouraged by our results in our timberlands business in the first quarter and I would basically point to three things. One thing was we clearly had higher prices as prices strengthened in the quarter versus the fourth quarter that resulted -- as a result we had a little bit higher volumes to capitalize on those higher prices in the quarter.  The second thing is as I mentioned earlier, we had some benefit from our operational excellence initiatives, specifically in some cost improvement on logging and trucking, and also did a good job of merchandising and what I mean by that as I mentioned earlier is getting the right log to the right customer at the right time to fully maximize the value.  And then third and importantly, we saw a really nice improvement from our Longview acquisition in the quarter. As I mentioned or as we mentioned, that was up approximately $18 million from the prior quarter. We saw about 6 million of synergy benefit or let me put it this way, in terms of the synergies from Columbia, we are at a run rate as of the first quarter about 6 million a quarter, which would translate into about $24 million of synergy benefits on an annual basis. And as you know that\u2019s well ahead of our original target of 20 million in synergy. So those are the three buckets that contributed to the Timberlands improvement in the quarter versus the prior quarter and maybe versus some expectations. Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank : Okay and I don\u2019t suppose you could quantify the operating excellence contribution there? Doyle Simons : As we\u2019ve said before, Gail, we will quantify that on an annual basis because it will be lumpy. But, I will tell you, it did have an impact in -- a significant impact, I guess, it depends on how you define significant, but it did have an impact on the bottom line in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank : And can you talk about maybe the weather impact in the quarter both potentially, if you can quantify what it might have done to you and just maybe taking a step back and what it might mean for the market for instance, lumber seems to have accrued up in Canada. Are you starting to see that come back? So if you could just maybe talk about both, I guess, the financial impact and direct impact as well as how you think it might impact some of the markets as everything unfolds in the second quarter? Doyle Simons : Sure, so let me start off by saying I was proud, we were proud the way our people managed through the tough weather conditions in the quarter. As you know, there was a lot going on. In terms of quantifying the impact, its differential by business as you would expect, but I would say in Timberlands, it was minimal. In our Wood Products business if you look across our Wood Products businesses, the impact by business was somewhere in the $2 to $5 million range per business.  This had to do with things like closures, and lumber for example, we lost 27 days due to closures and distribution. We lost over 50 days due to weather closures. In addition, we had slow backs, as you know when you have frozen logs in a saw mill you can\u2019t run as fast, so that was part of the issue. We had transportation issues in Canada and in the US. And we even had a couple of mills for a short period of time specifically in one of our OSB Mills we're able to get logs to the mill to run. So those were some of the challenges that we had. Again, I thought our people did a really nice job of managing through that in our Wood Products business. And then in our Cellulose Fibers business, Gail, the impact there from weather was approximately $4 million, and that was primarily due to higher energy cost and some railcar availability specifically regarding our Grand Prairie Mill.  In terms of going forward, most of these issues we think are behind us. There we still have transportation challenges that we'll work through specifically in Canada as you talked about, but all-in all we think most of it's behind us and we\u2019ll be able to work through it as we move through the second quarter. Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank : Okay. And just from the market perspective any worries that production build up in Canada as the transport issues unwind will have an impact on the market, is that why you\u2019re looking for fairly muted lumber prices in the quarter? Patty Bedient : So, Gail, I think as we referenced, our realizations thus far in the quarter were softer. I think that likely part of that is due to that issue, but I think now we see them starting to stabilize and think they will move up from this point. So, I think we\u2019ll work through that nicely. Again, it is dependent upon how housing activity comes back, but the underlying fundamentals for housing and now with the improved weather, things look good at this point. Gail Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank : Okay. And just one last question, can you talk about, I guess, looking at WRICO and the activity you\u2019re seeing there and as it suggests for housing activity more broadly, are you seeing, can you kind of quantify and give examples of any seasonal pick up you\u2019re seeing and also you operate in regions that would have been affected by weather but also ones that probably weren\u2019t? And did you note a difference in trend beyond just the underlying market fundamentals that gives you confidence, some of the sluggishness in housing or a lot of the sluggishness in housing in the first quarter was weather related versus something else? Patty Bedient : Sure. I think there are a couple of things as we look at our own markets. If you think about our Winchester subsidiary, which is in the Washington D.C. area was really hammered by weather, even the first part of the second quarter hammered by weather, so it\u2019s a little tough to see exactly the impact that weather had, how much of it, but it was significant and we\u2019re starting to see that now come back around.  I think the other in the first quarter markets that were a little rougher were not surprisingly those that were potentially a little overheated in the prior year and I would reference Phoenix and Las Vegas there. Phoenix is now stabilizing as well so that\u2019s a good thing, California, Los Angeles is doing well and here in the Puget Sound of course, the market did not go down as far as some of the other markets that we had.  Texas also continues to remain strong, so I think again as we look forward, a lot of that's behind us, I think the other thing that has put a little bit of a dampening effect on the marketplace is sort of a good news bad news, we had some pretty significant price increases over the course of last year and I think that has slowed that a little bit, so we don't have as many closings as we'd like but they're closing at higher prices, so one sort of helps to offset the other one, but as I said before, we are much more excited now about homebuilding as we look forward with this really harsh weather in so many geographies behind us. Operator :  Your next question is from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs :  Can you remind us how much incremental capacity the Evergreen, Alabama plant will add to the EWP business and where your utilization rates will be once that plant starts up? Patty Bedient :  You know, in Evergreen, which is, it has started up now and it will be shipping product the first of May, it produces two products primarily, I-joist and microlam and we have about 61 million Lineal feet would be the capacity that we would note for I-joist and about 4 million cubic feet for microlam solid sections.  In terms of its moving into commercial production now, it won't be operating at full capacity to start with as we move that product into the marketplace. I think overall if we were to discount the Evergreen mill we're operating across that part of the business in engineered wood at around 70% but it's very differential by product line. For example, our microlam product is operating at very, very high operating rates. That's one of the reasons that we're excited about having the availability from Evergreen coming online. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs :  Appreciate that detail, Patty and then pulp, there's been recent price erosion on the softwood side in China even though inventory seems to be in pretty good shape. Do you have any thoughts on why we've seen prices move lower in China and any visibility into the pulp price environment in China over next couple of months? Patty Bedient :  Well I think as we look at one of the things that puts pressure on paper grade softwood is of course the additional hardwood capacity that is coming online, but China does need softwood to go with the hardwood so I think even though prices may soften here later that we still are feeling good about pricing overall moving up in the second quarter and that would certainly include our fluff pulp price going up as well. Doyle Simons :  Yes, Alex if you look at the -- as we mentioned first quarter and fourth quarter clearly fluff prices were up and we anticipate that trend will continue into the second quarter and part of that has been the disruption in the overall supply side of the equation due to the weather but we do think that's going to carryover clearly into the second quarter overall. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets :  Thanks very much, good morning. Just a couple questions on Timberlands exports. My understanding is Chinese log and lumber inventories are actually pretty high right now. I guess a question is are you seeing the same thing and then just on your reference to the consumption tax increase in Japan and the slower refile there. Can you quantify that? Do you expect that down 5-10% in Q2? Doyle Simons :  From the Chinese perspective, I think inventories did build a little bit during the Lunar New Year period as I referenced in my comments. We anticipate as that gets behind us that demand will in fact continue to increase in China and that will be helpful in decreasing the overall log inventories in China.  In terms of Japan, if you look at it historically when there's been a change to the consumption tax, you normally see a little bit of pre-buying and then you see a little bit of weakness as it goes in and then stabilization. And it's hard to tell exactly how that's going to play out this time but our guess is it's going to be a similar type pattern. We probably did see a little bit of pre buying, now we're in the period where there may be a little bit of weakness due to the adjustment to the consumption tax, but long term, we continue to be very encouraged by the demand out of Japan. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then just on operational excellence, it looks like you're getting some traction there. Just wondering, if you're able to share at some point in the future your targets, your timing and sort of the CapEx required to get where you want to get to? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So let me talk generally about OpEx across all of our businesses and I would tell you we're encouraged by the progress that we've made against the targets that we laid out in December. As we previously said we will quantify the benefits on an annual basis but let me give just a little bit of color directionally on some of the benefits that we're starting to see. I already hit on Timberlands a little bit, but clearly part of our good quarter in Timberlands was a result of our operational excellence initiatives. And specifically, as I mentioned earlier regarding cost improvement on logging and trucking and also on merchandising, again making sure we get the right log to the right spot.  In terms of lumber, our manufacturing costs were lower than the prior quarter. That as you know is the key focus of our operational excellence efforts. I will tell you that was somewhat hampered in quarter by weather, but I can tell you plans are in place to start to really capture the benefits from our efforts there in the second quarter and we're confident we'll see the benefit of that in the second quarter and going forward. And our OSB business, the reliability, was a challenge our key focus areas, it\u2019s improving our reliability again as we laid out on December 17th, that was challenged during the quarter, due to weather but we start to see an improvement late in the quarter and that improvements continued into the second quarter. And then the other initiative there is to improve our mix of high value products or enhanced products and just as an example there, we're starting to make our flooring product at our Hudson Bay mill.  In ELP, as I mentioned earlier, we had some weather impacts, but we are confident that we will see the improvements that we've laid out in ELP. And similarly in distribution, where we are there, as I mentioned had over 50 days of closure due to weather in the first quarter, but I can tell you, all of our sites has completed, an extensive analysis of the customers, the products lines, pricing, the warehouse cost and delivery cost and I can tell you one by one those sites are turning to profitability and we are encouraged by what we're seeing there. In sales Fibers -- we can give you a number of examples of operational excellence but I think the one that I would highlight for the first quarter is we had record production at a number of our mills, despite the very severe winter weather and that's not the case across the board, if you look at what happened in that business overall and when I say in that business, I mean in that industry overall in the quarter, so we did a good job of running those mills, despite the tough weather. And then we talked about SG&A and we're making great progress on our SG&A. I'm confident we're going to get where we need to be.  So I think the summary is we're on track. We're working hard on this operational excellence every day. We're starting to see some benefit and much more to come and we'll like I said we will update you on an annual basis on exactly where we are versus the targets that we laid out on December 17th. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: Just two quick questions. First of all, can you just tell us what criteria would determine whether a split or a spin is preferable? Patricia Bedient : Sure, Steve. As we think about those, we think about the spin as being like a special dividend and the split is more akin to a share repurchase. So if you think about the criteria that you would use for each of those. In addition, one of the things that we look at when we look at the spin versus the split is, of course, in the spin you're just issuing the shares pro-rata to the existing Weyerhaeuser shareholder base. In a split, shareholders are given a choice to exchange their Weyerhaeuser shares for the shares of what we think is a very strong home builder going forward. So the split gives the investor base the opportunity to choose which one. And we think that it has the added advantage of then placing the stock with its more -- its natural investor base. Whereas there may be some people who are Weyerhaeuser shareholders who would say I don't really want to own homebuilding long-term, I want more of a forest products exposure, and so it really is the fact that one is simpler, certainly the spin is much simpler, and the split though a little more complex, does have the ability to place the stock with more of its investor base and it is the split is what we did in when we did the downtown transaction in 2007, although it is a little more complex to execute, it is something we have done in the past. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: It does make sense I guess to get it in the hands of those who want it. From a tax perspective, is one more advantageous than the other? Patty Bedient : No, there really isn\u2019t any difference from one versus the other. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: Okay, thank you for that. And then the second question was you\u2019ve elaborated on why you remain confident in the housing recovery, so can you just tell us how you position the Wood Products business? Is your operating stance predicated on an 18% increase in starts which is the difference between 2013 and the 1.1 million that you expect or is it based on your order filed from week to week? Doyle Simons : Well, I would say it\u2019s both of the above. We clearly are matching our supply with our demand but we\u2019re also as we look forward, we continue to anticipate an improvement in housing as we said. So you factor in all of those equations as you look to the future for our wood products business, but I like the way we\u2019re positioned in our Wood Products business. Our focus as mentioned earlier is just running the capacity that we have better. And we\u2019re starting to make improvements in doing just that. And in terms of our overall, if you look at it, any of our mills that we closed have either been started up so which was evergreen or permanently closed. We do not have any mills sitting idle at this point. And like I said, I like where we\u2019re positioned in Wood Products and think we\u2019re very well positioned to fully capitalize on the continued improvement in housing going forward. Steve Chercover - D.A. Davidson: So you\u2019re ready to serve 1.1 million starts but you\u2019re not going to run for practice, right. Doyle Simons : That is correct. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon. Chip Dillon : Three quick ones. Good morning, Doyle and Patty, and Kathy. And again good luck to you Kathy as you later this year move on into retirement. I wanted to you ask first on the land sales now that we have a reconfigured Timberland business with the Longview properties, is sort of the second quarter, is that an usually high level land sales you would expect going forward? And I know it's erratic or would that represent kind of a normal level? Patty Bedient : : Well, it is lumpy from quarter-to-quarter, sort of historically if you can call it seasonality to it. The first quarter is usually a little lower. The second quarter at 20 million does not involve Longview land sales. So, it\u2019s not that activity is not coming as a function of Longview. So I would say that 20 million probably is more on the high side from a quarterly perspective so that would give you a run rate of around 80, but it\u2019s going be lumpy from quarter-to-quarter and from year-to-year really based upon the opportunity that we see. So we look to upgrade the portfolio through the land sales because those are for the most part, exchanges that we are doing. So it\u2019s a function of continuing to look for the best opportunity and that\u2019s why you see the lumpiness, we're not trying to hit it a particular target in any one quarter, it\u2019s really opportunistic. Chip Dillon : I see and then I guess the second one is, I know in December that kind of the two sub-businesses within Wood Products had sort of need the improvement, obviously our EWP and distribution, and I was wondering sort of when do you get to a point where they need to show the kind of improvement you expect them to versus maybe making of a decision from those businesses? In other words would that be a couple of years or maybe a year? Doyle Simons : Chip, as we very specifically said on December 17, we anticipate and fully expect both of those businesses or each of those businesses, let me be very clear, each of those businesses to improve EBITDA about $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013. At this point, we remain confident that that\u2019s in fact exactly what\u2019s going to happen and we\u2019re taking a lot of very proactive steps to make sure that is in fact the case. So that\u2019s the timeline we\u2019ve played out and that\u2019s the timeline we\u2019re committed to. Chip Dillon : Okay, very clear, and one quick one for Patty. The interest expense for the first quarter at 83 million was a little less than we thought, is that a good run rate to use for that the rest of year assuming nothing big -- well forgetting the -- even with split off, would you assume not to change much? Patty Bedient : Yes, I think that that should probably be a pretty good. That is net of capitalized interest. So a few million can change quarter-to-quarter depending upon what projects we\u2019re doing, but there shouldn\u2019t be anything particularly different in that number going forward. Operator :  Your final question will come from the line of Colin Ming, with Raymond James. Colin Ming - Raymond James :  Hey, good morning, just real quick, going back to the question about really the cash balance, in the past you guys have talked about using some of your cash position to continue to grow that Timberland portfolio. Can you maybe just update us on what you\u2019re seeing from your perspective on the acquisition environment and are there, any other deals you guys are looking at on that front. Doyle Simons :  I would just say, we are constantly looking at opportunities to grow our Timberland base, now we will as we have historically we\u2019ll be very disciplined in doing that and we\u2019re not going to grow just for the sake of growing, if we can find acquisition opportunities like the Longview acquisition where we can drive value for shareholders that\u2019s something we will pursue going forward, so, we\u2019re, as we\u2019ve have been historically and we continue to be, we look at lots of different acquisition opportunities but we will be continue to be very disciplined in the way we approach those going forward. Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thanks Doyle, and then Patty maybe can you just remind us are there any sort of restrictions tied to the proceeds coming from WRECO, the $700 million plus or minus, just given the way that the homebuilder unit was in the TRS and then just the nature of the transaction, are there going to be any near term restrictions related to that incoming cash? Patty Bedient :  Yes, Colin as you think about that cash, it is unrestricted but as you referenced, it is coming into the TRS, so there are no additional restrictions as a result of it coming from the home building business other than the fact that would be the same as any other cash that is in the TRS in terms of moving at around between the REIT and the TRS but it is totally unrestricted other than that. Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, well, can you maybe just remind us like some of the mechanisms to get that, that amount of cash out of the TRS and up to the REIT? Patty Bedient :  Well one of the things that certainly you can do is dividend cash from the TRS to the REIT, there are limitations as to how much cash can be dividended in any particular year and that\u2019s really a function of the earnings in Timberland business.  The other thing that you can do, there is no restriction in terms of borrowing cash from the TRS, although you do need to pay interest income on that borrowing from one to the other. Certainly if you want to move cash down you can make a capital contribution, but I think your question is more about moving cash from the TRS up to the REIT, so you can loan it up without restriction, you just have to pay interest income on that down to the TRS. Colin Ming - Raymond James : Okay, and then just, you guys referenced in kind of you, I think your 2Q outlook in some of the prepared remarks just about some of the momentum you\u2019re starting to see in the US south as far as log pricing there, can you guys quantify that at all, I mean we\u2019ve kind of heard mixed messages depending upon which specific region you\u2019re in, generally the Gulf south not being as strong but kind of Georgia, Florida, the Carolinas being a little bit stronger, can you just maybe put a little additional color on that, maybe quantify the type of movement you\u2019re seeing in the south. Doyle Simons :  You know, I would answer that by saying, if you look at 2013, prices in the log prices in the south were up roughly 4%. As we said in our comments and as shown on the slides, prices were up again modestly in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter and what we anticipate is a slow but certain increase in log prices in the south going forward, yes, by quarter by quarter it will vary by region and you\u2019ll see one move up more than the other but overall we are encouraged by the trend that we see and are confident that over time prices will continue to improve in the south as we see housing continue to rebound. Colin Ming \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, great, congrats on the quarter. Doyle Simons : : Thank you. Okay, as I understand it that was our last question, I\u2019d like to just end by thanking everybody for joining in this morning and thanks for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator :  Thank you for joining us today, you may now disconnect.",

On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered a solid earnings performance in the second quarter driven by very strong results in each of our businesses and reflecting our employees\u2019 relentless focus on operational excellence. This morning we reported second quarter net earnings of $280 million or $0.47 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $2 billion. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $234 million or $0.40 per diluted share. This is an increase of nearly 65% compared with the first quarter and almost 30% compared with one year ago. Special items in the quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to the post retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. Earnings associated with Weyerhaeuser real-estate company RICO are being reported as discontinued operations as a result of the divestiture of that business on July 7. I would like to thank the Weyerhaeuser and RICO employees for their hard work in completing this transaction. As part of the RICO transaction, we retired nearly 59 million common shares worth over $1.9 billion. These retirements which will be reflected in our third quarter share count more than offset the common shares issued in conjunction with last year\u2019s Longview Timber acquisition. I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Severe winter weather earlier this year dampened the start of the spring building season and the U.S. housing market recovery remained sluggish with total housing start up only 6% in the first half of 2014 compared with 2013. Rising employment and strong consumer confidence support our expectation of further housing market improvements. However, we have lowered our 2014 housing outlook as a result of the weaker market during the first half of the year and are now planning for between 1 million and 1.1 million starts. The bottom line is we believe that residential housing markets will continue to improve but at a slower rate than it had been previously anticipated. Let me now turn to our business segments starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands posted another outstanding quarter contributing $170 million to earnings. In the West, we experienced steady demand in our domestic markets, our realizations from Western domestic logs declined. Although overall Chinese demand softened somewhat during the quarter as a result of elevated inventory to support our sales volumes to our customers increased compared with the first quarter and our pricing remained comparable. As anticipated, Japanese demand weakened in the second quarter due to the effect of the increased consumption tax. Western logging and road cost increased seasonally as we log our higher elevations in the summer months when snow is not present. We remain extremely pleased with the performance of our Longview Timber acquisition which contributed $51 of EBITDA in the quarter. In the South, sea harvest volumes declined due to wet weather and log prices rose by approximately 1% compared with the first quarter. Second quarter also included $24 million from dispositions of non-strategic Timberlands an increase of $20 million compared with the first quarter. The Timberlands segment continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives including reduction and stomp to customer logging cost and increased extraction of export quality logs. Wood products charts 6 and 7, wood products earned $102 million in the second quarter, an improvement of nearly 60% compared with the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $132 million compared with $93 million in the first quarter and sales volumes increased seasonally across all our product lines. In lumber, EBITDA improved by $9 million as high sales volumes due to improved weather and seasonality were partially offset by lower average price realizations. Lumber manufacturing costs continued to decline as a result of our operational excellence initiative which are focused on lowering our costs net of logs. In OSB, EBITDA was flat as lower realizations were offset by growth and enhanced products and improved productivity. Results for engineered wood products improved significantly compared with first quarter as EBITDA increased nearly fourfold to $30 million. Sales volumes increased more than 25% for solid section products and nearly 40% for TGI Joists, and average realizations for both products rose slightly. The business also benefited from lower manufacturing costs compared with the prior quarter as a result of operational excellence initiatives and the successful ramp-up of the evergreen Alabama mill. Our distribution business reported EBITDA of $3 million in the second quarter, an improvement of $8 million. The business remains focused on lowering cost and improving sales and margins. We\u2019re extremely pleased with the progress that our engineered wood products and distribution businesses made against their operational excellence targets in the quarter. Cellulose fibers, chart 8 and 9, cellulose fibers earned $91 million, a substantial increased compared with $54 million in the first quarter. Fluff realizations were strong and maintenance cost declined due to fewer schedule maintenance outage dates. The business had another excellent quarter operationally and set a year-to-date record for productivity. Discontinued operations, chart 11. As I indicated in my opening remarks, results from our real-estate business are now reported as discontinued operations. Second quarter results include after-tax earnings of $22 million from discontinued operations compared with $10 million in the first quarter. The improvement was primarily due to a seasonal increase in home closings. At the end of the second quarter, we clearly identified all planned cost reductions associated with our SG&A initiative. Implementation is ongoing and we incurred an additional $6 million of restructuring charges in the quarter relating to this initiative. I\u2019m highly confident we will reach our $75 million run rate reduction target by the end of the year. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook. Patty Bedient : Thanks Doyle, and good morning everybody. The housing recovery thus far in 2014 has been slower than anticipated. However, this week\u2019s better than expected forecast on GDP growth for the remainder of the year was welcome news. The outlook for the third quarter earnings is summarized on chart 12, and I\u2019ll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the west, export log realizations and volumes are expected to decline as a result of normal seasonal softening. The Japan market is normally weaker during the summer months as a result of rainy weather. In addition to the normal seasonality, the Japanese lumber market has been adversely affected by the implementation of the consumption tax increase. High log inventories at Chinese courts will also likely result in lower demand and prices. Domestic log markets are anticipated to be weaker as well during the third quarter. Softer export markets combined with the increased supply of logs that typically come to market during the third quarter from the smaller non-industrial private land owners who do not have adequate road systems to harvest on year round basis are expected to exert downward pressure on prices. As a result in anticipation of the softer markets in the third quarter, we intentionally accelerated harvest into the first half of this year. For these reasons, we anticipate a lower fee harvest in the west in the third quarter compared to the second. Supply constraints as a result of fire related logging restrictions could result in some upward price pressure in certain markets especially in Oregon. In the third quarter we also expect seasonal increases in western road costs. In the south, we expect that fee harvest will increase as some harvest in the second quarter was delayed due to wet weather. In addition, we typically perform more of our spending activity on the third quarter, which increases volumes and lowers the average realizations due to mix. We are also anticipating higher cost due to seasonal increase in silvicultural activities. Earnings from non-strategic land sales should also decrease compared to the higher levels of the second quarter. We expect that overall earnings in our Timberland segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second but comparable to the third quarter of last year. In wood products, we expect that sales realizations will be down slightly for both lumber and OSB with relatively consistent volumes. Sales realizations for engineered lumber will be up as a result of price increases that were effective as of the beginning of this quarter. Engineered lumber volumes could be somewhat lower due to orders that may have been called forward into the second quarter as a result of the announced price increase. Log cost in the west should decrease in the quarter and also in Canada to a larger extent. Housing demand has been more muted than expected, however our inventories continue to be in great shape across our system. And our continued focus on cost reduction and operating efficiencies continues to benefit all businesses. We expect that earnings in the third quarter in the wood product segment will be comparable to the second quarter. In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood inventories as beginning of this quarter were in good shape at a couple of days below normal. We do see some softening in paper grade especially into China and we expect that inventory levels will return to normal during the quarter. Fluff demand globally remains healthy and our order books are full. The most significant change in our Cellulose Fibers business in the third quarter will be an extended planned outage at our Longview liquid packaging operation. We will be completing a number of capital improvements that have been planned for some time. These include upgrades to the press section, evaporators, digester and head-box. The improvements will lower energy and fiber costs and increase the quality of the board and product mix. Although the outage will result in increased maintenance cost, our sales volumes will be only somewhat lower as we have been building inventory in anticipation of this outage and we have had excellent year-to-date operating reliability. In addition to the liquid packaging outage, we will also have increased plan maintenance in our port mill system compared to the second quarter. Overall, we expect that earnings in our sale of fiber segment will be significantly lower in the third quarter compared to the second quarter and more comparable to the first quarter of this year. Our real-estate results have been restated for all periods to show RICO operations has discontinued. At the end of the second quarter, our balance sheet was grossed up for funds RICO borrowed in anticipation of the transaction. Both the cash and the debt are included in discontinued operations as of June 30 and were eliminated after the end of the quarter when the divestiture was completed. As previously announced, we closed the divestiture on July 7. As a result, our share count was reduced by approximately 59 million shares bringing our current share count to just under 530 million. In addition, we received over $700 million in cash. Our third quarter results will show a gain on the divestiture of approximately $1 billion. Chart 10 summarizes the unallocated items for the second quarter. In the third quarter we expect that we will once again have a special item for the pretax gain of approximately $45 million related to an earlier post retirement health plan amendment which we are amortizing ratably over the year. Other ongoing unallocated items are difficult to forecast, as they are driven by changes in foreign exchange, share price and inventory levels. Chart 13 summarizes certain financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $845 million, an increase of almost $70 million. There was no change to our long-term debt of just under $4.9 billion and we have no maturities until 2017. As of the end of the second quarter, we had year-to-date capital expenditures including reforestation of $159 million and we still expect the total for the year to approximate $400 million. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Patty. Through the RICO divestiture and Longview Timber acquisition we have positioned Weyerhaeuser as a focused force products company with a productive asset base and significant runway for earnings growth and cash generation. Our strong second quarter results reflect our employee\u2019s commitment to operational excellence. And we remain focused on driving superior returns from our assets to generate value for our shareholders. Thank you. And now I would like to open the call to questions. Operator : (Operator Instructions). Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi: Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Anthony. Patty Bedient : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi: I had a couple of questions in Wood Products. In engineered wood products it looks like you\u2019ve got $20 million of EBITDA improvement year-to-date. And I believe that you had the $30 million to $40 million target for the year. And given the progress thus far, do you feel like maybe you\u2019ll be at the top end of that range? Is there maybe potential upside to that target? And then, also for the three main businesses within wood products, I was wondering if you could share what your operating rates were in the quarter? Doyle Simons : So, let\u2019s start with your first question and in our ELP business, Anthony, we were very encouraged by the progress we made in the quarter. As you referenced, we went from $8 million of EBITDA to $30 million, from $8 million of EBITDA in the first quarter to $30 million of EBITDA in the second quarter. Also as you referenced, our commitment was to improve EBITDA in that business by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013. And we think we\u2019re well on the way to doing that, that\u2019s the commitment we\u2019re going to work to get as much earnings out of that business as we can get in 2014. And like I said, we\u2019re encouraged about the progress we made to date. In terms of operating rates, if you will start with lumber, lumber operating rates were in the low 90%. OSB, was approximately 90% and then ELP overall and as you know that the mixture of products was in mid-70s in terms of operating rates for that business. Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi: Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just a follow-up maybe on Cellulose Fibers. The project in liquid packaging board, is that going to result in any material increase in capacity or is it just a cost measure? Patty Bedient : Anthony, the most important part of that project is cost reduction and quality improvement. We will get some increased capacity maybe in the around 10% range but that project really was done to lower our energy and our fiber cost and as I said improved the product quality. Anthony Pettinari \u2013 Citi: Okay, that\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research : Thank you. Just following up a little bit on the liquid packaging and the Cellulose Fibers, can you give us a sense as to roughly how much the outages, are going to impact the third quarter relative to the second quarter? Doyle Simons : Sure Mark. As we indicated in the comments, we anticipate earnings will be lower in the third quarter versus the second quarter in Cellulose Fiber. And that is primarily if not wholly driven by the outages. Just to quantify it a little bit, we think the Longview liquid packaging outage will result in roughly $30 million of the impact. And as we also said we have additional outages compared to the prior quarter in our port mills. And that would be another $5 million to $10 million impact on the third quarter versus the second quarter. Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research : Great. And then, is it fair to say that when you come out of it the other end, you not only get that back but presumably from the project, picking the liquid packaging, you hopefully have even higher earnings power assuming pricing and markets are similar. And any way to give us a feel for the type of returns or earning enhancement that you might get from the project? Doyle Simons : Well, as Patty alluded to Mark, the project will do three things, improve quality, lower cost and then have roughly 10%, over time it will take a little bit time to get there but 10% improvement in production. So, all those things will factor in. We won\u2019t provide a specific number but clearly the reason for doing that project is to drive additional earnings in cash out of our liquid packaging board operation. Mark Weintraub \u2013 Buckingham Research : Okay. Thank you and congratulations for the evidence of continued operational improvement. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Yes, good morning Doyle and congratulations on a great quarter. Doyle Simons : Thanks Chip. Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : I wanted to ask you about distribution, I know that it seemed like in the first quarter hadn\u2019t really turned much of a quarter but on the numbers I see here, it looks like you went from something like $16 million EBITDA loss from the first half of \u201813 to $2 million loss in the first half of \u201814. So, it may not be \u2013 it may not have arrived yet, but it looks like if the needle is moving in the right direction, do you still think you\u2019ll get to your goals for the year or have your feelings about the business changed any in the last three to six months? Doyle Simons : So, we\u2019re very encouraged about the progress we\u2019ve made in distribution Chip. And as you will recall, the objective there is to improve earnings about $30 million to $40 million. In that business versus 2013, we think we\u2019re absolutely on track to do that. I can tell you there is a real focus on continuing to grow profitable share, making sure our cost are at the target levels. And I\u2019ll just tell you we\u2019re encouraged as now more than half of our sites are in fact profitable and we see more and more of those becoming profitable as we move forward. So again very \u2013 lots of work to do as you mentioned but very encouraged by the progress that\u2019s been made over the past couple of quarters. Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Okay. And then on the $1 billion gain on RICO, is the early tax impact on that that we should anticipate in the third quarter? Patty Bedient : No Chip, that transaction as we talked about was done in a reverse more structure. And that is one of the benefits of that structure is there is a tax on that gain. Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : I see, and then lastly, just on the dividend at this point, I would imagine with $700 million plus coming in from RICO and with the strong results and I know the third quarter is not going to be quite a repeat. But with the lower share count, is that something that you guys are thinking about in the near-term in terms of bringing? Doyle Simons : So, Chip, as we previously disclosed, we\u2019re going to be visiting with our board in mid-August regarding the dividend, potentially use of cash proceeds and those types of things. Just to remind you and everybody else, as we think about capital allocation and what our financial priorities are, as you know, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders primarily through a growing dividend but also about share repurchase where appropriate. Second, is investing our business to high return projects. And then, just as you heard on sale this morning, then improved cost structure and our margin and of course we\u2019ll also look for opportunities to grow our business through value creating acquisitions. Again, an example there would be Longview. And then, finally, making sure we maintain the appropriate capital structure. And as you know we\u2019re in good shape on that front. So that\u2019s the way we think about it and again we\u2019ll read back to you in mid-August. Chip Dillon \u2013 Vertical Research Partners : Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: Hi, good morning. Patty Bedient : Good morning, Gail. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Gail. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: Maybe going back to engineered wood for a little bit, the volume growth that you had relative to the comments about housing maybe not picking up as quickly as you thought and given how much engineered wood is driven by housing. I mean, what do you think of your volumes, were you picking up share, was there an inventory build or do you think that volume has actually been used? Doyle Simons : I think there are a couple of things that were happening. Or I\u2019m guessing there were a couple of things that were happening there. I think first as we mentioned Gail, there is a price increase going into effect, and first is third quarter. So, I think there might have been some pull forward in terms of buying in the second quarter versus the third quarter. So I think that\u2019s part of the equation. I will also tell you as I mentioned earlier, we had a very focused sales effort in that business and I\u2019m encouraged by the progress we\u2019re making there. So, I think our sales folks did a really good job of growing profitable share in that business in the second quarter as well. Patty Bedient : And Gail, as Doyle referenced in his remarks, we did bring up the ever green Alabama facility so all of our engineered wood products facilities now are operating. And so that came up starting shipping product in May so we\u2019ll have it for the full quarter in the third quarter. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: Okay. And going, and looking at Cellulose Fiber, was there anything in the second quarter result that you wouldn\u2019t view as sustainable, I mean, I was wondering, it is your best quarter since 2011, pricing reported didn\u2019t move dramatically. I\u2019m just wondering, kind of what you think of that upside? Patty Bedient : Well, probably the thing that drove the upside the most was just outstanding operational performance across the Cellulose Fibers system. And I think that all of the hard work that they\u2019ve been doing is paying off and I would look to that being sustainable and repeatable as we go forward. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: Okay. And looking at the Japanese market, I guess what trends did you see moving through the quarter obviously the tax went up at the start of the quarter? Were things still getting worse or they\u2019re stable, just how do you see that market? Patty Bedient : Are you talking primarily on logs? Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: The logs market, yes. Patty Bedient : So, we had thought that it would be impacted we started to see some impact in the second quarter and that continued into the third quarter. It\u2019s a little difficult to tell for sure because as I mentioned, the third quarter is normally seasonally weaker. But I think the latest news that we\u2019ve heard just earlier this week was that the Japanese government is thinking that the impact of the consumption task, now this is broadly was not as significant as many once thought. And that it is starting to come up and they see more activity towards the second half of the year. But we\u2019ll have to see. But certainly it is softer in the third quarter. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: Okay. And just one last question, your Timberlands guidance for the quarter, can you give the sense of what type of land sale activity might be incorporated in that? Doyle Simons : So, share it. Patty Bedient : It\u2019s about \u2013 it will be lower than the second quarter as we mentioned, it will probably be somewhere around $8 million to $10 million lower than the second quarter. Gail Glazerman \u2013 UBS: Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Doyle Simons : Good morning Alex. Patty Bedient : Good morning. Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Couple of questions, starting off, engineered wood products. Can you put a little bit more meat around how much you think pre-buy may have contributed to the volume number in the second quarter? I guess we\u2019re now through July kind of looking at how the divine trends were in EWP in July. Does that sort of give you any incremental insight into how much pre-buy there was in the second quarter? Doyle Simons : Well, it is always difficult to assess pre-buy, I would tell you our activity in the month of July continued to be good. So, I would tell you there are some \u2013 there clearly was some pre-buy in the month, in the second quarter. But we didn\u2019t see just a dramatic fall-off in July so we continue to be encouraged by those markets and our sales efforts in those markets. Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful Doyle. And then, when you talk about share, so taking share in the EWP, is that again just traditional lumber or would that be against other players in the EWP market? Doyle Simons : And again, it\u2019s hard to know exactly what happens on shares because we don\u2019t see all the different information. But really what we\u2019re talking about when we talk about profitable growth is just growing the ELP business overall. And there are some coming out of saw logs maybe but that\u2019s not specifically what we\u2019re talking \u2013 when I say I didn\u2019t mean all of it, some of it coming out of lumber, possibly but that\u2019s not really what we\u2019re referring to. Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, understood. And then, just one last one, Patty, on the corporate line, just from a modeling perspective, so, is it really just zero to minus 5 an then everything else is kind of noise around like you said currency and inventories and some of the other things as well on that line? Patty Bedient : Yes, Alex, as I mentioned, it is difficult to forecast. And that\u2019s one of the reasons why when we put this information together we\u2019ve started putting that chart 10 together for you just so you can see what it looks like in the number of things that move around. So, if for us, the foreign exchange really is a function of the Canadian exchange rate. So as that moves, our share based comp certainly you can track that with the stock price. And then, there are just a whole lot of other stuff that goes in there. This quarter, and as we go forward, the other thing that we are focused on is lowering our G&A but we will have some costs on a go forward basis that were historically allocated to the RICO business. And we are focused on making those costs lower as well. But you may see some choppiness as a result of that as we work through the G&A cost. Alex Ovshey \u2013 Goldman Sachs : Okay, got you. All right, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Patty Bedient : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Good morning, Doyle, good morning, Patty. Patty Bedient : Good morning, Mark. Doyle Simons : Good morning Mark. Good to hear you. Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Good to be here. I wondered if you guys could talk a little bit about just this shift that we\u2019ve seen over the last year and where your log exports are going because it\u2019s been a pretty marked drop off in the proportion of the volume that goes to Japan and about a 20% to 40% in terms of the growth in what\u2019s going to China? Patty Bedient : Sure Mark. It really is a function of not Japan getting smaller but the China market growing. And so, as you think about the percentage of the pie to those markets, it moves around. What we\u2019re really focused on is growing the pie, and Japan continues to be an extremely good market and important market to us. But what\u2019s moving that really is more growth in the China market in terms of incremental growth. Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : And Patty, does that, should that change sort of your average just realization in your export log prices, because my understanding is always that China doesn\u2019t buy as high priced of log as what goes into the Japanese market? Patty Bedient : Yes, that\u2019s fair Mark. From a mixed perspective, you will see the average realization come down. But you will still see a spread between the specific China log compared to the Japanese log. Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Yes. And how would you think about that spread right now? Patty Bedient : It\u2019s closing a little bit but they\u2019re both \u2013 both of them have come down in the quarter as we talked about. So I don\u2019t know that the spread is changing all that much. Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Just a couple of other quick ones. Doyle can you talk a little bit about how you would think about both investments and/or acquisitions outside of Timberlands, say in the Wood Products area? And then can you give us a little color on that joint venture you announced with Pioneer? Doyle Simons : Okay. In terms of the way we look at acquisition opportunities in wood products, Mark. We will, as we\u2019ve said, we would be interested in potentially growing our wood products business but we\u2019re going to be very disciplined. We\u2019re not going to grow those businesses just for the sake of growing. And if we find one-off opportunities that something we would consider, but our primary focus in our wood products business is we\u2019ve said, it\u2019s just running on what we have better. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re focused on doing every day. Patty Bedient : Mark, I think you\u2019re referencing the licensing that we did on some of our technology IP international intellectual property. And I think it\u2019s an important recognition of the importance and the strength of our intellectual property. But I will tell you that it\u2019s not a meaningful increase in terms of our quarterly results. Mark Wilde \u2013 BMO Capital Markets : Okay. Very good. That\u2019s helpful. Good luck in the second half of the year. Patty Bedient : Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA: Thank you. To follow on Mark\u2019s question, so the market in Asia for logs is moving in the direction that you said last quarter you thought it would. Does that change the way you think about your Timberland mix? Over the years, obviously Weyerhaeuser bulked up on higher value species and got rid of a lot of the lower value, Hemlock and other lower value stuff. So, are we likely to see Weyerhaeuser maybe attempt to move that shift back to owning or being more willing to own lower value species in the Pacific Northwest? Patty Bedient : Well, Mark, we are focused primarily on Douglas Fir, that is what our most of our lands are best suited to grow. We do have some Whitewoods as well. And so, as you know, not every acre grows best the same species. So I would say we will continue to have a focus on Douglas Fir but our Whitewoods inventory will be important as well. Although it does come at a lower price point based on the quality. Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA: Okay. And then a second question, you\u2019ve said that you have catch up investing to do, particularly in Wood Products. When do you think you will have caught up? Will that happen this year or next? And what do you think of as normal spending in manufacturing and maintenance, once that catch up is done? Doyle Simons : So, Mark, we\u2019re spending a lot of time working on capital issues currently. We will, as always once we make some decisions for next year, either late this year or early next year we will be passing those on to you. It will take more than one year period to get our \u2013 to make the investments in some of our wood product operations that we need to, to get our cost structure to where we want it to be. And as you know, that\u2019s the real focus of the investment we\u2019re going to make going forward is to continue to drive down our cost structure in order to fully accomplish the OpEx initiatives that we laid out. So, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it. And as we develop more detail, we will be sharing that with you. Mark Connelly \u2013 CLSA: Thank you. That\u2019s very helpful. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America : Thanks, hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. I guess my first question I wanted to go back to distribution. And Doyle recognizing there were a number of factors that you had mentioned in past, that you were focused on in terms of improving the profitability. Were there one or two key things that you did this quarter better as a business than you did first quarter or second quarter last year that drove the swing in profitability? And could you comment to those things? Doyle Simons : Sure, sure George. And it really is, when you step back and look at it, it\u2019s getting the focus where it needs to be and just doing the blocking and tackling better. But just a couple of things that I would highlight is, we set very specific targeted cost levels that we needed to accomplish in our distribution business to get \u2013 start to get earnings to where they needed to be. And we made significant progress towards those target levels in the second quarter. And then the other thing I would say is, while we\u2019ve been successful in driving the top-line in that business as I referred, we haven\u2019t always had a focus on driving what I call a profitable share. And I think our folks did a really nice job of growing business that added profit to the bottom line in the quarter. So, those are the two specific things that I would highlight occurred in the quarter. Again more work to do but really encouraged about the progress that we\u2019re making in distribution and our folks have done a lot of really good work in that business. George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America : In terms of the runway, is it going to be more on the cost side or is it going to be more on what you\u2019ve got on the racks and can sell? I mean where do you get the further uplift from here, if you had to pick between those two? Doyle Simons : Normally I\u2019m not ambiguous as you know George. But I would tell you, it\u2019s absolutely both. We have to pull both those levers to get to where we need to get to. So I think there is, opportunities both on the cost side and making sure we get the turns right, making sure we have the right products that our customers need. So lots of levers to pull in that business and we\u2019re going to need to pull everyone (inaudible) we are. George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America : Okay. Thanks for that. Doyle, in terms of the Longview board machine, I seem to remember that machine\u2019s maybe had some operating difficulties in the last couple of years. Now clearly you\u2019re going to improve productivity, you\u2019re going to improve cost and you need a little bit of throughput out of this as well. But how much of this was driven by the fact that maybe the machine had been a little bit less reliable in terms of quality over the last few years? And can you explain a little more in terms of what was behind that? Doyle Simons : So, let me give my view point of probably little more short time and I\u2019ll let Patty expand on it. But again, I\u2019m just telling you, this facility has run really well, and Patty mentioned in her comments, it\u2019s run really run over the past few quarters, both from a quality perspective. You\u2019re right, historically we\u2019ve had some quality issues but quality, we made significant improvements in quality over the past few quarters. And just to be real straight forward about it, the operating rates and reliability of liquid packaging had been kind of up the charts the last few quarters. Now again, we\u2019re excited about this, the outage and the capital that we\u2019re getting because we think that\u2019s going to allow us to take it to the next level. But this is not one where we go we\u2019re having big, big problems so we got to go spend this money, this is the one that\u2019s really going to just further enhance what we\u2019ve been able to do at this facility at least over the past year. George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America : That\u2019s where I was going with that question. Go ahead, Patty, I\u2019m sorry. Patty Bedient : No, I was going to say George that as we look at the spending that\u2019s being done at Longview there is some spending for cleaners that will improve the quality. But as a percentage of the total dollars, it\u2019s a small amount of that. The big piece as well in this project is that it will allow us to upgrade the product mix coming out of that operation. Today, the excess fluff pulp goes into wet lap. And so there is not a great market for that. So we\u2019ll be able to change the product mix a little bit. And then again, the big piece will be just lowering the fiber cost and lowering the energy cost. So, it\u2019s not a place where as we look across our system that we would spend capital in any operation that we didn\u2019t think had the ability to run well and run reliably. And Longview has proven that. And I think they have a really good package going forward as it relates to the return that we\u2019ll get from these projects. George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America : Okay. Last question and I\u2019ll turn it over. Would it be fair to say that in recognizing it is the Board\u2019s decision, that at this juncture, from your vantage point of the key metrics, either from a balance sheet standpoint or the operating fundamentals of the Company and the sectors that you\u2019re in, that you\u2019ve checked the box, so to speak, in terms of being able to raise the dividend in the next several quarters? Thanks guys and good luck in the quarter. Patty Bedient : Yes, I think George, going back to the comments that I made in December at the Investor Meeting. We said that we would be looking forward to increasing the dividend in the future but that would likely be after we closed the RICO transaction. And that is now closed and as Doyle said, we\u2019ll be visiting on that with the board at the next board meeting in mid-August. George Staphos \u2013 Bank of America : Thank you, Patty. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with DA Davidson. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Doyle Simons : Good morning. Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson : A couple that pertained to I guess the Wood Products segment. Starting with engineered wood products, I think you indicated that all of you facilities are now running and you\u2019re at around a 75% operating rate. Let\u2019s, if we call housing at $1 million, and potential $1.5 million, that\u2019s a 66% operating rate. Will you guys have sufficient engineered wood product when the housing actually hits mid cycle, particularly if EWP gains share versus solids on lumber? Doyle Simons : So, as I have said, we\u2019re running at 75% kind of on a blended average across the system. Some of our mills are running more than that, some of our facilities are running less than that. So, clearly, in some products if housing continues to improve, we may not have enough production to always meet our customer\u2019s demand. In others we clearly do have as Patty mentioned, we\u2019re in the process of ramping up evergreen. So we\u2019ve clearly gotten more capacity there. So, we feel pretty good about where we\u2019re positioned overall in engineered lumber, in order to continue to service our customers as we move forward. Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson : But the capacity you have is the limit, right? Everything that has been de-commissioned has been demolished or is there any kind of temporarily or indefinitely idled capacity that still exists? Doyle Simons : You\u2019re exactly right. The capacities that we have, is what we have. And so there is nothing sitting out there to go start back up, we\u2019re running what we have. Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson : Okay. Thanks for that clarification. And then, just on distribution, great to see it, turn the corner a little bit. Again looking towards mid cycle, can you give us a sense of the revenues and I guess EBITDA or margins are, please? Doyle Simons : Yes. It\u2019s hard to project exactly what revenues or earnings are going to be. But I\u2019ll just tell you as mentioned our commitment this year is to improve by $30 million to $40 million in our distribution. But let\u2019s be clear about it, that doesn\u2019t get us to where we absolutely need to be. We think as we do benchmarking versus our competition, we understand we are clearly not the leader. Our goal will be to be the leader in that business. And I\u2019ll just put it this way Steve, I think there is still a lot of run way. Once we accomplish the $30 million to $40 million this year, there is still a lot of run way in front of us to continue to improve earnings and cash flow out of that business going forward. Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson : Yes, I should think so. And so, therefore, would it be safe to say that your aspiration is to see 3%, perhaps 4% EBITDA margin once you\u2019re back at mid cycle potential? Doyle Simons : Yes, I mean, our goal is to be like I said the leader in that business. And those types of numbers are absolutely what we would be able to accomplish. Steve Chercover \u2013 DA Davidson : Great. Thanks, Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Yes, thanks very much. Morning, Doyle and Patty. Just a couple of easy questions here. Just trying to put in context on Cellulose Fibers, you mentioned the year to date record productivity. I know you\u2019ve moved to 18 months maintenance schedules on some of your mills. Just if you could give us an update on where you are in that program? And then how the year-to-date productivity record balances with that? Patty Bedient : Sure, Paul. As it relates to the 18-month cycle, now all mills will be on an 18-month cycle. The last one really is Longview which was on 18-month and we took it down, it went down in \u201813, it\u2019s coming down this quarter or this year in order for us to be able to flip those capital improvements. But now they are all on an 18-month cycle going forward. So, I don\u2019t have the specific, how many mills and which year will be in \u201815 versus \u201814 in front of me. But they are all on that cycle. In terms of the productivity, that really is as we look at it, how are we doing in terms of our uptime and how are we doing in terms of our production per day. And all of our mills are really operating very strongly. And they are competing with each other as well as one gets better they benchmark each other and share best practices. And we\u2019re really pleased with the work that\u2019s being done by the folks in Cellulose Fibers. As I mentioned, the third quarter earnings will be significantly lower but that\u2019s because of the maintenance that we\u2019re doing because the mills aren\u2019t running well. Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Okay, great to hear. And Doyle, you mentioned that you\u2019d be interested in growing the Wood Products business. Just curious as to which area within Wood Products is more highly sought after than other areas? Doyle Simons : Yes, and what I\u2019ve said on the wood products business is, our primary focus is continuing to run what we have better and again making progress there. In terms of specific businesses, there is not a specific business we feel compelled to grow at all. We like our position. And all of those \u2013 in those businesses, again we think our biggest opportunity is to run when we have better. With that said, if we find growth opportunities then we think can add additional value for our shareholders in that business that\u2019s something we would consider. Paul Quinn \u2013 RBC Capital Markets : Great thanks very much. Best of luck. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Patty Bedient : Thanks, Paul. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James : Good morning, Patty and Doyle. Patty Bedient : Good morning. Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James : Congrats on the quarter. A couple of questions here. Can you guys discuss a little more about the trends you\u2019re seeing in the different wood baskets you operate in the US south? I know we\u2019ve heard kind of just generally out there that Arkansas and Mississippi is heavily lagged. Maybe as it relates to you guys the Carolinas. But put a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing, kind of your expectations there for the back half of the year? Doyle Simons : Sure, so in terms of further on saw logs, we should step back and look at overall in the south, we saw log prices go up about 4% in \u201813 versus \u201812. As we mentioned earlier, we had seen saw log prices up modestly in the first half of \u201814 versus \u201813. And we think that trend will continue into the second half of \u201814. Yes, there are always some regional differences based on capacity, based on weather, based on a lot of different things. So yes, you do see some different things in mid south versus Gulf versus Atlantic, whatever the case may be. But overall, we continue to anticipate but continued improvement in saw log prices going forward. Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. And then, I don\u2019t know if maybe you guys could break out roughly how much of the EBIT during the quarter came from the south versus say the west? Patty Bedient : I don\u2019t have that exact number in front of me. I would tell you that in terms of looking forward in the third quarter, most of the decrease in EBIT will come in the west versus the south because of the export markets both in terms of what the export markets are doing in export and then obviously that has an impact back to the domestic market as well. Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. And then, just to like following up on earlier question and I know it\u2019s early. But as you think about the \u2013 really the step-up in the run rate as far as the CapEx this year is. The $400 million kind of \u2013 is that even appropriate if we think about 2015 or could there be another, I guess, I\u2019m asking, could be there another leg up in terms of CapEx dollars, do you feel like this was kind of the high water mark? Patty Bedient : Colin, as we look at our capital expenditure what will drive that is our ability to continue to have high quality projects which we would focus on as driving our cost down. So as Doyle said, we\u2019re still looking at those numbers. I hope actually that that number will go up a little bit because that means we do have good projects but we\u2019re still working through that as we are speaking. And I think the other thing that we have really had a focus on is making sure that before we spend capital, all of our operations are really operating well. So, we\u2019re not looking at growing capacity necessarily from additional capital spend, it really is focused on improving the cost position of our operations. But we\u2019ll be giving you more clarity on that as we get closer to the end of the year. Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James : Okay. And then, again, going back to just the capital allocation and still recognizing you\u2019re in the middle of that process right now. Can you maybe just put a little more detail on how much time are you really actively spending right now looking at Timberland acquisition and growing that part of the book currently or has it really just been trying to again determine where you want to put capital to work and still kind of integrating Longview? Doyle Simons : We\u2019re always looking for opportunities to grow our Timberland base. So, there is as you probably are assuming \u2013 I\u2019m sure you know there is some activity out there. There has been a pretty consistent flow. We look at every opportunity that comes along. We take a disciplined approach to it. And we will continue to do that. So, no, we didn\u2019t \u2013 Longview has been a fantastic acquisition for us. We\u2019re well ahead of our synergy targets. We\u2019re on track to deliver the EBITDA that we indicated out of that acquisition. But we didn\u2019t put other things on hold as we went through that process. We\u2019ve continued to look. Again, we\u2019ll be very disciplined but we think there will be opportunities to grow our Timberland base going forward and we\u2019re focused on doing just that. Collin Mings \u2013 Raymond James : Okay, thanks. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Thank you. We\u2019ve now reached the allotted time for questions. I would like to turn the call back over to Doyle for closing remarks. Doyle Simons : Thank you. And thanks everybody for joining this morning. Before we sign-off, one thing I would like to do as, I would like to acknowledge Kathy McAuley who actually retired effective today. It\u2019s hard to express just how much Kathy has contributed to Weyerhaeuser during her 14 years with us. Patty and I would like to offer our sincere thanks. And more importantly wish her all the best in her retirement. As we have previously announced Denise Merle has taken on responsibility as Senior Vice President of HR and Investor Relations. And Beth Baum is the Director of Investor Relations. They will both be available to answer any follow-up questions that you may have. And again, I\u2019d like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And we appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Denise M. Merle: Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2014 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Patty Bedient, Chief Financial Officer; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you, Denise. Welcome, everyone, and Happy Halloween. This morning, we reported strong third quarter results in each of our businesses as our employees continue to drive sustainable performance improvements through relentless execution of our operational excellence initiatives. Net earnings for the quarter totaled approximately $1.15 billion or $2.15 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.9 billion. This includes a gain of approximately $970 million related to the July 7 divestiture of Weyerhaeuser Real Estate Company. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we earned $178 million or $0.33 per diluted share, an increase of almost 31% compared with the year-ago quarter. Special items for the third quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to a post-retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about market conditions. Housing starts continued to improve in the third quarter but at a measured pace. We now anticipate approximately 1 million housing starts for 2014. We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen, supported by employment growth and increasing consumer confidence. We are also encouraged by changes recently proposed by the Federal Housing Finance Agency that would improve mortgage credit availability. Looking forward to 2015, our outlook is in line with consensus forecasts, which anticipate 1.1 million to 1.2 million housing starts and an accelerated single-family recovery. Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $136 million to third quarter earnings compared with $170 million in the second quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes declined as we intentionally accelerated harvest during early 2014 in anticipation of lower price realizations in the third quarter. Realization for Western logs declined due to the normal -- due to normal seasonal increases in domestic supply and softer Asian markets. Inventories at Chinese ports, although down from their peak, are still elevated and takeaway remains below normal levels. Sales volumes to Japan increased due to timing of shipments. Our Longview Timber acquisition contributed $36 million of EBITDA in the third quarter and remains on track to achieve our 2014 target of $175 million to $185 million of EBITDA. In the South, fee harvest volumes increased due to improved weather conditions. Average realizations for southern logs rose slightly compared with the second quarter. Third quarter earnings included $19 million from disposition of nonstrategic timberlands, a decrease of $5 million compared with second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives to optimize truck scheduling, road construction and maintenance and silviculture practices contributed to Timberlands' strong performance in the quarter. Wood Products, Charts 6 and 7. Wood Products earned $105 million in the third quarter, a slight improvement compared with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $135 million. In lumber, EBITDA improved by $8 million compared with the second quarter. Average price realizations improved approximately 1% as higher realizations for narrow lumber were partially offset by lower prices for wide dimension lumber. Log cost for our western mills declined and operating rates fell slightly. This business continues to implement operational excellence initiatives focused on reducing manufacturing cost net of logs. In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $3 million compared with second quarter as a decline in average realizations was partially offset by lower manufacturing cost. This business remains focused on lowering cost, improving operating reliability and increasing sales of higher-value products. Engineered wood products reported third quarter EBITDA of $27 million, a slight decrease compared with second quarter. Average sales realizations improved for solid section products in TJI joists as we captured the value of our announced second quarter price increase and benefited from a favorable sales mix. These improvements were offset by lower sales volumes across most product lines as second quarter included prebuying in advance of the price increase and customers managed inventories tightly during the third quarter. The distribution business reported EBITDA of $5 million in the third quarter, an improvement of $2 million. This business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs. Our engineered wood products and distribution businesses continued to make strong progress against their operational excellence targets, and we remain confident that both of these businesses will improve EBITDA by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 compared with 2013. Cellulose Fibers, Charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $59 million to earnings, down from $91 million in the second quarter. Fluff pulp markets remained strong through the third quarter, and average realizations for pulp and liquid packaging board increased. This was offset by substantially higher maintenance costs due to a scheduled increase in maintenance outage days within the pulp mill system and an extended planned outage at our liquid packaging board facility. Our liquid packaging board facility restarted in early October and is running well following the safe and successful completion of several maintenance and capital projects. The Cellulose Fibers business continues to demonstrate excellent offer -- excellent operational performance. Let me now switch gears briefly to SG&A and other matters. Our SG&A initiative remains on track, and I am highly confident we will achieve our $70 million run-rate reduction target by year-end. On August 13, our Board of Directors approved a 32% increase in our quarterly dividend and authorized a $700 million share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased nearly 19% of that authorization. Our foremost priority for capital allocation is returning cash to shareholders, and these actions demonstrate that commitment. Also in August, we announced we will move our corporate headquarters from Federal Way, Washington, to Seattle. We expect the move to occur in mid- to late 2016, when construction of our new leased building will be complete. Although our existing campus has served us very well over the years, it is too large and too costly for our current needs. Our move to Seattle is an important step forward and will help position Weyerhaeuser for future success. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Patricia M. Bedient: Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everybody. The outlook for the fourth quarter is on Chart 11. I will begin my comments with Timberlands. Starting with log exports in the West. Log inventories at Chinese ports are still at elevated levels, which will likely result in somewhat lower sales volumes to China this quarter. We also expect lower sales volumes to Japan, primarily as a result of timing of shipments, and realization for our Japanese exports are expected to increase modestly due to mix. Sales realizations for domestic logs in the West are expected to increase compared to the third quarter. In the South, we anticipate volumes will increase slightly with flat pricing. Silviculture costs are expected to increase seasonally. Earnings from nonstrategic Timberlands sales and miscellaneous items are anticipated to be approximately $15 million lower in Q4 compared to Q3, primarily as a result of timing. Excluding these items, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the third quarter. In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes across all product lines. Average sales realizations for both lumber and OSB are expected to weaken relative to the third quarter. Log costs are anticipated to increase somewhat with seasonal inventory build and weather-related restrictions. Production volumes in the fourth quarter will decrease due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs. Consistent with the normal seasonal pattern, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third quarter, and likely comparable to the fourth quarter of last year. Moving on to Cellulose Fibers. Worldwide inventories for softwood pulp at the end of the third quarter were at 27 days, slightly below normal levels. Demand for our products continues to be strong, especially for our fluff pulp, and we expect mostly -- pricing to be stable in the fourth quarter. Sales realizations for liquid packaging board are expected to be somewhat lower due to grade mix, and fiber costs are expected to be higher. Total maintenance expense for the segment will be much lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. As I discussed on our last quarter call, we had an extended planned shutdown at our Longview operation during the third quarter for maintenance and installation of capital equipment. We had a very successful startup of the mill, which was completed during the first week of this month. The mill is running well, and customer response has been very positive. During the fourth quarter, we planned only one mill down for maintenance. That shutdown was completed earlier this month, and that mill is also back up and running well. We expect earnings on our Cellulose Fibers segment to be significantly higher in the fourth quarter compared to the third. Now I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments. As shown on Chart 12, during the third quarter, we invested approximately $112 million in capital expenditures in our businesses. This brings our year-to-date expenditures through the third quarter to $271 million, and we still estimate total expenditures for the year, including reforestation, to be approximately $400 million. As reported earlier, we completed the divestiture of our home building business in early July. As a result of the transaction, we retired approximately 59 million shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of over $700 million during the third quarter. These proceeds, combined with strong cash flow from operations during the quarter, resulted in a cash balance of approximately $1.6 billion as of the end of the third quarter. Chart 13 details significant actions we are taking to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. In August, the board increased our quarterly cash dividend by 32% to $0.29 per share or $1.16 on an annual basis. Based on the closing stock price at the end of the third quarter, that equates to a 3.6% yield. In August, the board also authorized a $700 million share repurchase program. During the third quarter, we repurchased approximately 4 million shares, using approximately $130 million, at an average price of $33.63. As a result of the WRECO divestiture and of the share repurchase program, we reduced our outstanding share count during the quarter by over 10%. Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you, Patty. As many of you have heard me say over the past few months, we are relentlessly focused on performance and capital allocation to grow shareholder value. The pace with which we have begun to execute our share repurchase program illustrates our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Through our operational excellence initiatives, we remain focused on driving performance to sustainably grow earnings and cash flow and deliver additional value to our shareholders. And now I'd like to open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Just a question on Wood Products. If I look year-to-date, it seems like your third-party sales volumes in lumber and OSB are sort of flat with the first 3 quarters of 2013. And if I think that housing starts are growing, and maybe your operating rates are in the low 90s and you have maybe some room to ratchet them up, is there a reason that your volumes in lumber specifically aren't up more year-over-year? And by that same token, if we do 1.1 million to 1.2 million starts next year, would you expect your volumes to be up in 2015 by a decent amount? Patricia M. Bedient: Anthony, as we look at our volumes for lumber, I think, year-to-date -- based on year-to-date, we were pretty flat, as you said. But I think that the third quarter, we probably produced a little bit less than what we thought we would. And as we look at 2015, I think that we have the ability to increase with the market, which, as Doyle said, we don't have a real robust outlook for housing starts, although they will continue to improve as we move forward. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. Okay. And then, Doyle, last week, one of your competitors in fluff pulp said it was exploring the possibility of putting their mill system in an MLP structure. And I was wondering, obviously, Weyerhaeuser's a REIT, and the Cellulose Fiber's business is in a TRS. But is the MLP angle something that you've looked at? Or do you have any thoughts you can share on whether this structure might ultimately be appropriate for Cellulose Fibers? Doyle R. Simons: Yes, and that, Anthony, is something we have looked at, and I'll ask Patty to give a little bit more color on that, because she's coordinating that effort for us. Patricia M. Bedient: Anthony, we are actively looking at the applicability of the structure. As you know, there are a number of uncertainties, and not the least of those is the fact that the IRS has put on pause issuing any additional private letter rulings until they've completed a thorough review of the MLP structure overall. We don't have clarity on when that will be, but we do continue to monitor the situation. And if we think it will add value, we'll move forward with our review. We have consulted our advisers, and we have included their input into our review. As you probably know, a number of years ago, there was a private letter ruling for pulp, but private letter rulings are fact-specific, and technically, can only be relied on by the taxpayer that's making that particular application. And given the fact that the IRS is now undertaking an in-depth review, we don't think it would be prudent to move forward without a ruling. And so we're sort of on pause, waiting to see what happens. We haven't made any decisions one way or the other, but we'll continue to monitor the situation. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Doyle, Patty. Doyle, the progress that you're making in the Wood Products business is pretty impressive. I wondered if you could give us a sense of where you think the gains are coming from. Is it kind of better commercial performance, just better operating performance, reduced cost? And where do you think you are on a sort of a scale of 1 to 10, in terms of optimizing those wood businesses? Doyle R. Simons: So Mark, thanks for that comment. And there is a lot of really good work going on in our Wood Products businesses. In terms of the progress we're making, as we've identified, and starting with lumber, we said that we think there's $100 million opportunity there, and as we've previously said, we'll think we'll get $30 million to $40 million of that in 2014. And then part of what we're going to be doing on December 9, Mark, on our Investor Day is being -- laying out more details of what we think the opportunity is and the timing is in that business and our others going forward. In OSB, similarly, we've made some progress there. More work to do, but again we've identified 50 to 60 of operational excellence opportunities, and more work to do there. We will get 5 to 10 of that, we believe, in 2014. In ELP and distribution where we had, in my opinion, and I think most people's opinions, the biggest opportunity to improve. As I said in my comments, very encouraged by the progress we are making in both of those businesses, and we believe we're going to improve. Despite not great housing starts, we think we're going to improve both the EBITDA in both of those businesses by $30 million to $40 million in 2014 versus 2013, and we're on track to do that. I would tell you, Mark, to your exact question, there's still a lot of work to do in both of those businesses and opportunities. With the $30 million to $40 million, the way we think about it proves that we -- or shows that we've earned the right to be in those businesses, and our next step is to show that we can win in those businesses, and part of winning, of course, is earning above cost of capital over the cycle. So good progress there, very encouraged by all the hard work that our employees have done, but still a lot of work to do in both of our ELP and distribution businesses. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Okay. And if I could, as a follow-on, just for Patty, even if we assume the rest of the share repurchase were to happen in the fourth quarter, it still looks like you're going to be sitting on over $1 billion of cash. Can you talk to us about how much cash you want to carry going forward? And just thoughts on the use of that residual cash. Patricia M. Bedient: Sure, Mark. In terms of how much cash we carry, it's a function of where we are in the cycle, it -- we'll use some cash in the first quarter. At least, we hope to use some cash in the first quarter to build some working capital as housing recovers. So that's one place that we're looking. We also are continuing to utilize the share repurchase, as you said. As we look at capital allocation, our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost, has been returning cash to shareholders. We increased the dividend, as we talked about. Continuing to execute on that share repurchase. And then, we'll also be investing in our businesses in our capital expenditure program. We'll give you a little more color on that when we get to our December Investor Day and then certainly on our earnings call for the fourth quarter. I would expect that may be a little higher than this current year, not a huge magnitude. And then obviously, as we've said before, we're looking to grow our businesses in a disciplined way. Our first priority there would be in Timberlands, but there's no imperative that I have to grow. So we're being very disciplined about looking at all areas where we would utilize that cash. In addition, we do have the credit line that doesn't expire until September of 2018. $1 billion that has not been utilized to this point. So we really feel very good about our opportunities to continue to provide value to shareholders as we go forward. So it's a nice place to be. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Doyle, I guess my first question, maybe this is under the category of \"no good deed goes unpunished.\" I mean, you've done quite well in Wood Products, Mark was noting that in his Q&A. If we look at Slide 7 of your deck, we generally see product prices that are flat to higher on average than where they were last year, OSB maybe being an exception there. We know the progress that you're making in cost reductions and operational excellence. So I was just curious why, if I heard you correctly, fourth quarter guidance and EBIT for Wood will be flat year-on-year, not to mention the progress you've already made this year-to-date? And then I had a couple of follow-ons. Doyle R. Simons: George, I would say, just from a seasonal perspective, as you know, the fourth quarter is the slowest seasonal period. So that's going to have some pick on -- impact on our performance in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. If you look year-over-year, we have made improvements, as you've said, and part of the year-over-year will be impacted by sales realizations. We'll -- it remains to be seen what happens in the quarter. I will tell you, currently, lumber prices are down roughly $10 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. OSB, down roughly $5 in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But part of it, of course, will be, if you look at pricing on the chart that you refer to, specifically in OSB, if you look at it year-over-year levels, pricing will be down fairly significantly in OSB fourth quarter of 2014 versus fourth quarter of 2013. So we'll see how that plays out for the balance of the year, but that's the biggest driver of what's going on. George L. Staphos - BofA Merrill Lynch, Research Division : Okay, and that's fair. We appreciate the thought. If we switch gears a little bit, but still within Wood Products, and I recognize, again, this is probably going to be something you'll talk more about in detail on December 9, can you give us a little bit of a flavor in terms of what kinds of investments you're making within the mills? Is it similar to what you did at your former shop in terms of automation and improvement of yield? But -- can you give us a little bit more color there? And then, my follow-on, and I'll turn it over, again, you're clearly getting improvement in SG&A, at least in terms of the numbers that we are seeing across the segment. Do you worry at all that with the cost reductions, and you're on target for your $75 million, that at some point in time, that begins to impact negatively your ability to be commercially more effective within Wood Products, i.e., you cut a little bit too much on the cost side, cut into the bone? Doyle R. Simons: Thanks, George, for the questions. So in terms of what we're doing in investment in our Wood Products businesses, George, those are specific investments that will be made to lower our costs. This is proven technology that's in place in some of our mills, and we will be extending that to additional mills. But again, the key focus is on investments, improving technology that are focused on lowering costs. This is technology that we are comfortable with, we know how to put it in and are confident as we implement these capital expenditures that we will ultimately get the cost reduction associated with that. In terms of the SG&A, as I said earlier, we are on track to achieve the $75 million cost-reduction initiatives in SG&A. With that said, I am not worried at all about that cutting into the bone, as you said, in Wood Products. These are cost-reduction initiatives across the entire organization, and we are making sure that we are still very well positioned from a commercial standpoint and able to do what is necessary to service our customers going forward. So no concern regarding that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Doyle, with all of the work on operational improvement, do you think we're going to see a faster rate of growth in profits in REIT income or TRS income over the next, say, 12 and 24 months, assuming housing continues the slow recovery? Doyle R. Simons: Mark, as you know, we are looking at operational excellence across the entire organization, in our Timberlands business as well as our manufacturing businesses, and we've laid out specific targets for both. We've given an update on where we are on each of those for 2014 versus 2013. And we'll, as I said, in December 9, be giving more clarity on what 2015 looks like. So I think there's opportunity, Mark, and clearly on the REIT assets, on the Timberland, and encouraged by the progress we're making there, and there's also opportunities on the manufacturing side, both in Wood Products and Cellulose Fiber. If you look at it just from a dollar basis in terms of what we've laid out and add it up, the bigger numbers are, of course, in Wood Products and Cellulose Fibers combined, compared with the Timberland business, but we're focused on operational excellence across into -- our entire organization including, as you'd -- as we just alluded to, the $75 million of SG&A. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Limited, Research Division : Okay. And just one more question. How much of the improvement that we saw in engineered wood this quarter was attributable to lower OSB prices? And should we assume that, that division has already seen the full benefits of the decline we've seen so far? Doyle R. Simons: So only a minor part, Mark, of the -- of what you saw in the ELP was a result of the lower OSB prices. And yes, you should assume -- we'll see what happens to OSB prices from this point forward, but yes, you should assume most of that benefit has played through the system. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Yes, just given things where housing starts are and where southern sawlog prices are and just with your thoughts on sort of housing starts for 2015, could you share some thoughts, I guess, on the type of harvest growth you may be planning for in the West and the South as we look out to 2015? Doyle R. Simons: Yes. No, on the southern harvest, we have kind of been expecting, as we've talked to you about, a slow, steady increase in southern sawlog pricing for 2014. And that's generally what we've seen, up 3% to 4%. We continue to have consistent demand from our customers. So we're not planning, at this time, any type of deferral as we look into 2015. We'll continue to keep a close eye on market conditions. Just in terms of how we think about our harvest overall, what we look at is the financial maturity of -- and the expected market demand, and those are the factors that we use to build our harvest plans going forward, and we're working on those for 2015. We also, as you know and we've talked about, have the ability to flex some during a year and during a specific quarter. And you saw some of that earlier this year as we capitalized on stronger export prices in the first half of 2014 and 2015. And we'll continue to hopefully capitalize on those opportunities in 2015 and beyond. Tyler J. Langton - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Okay, great. That's helpful. And then just on the Wood Products side, I don't know if you could kind of quantify the type of volume declines you're looking for in the fourth quarter. And then, I mean, is this -- are these declines just sort of typical seasonal declines? Or are they driven by, I guess, a greater-than-expected drop in demand at all? Doyle R. Simons: No, these -- what we are talking about, Tyler, is just your typical seasonal-type slowdown in the fourth quarter. As Patty said in her comments, the fourth quarter is typically the slowest seasonal period from a Wood Products perspective. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Maybe tagging on, on the question of kind of 2015 outlook, and again, I appreciate we'll get more either in December or January, but given the housing outlook that you put out for 2015, how do you think that affects the trajectory of sawlog pricing in the South? Do you think it's kind of more of the same? Do you see any chance for acceleration? Doyle R. Simons: Gail, our best guess on southern sawlog pricing is we will continue to see slow, steady improvement. I think the range we gave on housing, 1.1 million to 1.2 million; at the upper end of that range, I think you could see maybe an acceleration in pricing in southern sawlog, even above the 3% to 4% that we anticipate for 2014. If it's at the lower end of that rage, then maybe it's more in the 3%, 4%, 5% range that we've seen for -- or we anticipate for 2014 versus 2013. So that's our kind of best guess on southern sawlogs in the near term. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And can you give a little more color on what you're seeing in terms of the log export markets? How severe do you think the inventory situation is in China? How long do you think it would take to normalize? And x the timing of volumes to Japan, can you give us a sense of kind of the underlying trend in Japan, particularly relative to -- has it fully worked through the consumption tax at this point? Patricia M. Bedient: Sure, Gail. This is Patty. As we think about China, as I've said, inventories are still at higher-than-normal levels, and the takeaway is going a little slower than probably what we would have expected last quarter when we were on the call. But they are working their way through. That'll probably take through the rest of this quarter. So we don't anticipate any significant change in direction for the quarter other than what I talked about earlier. In Japan, I think that, stepping back from that, too, you'd have to say there's the Japanese market overall, but then there's also the customers that we have. And the customers that we have worked with, as you know, for some of them well over 20 years, are really talking to us about making sure that they get the volume that they need to support their operations. So they're large customers. They have very efficient supply chains, both in terms of the supply for logs, but importantly as well, how they merchandise lumber in Japan. So volumes in Japan, as I said, are primarily down because of timing. We had a little better shipments in the third quarter, as Doyle talked about in his remarks. So we are still confident in our Japan volumes, although pricing will be impacted as we go forward based upon what things do overall. But we do expect our realizations to Japan for this quarter to be up a little bit because we'll have a little bit higher freight to Japan, relative. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And on engineered wood, do you think the volume you saw in the third quarter is reflective of kind of the underlying market? Or was it depressed due to payback from the outside strength in the second quarter? Doyle R. Simons: I think, the -- we clearly saw, as we indicated after the second quarter -- or on the second quarter call, Gail, some pre-buying in the second quarter, due to the price increase that went in late in the second quarter in our engineered wood business. So I think maybe if you average the 2, that would probably be kind of the normalized rate. But clearly, we had some pre-buying in the second quarter versus the third. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Investment Bank, Research Division : Okay. And just one last quick one. Patty, can you possibly quantify, particularly since it seems like you're already done, what the outage expense would be for the fourth quarter in Cellulose? Patricia M. Bedient: Sure, Gail. As we looked at Cellulose Fibers, if you look at Chart 9, where we detailed the maintenance expense and outage days, so in the third quarter, we had about 38 days of maintenance downtime. We would expect, because we are now complete, that, that would be about 14 days for the fourth quarter. So that's a difference of around 24 days. And as I've said in the past, each day is usually about $1 million. So it's around a $20 million delta from third quarter to fourth quarter, which is the primary difference between our outlook for the fourth quarter as it compares to the third. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Doyle, engineered wood products, could you just talk about how engineered wood is performing in the marketplace relative to lumber in single-family construction? And any progress, if any of those been made, in further penetrating the multifamily end market with engineered wood? Doyle R. Simons: Sure, so in engineered wood, we continue to be, as I mentioned earlier, about the -- encouraged by the progress that we're making. As you see from our overall shipment numbers, we continue to gain in terms of capturing profitable share going forward. And some of that is coming from multifamily. Still, the -- I don't want to mislead you. The key driver for engineered wood has been and will continue to be single-family, but we have had some successes in moving into multifamily in terms of our engineered wood products. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then, at the Analyst Day last year, we talked about the performance in engineered wood and distribution, that it materially improved, and that potentially, those businesses will not be part of the portfolio longer term. Obviously, we've seen very meaningful improvement in those businesses. So are we at a point now where the improvement is enough where we would -- we can say that engineered wood and distribution will be part of Weyerhaeuser for the long term? Doyle R. Simons: Alex, the way I would answer that is -- and I think I said this earlier, is the $30 million to $40 million was necessary to show that we deserve the right to be in those businesses. I think we are delivering on that. So our next step now is to show that we can win in these businesses, and again, we define winning as showing that we can earn above cost of capital in each of these businesses over a cycle. That's going to take some additional work in each of these businesses going forward, but that's what we're focused on doing, winning both from a cost of capital perspective and showing that we can be the leader in each of these businesses going forward. And that's the way we think about it. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Understood. I mean, just last one on share buybacks. So good to see that happen in the quarter. Should we read into an issue -- in terms of the amount and the timing, is that any sort of potential number that we could see consistently on a go-forward basis? Is that some sort of run rate that we can think about on a go-forward basis that you could -- you can buy back? Doyle R. Simons: No, what I would read into it is the fact that we are committed to executing this share repurchase plan in a -- on a timely basis. The comment we made when we announced this authorization is this is one we fully anticipated completing on a timely basis. We will report to you, just as we did this quarter, the progress we're making going forward. But I wouldn't read into, just to say we're going to do this amount every quarter based on what we did for half a quarter in third quarter of 2014. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Doyle and Patty, first question is, we've seen a pretty interesting divergence of opinion in the last few weeks. And one way you guys can, of course, buy timber is just by buying your own stock, and it looks like we've seen 2 of your competitors, one step up and pay pretty close to peak prices, I guess, for southern lands, and another of your competitors decided to focus more on, not only maybe being buying back stock, but actually selling land into The Street to buy back stock. And I didn't know if you had an opinion on what you thought of land values. And I'm really thinking of the South at this point, where there seems to be a divergence of opinion, and whether we would see you step up now or hang back? Doyle R. Simons: So Chip, I think you can look at our actions in terms of the way we think about things. Clearly, as we've already highlighted, we are in the market actively repurchasing our shares. So we are convinced that we are creating value for our shareholders for doing that. In terms of actively buying timberland, there's no doubt that there are lots of opportunities out there to do that in today's market. There's also lots of money chasing those deals. We look at those deals, each and every one of them that comes along. And as we've said before, we're going to be very disciplined in what we actually acquire. And to date, we have not made any acquisitions in the South. The type of transactions we're looking for, again, actions, are the ones that are along the lines of what we did in the Longview acquisition. And you can look at the type of returns that we are generating from that acquisition that we made last year. That's not a South-versus-West statement, Chip. We'd look for -- if the right opportunities are there, that where we think we can grow value for shareholders, we would look at making acquisitions, both in the West and in the South. But we're just going to continue to be very disciplined in the way we look at those potential acquisition opportunities going forward. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners, LLC: Got you. That's very helpful. And just a quick follow-up. Last year, I seem to recall that you all made a point of saying that lumber and OSB were a little bit more strategic and possible areas of growth through acquisition, than say, EWP and distribution. And I just wanted to know if you're still open to making acquisitions if the right thing comes along in those 2 businesses that you've mentioned. And if those other 2 businesses, EWP and distribution, continue to improve, as they've certainly done this year, could they also be areas that maybe in a couple of years you could see growing in? Doyle R. Simons: Chip, I don't specifically remember making the comment that you just referred to, but let me talk about how we think about acquisitions generally. As we've consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisitions are going to be in our Timberland business. With that said, if we can add -- find acquisition opportunities in our Wood Products business, or Cellulose Fiber business for that matter, that will result in additional shareholder value, that's something we would look at. Now we don't feel compelled to grow any of our businesses. But again, if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions in Wood Products or Cellulose Fibers that we think add value for shareholders, that's something we would potentially consider. But again, we think our biggest opportunities for acquisition will be in our Timberland business. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Just a couple of cleanups. In engineered wood, can you please tell us what your operating rate was in the quarter? And what you expect it to be in 2015? Doyle R. Simons: The operating rate in the third quarter, Steve, continued to be in the mid-7 range -- so roughly 70%- to 75%-type range operating rates in EWP in the third quarter. And we'll see what happens to housing. But I don't think that number will -- so I would anticipate, if housing continues to improve, that number could go up going forward. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Yes, and I was going to say, given that housing has kind of underwhelmed over the last couple of years, is it appropriate to budget your production to the lower end of that 1.1 million to 1.2 million range? Maybe particularly with respect to OSB? Doyle R. Simons: Well, yes. OSB is a different story, of course. And what I would tell you in OSB is we took 20 days of downtime in the third quarter. And in the fourth quarter, we would anticipate higher amounts of downtime due to normal seasonal factors, holiday season and some maintenance and capital projects that are going in place in terms of OSB in the fourth quarter. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co., Research Division : Great. The final question, with respect to your understanding of MLPs, is converting logs into lumber panels in EWP also eligible? Or is it just for pulp-based businesses? Patricia M. Bedient: Steve, as I said before, that the IRS has a project, a very complete project that they've undertaken, and it seems they're taking even a little bit longer than maybe what was anticipated when they announced the project, which was back towards the beginning of this year. So I think it's difficult to know, really, where they'll come out on their deliberations. What we do know, as I said before, was a number of years ago, they did have a ruling on pulp. But whether or not they will modify that ruling and application going forward, and whether or not they would say anything about the other businesses is still yet to be known. So tough to give you any more clarity. I wish we all had a little more clarity at this point, but that's sort of what we know as we sit here today. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : I too, like George, was looking at Chart 7, where you had Wood Products volumes and pricing. And I had something of a different question, and that's the lumber, engineered wood and if we threw plywood on here, it'd be the same. Prices have been pretty good over the last 1.5 years. Obviously, OSB has been a very different story. There was a lot of restarts last year, but that was a while ago. Any thoughts as to why it's taking so long for OSB to regain its footing and what needs to happen for the markets to get into balance and more profitable? Doyle R. Simons: Mark, I think you said it right. There was significant additional supply that came online, I think in anticipation of maybe stronger housing starts than we've seen occur in the 2014-type time frame. So I think it's a simple supply-and-demand equation that appears to be out of balance currently, and that's what has resulted in the current pricing environment. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Do you think there are any structural impediments, though, to regaining balance? Because I'm not sure the operating rates in engineered wood are higher, or for that matter in gypsum, than in OSB. It just seems to be that the market struggles to adjust to the demand situation. Any thoughts as to what impediments might be in place? Doyle R. Simons: No, Mark, I don't think there are any long-term structural impediments. OSB tends to be very volatile, as you very well know, over a cycle, and I think we're just in one of those periods of low pricing currently. Patricia M. Bedient: One thing I would say, Mark, that's different in the 2 technologies. OSB, when capacity comes on the market, comes on in pretty big chunks, and people seek to run those mills 24/7 because of the type of operation that they are. So I think when new capacity starts up, as we saw a number of mills earlier this year, it takes a longer time for the market to absorb it if the housing doesn't recover as quickly as I think what people anticipated as we started the year. So I think I would point to that as the difference between the 2 technologies. Lumber, similarly, also is a more fragmented business that capacity comes on in smaller chunks than what OSB does. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group Incorporated : Fair enough. And certainly, I realize it's not your job to be prognosticating on price actions, et cetera, but given your housing starts forecast for next year, is it feasible that OSB gets into balance? Or do you think we're still a ways away? Doyle R. Simons: Mark, I think, as we move through 2015 and housing continues to improve, I think they're in the range that we laid out. You could see an environment -- and again, we're not prognosticators of pricing and we'll leave that to others, but I think you could see a point where that is more in balance going forward. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Yes, just following up on, I think, Chip's question on Timberland transactions and trying to get your viewpoint about your actions. If you could give us a little bit more color on your nonstrategic Timberland sales, where are those happening? Is it more West-based than South? And in terms of transaction values, are you seeing a steady increase over the last year? Doyle R. Simons: Yes, so we have those in both the West and the South. I'll give you an example of one that was in the third quarter. It happened to be in Oklahoma. It was a tract that was roughly 760 acres, and it sold for $14,000-plus per acre. So that's an example of what we see occurring out in the marketplace right now. So some of it's truly nonstrategic, some of it's more HBU-type land, and that's what we've seen going on, and we think will continue to be opportunities for us going forward. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Capital Markets, LLC, Research Division : Okay, and just getting back to the Q4 outlook on lower lumber and OSB pricing. Just specifically on the OSB side, it looks like those prices bottomed out in September, and we've seen, depending on the region, about anywhere from 10% to 14% price lifts since that point. What's your level of confidence that prices will be lower quarter-over-quarter? Doyle R. Simons: Again, we're not better than anybody else in predicting what's going to happen on prices. The number that I referenced earlier is, if you look at third quarter average versus October-to-date prices, October-to-date is down roughly $5 for our overall mix. So that's to give you some sense of where we are today. Now again, that third quarter average, you referenced end of the third quarter, but if you look at third quarter average versus October-to-date, that's where we ended up. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Just a couple of cleanups here. Just kind of a follow-up to Gail's question on Japan. You mentioned that you're seeing better realizations in 4Q due to mix. How are like comparable-quality log prices? Are they still falling in that market? Or are you actually starting to see some stabilization and lift on kind of an apples-to-apples basis there? Patricia M. Bedient: I would say that Japan is stable as it relates to price, overall. And as I said, both in terms of the volume to Japan, we are also very pleased with the customer relationships that we have that really are focused on making sure that they have adequate supply of Douglas fir logs in order to supply their large operations. Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, Patty. And then, as far as the Cellulose Fibers guidance for 4Q, could you see, as far as from an earnings contribution, a bounce back all the way to what you saw in 2Q? Or is it probably going to fall out somewhere between what we had saw in 3Q and -- I'm sorry, between 2Q and 3Q? Patricia M. Bedient: Well, I think, as you look at that, the major difference between the third quarter and the fourth quarter is going to be that roughly $20 million of maintenance expense that I referenced when Gail asked her question. There are some puts and takes and other -- I said liquid packaging realizations will be down. Pulp pricing should be pretty stable. But the major difference between the 2 is that -- 2 quarters, is that $20 million of maintenance. Collin Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc., Research Division : Okay, Patty. And then just one last big-picture question, Doyle, and kind of a follow-up to both Chip's and Paul's questions. Just given the strong bid for timberland right now, have you thought about just becoming more aggressive as far as capital recycling within the Timberland business? More specifically, are there certain wood baskets in the U.S. South that you want to try and get more aggressive in and have a bigger presence in, and maybe exit some of the regions you are in now? Because just looking at your footprint in the region, there are some areas in states where you have a pretty large concentration, and then some other areas where we're seeing arguably a little bit better signs of a price recovery in sawlogs that you're not in. So are you looking at kind of shifting some capital around within Timberland from that perspective? Doyle R. Simons: Yes, that's a good question. And as you, I think, know, and as we've talked about before, we're always looking to improve through trading and buying and selling the overall quality of our timberlands. And some of that may include, as you alluded to, potentially getting in markets maybe that we're not in, although we're in most of the markets currently. So those are things that we are [Audio Gap] to consider going forward. With that said, we have, as you know, a pretty good footprint in terms of -- both in the South and in the West in terms of where our strategic timberland is located. And we're convinced that through growing and harvesting trees on that strategic timberland, we're going to be able to drive value for our shareholders going forward. But we're always looking to improve the overall quality of our timberland base, and I think we've had some success in doing that historically, and we'll continue to look at opportunities to do that going forward. So as I understand it, that was our final question. As we wrap up this morning's call, I want to just remind everybody that we will be holding an investor meeting on December 9. That's going to be at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel in New York. Our business leaders will be participating in that meeting. We're looking forward to that meeting, and we look forward to seeing each of you there. So with that, thanks, everybody, for joining in on the call this morning, and we thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Thank you. That concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you and I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Denise Merle : Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2014 earnings. On the call with me this morning, are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings materials on our website. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. As we enter 2014, we embark in the journey here at Weyerhaeuser to grow at truly great company. As we said at that time, the three primary levers we are pulling to drive shareholders, our portfolio performance and capital allocation. Over the past year, we've made significant progress. Specifically in 2014, we'd divested our home building business to become a focused forest product company, achieved our 2014 operational excellence targets and improved earnings from our continuing operations before special items about 22% to $700 million or $1.25 per diluted share compared with $572 million or $0.99 per diluted share in 2013. In addition, we increased our dividend by 32%, authorized a new $700 million share repurchase program and within five months completed nearly 30% of that authorization. Through these actions, we demonstrated our commitment to delivering shareholder value and our total share of return for the full year of 2014 exceeded 17%. Included in these full year results are the strong fourth quarter operating earnings we reported this morning. We out earned $166 million or $0.31 per diluted for the fourth quarter. Our net sales from continuing operations of $1.8 billion excluding special items, we are into $145 million or $0.27 per diluted share an increase of 31% compared with the year ago quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included an ongoing gain from a change to post-retirement health plan and restructuring charges associated with our SG&A cost reductions. I'll begin the discussion of our businesses performance with some brief comments on housing. Housing starts showed continued improvement in the fourth quarter, albeit at a modest rate. U.S. housing starts totalled just over $1 million for 2014, an improvement of approximately 9% compared with 2013. We are confident that housing markets will continue to strengthen in 2015 at accelerating employment growth; strong consumer confidence, low mortgage rates and initiatives to improve mortgage availability should support increased household formation. We anticipate over $1.1 million housing starts for 2015. Let me now turn to our business segments starting with timberlands, Chart 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $143 million to fourth quarter earnings compared with a $136 million in the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes increased as we were able to access tracks that had limited operations during the third quarter's fire season. Average realizations for Western logs rose due to tighter domestic markets and a favorable export log mix. Japanese demand remained solid during the quarter. Chinese demand slowed and prices for Chinese export logs declined. Although Chinese inventories decreased during the fourth quarter, they remained above normalized levels and the weak Rouble improved the competitive position of Russian logs. Operational excellence initiatives to drag each log to its most profitable customer contributed to the strong performance in the quarter. [indiscernible] acquisition contributed $44 million of EBITDA in the fourth quarter. This acquisition has been fully integrated into our Timberlands operations. In the south, fee harvest volumes rose and average realization increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter earnings included $3 million from disposition of non-strategic Timberlands, a decrease of $16 million compared with the third quarter. Our Timberlands business met or exceeded all of its operational excellence target for 2014 including $194 million of EBITDA from the Longview acquisition against the target of $175 million to $185 million, $29 million of synergies against the target of $20 million and over $20 million of operational excellence improvements. We anticipate an additional $20 million to $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2015 in this business. I will turn to wood products Chart 7 and 8. Wood products contributed $56 million in the seasonally weak fourth quarter down from $105 million in the third quarter. Earnings for the segment were comparable to the fourth quarter 2013 as benefits from our operational excellence initiatives offset a 13% year-over-year decline in average OSB realizations. Wood products EBITDA for the fourth quarter 2014 totalled $86 million compared with $135 million in the third quarter. In lumber, EBITDA totalled $65 million average price realizations declined approximately 4% compared with the third quarter. Log cost of western and southern mills increased and per unit manufacturing cost rose due to seasonally lower production volumes. In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the third quarter due to a 4% decrease in average realizations. Engineered wood products reported fourth quarter EBITDA $14 million, a slight increase in average sales realizations was more than offset by seasonally lower sales volumes and higher fee manufacturing cost due to reduced production volume. EBITDA for the distribution business declined $6 million compared with the third quarter, but improved by $5 million compared with the fourth quarter of 2013. In 2014, the wood product segments achieved over $100 million of benefit from operational excellence initiatives including delivering on our commitment to improved EBITDA and engineered wood products and distribution about $30 million to $40 million in each business. We've made good progress, but much more work remains to be done, as we continue our focus on operational excellence in 2015. We have committed to deliver an additional $25 million to $30 million of operational excellence from our lumber business, $10 million to $15 million from OSB, $15 million to $20 million in engineered wood products EBITDA and $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA from distribution. Let me know turn to cellulose fibers, Charts 9 and 10. Cellulose fibers contributed $87 million to earnings, an increase of $28 million compared with the third quarter. Fluff pulp markets remain strong in the fourth quarter and average pulp price realizations increased. Maintenance cost at our liquid packaging board facility declined substantially and production increased volume completion of extended outage that occurred primarily in the third quarter. As anticipated, liquid packaging board realization declined in the fourth quarter due to a temporary shift in mix, as we restarted the facility. Shipment volumes for that product also declined as result of slowdown associated with the West Coast port labour disputes. The Cellulose fibers business finished the year with strong operational performance with several mills setting annual records for uptime, productivity and quality. The business generated nearly $30 million of operational excellence improvements in 2014 and is targeting another $25 million to $30 million in 2015. As I wrap up this morning, let me touch briefly on SG&A. At the end of 2014, we had achieved our $75 million run rate reduction targets. Moving forward, we will continue to seek opportunities to simply and reduce cost to ensure that we have the appropriate cost structure require to win. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook. Patty Bedient : Thanks, Doyle. Good morning, everybody. The outlook for the first quarter of 2015 is summarized on Chart 12. I will begin with discussion with Timberlands. Fee harvest in the left is anticipated to increase seasonally. Western domestic prices are expected to move higher and we are shifting supply into those markets. Japanese volume will likely decrease due to the softer overall Japanese housing demands and seasonal weather conditions. Sales realizations for China logs are expected to decrease somewhat, but the impact softer prices is being partially offset by lower freight cost. Inventories at Chinese ports have been declining; the take away has not yet been strong enough to bring balances to normal levels. Demand is not expected to tick up until after the lunar holiday. Logging and road cost should decrease in the quarter, as the results of harvesting lower elevation sites and less road construction activity. In the South, we expect fee harvest to decline seasonally. We anticipate slightly stronger pricing, although realizations will likely be flat due to a somewhat smaller log size. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated at around $10 million compared to $3 million in Q4. We expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter and up slightly from the first quarter of 2014. In wood product, we anticipate higher sales volumes in Q1 compared to Q4 due to seasonal improvement and demand slowly improving housing markets. Fee increase in single-family starts, which improves by almost 8% in December on a seasonally adjusted basis compared to a year ago, is a positive sign. Channel inventories are very lean so assuming a more normal strain [ph] buildings season we should see uptick in pricing. Prices in lumber and OSB however have decreased since year-end, but we expect realizations to improve as we progress further into the first quarter. Average realizations for engineered wood products are anticipated to decrease slightly due to product mix. However this decrease should be more than offset, by higher sales volumes. Log costs are expected to increase while manufacturing unit cost should be lower on higher production volume. Resin cost should also decrease as a result of low oil prices. Overall, we expect earnings in our wood product segment to increase significantly in the first quarter compared to the fourth. In cellulose fibers, day supply of global softwood inventory has increased to 31 days as of year-end, which is above normal levels. The combination of a stronger dollar and the usual seasonal slowdown in demand is likely to negatively affect full pricing. We also expect to incur higher maintenance expense this quarter as our largest fluff mill takes it plants maintenance shutdown. Sales realizations for liquid packaging are expected to increase this quarter compared to Q4, due to a more normal sales mix. The problems encountered as a result of the West Coast port slowdown have continued into this quarter. So far this quarter, we have scheduled 13 days of downtime at our Longview liquid packaging board facility due to the port situation. Although negotiations are underway with the federal mediator the issues have yet to be resolved. In addition to downtime, we are also incurring additional dollars for increased freight and warehousing. We expect overall earnings in cellulose fibers segment to be significantly lower in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter and likely more comparable to the first quarter of 2014. Chart 11 shows the detail of unallocated items. Earnings in Q4 were negatively affected as unallocated items increased by approximately $23 million in Q4 compared to Q3. The largest increase was the change for profit and inventory in LIFO, which accounted for $14 million of the difference. Higher share-based compensation as a result of the increase in the stock price during the quarter accounted for an additional $8 million of the difference. Referring to Chart 13, I will catch on some overall financial comments. Cash flow from operations for the fourth quarter was $304 million. Major uses of cash during the quarter included capital expenditures of $124 million dividend payments for preference and common stock of $174 million and share repurchases of approximately $80 million. This brings our total share repurchases for the year to just over $200 million or approximately 30% of our current authorization. We ended the year, with total shares outstanding approximately of 524 million shares down from approximately 584 million at the beginning of the year. The divestiture of our home building business in the third quarter of last year resulted in retiring approximately 59 million shares. Total capital expenditures for the full year of 2014 including reforestation was $395 million for 2015, we are expecting expenditures in the range of $480 million to $500 million consistent with the guidance we gave at our investor meeting, this past December. I'll now wrap up with an update on the status of our retirement benefit plans. The unfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans increased by approximately $820 million as of the end of 2014 compared to 2013. This increase in unfunded status was primarily driven by the implementation of new mortality table and decreasing discount rate. The updated mortality table accounted for approximately $400 million of a deficient increase. And the majority of the remaining change was due to decreasing the discount rates by approximately 80 basis points for both the U.S. and Canadian plants. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2014 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan in 2015. Cash paid for other pension and post-retirement benefits in 2014 was $101 million. We expect total spending in 2015 to be approximately $90 million. Our primary contributions in 2015 will again be for our Canadian plants for approximately $40 million with the remainder going to pay for benefits under our supplemental pension plans and other post-employment benefit plans, none of which are separately funded. Chart 15 details pension and postretirement benefit plan expense from continuing operations by segment. For 2014, the full year net to zero. Pension and post retirement plan expense for 2015 is estimated to be approximately $40 million. The increased expense is driven by the adoption of the new mortality table and decrease discount rate. Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and I look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Patty. In 2014, we demonstrated our commitment to driving shareholder value by improving performance through operational excellence and returning cash to shareholders. As we enter 2015, our priorities remain unchanged. We remain relentlessly focused on driving operational excellence to the fully capitalized on our improving markets and deliver value to our shareholders and wit that; I'd like to open up the lines for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty. Patty Bedient : Good morning, Mark. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : I wondered, if the two of you could talk a little bit about the impact of FX move across your overall portfolio, you made a couple of references to this in the commentary already this morning. Doyle Simons : So, Mark let me talk generally about the effect of the stronger dollar across our businesses and then, Patty to fill in any of the details, but just generally you know stronger dollars generally is not a positive for Weyerhaeuser in terms of Japanese logs, what we seen is the demand is not been affected by the strong dollar as I referenced and Patty referenced in our comment, but if it continues, it could have potentially affect our price. In terms of Chinese logs, what's happened there, weak Rouble is making Russian logs less expensive than U.S. logs that of course reduces the price that the Chinese are willing to pay. Now with that said, as you very well know there is a practical limit on just how much Russia can provide and the other thing, we are at prices are not at desirable levels. We are able to redirect some of our logs to domestic markets there, in those domestic markets are holding up very well. In terms of wood products, the Canadian lumber mills are benefitting from the higher margins on shipments to the U.S. overall and then on Cellulose fibers as Patty alluded to the strong dollar at this point is not effected demand, but we do anticipate lower prices due to considerable pressure from Fluff pulp's customer primarily in Europe and currently India's K prices are under some pressure. So that's kind of the big picture impact of what's happening because of the stronger dollar. Patty Bedient : Sure, the only other thing that I would add, I think Doyle really went through all of the businesses, I would just call your attention to Chart 11 that I talked to in my comments and you notice there, that there is an FX loss both in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, that's really a function of U.S. Dollar denominated debt that it held by our Canadian subsidiaries. So as the Canadian Dollar depreciates as it did, again the fourth quarter that takes more Canadian Dollar pay off that loan, so that's what generates both of that loss there. Now as you look forward into Q1, the Canadian Dollar to-date, I think has depreciated even more than it did in the fourth quarter, but that would be driven ultimately by whatever the exchange rate as of the end of the quarter. Mark Wilde : Okay and Patty if I could ask just one follow-on, I wondered if you could talk a little bit about sort of that big cash position you're sitting on, at the rationale for holding so much and kind of tied with that, how you think about the completing the remaining share repurchase authorization, you have about $500 million out there, yet. Patty Bedient : Yes, so we are very committed to completing that authorization and we have a little under $500 million left to go, the other thing I would say, is that we think, we should have a cash balance somewhere between $300 million and $500 million. So we do have significant cash yet to create additional value for shareholders and we'll be talking about that, as we go into 2015 and have been discussing that, but I really don't have anything more to add. In terms of what we would use that for, other than just to reiterate that our priorities for capital allocation are first and foremost concerning cash to shareholders, investing in our businesses and maintaining our appropriate capital structure and to that end, I should probably add that. In January, we did receive an upgrade in our investments rating to BBB from BBB minus from S&P. So I think our capital structure is in good shape. Mark Wilde : Okay, very good. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hey good morning, this is actually John Babcock [ph] sitting in for George. How are you doing today? Doyle Simons : Good, how are you this morning? Unidentified Analyst : I'm doing very well, I just I know you talked a little bit earlier about the performance improvement and for as far as, Doyle if you could discuss, how everything is going on in that front, especially in 4Q and additionally are there any segment performance goals that are looking more difficult to achieve than when you presented back in December. And then lastly and the with the G&A expense reduction the fourth quarter, what was that ultimately focused? Doyle Simons : Yes, so in terms of OpEx targets, we continue to make progress in fourth quarter, 2014 and ended up essentially in line with what we laid out at our December, 9 presentation. So we're encouraged by the progress, we continue to make. In terms of 2015, as we specifically laid out on December 9, we think there is a lot of additional opportunity. We identified $20 million to $30 million of additional OpEx opportunity in Timberlands, another $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $10 million to $15 million in OSB. In ELP, here again the targeted is improving. EBITDA and that's $15 million to $20 million of EBITDA improvement in $20 million to $30 million of EBITDA improvement in distribution business and then $30 million to $35 million in cellulose fibers. So overall, very encouraged by the progress we're making, but still as I mentioned in my comments still a lot of work to do in front of us, but we are very focused on getting that to bottom line in 2015. Regarding your SG&A comment, our question if you will re-ask that, so make sure I'm more responsive to your question. Unidentified Analyst : I was just wondering, it looks like G&A expense to come down in the fourth quarter and I was just wondering ultimately, what drove that? Doyle Simons : When we laid out our SG&A target back at the end of 2013, we said it would take a balance of 2014 to get it fully implemented. So we continue to make progress in the fourth quarter and about end of the fourth quarter, we were at the run rate of above $75 million in terms of our SG&A targets. So encouraged by the progress, we made there and as I mentioned we've achieved that target, but we'll constantly be looking for opportunities to make sure we had the appropriate cost structure going forward. Patty Bedient : You know, actually as you look at Q3 to Q4. Q4 is up over Q3 and that's really just a function of some of the timing that happened with year-end as well as the additional item in unallocated as I spoke about share-based comp etc., but as Doyle said we feel very confident about that $75 million reduction run rate. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, good. Thank you for the colour there and then next, I guess before I pass it on, I was just wondering on the cellulose fibers front. First of all, it looked like liquid packaging realizations were down a little bit in 3Q and I was wondering, if most of that was seasonal nature or if there is any impact ultimately from the port disruption and then on top of that, how are the mills performing on the 18-month payment schedule? Patty Bedient : Well, as it relates to the liquid packaging realization, the decrease in the fourth quarter wasn't driven by the port disruption. It was driven by the fact that we had, we were bringing up Longview liquid packaging as a result of the extended outage that we had in Q3. So it's just a little mix of lower grade board in the start-up of that facility coming up from the outage. You'll see in Q1 as I referenced in my comment that the tails realizations will increase in the first quarter more consistent to where we were on the more normal sales mix. So the fourth quarter decrease is really just a mix issue from the start off the machine. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great and then on the maintenance schedule briefly. Patty Bedient : Yes on the 18 month schedule we are on track fully implemented for that. You know it will vary from year-to-year as 18 months, but we're pretty much on schedule to do that. As I mentioned, our largest fluff mill goes down this quarter. So that's our maintenance outage that we have in the Q1. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. Thanks for the colour. I'll get back in the queue. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you was hoping to get a bit more colour on your encouraging comments on wood products prices expected to go higher as the quarter progresses and maybe, it's just kind of contextual, why they had been weak quarter-to-date and what you think and what degree of confidence, do you have, indeed they're going to turn? Doyle Simons : Mark as you know predicting prices is always difficult, currently as we alluded to lumber prices are down slightly versus the fourth quarter average and OSB prices are down about $5 versus the fourth quarter average. We in talking to customers understand that, inventory levels are very lean. We also believe as we said, the housing is going to continue to improve. So our thought is as we move into closer to the stronger seasonal period that we will see a rally in lumber and OSB prices as we move throughout this quarter. So our comments to your point, our prediction regarding significant improvements in earnings in wood products in first quarter versus fourth quarter are dependent on pricing, but we do believe our crystal ball tells us that, we will see higher prices as we move through the quarter in wood products, but time will tell. Mark Weintraub : Thank you and do you have any view as to what's been frustrating prices of late, there is some weather related issues or is there, just I mean, obviously seasonally it's not a great time, but any added colour you might have that anything unusual going on or just part of the seasonal process? Doyle Simons : I think it's mostly the seasonal process, Mark. You know there have been some weather related events I don't need to tell you all, the north you all lived through one earlier this week. So I think there have been some isolated weather incidents, so far we haven't had the type of weather overall, that we had last year first quarter. So I think it's mostly seasonal, I think it is, some people being very conservative on their buying as I said, inventory levels throughout the system are very lean and that's part of why we believe that prices are going to rally because as demand does pick up, as we get to closer to this spring building period. We believe it's not to take a lot of pick up and demand to have an impact on pricing moving forward. Mark Weintraub : Okay, that necessarily don't make sense and just lastly, as you think about the dividend this year. Can you kind of remind us, what the key metrics you'd be looking at that would determine any action you might want to take on the dividend later in the year? Doyle Simons : Yes, let me just make a general comment about the dividend, you know it goes back to our overall leverage we pulled in and we clearly understand that the capital allocation is a key lever to driving shareholder value. You know as we've consistently said over our number one priorities in terms of capital allocation returning cash to shareholders through growing and sustainable dividend. As you know, we increased our dividend by over 30% in 2014 and I'll just tell you, we'll be working with our board later this year to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward. We have given general and I reference it as general guideline of 75% of that over a cycle in terms of dividend level, but again that's just a guideline but we do in fact understand the importance of growing our dividend and that's something we intend to do, continue to do going forward. Mark Weintraub : And would it be fair to say, that you'd consider 2015 at least the way it looks out to be, not an above average year given that housing is still at fairly depressed levels or? Doyle Simons : Yes, that's a fair comment. I mean, as we said we anticipate housing this year will be north of 1.1, but that's still a long way from kind of average 1.4, 1.5, and 1.6. So I would agree with your commentary. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Connelly : Thank you, two things. Doyle. First, how are you thinking about the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. Timberlands acquisitions? And then secondly, as you think about the targets you're setting for wood products for 2015 is the emphasis different than it was in 2014. I'm just curious because you achieved a lot so fast in those businesses and I'm wondering, if you got to do something different to get to next layer up. Doyle Simons : So Mark in terms of the relative value of U.S. versus non-U.S. timberlands you know as we've said before, we look at all opportunities to grow our Timberlands both domestic and non-domestic. I will tell you, I think our bigger opportunity is going forward probably be in the U.S. we will look internationally I think one things we would be sure and do when we look internationally is, risk adjust based on the international exposure and we'll continue to that going forward. As you know, we have a very good plantation position in Uruguay. Those trees are we have a very good team there, those trees are very well positioned and growing really fast and those markets continue to develop over there, but as I tell you, we'll look both, but I think our bigger opportunities to grow our timberlands will be domestic going forward. In terms of our wood products, operational excellence targets. Mark, thanks for the comment. We did made good progress in 2014, but if that's it. We still got a lot of work to do in that business. Now I'm not going to tell you, it's going to be easy. Yes you continue to make progress on these. You kind of got some of the low hanging, so you've got it remain very focused on delivering that to the bottom line, that's why we set very specific targets and have very specific plans on how we're going to get there, both from the sales perspective as well as the cost perspective. So we are very focused on pulling every lever that we can pull to continue to drive OpEx improvements in the wood products business and are confident, we're going to reach the targets that we set out in 2015, but your point. I mean, it will get harder as we move forward, but I'm confident that we have the team and the focus to accomplish the goals that we set forth. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead with your question. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Gail. Patty Bedient : Good morning, Gail. Gail Glazerman : I guess, just could I go back to some of the comments about currency and how that might flow into some of the market. Have you seen, can you give any sense of magnitude to the shift that you might have seen in Russia and maybe more detail. Have you seen any signs of Canadian lumber and being redirected from China into the U.S. then if so, any concerns if that might affect some of the western market? Doyle Simons : Gail, as you would expect it's hard to know exactly what's happening in Russia situation. Clearly we are hearing and seeing that there is more logs coming from Russia into China. I think most of that's in northern china, as I understand it. So I think depending on what happens to rule that something, that continue but as outlined there are some practical limits based on just how much you can comment just on the infrastructure challenges, that Russia has had historically and we believe, will continue to have going forward. Patty, do you have any thoughts on the Canadian question and any redirects some lumber coming from anything going to China that's been redirected otherwise? Patty Bedient : I think that is something that, is happening we haven't seen a big company lumber volumes overall again. So I think the extent that we'll see it more as bringing building season continue. So it will be something that will impact us going forward. We do have some Canadian operations ourselves as well and Gail, you referenced the western prices, I think that's also Canadian lumber coming in, puts pressure on the U.S. South as well, but so far it's not been, a huge piece. Gail Glazerman : Okay, can you give any insights on to how your oil and gas income might be impacted by the recent collapse in oil prices? Doyle Simons : And so let me give you a couple of sensitivities to that, I think we've done some work on that exact issue. So as you think about oil and gas prices and specifically oil prices going down there is some give and take as you would expect, but as we think about sensitivity specifically to diesel prices and how that slows through, I would tell you that we think there's probably $4 million to $5 million benefit in our earnings in fourth quarter, 2014 as a result of lower diesel prices and that's probably $2 million to $3 million in Timberlands, a $2 million in Timberlands, $2 million in wood products and maybe a $1 million in Cellulose fibers. Going forward, we would tell you that every roughly $0.10 decline in diesel prices flowing it through the system would result in somewhere in the $5 million benefit again with the relative ratios kind of like outlined earlier in terms of various businesses. So in annual basis, every $0.10 reduction in diesel prices will have a bottom line $5 million impact. Now, there are some offset as you just alluded to, one of them is, we continue to face increasing base rates for trucks and rail carriers as those continue to be tight, so that will somewhat offset some of the benefits, I just outlined and then to your point. If oil prices remained at the levels that they're currently, it will take a little time, but that would have a negative impact on our mineral income going forward. Just how much is hard to know, we haven't seen a big impact so far, but again if oil prices stay, 50 or south of 50 that would have some impact going forward as we continue to look at ways to maximize the value from our mineral resources. Gail Glazerman : Okay, thank you and just one last quick one. Patty, can you spot us or give us any perspective on how much pulp maintenance will be in the first quarter? Patty Bedient : I think that will have an additional in the fourth quarter somewhere, I would expect around $10 million to $15 million in additional maintenance expense. We'll have some decrease as a result of the effect of less productivity because of maintenance. You know as I said, as you think about the overall earnings for the pulp segment or say about fiber segment, it's a little difficult to project. So we try to give you a little more colour in that, we said it would be significantly lower than the fourth quarter, but probably comparable to the first quarter of 2014 which I think was somewhere a little bit north of 50, maybe 54. Gail Glazerman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. James Armstrong : Good morning, this is James Armstrong sitting in for Chip. Doyle Simons : Good morning, James. Patty Bedient : Morning, James. James Armstrong : First question is, in wood products with oil prices down significantly. How much impact have you seen in resin and chemical cost so far and could you remind us of the cost buckets for that business? Doyle Simons : Yes, so James the sensitivities that I just outlined for Gail, that we just outlined for Gail in terms of diesel prices includes the improvements in resin, but you're exactly right that's where the biggest opportunity is in terms of the lower oil prices is in the resin that we buy for OSB and ELP businesses. So the biggest component of what I just outlined is prices as oil prices move down, resin prices are moving down and the sensitivity I gave earlier is making the correlation between diesel and resin and then flowing that through to the bottom line. James Armstrong : Okay, that's also lot and then switching gears. Any chance to retire debt in the next year, I was just wondering if there are any lockups or what's going on the? Patty Bedient : Sure as you think about the debt, we don't have any maturity due until 2017 and for us to retire that debt in terms of premiums we would have to pay really don't make it very economics to do that, depending upon the issues, it's probably premium of somewhere between 75%, 30% slot. So we do continue to look at it, but it doesn't really seem to make a lot of sense to us at this point. James Armstrong : Perfect and then lastly, could you just give us a update on what you expect the 2015 tax rate to be? Patty Bedient : Sure, the tax rate always is dependent upon the mix of weak income which the tax rate is zero and GRS income which is be somewhere around 33%. So there are two things that drive that, one is rate overall which is dependent upon the mix, but we would expect that we'd beat somewhere around 18% to 20%. James Armstrong : Okay, that helps. Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Linton [ph] with J.P. Morgan. Please go ahead with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Yes, thanks good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Tyler [ph]. Unidentified Analyst : I was just wondering, in the west for Timberlands I know it's still early, but do you think domestic demand at this point is still strong enough to offset the weaker demand that you're seeing sort of the export markets as this time? Doyle Simons : As we talked about at least in the first quarter, we anticipate that we will have higher earnings in Timberlands and clearly a component of the higher earnings versus the fourth quarter Tyler [ph] our higher price and that's primarily due to domestic prices being higher as you just alluded to and some mix issue. So we'll see how it plays out going forward, but as we said domestic prices are in good shape and we think that it continue, we'll just have to see what happens in terms of, I think the biggest challenge as we talked about in the Chinese markets will get through the lunar holiday, as we talked about inventory has come down and not back to where normal is, but they have come down. So our guess is, those markets will stabilize in the second half of the year as well. Unidentified Analyst : Okay then I was, in terms of your export log volumes. I guess China has slipped they had been kind of pulling around 30% of your volumes and they were around 25% this quarter. Is that anything, is that like a deliberate effort on your part just given the weakness over there? Or really that's just function of demand from China has just slowed lot more than the demand, slowed out of Japan? Doyle Simons : I would say both, Tyler [ph]. I mean part of it is, we have seen a little bit of fall off in demand in China as we alluded too, but we also made the conscious decision to redirect some of those log domestically because of the strong prices that we're seeing on the west coast. So it's the combination of both things. Unidentified Analyst : Got you and I think it's finally engineered wood products side, I think you've had two quarters of pretty significant production declines. Have these been more sort of temporary cuts and do you think volumes are little bit down more towards the level that \u2013we saw in the first half of 2014 or dipping in the volumes to kind of grow more in line off of this lower base, any thoughts on that going forward? Doyle Simons : Yes, I think the declines one of them was kind of, it happened because of the second or third was, as we put in a price increase and moving some volume forward to the second versus the third and then the follow-up in the fourth quarter from our perspective was purely seasonal. So as we move into the stronger seasonal period first quarter and then second quarter, we would anticipate a nice rebound in volumes in our engineered wood products business. Unidentified Analyst : Very great, thanks so much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes, thanks very much and good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Paul. Paul Quinn : Yes, just two easy questions today. Just one is, you referenced opportunities in Timberland in North America, just wondering if you could comment on that competitive landscape out there, whether you're looking at bigger things or smaller things? Doyle Simons : Yes, so as you know it's been pretty active in terms of activity in both the south and the west. In terms of the competitive landscape, I still think there is a lot of money out there that is looking to invest in this asset class. In terms of the way we look at it, our key criteria or we clearly are looking for opportunities that generate appropriate returns and cash flow both short-term and long-term. We look for opportunities where we can strengthen our access to strategically important markets for us or move into new markets, that we may not be in although we are in most markets, as you know. Also looking for opportunities where we can get synergies and I think Longview is a very good example of where we were able to do some things to get some mix synergies and then finally to your point. We are looking for scale opportunity. Now that doesn't mean, we won\u2019t do some small deals and we're always in the market doing some small deals, we're really looking for some scale opportunities to continue to grow our timberland, if we can find those right opportunities going forward. So that's kind of the way, we think about it. Paul Quinn : Okay, great and then turning over to the SoftWood Lumber Agreement. One of your competitors on a timber REIT side, this week said that he talked to Softwood Lumber Agreement served its purpose and really no longer needed. I'm just wondering what Weyerhaeuser's position is, are you happy with the current agreement, do you want to see higher import duties or is it the latter that no longer needed? Doyle Simons : Yes, I wouldn't say some type of agreement is no longer needed. As you know, as we've talked about, the agreement set to expire later this year. I can tell you there is a lot of discussion from folks on both sides of the border discussing options for renewing that agreement and also to tell you that we are very actively involved in those discussions. Paul Quinn : Okay that's all I had, thanks a lot. Thanks. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, I've a question on cellulose fibers. Given we've seen a slowing of emerging market economies and a very strong dollar. I was wondering, as we start the year putting aside the west coast port issues. Are you seeing any change in customer buying behaviour or any slowing of demand for fluff and then a related question. You have a competitor who's talked about converting a fair amount of new fluff capacity next year and I think you've debottlenecked some capacity as well. I was just wondering, how you're thinking about the fluff supply-demand balance over the next year or so? Patty Bedient : Sure, Anthony. You know as it relates to demand for the product. Demand has continued to be very strong having said that, I think that we will likely have some downward pressure potentially on price, just given what's happening with the economies in Asia as well as just currency flows. So far we've been very pleased with the demand outlook for fluff, it is thus continue to grow, but depending upon what's happened with some of those developing economies, we could see some softening a little bit there, but really haven't seen it after a point. As it relates to conversion, I wouldn't want speculate too much because it will take some time for any conversion to come in to place and then it will just be a function of what the overall market is at that point in time. One thing I would say is that, as we talked about before, the higher quality fluff product which is where we play primarily does have a consumer product companies like Procter & Gamble who are pretty picky about the quality. So not only does it, it take time to actually do the conversion to the product, it also takes time to qualify that product. So it's something we are watching very carefully and being very thoughtful as we go forward, but the current state is that the demand, which is pretty solid. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful and then maybe just switching to wood products. You\u2019ve made some very impressive performance improvements in distribution this year or last year. I think you referenced to $20 million to $30 million improvement target for 2015. Can you drill down a little bit on the kind of the leverage you're going to pull to drive that EBITDA improvement and distribution this year and can you talk a little bit about the strategic importance of distribution as part of the broader wood products portfolio? Doyle Simons : Yes, so in terms of the leverage that we're going to pull. There seems to be the same levers that we pulled in 2014, it's just continuing to be focused on that. As Cathy Slater talked about it in our December 9 presentation it's really a focus on what we call the five S's which is sourcing, selling, stocking, storing and shipping. So it's basically the blocking and tackling of making sure we're continuing to do things to drive down our cost structure where it needs to be and then making sure we are doing things on the sell side to maximize the profit margins of what we run through our distribution system. In terms of how we think about distribution as I've said before \u2013 that\u2019s a business where frankly we've underperformed for a number of years. We needed to show that we could make dramatic improvements in that versus in terms of overall EBITDA improvement and where we stack up competitively. We started to do that in 2014, but still a lot of work remains to be done in terms of how we think about it going forward, that's business we need to show that we can win by out-executing the competition and generate returns well in excess of our cost of capital over a cycle and that's what we are focused on doing currently. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Doyle Simons : Great. Thank you. Okay, so I understand it that was our last question. So I would just like to end by saying, thank you everybody for joining in this morning. More importantly thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Patty Bedient : Thanks everybody. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference c all. You may now disconnect.",

Davidson Mark Wilde - BMO Capital George Staphos - Bank of America Collin Mings - Raymond James Operator : Good morning. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead, ma\u2019am. Denise Merle : Thank you, Brad. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s first quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in earnings material on our website. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Denise and good morning everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings for the first quarter of $90 million, or $0.17 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a $9 million after-tax charge related to a non-strategic asset, we earned $99 million, or $0.19 per diluted share. We were pleased with our first quarter performance in timberland and wood products as our operational excellence efforts enabled both businesses to improve earnings compared with the fourth quarter despite weaker market conditions. Our cellulose fiber business faced several challenges in the quarter, including ongoing West Coast port disruptions, a strengthening U.S. dollar and the slower-than-expected restart of our largest fluff mill following a scheduled maintenance outage. Our earnings before special items also included non-cash foreign exchange losses of approximately $0.04 per diluted share related to debt held by our Canadian entity. We continue to aggressively execute our share repurchase program. During the first quarter, we repurchased over $250 million of common shares. That\u2019s $250 million of common shares. In total, through the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased over $450 million, or 65% of our $700 million share authorization. I will begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. U.S. housing activity paused in the first quarter as severe winter weather delayed the spring selling season and disrupted construction activity throughout much of the country. Although reported new home sales were lower than anticipated in the first quarter, we are encouraged by the recent positive homebuilder sentiment regarding an improving spring selling season. Employment growth, strong consumer confidence and historically low mortgage rates should support improvement in new home sales this year. Our outlook for 2015 remains unchanged at approximately 1.1 million starts. Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with timberlands, Charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $162 million to first quarter earnings, an increase of $19 million compared with the fourth quarter. Operational excellence initiatives related to cost efficiencies and log merchandising more than offset the effect of softening Western markets and unusual winter weather. In the West, average log sales realizations declined. This decline is primarily due to a shift in mix as we sold fewer logs in the export markets as the continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar pressure demand and pricing for our export logs. Sales volumes to Japan declined due to seasonally weaker demand in a slightly softer housing market following last year\u2019s increase in the consumption tax. However, average sales realizations for our Japanese logs improved slightly due to favorable mix. Chinese demand remains slowed throughout the extended lunar period and inventories remained at elevated levels. The combination of lower export log demand and unusually favorable logging conditions generated an oversupply of logs in Western domestic markets and domestic log pricing weakened during the quarter. In the South, unusually wet weather slightly amplified our normal seasonal decline in fee harvest volumes. Average sales realizations for Southern logs were comparable to the fourth quarter. First quarter included earnings of $17 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $14 million compared with the fourth quarter. The timberlands business continues to expect $20 million to $30 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015 from efforts related to log merchandising, harvesting, transportation and silviculture efficiencies and non-timber revenues. Wood products, Charts 6 and 7, wood products contributed $62 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $6 million compared with the fourth quarter. EBITDA increased to $88 million. Results were comparable to the first quarter of last as benefits from operational excellence initiatives helped the business offset lower year-over-year sales realizations of nearly 15% in OSB and 7% in lumber. In lumber, EBITDA was unchanged compared to the fourth quarter as the business fully offset a 3% decline in average sales realizations with benefits from operational excellence initiatives to reduce manufacturing costs net of logs and overhead expenses. In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $3 million. Average sales realizations declined 5% compared with the fourth quarter. This decline was largely offset by reductions in manufacturing cost. Engineered wood products reported first quarter EBITDA of $26 million, an increase of $12 million compared with the fourth quarter and $18 million more than the first quarter of 2014. Sales volumes rose across all product lines, primarily due to stronger demand in the West and per unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher production volumes and operational excellence initiatives. EBITDA for the distribution business declined by $2 million compared with the fourth quarter, but improved $2 million compared with the first quarter of 2014. This business remains focused on improving margins and lowering cost. Our wood products businesses continue to target 2015 operational excellence improvement of $20 million to $25 million from lumber, $10 million to $15 million from OSB, $15 million to $20 million of additional engineered wood products EBITDA and $20 million to $30 million of additional EBITDA from distribution. Cellulose fibers, Charts 8 and 9, cellulose fibers contributed $33 million to earnings compared with $87 million in the fourth quarter. The West Coast port disputes significantly affected our cellulose fiber business throughout the quarter. Although a tentative contract agreement was reached in late February, productivity at the ports of Seattle and Tacoma remain well below normal due to continued congestion at the container terminals. Both ports are also absorbing volumes from carriers that have canceled service at the Port of Portland. As a result of the disruption, we incurred 13 days of downtime at our liquid packaging facility as well as incremental warehousing and transportation costs throughout the segment. In total the port disruption affected segment earnings by approximately $15 million in the quarter. This was significantly more than we had originally anticipated. Turning to our pulp mill systems, pulp markets weakened during the first quarter as global inventories remained above balanced levels and a strengthening U.S. dollar pressured broader market pricing. Average pulp sales realizations declined due to slightly softer pricing for pulp, weaker pricing for our premium towel and tissue grades and an unfavorable product mix. First quarter also included higher maintenance expense for a planned outage at our largest fluff mill. The restart of this mill took longer than anticipated resulting in lower production and higher per unit manufacturing costs. This mill is now running well. The cellulose fiber business remains relentlessly focused on delivering operational excellence improvements of $30 million to $35 million in 2015. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our second quarter outlook. Patty Bedient : Thanks, Doyle and good morning everybody. The outlook for the second quarter is summarized on Chart 13 and I will begin the discussion with timberlands. In the West, log export volume is expected to improve from Q1 consistent with higher seasonal construction activity. Log prices are likely to remain under downward pressure due to the combination of currency headwinds and higher-than-normal inventories in China. Western domestic log prices and volumes have continued to decrease through the first part of this quarter, but we anticipate they will stabilize as housing activity begins to improve and mill inventories come back into balance. Fee harvest in the West will decrease slightly and road costs are expected to increase seasonally. In the south, we anticipate pricing consistent with first quarter levels. We expect typical seasonal increases in fee harvest and silviculture costs. In Q1, the gain on non-strategic land sales was $17 million. We anticipate only minimal land sales in Q2. In total, we expect that earnings in our Timberlands segment will be lower in the second quarter compared to the first. Moving to wood products, thus far in the quarter, prices for lumber and oriented strand board have continued to soften and are currently below the average sales realizations for last quarter. However, we do expect this trend to reverse as weather improves and building activity picks up. As a result, we anticipate that average realizations in the second quarter for both lumber and OSB will be similar to Q1 on seasonally increased volumes. Volumes in engineered wood products are expected to increase significantly with little change in pricing. Western log prices should decrease compared to the first quarter and per unit manufacturing costs will likely be lower due to higher operating rates and our operational excellence initiatives. Overall, second quarter earnings in the wood products segment are expected to be significantly higher than Q1. In cellulose fibers, pulp prices have been negatively affected by foreign currency exchange rates and higher than normal inventory levels. Second quarter average sales realizations are anticipated to be lower than the average for Q1. The effect of lower realization should be partially offset by increased sales volume. While the disruptions caused by the West Coast port dispute have lessened, we continue to have some negative effects in the second quarter. We will have an extended outage at one of our southern fluff mills in order to perform scheduled maintenance and to install energy-related capital improvements. These improvements include installation of a turbine generator and upgrades of the boilers and steam and power systems. Benefits include lower manufacturing costs through improved reliability, improved energy efficiency and increased outside power sales. This second quarter outage is anticipated to result in more than twice the number of outage days compared to the 17 days in Q1. We expect maintenance expense will be approximately $15 million higher in Q2 compared to Q1. As a result of this extended outage, overall earnings in the cellulose fibers segment are expected to be lower in the second quarter compared to the first. We have only one mill maintenance outage scheduled for the second half of the year and therefore earnings in the second half of the year should be significantly higher than the first. Chart 10 details the major items of unallocated costs. Q1 expense, before special items, increased to $41 million from the fourth quarter level of $13 million. As Doyle mentioned, the major item was the non-cash foreign exchange impact of $29 million resulting from the weaker Canadian dollar. In Q2, we expect that the total expense for unallocated items will be closer to the fourth quarter level before considering the effect of foreign exchange rates. Now, I will wrap up with some overall financial statement comments. I will refer you to Chart 11 for this discussion. Cash for the quarter decreased $422 million. Cash flow from operations was $77 million. As you can see from the chart, the first quarter is typically our lowest quarter due to seasonality. Major outflows in the first quarter were as follows. Capital expenditures were $89 million. We continue to expect that total capital expenditures for the year will be approximately $500 million. We paid $152 million in dividends and repurchased shares for $253 million. The share repurchase activity is summarized on Chart 12. As of the end of the first quarter, we had just over $240 million remaining on the $700 million authorization that we announced last August. Now, I will turn the call back over to Doyle and I look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Patty. We are optimistic housing markets will strengthen throughout the remainder of 2015 and look forward to improving demand as the spring selling and summer building season progresses. Going forward, our priorities remained unchanged. We are relentlessly focused on improving our performance through operational excellence and delivering on our priorities for capital allocation. And now I would like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. I just wanted to focus a little bit more on the Cellulose Fibers segment just to make sure I understood what was said, I believe you said that the maintenance costs would be as much as $50 million higher second quarter versus first quarter? Patty Bedient : Thanks for asking that question, Mark. It\u2019s $15 million. Mark Weintraub : Okay, alright. That changes things, all those questions throughout the window. Shifting gears then, when looking at the first quarter, I think you originally were anticipating that you would see lumber and presumably OSB pricing come back and it didn\u2019t, do you think that was more a function of the demand or supply side issues, maybe if you could delve into that a bit? Doyle Simons : Mark, as you know historically we have experienced price increases in the first quarter and the fourth quarter in lumber. As you highlighted, we thought that would happen again this year, it did not. And to your question, I think there were two drivers. Number one is while January was okay from a weathers perspective, February and March were not. So clearly from a demand perspective, the lack of construction activity due to the severe weather had an impact on the demand side of the equation. I think there was also some impact from additional supply of lumber coming from Canada due to the currency situation. So I think it was a combination of both of those things that resulted in pricing not improving to the level that we had anticipated when we had the fourth quarter call. Mark Weintraub : And so is it fair to say that the demand side should take care of itself assuming housing continues to improve and how do you feel of the supply side, is the stronger dollar \u2013 does that change the playing field a bit on a go-forward basis or does \u2013 are there reasons why that will come back to normalized and the supply issues disappear? Doyle Simons : Yes, I think it\u2019s the latter, Mark. I think the demand side will clearly take care of itself. And fortunately we are starting to see some real signs of improvements there. On the supply side, I think that takes care of itself over time as well. As you continue to see improvement in export markets for lumber and as we also know, there is just a natural constraint on how much lumber can come from Canada on an ongoing basis because of the pine beetle situation. So I think both supply and demand work temporary phenomenon in the quarter and will take care of themselves over time. Mark Weintraub : Okay, I will get back in queue. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead with your question. Tyler Langton : Yes. Good morning. Thanks. I guess just timberlands, Doyle I mean, I think you mentioned kind of touched on that in your opening remarks, but I guess, in general revenues were down but profits were up, could you just talk a little bit about how much sort of mix may be contributed operational excellence. And I guess applied on the wood products side, because there is sort of a similar trend there as well. Doyle Simons : Yes. So, it\u2019s referred to in the comments. We clearly saw some benefit from operational excellence in both the timberland business and the wood products business in the first quarter. And timberlands, to your point, basically what happened there is we had lower price and volume as we talked about, but that was more than offset by lower cost in the quarter, the lower costs being both in the west and in the south in the lower price and volume of course being primarily in the west. In addition, we had some benefit from higher land sales, but that\u2019s what got us to the improvement in the first quarter versus fourth despite the fact that we had weaker market conditions specifically in the west. On the wood products side, I would say we were pleased with the fact that we clearly saw OpEx improvements in our results in the first quarter. Because as we talked about, we did in fact, have resident higher prices, we had lower prices pretty much across the board. So, I would tell you our continued effort for example in lumber to reduce our cost net of log. We saw benefit there in OSB, lower manufacturing cost. And then in ELP where we saw a nice improvement really what \u2013 the key driver there was we had lower price kind of offset by higher volume, but the \u2013 we had overall lower manufacturing cost due to favorable resins, less maintenance downtime in the quarter, but frankly before I was just running better as a result of our OpEx effort. So, that\u2019s kind of how what we saw play out in the first quarter versus fourth. Tyler Langton : And then I guess do you think you are on track with your operational excellence goals to exceed the targets for this year or are you generally sort of in line? Doyle Simons : Yes, I would say we are on track in both timberlands and in wood products. We got some catching up to do in cellulose fiber. Tyler Langton : Got it. Okay, thanks so much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead with your question. Usha Guntupalli : Thanks. It\u2019s actually Usha Guntupalli on for Alex. How are you? Doyle Simons : Good. How are you this morning? Usha Guntupalli : Good, thanks. Just following up on the operational excellence program as you are working through this program, has execution proved a bit more difficult than original expectations for any of the segments or maybe are you even seeing opportunities for further savings in any segments? Doyle Simons : I would say generally and made this comment before as we get deeper into our operational excellence program it\u2019s harder work to get it done. But with that said as I just referred to very pleased with the progress that we made in our timberlands business and our lumber business \u2013 I mean, timberlands business and our wood products business in the fourth quarter, still some additional work to do in cellulose fiber, but we are very encouraged by the progress we made. And I can tell you our folks are working really hard everyday to deliver against those targets and we are confident that we will reach those targets in 2015. Patty Bedient : The one thing that I would add is on the \u2013 Doyle did a nice job of walking through the operational excellence on the businesses. One of the other areas that we had was our G&A targets \u2013 SG&A targets. And as we said at the end of the year that we had identified the things that we needed to execute on to get that and you can see in the results year-over-year the improvement is coming through there. So, we are also equally pleased on that front. Usha Guntupalli : And just a quick one on FX, are you seeing a major impact on trade flows for the log market given all the FX slows around the world? Doyle Simons : I am sorry will you repeat your question please? Usha Guntupalli : Yes. Could you talk a little bit about the FX impact on the log market like are you seeing major changes in trade flows around the world? Doyle Simons : Yes. So, as we talked about we did see some impact on the trade flows in terms of our export volumes in the first quarter. As we stated, volumes were down both into Japan and into China. And as a result, there was additional trade flow that came into the domestic market and that was part of the reason for the lower cost \u2013 lower priced logs. Overall, lower price realizations in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Usha Guntupalli : Great, thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead with your question. Chip Dillon : Yes. Good morning Doyle and Patty. Patty Bedient : Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning Chip. Chip Dillon : First question is on the \u2013 just to make sure I heard this right. I know that timberland, I think sales were top line $25 million in the first quarter, did you say that earnings impact was $18 million? Patty Bedient : Are you talking about the gain on non-strategic land sales in the Timberland segment? Chip Dillon : Yes, that will go away in the second quarter? Yes. Patty Bedient : Yes. The gain was in the first quarter was $17 million in total and that was an increase of $14 million over the fourth quarter. And we really don\u2019t expect anything of any significance in the second quarter. Chip Dillon : Okay. Patty Bedient : So if that\u2019s true that will impact our Timberland earnings without $17 million. And we would expect that that\u2019s probably half of the decrease of Q1 to Q2. The other piece would be primarily Western logs. Chip Dillon : I see. Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Now, switching gears, Doyle you had mentioned coming in back in December of \u201813 that the two businesses within wood products that you really wanted to see that needed to improve the most were engineered wood and distribution. And it looks like at least like in the first quarter and just kind of watching that trends of the engineered business, engineered wood products is doing great compared to what it had done, but it also on the same token looks like distribution is kind of still well, better it\u2019s still bumping along breakeven and how would you sort of look at those businesses strategically over the next year or 2 years. And has for example, engineered kind of earned its right to grow yet and what has to change in distribution? Doyle Simons : Yes. So to your point Chip, we did make the comment that we needed to significantly improve the performance in both of those businesses. And in 2014, as you will recall we improved earnings in each of those businesses \u2013 both of those businesses by $30 million to $40 million, so real progress. At the end of 2014, as you also recall Chip, we made the comment that that was good progress, but we still have a lot of work to do to get these businesses to where they need to be long-term. Thank you, for your comment on the progress that we made on ELP in the first quarter and we were pleased with that, more work to do. And on distribution we did made slight improvements there. But what I would tell you is we set goals \u2013 OpEx goals for ELP of $15 million to $20 million for 2015. And we are on track and maybe a little bit ahead of schedule to deliver on that and then on distribution, $20 million to $30 million. And I am still confident that we will accomplish that going forward. So I would say progress in both businesses, still work to do. And ultimately as I have said, we just got to show that we can in both of those businesses, earn above our cost of capital over the cycle and sustainably and maybe more importantly how to execute our competition, so still more work to be done. But thanks for your comment on the progress. Chip Dillon : And then I guess, the last question is just you have certainly executed on the buyback as you said you would back in last August in the wake of the building \u2013 homebuilders sale, homebuilding business sale. As we get out, I would imagine to the next \u2013 to this summer or maybe early fall and assuming you have worked through the remaining authorization, what is your sort of your view then, are you going to take another look to see if you should continue a buyback. I know that obviously, a lot of these \u2013 this buyback was funded by the sale of homebuilding business. And you also \u2013 I am sure what would fit your thinking is your view towards opportunities in timberland acquisitions although we keep hearing there is really not much on the market, so what \u2013 any early thoughts on those issues? Doyle Simons : Chip, as you know we spend a lot of time focusing on capital allocation around here and we are constantly reviewing our various alternatives. To your point, as we approach the completion of the current repurchase authorization, we will work with our Board regarding the best use of our cash going forward. As we have previously stated, long-term we believe the appropriate level of cash in our balance sheet is in the $300 million to $500 million range. And even with the completion of the current share authorization we will be well in excess of that. So something we are spending a lot of time working on thinking about and we will make some decisions as we move forward. Chip Dillon : Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Regarding the West Coast port strike, I think you indicated it was $15 million in 1Q. And I think Patty said that there was you are still kind of feeling the effects of that this quarter. Is there any way to size what the impact of West Coast port strike might be this quarter? And then I think you indicated the oversupply of Western logs that you saw in 1Q, you have had some level of confidence that might sort of work itself out domestically as demand improves. I am just wondering the inventory situation in China and the oversupply in China, do you have any view as to what \u2013 when that situation sort of normalizes? Doyle Simons : Okay. So, in terms of the port situation, that has been \u2013 as we said in our comments, has taken longer to get resolved than we had originally anticipated. There are still some congestion at the port. We had no situation in Portland in some of the traffic there moving to Seattle and Tacoma. But to your point, Patty, I did say that it was $15 million impact in the first quarter and we would expect that to be $5 million or less impact in the second quarter. Patty Bedient : I think it could be $5 million to $10 million in the second quarter. Doyle Simons : Okay. And then the \u2013 your question regarding \u2013 let\u2019s talk a little bit about kind of how we are viewing the export markets and the overall markets for our timberland for our logs. In Japan, what we have seen there is we talked about reduced log demand by lower housing activity. The strong U.S. dollar is impacting the pricing as our customer competes with other alternatives from Europe due to the comparative FX rates and Q2 log shipments as we said should be up seasonally compared with Q1, but the price we anticipate will be down and we expect prices to stabilize as we go out of the second quarter into the third quarter. China, there we are having the strong U.S. dollar is having a negative impact on the U.S. log demand and pricing relative to imports from New Zealand and Russia. Log inventories as everybody know remain elevated at approximately 4.5 million cubic meters. We expect our shipments to be higher in the second quarter compared with the first quarter due to the Chinese building season. We expect continued downward pressure on pricing in 2Q. And here again, we expect prices to stabilize in the second quarter moving into the third quarter. I would make the point on China, despite the current situation if you take a little bit longer term look we believe China will continue to be a key market for us due to continued growth in middle class in China and the limitation \u2013 the natural limitations on additional wood supply from Russia and New Zealand, but China has been volatile in the past and we think we will continue to be volatile going forward. And then finally if you look at it at the domestic markets, I think to your specific questions, we think the \u2013 the volume and prices that we see there will flatten its housing activity accelerates, especially in California and we are starting to see some of that. And as log inventories normalize, a part of why the log inventories got to the condition there is because of the very favorable logging conditions that occurred in the first quarter. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I will turn it over. Doyle Simons : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead with your question. Mark, please make sure that your line is not on mute. Doyle Simons : Mark, are you there? Operator : Sir, would you like to go to the next question? Doyle Simons : Yes. Operator : And your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Gail. Gail Glazerman : Doyle and I guess in one of your responses to your question you referred to seeing some positive signs of improvements, I guess we are in May, it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise, but I was just wondering if you could put a little bit of color behind that, where are you seeing the improvements and how would that compares to this time last year? Doyle Simons : Gail, I am sorry. You cut out a little bit on our end. So, if you can repeat your question for us please? Gail Glazerman : Sure. In response to your earlier question, you referenced seeing some positive signs of improvement, so and it wouldn\u2019t be a surprise we are into May, but I am just wondering if you could put a little bit of color behind that exactly where you are seeing it and how would it compare to this time last year? Doyle Simons : Yes. So as I said we are seeing signs, it comes partially from discussions that are ongoing with our customer base. We are also encouraged by the commentary that\u2019s coming out of the home builders that we talk to. And their commentary is a lot more people are showing up. Even some commentary that first time homebuyers are starting to show up. So it just feels like it\u2019s the spring selling season is starting to shape up well. As we have said, it was deferred because of weather. But all in all, with \u2013 almost without exception, our customers and others that to are saying the demand is there, folks are interested. And if you really look at it, that makes sense. I mean you have got full-time employment, its the highest level it\u2019s been in many years. You got consumer confidence, you got gas prices that are down over 30% year-over-year. You still got very low rate mortgages. You got the FHA and heard working together to try to bringing the first-time homebuyers, so a lot of very positive things. And we are seeing it in the sentiment that we are hearing and from our customer base. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing on the cost environment, you had put out some targets based on where oil prices are, are things targeting in that level. And maybe specifically, are you seeing any offset in terms of ocean freight to offset maybe some of the pressure you are seeing in export market? Doyle Simons : Yes. We \u2013 as you referred to, Gail we did give some guidance on what we thought the positive impact would be from lower diesel prices. We saw some of that in the quarter. Overall, I would say the benefit was roughly $5 million because of the lower diesel prices in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. That has helped on the ocean freight and that has partially offset some of the pressure that\u2019s been on pricing. The other thing I would say, and I think you asked this question last time, we are seeing partially offsetting that, we are seeing some negative impact from our oil and gas revenue from our timberland side. Our best guess is that will be down somewhere to $5 million maybe $10 million in the \u2013 in 2015 versus 2014 if we kind of continue at these oil prices going forward. Gail Glazerman : Alright. And just one last question on the fluff pulp market, we have seen another really large supply announcements, you have got a company looking at doing hardword based fluff down in Brazil and another one doing softwood in Brazil in addition to projects here, has any of this changed your outlook, are you hearing anything from your customers that would kind of make you worried as you look at some of that supply coming on next year? Patty Bedient : Gail as we look at that market, the demand for that is growing. And that\u2019s why we do need more supply overall to meet that demand. The unfortunate part is that oftentimes when it comes on, it comes on in chunk. So it takes a while for the market to absorb it. I think the good news that we are hearing from the folks who are bringing that supply on is they do have the opportunity to produce both paper grade as well as fluffs. And so I suspect that that will come in over the course of time. But there is no question that as we look at our own demand growing and their customers growing, that there is just more demand for fluff both in the emerging markets and also in the adult and continent here domestically. Gail Glazerman : Okay, thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much. Lot of questions here have been answered, but just overall guidance, you guys sort of guided after the Q4 call that this quarter would be a little bit better, just wondering how you think about that when you are seeing prices lower than your expectations, do you \u2013 was there a thought to revise the guidance at some point in the quarter and is that your \u2013 what is you current thinking? Doyle Simons : I want to make sure I answer your questions so restate that Paul just\u2026 Paul Quinn : Well, if go back to the Q4 guidance for Q1, it seemed a lot more bullish than what you are able to achieve and a lot of things moved in the quarter, I mean it\u2019s the best guess at the time. Just thinking about I am just wondering how you are thinking about that. When you see prices like say for example lower lumber and lower OSB prices when you guided materially higher pricing, it\u2019s a real improvement in wood products. Would you look at revising that guidance or is that something that\u2019s a point in time in your way for the quarter? Doyle Simons : Yes, that\u2019s a really good question. And the way we think about it, let me talk specifically about wood products is we did say that we anticipated prices going up in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. That was based on what we were seeing in January when we did that. And as I mentioned earlier, January was a good month and we were right on track. Some things happened in February and March. That on the demand side primarily as we talked about that impacted lumber and OSB prices. We also did make the comment on the first quarter call that those were our best guesses and we would all watch lumber and OSB prices together and see what happens. So, our sense is that, that\u2019s something that not unique to us. It\u2019s being \u2013 is able to be tracked by our analysts and investors and can make adjustments accordingly. So, if it was \u2013 what our experience was, was dramatically different than what\u2019s happening in the marketplace. To your point at that point, we would consider officially revising guidance, but if it\u2019s just something that\u2019s public in what\u2019s happening in the marketplace, we typically would not revise guidance just based on that, because there is a lot of visibility to those prices in the marketplace. Paul Quinn : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. And then just additionally on cellulose fibers, it looks like you had some operational hiccups in Q1 and probably a drag on this West Coast port issue in Q2 and maintenance. Just wondering how much better the second half of the year is going to look? I mean, it looks quite a bit from my standpoint just trying to get some color from you guys. Doyle Simons : Yes. As Patty alluded to in her comments, we anticipate that the second quarter will be significantly higher than the first quarter. To your point, we have got a lot of maintenance in the first half of the year both in the first quarter and then we have doubled the amount of maintenance in the second quarter. We also had some \u2013 to your point some headwinds and small operational issue in the first quarter. All of that should be behind us. So, we would anticipate significant improvement in our cellulose fibers business in the second half versus the first half. Paul Quinn : Great, thanks very much. Best of luck. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead with your question. Steve Chercover : Good morning, everyone. These are kind of cleanups at this point, but could you please expand on your comments on engineered wood. I think you said flat pricing, maybe you can tell us what the operating rates are and when you expect to see some tension kick in to justify higher prices? Doyle Simons : Yes. So, we do anticipate \u2013 or we did have \u2013 I am going to start with the operating rate. Operating rates in the first quarter were in the low 70s in terms of ELP. In terms of pricing, you are right we said that was roughly flat currently versus the first quarter. There has been a price increase announced in Canada and for ELP roughly 5% or a little more and we think that could pass through. We won\u2019t see the full benefit of that until the third quarter. Steve Chercover : Okay. And then clearly you think that housing was going to get better and Q1 was just basically seasonal. Do you think that your pulse on the market is as accurate today as it was when you owned RICO? And what is your full year view for starts? Doyle Simons : Yes. I would say the first quarter was more \u2013 first quarter is always slower seasonally, but I would say it was even worse than the normal seasonal, because of the weather impacts again in February and March. As I said earlier, January was a pretty good month and then February and March were difficult due to the weather situation. In terms of our visibility into housing, our crystal ball is not necessarily any better than anybody else\u2019s, but we have a lot of customers that we talked to on a very regular basis. So, I would say we have got good visibility into housing going forward. I would say in terms of what our forecast is for starts, it is unchanged at $1.1 million. And actually, we are really encouraged by what we have seen over the past few weeks in terms of again, talking to customers and their overall sentiment for housing. And if you really step back and look at and it and I have talked about it earlier, there are a lot of really things \u2013 positive things happening which should continue to drive household formation. The employment level, the consumer confidence, the lower gas prices, where mortgage rates are \u2013 the availability is improving in terms of mortgage for first time homebuyers. So a lot of encouraging things there that we think will continue to drive housing going forward. Steve Chercover : I agree with you actually. So, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes in the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead with your question. Mark Wilde : Good morning Doyle and good morning Patty. Patty Bedient : Good morning Mark. Doyle Simons : Good morning Mark. Mark Wilde : I got a lumber question and I got a timberland question. My lumber question, Patty is kind of two pieces. One is typically I think of you guys lagging what we would see in terms of random lengths in terms of lumber realizations you report every quarter. And I just want to kind of confirm that and see how we reconcile that with your assumption that price will be flat kind of quarter-to-quarter. And also within lumber, it looks like Southern lumber prices are starting to come down now even while we are seeing a little pickup in West Coast lumber prices, so how will that affect you guys sort of Southern prices versus Western. And then just the lag between reported prices than what you realize? Patty Bedient : Sure. I think as you think about what we report against the random lengths framing composites for lumber, the framing composite has made up a number of different grades and it doesn\u2019t equate exactly to what we are manufacturing. So sometimes we lag, sometimes we are a little ahead. So I don\u2019t know that I would say we always have that same relationship. As you think about what happens in the South versus West, of course we have operations in both our southern system is larger than our Western system. One other things that I think will help our Western system for lumber in the second quarter is the log prices coming down. And as you know, log prices are a big or log costs are a big cost of producing lumber. So the West will get a little help on that. And in the South, we would expect that those log prices will be unchanged as well. So little more important to us in the South just based on the size of the system, but both geographies are important to us. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then over on to timberlands, I wondered Doyle if you can just talk a little bit about sort of what you see out there in terms of the timberland acquisition markets, how you are kind of seeing values right now. And just how you think about Weyerhaeuser\u2019s timberland portfolio going forward, you are pretty heavily skewed right now in terms of your earnings to the Pacific Northwest, you want to shift that over time? Doyle Simons : So Mark, in terms of the deal flows overall, it was low in the first quarter in both the South and the West, as we have previously said we expect that to increase as we move through the year. And I will tell you there is still a lot of money chasing deals going forward. In terms of our specific portfolio, as you know we have got 4 million acres in the South, 2.7 million acres in the Pacific Northwest. We would like to grow both areas. We like the positions where we are. We will look at growing both the South and the Pacific Northwest. But with that said, we are going to continue to be very disciplined in terms of our approach and make sure that any acquisition opportunity that we look at meets our specific criteria of having appropriate cash flow on returns, both in the near-term and long-term, strong market access and ability for us to add value or synergies and I think the Longview acquisition is a good example of where we were but able to add synergies as a result of that transaction. So we will look to grow both in the West and in the South we like our position in both of those, but we will be very disciplined in the approach that we take. Mark Wilde : And Doyle how do you think about international timberlands, because at one point this was a big growth focus for Weyerhaeuser and I think you have peeled that quite \u2013 back quite a bit, how does that sort of fit in the situation now? Doyle Simons : Yes. I think our biggest opportunities for growth going forward, Mark, will be domestic. We will continue to look internationally. As you know, we have Timberland Uruguay. That is a really good timberland. We have got a good team in place there. The growth rates there are really encouraging. So, we understand international timberland, but I think on a risk-adjusted basis I think our bigger opportunities going forward will be domestic as opposed to international. Mark Wilde : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much. Good luck in the coming quarter. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, George. George Staphos : How are you doing? A lot of my questions have been asked already. So, maybe a couple of bigger picture questions and not necessarily to pick on cellulose fibers, I guess, first of all, Doyle, if we look at the portfolio, my guess is your strategy \u2013 your strategic view wouldn\u2019t have changed a whole heck of a lot since December presentation, but certainly cellulose fibers does operate to a different cycle than your classic housing related businesses. And so can you update us on your thoughts in terms of how C fibers, fits within the whole portfolio and why it fits well? And then separately within cellulose fibers, you mentioned that you are relentlessly focused on operating excellence over the balance of the year, which suggests that you perhaps wanted to improve performance of maybe some things that didn\u2019t go as well as you would have liked in the first quarter. Obviously, you can\u2019t control the port situation or maybe you could have where there are some things with the port and the situation your reaction to it as a company that you thought you could have done better and the mill outage in coming back from that again lag a little bit. Is that a reflection at all of the new maintenance schedule or totally not related at all? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Doyle Simons : Thank you, George. And I am going to take your second question first and then I will come back to the bigger question. So, in cellulose fibers in the quarter, we did not see much benefit from operational excellence. In terms of the start up of the mill that was down, that\u2019s something that we could have done better. In terms of the port situation and the FX situation, those are just were what they were. I was actually really proud of the way our team managed through the very difficult port situation from the fact that it really did \u2013 it had a really significant impact on our ability to ship product. We had to move things around. We had additional transportation costs. We had warehouse costs. A lot of moving parts there in our team was on top of it and did a really nice job of managing through that and has continued to do that as we move forward. So, comment on the $30 million to $35 million of OpEx, I am absolutely convinced we are going to get that for the year. There was not much that showed up in the first quarter in our cellulose fiber business unlike out other two businesses, where it did show up, but we have got a good team in place, we have got the right strategy and the mill outage. When you take those down, you start them back up, it doesn\u2019t always go as well as you had hoped. That happened this quarter and we will manage that better as we move forward. In terms of the strategy overall, for cellulose fibers, as you alluded to, we talked about that at our December meeting. And we like having cellulose fiber business as part of our overall portfolio partly because of the reason you said. It does tend to be countercyclical to some of our other businesses, but much more importantly, we like the cash \u2013 the very strong cash flow generation that we have historically received from that business and we are convinced we will continue to generate significant free cash flow going forward. We like that, because that ties to our number one capital allocation priority of having a growing and sustainable dividend and we believe the cash flow that we generate from that business will continue to allow us to grow our dividend going forward. George Staphos : And Doyle\u2026. Patty Bedient : One of the projects that will significantly improve our operational excellence going forward was, as Doyle said, we didn\u2019t have in the first quarter and we won\u2019t have the full benefit in the second quarter, but is that energy installation and boiler upgrade that we are doing in one of our fluff mills in the second quarter. So, we are excited about the additional power generation sales that we will have from that upgrade, but also it will significantly improve the reliability of that mill and thereby lower our cost going forward as well. So that\u2019s just one example of an operational excellence focus that you haven\u2019t seen show up on the bottom line yet, but we will start to see some of that improvement later in the year. George Staphos : Thanks for that Patty. Doyle, I guess the fact that you didn\u2019t mention it means it wasn\u2019t an issue but you have not seen the new maintenance schedule affect your ability to bring mills back up in a timely way or have you? Again, thanks and good luck in the quarter. Doyle Simons : No. George and you are right, I didn\u2019t mention it because it did not have an impact. That was a mill that went down. And as we said when you start mills back up, sometimes they don\u2019t start up as well as they should, that\u2019s what happened on this occasion. And we will work to make sure that doesn\u2019t happen going forward. George Staphos : It\u2019s tougher than running a spreadsheet I guess. Have a good quarter. Doyle Simons : Thanks George. Patty Bedient : Thanks George. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we now have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead with your question. Collin Mings : Hi, good morning Doyle, good morning Patty. Just a couple of questions here, first Patty and I may have missed this but again despite some of the pricing headwinds and given some of the operational improvements you are seeing the lower log cost, could you see wood products earnings bounce all the way back up to year ago levels or is that a bit too optimistic? Patty Bedient : I think that we would certainly see our second quarter significantly higher than the first quarter as I said. To get to the roughly a little over $100 million of a year ago quarter we are going to have to see some really significant turnaround in prices, that we haven\u2019t seen yet. So I am pulling for it, but it\u2019s unlikely that we ill get there unless as I said pricing just really significantly has an inflection point from here. But it will be somewhere south of that, but still significantly higher than what we saw in Q1. Collin Mings : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then again you talked a little bit about as far as acquisition priority if you guys stop being on the radar, but maybe just provide a little bit more of an update of what you are seeing as far as sawlog price improvement in the region if any I know I think in 2Q you are looking for flat pricing, but just the outlook in that market. I know some of your peers have kind of suggested that given some of the weakness in Asia that, that tipping point as far as the supply demand in that region may have been pushed out even further, so can you just maybe update us on what you are seeing in that region? Doyle Simons : Yes. So in the South, we continue to anticipate that Southern sawlog prices will be up 3% to 4% in 2015 versus 2014. That\u2019s kind of what we saw in Q4 \u201814 versus \u201813. We think that trend is going to continue. It\u2019s hard to know exactly what the tipping point is going to be to your question. And China, as I mentioned earlier is going to be volatile. So I don\u2019t get too concerned about that component of it. I think as housing continues to improve, that\u2019s going to help on the demand side and then overall on the supply side, the constraints that Canada has in place because of the pine beetle situation will be a key driver there. So we are not yet to the tipping point, I think it\u2019s still in front of us and the key driver there is going to be what happens with U.S. housing and as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be encouraged by the progress there, just had to pause in the first quarter, but the fundamentals are clearly in place for a continued improvement in housing as we move forward. Collin Mings : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then I guess just following up really quick and as far as the Pacific Northwest, is there a good way to think about as far as you are looking at 40% year-over-year decline as far as on log export revenue, I know there are a couple of moving pieces there, but can you maybe give us some sense of how much of that was pricing versus volume? Doyle Simons : Yes. I would say the biggest component and I don\u2019t have that exact breakdown in front of me, but the biggest component of it was the volume as we talked about Japan slows down due to just the general slowdown in housing. And then we all know what happened in China. So clearly, both were components. But I would tell you, volume was the bigger component of the decrease that was experienced. Collin Mings : Okay. And then just one last one, and Doyle just as you think about that headwinds in the Pacific Northwest. I mean again I recognized that you think are optimistic that pricing is going to stabilize as you go through 2Q on the domestic front, but is there a point where you really started to ratchet down the harvest activity in the region just with the thinking that may be prices have over corrected here given some of the currency headwinds and the slowing in China and the inventory there? Doyle Simons : Collin, as you know, we do have the ability to flex up and down depending on what\u2019s happened on market conditions. We will see how things play out going forward, do not have any intention to do that at this point, but that is something that we have done historically and we have the ability to do as we move forward. Collin Mings : Okay, well thanks for all the detail. Good luck during the quarter. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Patty Bedient : Thanks. Operator : And I would now like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any closing remarks. Doyle Simons : Thank you and thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. And most importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Senior Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Denise M. Merle - Senior Vice President-Human Resources & Investor Relations : Thank you, Brent. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $133 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. Each of our businesses delivered solid operating results, as operational excellence efforts helped mitigate the delayed arrival of the spring building season and the continuing challenge of a strong U.S. dollar. In addition, we returned over $150 million of cash to shareholders in the quarter through repurchase of common shares. Cumulative repurchase at quarter end totaled $610 million, as we near completion of our existing $700 million authorization. I will begin this discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. Housing indicators remain choppy and the spring building season was slow to gather momentum in the second quarter as weeks of heavy rain and flooding in the South hampered building activity. However, markets gained momentum late in the quarter as the weather abated and our outlook for 2015 remains unchanged at approximately 1.1 million housing starts, which represents a 10% improvement compared with 2014. We continue to be optimistic about the longer-term prospect for housing as rising employment, strong consumer confidence, historically low mortgage rates and signs of increased participation by first time home buyers should support continuing improvement in the U.S. housing market. In addition, builder sentiment in July was at the highest level in 10 years and our customers continue to tell us they expect increased housing activity in the second half of the year. Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $127 million to the second quarter earnings, compared with $162 million in the first quarter. Lower average sales realizations for western logs and lower earnings from timberlands dispositions more than offset seasonally higher sales volumes. In the West, export log prices remained under pressure due to the continued strength of the U.S. dollar. However, export volumes increased substantially, compared with first quarter due to seasonally improved demand from our Japanese and Chinese customers. Domestic log sales realizations declined throughout the quarter, as log markets remained well supplied due to favorable market conditions in the first half of the year. In the South, fee harvest increased seasonally as we were able to flex harvest settings around the second quarter's extreme wet weather. Average sales realizations for Southern logs were comparable to the first quarter. Second quarter included earnings of $5 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, a reduction of $12 million, compared with the first quarter. The Timberlands business continues to benefit from operational excellence initiatives and remains on track to meet its OpEx targets for 2015. Wood Products, charts six and seven. Wood Products contributed $71 million to the second quarter earnings, an improvement of $9 million compared with the first quarter. EBITDA increased to $98 million. Improved sales volumes and reduced operating cost enabled the business to overcome lower average realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. In Lumber, EBITDA declined $6 million, compared with the first quarter, a 5% decline in average sales realizations was mostly offset by seasonally higher sales volumes, lower Western log costs and operational excellence initiatives to reduce manufacturing cost. In OSB, EBITDA decreased by $4 million due to a 3% decline in average sales realizations. I was particularly pleased with the performance of engineered wood products in the quarter, as we reported EBITDA of $38 million, an increase of $12 million compared with the first quarter. Sales volume rose seasonally across all product lines and per unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher production volume and operational excellence initiatives. EBITDA for the distribution business increased by $5 million, compared with the first quarter due to improved sales volumes, higher product margins and lower overhead cost. Our Wood Products businesses remained relentlessly focused on operational excellence. Lumber and OSB are on track to achieve their 2015 targets. Engineered wood products is tracking significantly above its full-year EBITDA improvement target, up $26 million year-to-date compared with 2014. And our distribution business has been challenged by the severe weather in some of its key markets in the first half of the year and has work to do to achieve its target. However, this business is well-positioned to capitalize on the expanded building activity we expect during the second half of 2015. Cellulose Fibers, charts 8 and 9. Cellulose Fibers contributed $27 million to earnings, compared with $33 million in the first quarter. Pulp market stabilized during the second quarter as global inventories declined to more balanced levels. Average pulp realizations were down compared with the first quarter. As expected, maintenance expense increased significantly in the second quarter, as we completed a planned extended outage at our Flint River, Georgia mill. The outage included scheduled maintenance and installation of energy-related capital improvements. The West Coast port disruption resulted in approximately $8 million in lingering logistics costs in the second quarter, but we anticipate minimal effects going forward. The Cellulose Fibers business made good progress on operational excellence initiatives in the second quarter, including the successful startup of a turbine generator that significantly reduces energy cost at our Flint River mill. This business remains on track to achieve its 2015 operational excellence target. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our third quarter outlook. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the third quarter is summarized on chart 13, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, sales realizations for export logs to Japan are expected to improve slightly, due to increased housing demand. Although China inventories have decreased from earlier in the year, they remain at above-normal levels, putting continued pressure on prices. Domestic log realizations are anticipated to increase as a result of constrained supply due to fire-related harvest restriction. Fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease accordingly. In the South, average sales, log sales realizations are anticipated to be comparable to Q2. Fee harvest volumes are expected to increase on a slightly lower grade mix as Q3 typically carries a greater percentage of thinning volume. Silviculture costs are anticipated to increase both seasonally and because some activities had to be deferred from Q2 as a result of wet weather. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are projected to be around $10 million, compared to $5 million in Q2. Overall earnings in our Timberlands segment are expected to be slightly lower in Q3, compared to Q2. Turning to Wood Products. Although, lumber and oriented strand board prices have decreased during the month of July, the average sales realizations for this month are still higher than the Q2 averages. We expect prices for both lumber and OSB to increase in the remainder of the quarter from today's level. We anticipate average sales realizations for engineered wood products in the third quarter to be comparable to the second quarter. Sales volumes are anticipated to be seasonally higher across most product lines. Western log costs are expected to be modestly higher than Q2. We will be taking some annual maintenance downtime in our engineered wood products facilities, which will negatively affect manufacturing costs for the quarter. We expect continued improvement in the results of our distribution business. Overall, we anticipate that third quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment will be higher than the second quarter, but likely lower than the third quarter of last year. Moving to the Cellulose Fibers business, global softwood pulp inventory levels decreased during the second quarter, and we were basically in balance at the end of the quarter. However, because the industry typically plans fewer maintenance outages in the third quarter, combined with uncertainty around demand from China, inventory levels could tick up leading to some softness in pulp prices in the third quarter. We expect higher sales volumes to partially offset the potential effect of lower sales realization. We anticipate substantial cost improvement in the third quarter. During the second quarter, we had 46 maintenance-related outage days. And this quarter, we have only minimal days planned. As a result, we will have lower maintenance expense and higher productivity. In addition, now that the West Coast port dispute has been resolved, we do not anticipate a repeat of the $8 million negative effect that we experienced in Q2. Overall, third quarter results in our Cellulose Fibers segment should significantly increase, compared to the second quarter and exceed the third quarter earnings of last year. Chart 10, summarizes the results of unallocated items. Before special items, total cost decreased by just over $60 million. The largest item making up this variance was foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar appreciated from approximately $0.79 at the end of the first quarter to $0.81 at the end of the second quarter. For modeling purposes, every penny in the exchange rate is roughly $4 million on a pre-tax basis. The other large item was the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. This item is difficult to predict, as it fluctuates based on the level and mix of inventory from quarter-to-quarter. However, we do not expect the change of this magnitude in the third quarter. Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, beginning with chart 11. Cash flow from operations for the second quarter was $366 million or an increase of $289 million, compared to the first quarter. In addition to increased earnings, large positive variances included lower working capital, and lower interest payments, compared to the first quarter. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $108 million, bringing our year-to-date expenditures to $197 million. We continue to expect total expenditures for the full year to approximate $500 million. We do not have any debt maturities until 2017 and have no borrowings outstanding under our $1 billion line of credit. As detailed on chart 12, during the second quarter, we used $154 million to repurchase our common stocks. And at the end of Q2, we had approximately $90 million remaining under our existing authorization. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Patty. The housing market continues to gather momentum and building activity is increasing, although, it has come this year in fits and starts. Looking forward, we are well positioned to capitalize on its improvement. And we remain relentlessly focused on driving value for shareholders through operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. Now, with that, I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : Thanks a lot. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Doyle, you'd made a comment, or Patty, that you are expecting lumber and OSB prices to pick up as the quarter progresses. I was curious what informs that view, whether it's a sense of where inventories are in the channel? Is at sense that demand is going to be getting better? What would be the drivers that you are expecting to help us see lumber and OSB start moving in the right direction? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Mark, it's a combination of those factors. As I mentioned in my prepared comments and talking to customers, they continue to be very optimistic about housing activity. In fact, I was talking to Adrian Blocker just this morning. He was with customers as recently as yesterday, and just very optimistic about activity out there. In addition, in terms of inventories, as you mentioned, I would tell you inventories are fairly lean at this point in time. So, I think what's happened is there's been a confluence of events from the supply side, Mark, as you're very well aware of in terms of the Canadian dollar, and that's resulted in additional volume coming into the U.S. The weakness in the export \u2013 Asian export markets has resulted in an increase coming in to the U.S. That, at a time when we had a delay in the spring building season, all resulted in prices having some pressure on them. I think as demand continues to improve, supply and demand will get back in balance, and hopefully, we will see some improvement in lumber and OSB prices as we move through the balance of the quarter. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. And one quick follow-up. Do you have thoughts on the potential expiration of the softwood lumber agreement and what type of implications that might or might not have for lumber markets as we go forward? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, in terms of the softwood lumber agreement, as we've said previously, this is an important issue to Weyerhaeuser. There's a council of industry leaders that are discussing options for renewing the agreement and Weyerhaeuser is actively participating in those discussions. And we're very hopeful that we can reach an agreement and avoid trade litigation going forward. In terms of the implications, if it runs out in October, Mark, there's two trains of thought. One is that when that occurs, that additional supply comes on from Canada because there won't be any tariffs in place. But there is also the thought that that will not occur because of the implications that it could potentially have in trade litigations down the road. So, don't know how to play out. And again, two different trains of thought, and we'll just have to see what happens if we're not able to get a resolution in place prior to that which I think everybody is working towards. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Could you talk about the movement of Western export log prices as you move through Q2 and then into July, and are you seeing any inflection point there? And then maybe just a related question. We've heard a lot about the risk of fires in British Columbia and the Pacific Northwest. Is that something that's actually impacting prices and volumes right now, or is that just something that we need to kind of keep an eye on in August and September? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, both important issues, and let me address each of those. In terms of export markets, let me break it down by market. In Japan, we saw prices bottom in June and prices have started to move up in July. And this has been due to the improved Japanese housing demand. And to your second question, I'll get into more details on this in just a minute, the lower log supply due to \u2013 primarily due to fire restrictions. In terms of what we're seeing in China, the log takeaway from Chinese ports picked up in the second quarter, but remains at relatively low levels. Log inventories \u2013 I mean, log inventories moved down to about 3.8 million cubic meters in the second quarter, but has since climbed back up just above 4 million cubic meters. And I can tell you the softwood log imports from all regions into China are down, but as I said, the inventories remain high and we think there continue to be pressure in China in terms of pricing. Related to that in domestic markets in the West, we think domestic prices are going to rise due to the fire season. And our volumes, as Patty mentioned, our harvest volumes are projected to be down in the third quarter versus the second because of the fire restrictions. Now, let me turn to the current fire situation. And I can tell you just drive around the Pacific Northwest, it's dry out there. It almost looks like you're in Arizona as opposed to the normally wet Pacific Northwest. In terms of what's happening, the fire season started earlier this year and at least at this point, it looks like it's going to last longer than normal. If you look at the level of rainfall, it's one of the lowest levels in the last 70 years. And I can tell you most Western acres are currently under either what's called level 2, level 3 or level 4 fire restrictions. These are restrictions that are put on placed by outside regulators. Just to give you a sense, level 2 requires most operations to cease by 1 PM. Level 3 requires all operations to cease by 1 PM and further restricts certain harvest activity such as using power saws and cables, cable yarding at all times. And then level 4 restrictions are complete ban on entry to the forest. Just a couple of days ago in Oregon, a level 4 restriction was put in place in portions of Oregon. There's not been a level 4 restriction in place since 1988, just to put it in context. And that restriction impacts about 15% of our Western Timberlands. Now, that can change overnight if we get some rain or temperatures cool down and all those things. But that is the current state. And to your question, we do anticipate lower harvest in the third quarter versus the second as a result of these fire restrictions and we'll continue to monitor them and see how they play out going forward. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Maybe just to add to that a little bit, as Doyle said, the fire restrictions or the fire concern happened earlier in the Pacific Northwest than normal. And people anticipated that this may happen in some of the drier conditions, as you heard us talk about in the second quarter, led many of the mills to, and I'm talking industry now, to put in a few more logs. So, we haven't seen closures of mills at this point because of out of log downtime because they still have some inventory of logs. But I think as we get into August and into the middle of August, we'll see more of that concern, as Doyle said, if we don't get more rain in the Pacific Northwest, which isn't the forecast as we sit here today. I think it'll be something that we'll see more in the month of August than we've seen thus far in July. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay, that's very helpful detail. And then maybe just one follow-up on timberlands. During the quarter, we saw announcements from a few large timber owners that they would put large properties on the market. I wonder generally, are you seeing any change in institutional interest for timberlands? Is it becoming a little bit more of a buyer's market? Are you seeing any trends in prices changing? And is there an opportunity for Weyerhaeuser, as a buyer or a seller, especially in the South? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And so I would say overall, when you step back, Anthony, the amount of activity still is generally low in the South and the West. As you mentioned, there were some facts that came on, became available in the first half of the year. I would say, most of those have some unique challenges that people will have to work through in terms of how they're going to value those. I would say, we expect more activity in the second half of the year, and I can tell you there's still a lot of money chasing deals. So no, I don't see any downward pressure on timberland prices at this point in time. In terms of Weyerhaeuser specifically, as we've consistently said we're always looking to grow our timberland, but we will continue to be very disciplined and make sure any acquisition that we make meets our appropriate level of returns and drives value for our shareholder. So, we look at everything that comes across, or most everything that comes across. And we are interested in growing but we'll continue to be disciplined. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Gail. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : First, just picking up on a couple of things that have been asked, looking at the Canadian trade situation maybe shorter term tariffs are set to go down fairly significantly in August. Do you have any concerns there that that might put incremental supply in the market and weigh on pricing? If not, it doesn't look like you do, so why not? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. As we alluded to, tariffs are scheduled to go down from 15% to 5% in August. We don't anticipate that that's going to have a big impact on the supply side of the equation but I guess we'll just have to watch it together. But our sense is that it hasn't been a, the 15%, even with the 15% we've seen, we continued to see supply come in from Canada so we don't see, we don't anticipate a significant change when the tariff changes on a monthly basis. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just quickly following up on the view on western logs and the fire restrictions, can you give maybe a sense, I mean have you started to see any tension in the markets at all yet? I appreciate what you are saying that it will play out more in August, but can you give a sense maybe your July pricing versus your second-quarter average? Has there been any movement yet? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: It takes a little bit of time for that to flow through, Gail, but I don't think there's any doubt that there is tightness in the market. And that's just going to increase as these fire restrictions continue. So, as we said, as Patty said and I alluded to, both in Japan and in western domestic, we anticipate prices increasing in the third quarter versus the second. And we're starting to see signs of that. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And just switching gears to capital allocation, you have obviously exhausted basically 85% of the existing buyback authorization. Can you just give us some thoughts and perspective on how the board might be thinking about incremental allocation dividend buyback moving forward? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, so in terms of capital allocation, first and foremost, our number one priority is returning cash to shareholders. As we've said, that's primarily going to be through a growing and sustainable dividend. In addition, we'll look to use share repurchase as a tool where appropriate. As we look forward, we'll continue to work with our board regarding our dividend. I can tell you, as you know, we've constantly raised our dividend over the past few years. And as I said, we'll work with our board to determine the appropriate dividend level going forward. In terms of share repurchase, as you said, we are approaching the completion of our $700 million authorization, and we'll work with the board on that issue going forward. As we've also said, we think long term the appropriate level of cash on our balance sheet is somewhere in the $300 million to $500 million range, and we are significantly above that at this time. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Just one quick follow-up on that. With the recent share price decline, do you think that's something that the board may kind of factor into its thinking? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think the board looks at lots of factors in determining the appropriate balance between dividends and share repurchase. And that clearly would be a factor that the board would in fact consider. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I just wanted to come back to wood products. Your lumber EWP margins look quite good, especially relative to peers. Can you talk about what you're seeing and what has been the key driver there? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry. I might have to ask you to repeat the question. You're cutting out a little bit on our end. Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States): I'm sorry. I wanted to ask about the lumber EWP margins. They look pretty good relative \u2013 especially relative to your peers this quarter. So I just wanted to understand what has been the key driver and what you are seeing? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, in terms of lumber, we were encouraged by the margins this quarter. And I think what you saw there is a combination of OpEx efforts and lower log cost that pretty much are almost \u2013 completely offset the decline in prices in the quarter. So, we're continuing to make progress on our OpEx, and that is showing up in our bottom line. And we saw some of the benefit of that in the second quarter Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States): That's helpful. And just one more, switching gears to timberlands. Can you talk a little bit about your offshore timberlands in Uruguay and how you think about it? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So we have 300,000 acres of timberlands in Uruguay. It's about half pine and about half eucalyptus. I was down there not too long ago, and very fertile ground and the trees grow very quickly. So, it's been \u2013 we don't have many mature trees at this point. It's still fairly early in the rotation and we're spending a lot of time figuring out exactly the best way to monetize those trees through manufacturing going forward. Ketan Mamtora - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning, everyone. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Chip. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Doyle, I would imagine you and Patty, all of you all, are pretty pleased with the engineered wood products result. Would you say it's kind of gotten into the zone of where you were hoping it would be when you embarked on a lot of your initiatives a couple of years ago, and if not, how much further do you think we need to see that improve? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Thanks for your comment, Chip. And we are pleased with the progress that we've made in EWP. But we still have more work to do. But the key three \u2013 three key drivers that we've seen to get us to where we are today is continuing to reduce our controllable manufacturing costs through OpEx, some lower SG&A cost and then growing profitable sales. So, to your question, we are absolutely very pleased, our team they have done a really nice job. But we're not taking our foot off the accelerator. We're going to continue to do things to improve that business going forward. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. And then when you look at the Distribution business, I know it tends to not really \u2013 it tends to always below margin, but sometimes it's hard to know what's going on below the surface. Would you say that's equally along the path as EWP is, or does it still maybe have a little bit further to go versus EWP? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. It clearly has further to go, Chip, versus EWP. So, we are making a progress there. But frankly, we're behind schedule. I can tell you a portion of that was primarily due to some adverse weather we had in some of our key markets like Texas and Denver. But get to our OpEx goals for the quarter, we're going to have to hustle. We're going to have to have good execution in the second half of the year. And we're well positioned to capitalize on markets as they continue to improve. But clearly, we're not as far along in distribution as we are in EWP and still have some work to do. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Great. Very helpful. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details, and congrats on the operational excellence again. I guess the first question I had, can you comment as to what roughly you would have in your guidance thus far for the third quarter for wood product pricing? Would prices have to rise above the current run rate or the \u2013 clearly the second quarter average, and if so could you put a bracket on what kind of growth rate we'd need to see in pricing from here? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: George, where we are currently is \u2013 prices are up. So, quarter-to-date, prices are up versus the second quarter average. So, lumber prices for us are up roughly $10 versus the second quarter average. And OSB prices are up roughly $5. As Patty said in her comments, we anticipate prices will move up from this point forward, but we'll all watch that together. But because of the reasons I've said earlier, primarily driven by improving demand is our best guess and it is a guess, but it's our best guess that we'll see prices move up for the \u2013 somewhat for the balance of the quarter versus where they are today. But we are currently higher than where \u2013 than the second quarter average. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fair enough, Doyle. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. And I think the price... George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hey, Patty. How are you? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. When you think about prices in the month of July, they actually came down. So, we had a little bit of rally late in the second quarter in June, and then about after the 4 of July holiday, prices started to tick back down. So, the average that Doyle was giving you for July is actually a little higher than where they would be with midweek print randomly. But we do anticipate, for all the reasons that Doyle said that those prices will be going back up. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, to summarize, third quarter is a decent start on an average basis, but the markets would need to see more movement, more progress relative to what you have embedded in your guidance. Is that fair? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's generally fair. Yes. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. All right, thanks, Doyle. In terms of the mills, can you tell us where you think you are on the cost curve? Recognizing that we're not at \u2013 hopefully, at the precipice of a recession. I know one of the goals in the past has been to get all the mills in the Wood Products business, as much as possible, to cash break even so that when you do get into a downturn you won't be losing cash. So where do you stand in terms of getting the mills to where you want them to be on the cost curve and positioned both versus competitors and versus the macro? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, as you said, George, our goal is just as we say around here, be black at the bottom and that's the cost structure that we're putting in place in our Wood Products facilities. We've made progress but we've still got work to do. We've laid out specific OpEx targets. And like I said, we're making good progress on those, but by the end of this year, we'll met our 2015 targets but we've still got additional work that needs to be done over the next two to three years to get our cost structure where ultimately it needs to be, to be black at the bottom, fully capitalized on the this upturn and maybe most importantly outperform our competitors on an ongoing basis going forward. So, progress made, still lots of work to do. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Fair enough. Doyle, last question and then I'll turn it over. If we look at the pulp mills, and again, we're down the pike in terms of the 18-month maintenance cycle being brought in now maybe a couple of years, what continue to be the learnings that you are getting from this? How the mills come up after maintenance? Anything that you would tweak with the strategy on a going-forward basis? Any thoughts there would be helpful. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. So, George, I would tell you that the 18 month outage plan has been a success for us. When you take mills down, it can be difficult to bring them back up. We saw that in the first quarter as we talked about. But that occurs whether it's down over 12 months or down every 18 month. So, we are encouraged by the progress we're making on the 18 months schedule and we think that has been a net benefit to our company and to our shareholders. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Is there a particular challenge when you go up 18 months versus 12 months, or really no difference? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: You know I wouldn't say there is no difference, George, but you still got to take \u2013 as you and I talked about last quarter, taking these mills down and starting them back up, there is always challenges associated with that, and it may be a little more challenging if it's 18 versus 12, but we haven't seen anything systematic or systemic that makes it harder. You just got unique challenges with each one of these mills as you take them down and bring them back up. And some of them go really, really well. And some of ours have gone well and some of them, you have challenges. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Well, thanks. Congrats \u2013 go ahead, Patty. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : George, when we look at our \u2013 and I think Flint River is a good example of that. It was not only a factor of taking a mill down for maintenance, but we were also installing some really very beneficial equipment around energy costs. And so, it's the combination of all those things. But I think it is important to your question that as we've gone through this process, there are learnings, and I would call them only tweaks that you get from just the maintenance, which is a very important piece in our Cellulose Fibers business. So, we are capitalizing on looking at the learnings as we take a mill down and bring it back up to factor that into our maintenance going forward, and that's part of our operational excellence. George L. Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks for the thoughts. Congrats on the quarter and good luck going forward. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, George. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark? Operator : Mark, please make sure your line is not on mute. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hello, Mark. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Why don't we take the next question? Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yes, good morning. Thanks. I just had a question I guess lumber and OSB prices. I guess they ticked down recently. I know it's not a big decrease, but is there anything you can point to that's maybe driving that drop? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You know, I think it really is just the factors that Doyle went through. We've had weaker demand from Asia, which impacts the exports that come out of Canada. We've had some changes in currency that put some headwinds there. And then I think, notwithstanding the fact that housing has been ticking up of late in terms of people have reiterated their full-year guidance for the year. The first half was a little disappointing in terms of where we thought things would be. So, as we look at housing for the second half, our guidance really hasn't changed. And since we didn't have a great response in the first half, that would bode for the second half being better. But as Doyle said, we'll have to wait and see. There's just a lot of moving parts out there with all of this, so. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay, great. And then just, I know it's still early, but I think you mentioned CapEx of $500 million this year. Can you give a rough sense of a range where it could be for next year? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We really don't have a range for next year that we would give in terms of guidance at this point, Tyler. We'll do that as we approach year-end. But one thing that I would say about the projects that we're putting in, and the $500 million is a little higher than where we've been historically. But we've got some great Wood Products projects that are underway that I think will pay additional dividends as we look at bringing our costs down across that system. So, really excited about the projects that we are spending that money on, but a little too soon to tell you exactly what we'd be doing for next year. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : And then just a last question, southern seller prices I know, I think last quarter you were looking for maybe a, it was 3% to 4% increase. Prices have been generally flat. Do you think it's more realistic that prices are flat for this year? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Tyler, we still anticipate that southern prices will be up kind of in line with what they've been up over the past couple of years, which would be somewhere in the 2% to 3% range year-over-year. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Got it. Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Steve. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Hi, Steve. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: So, if I'm not mistaken, the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade negotiations should conclude today, and I don't think it's a highly visible piece of the puzzle, but Canada's effective ban on log exports is part of the equation. That's mainly BC, obviously. So but if BC was compelled to export logs, can you tell us how that would impact your Pacific Northwest operations? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : As we look at that, Steve, we'll just have to see how that actually plays out in terms of what the final resolution will be. So, difficult for us really to tell what that result is. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Has it been on your radar, clearly, Canada is a big supplier of sawn lumber. So, are there ports, for instance, conducive to log ships as opposed to lumber ships? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : It is something that we have tracked, but it's not something that I would say we have a comment that we'd make about in terms of ports at this point. Steven Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: All right. Thank you, Patty. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You bet. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Hopefully, you can hear me this time. I apologize. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We can hear you. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Go ahead. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Great. So first question is, it's around but not really about transfer pricing. I'm curious whether your internal log prices to your West Coast lumber operations were up a similar amount to your outside log sales. Obviously, there's going to be a mix and other difference. I'm just curious how they tend to track, understanding mix and geographic differences. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : So, Mark, just to be clear, your question is related to how we do transfer pricing to our docks? Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Well, you mentioned that external log sales realizations are up. And I'm curious whether your internal log costs are up by a similar amount, and whether those two things tend to track over time. I'm not asking whether you do transfer pricing, honestly. Obviously you do. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Actually, they are correlated because they all come from the same geographies. There is a different mix however, as you think about what we would send exports, for example to Japan versus the grade that our domestic sawmills would use. So, directionally, they usually do track but they will not be similar absolute pricing because of the grade mix. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay, that's very helpful. It's just what I was looking for. And second quick question. Does the U.S. dollar strength increase your relative interest in overseas timberland acquisitions? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, as we've said before, we are looking to grow our Timberland. We think our biggest opportunities will be domestic whether it'd be in the South or the Pacific Northwest. We'll also continue to look internationally but we're going to make sure that we appropriately risk adjust any acquisition that we would make internationally. So, that's kind of generally the way we think about it. Currencies don't move up. Currency is going to move down. So, we won't overemphasize that in any decision we may make versus acquisitions. Mark W. Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Very helpful, Doyle. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Doyle and Patty. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Collin. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: I guess my first question, just Patty, as it goes back to the guidance significantly increased results in the Cellulose Fibers business. I think, Patty, you indicated in the prepared remarks that would be above last year's 3Q, so could we see that bounce all the way back up to, call it, about the $90 million or so figure that you posted a few quarters last year, or is that a bit too optimistic? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You're probably just a little optimistic there, Collin. If you kind of think about guidance for the Cellulose Fibers business, we were at $27 million, I believe, in the second quarter. We've got 46 days in the second quarter and, probably, less than a handful in the third quarter. So, between the maintenance expense and better productivity as we run more days, I would say that's probably going to be around just to give you some sense around the $45-ish million number. We said we will have likely lower realizations. But I would expect that to be offset by some higher volumes as well as some additional potential for cost improvement in other ways. So, I think that will help you get a little bit in the ZIP code. I think $90 million \u2013 love to have $90 million, but that might be a little optimistic at this point. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. No. That's very helpful. And I guess also, Patty, just going back to Tyler's question, just thinking about the CapEx, I know it's obviously too early for 2016, but the comments as far as kind of the ramp-up over the last couple of years, should we view the $500 million as kind of a high-watermark, or do you think there's still the potential to see a higher number at some point as you continue to invest in your mills? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, I think you would think about $500 million as being closer to the high watermark, Collin. I don't think we'd be looking at something that's significantly above that. I think last year in 2014, we were around in the $400 million, maybe $450 million. So, we have ramped that up a little bit. But I wouldn't see us being significantly above $500 million for 2016. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then I guess just the last question, kind of going back to Gail's question earlier, just about the share repurchases. One thing that surprised me a little bit during the quarter was that there was a moderation in repurchase activity relative to 1Q, particularly in context of the drop in the share price. Anything that we should read into that or any sort of restrictions on preventing you to buy back stock during a period of the quarter? Or just can you put any additional color around that? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Collin, there is nothing that should be read into that. That's just where it ended up for the quarter under our program and we'll continue to report on a quarterly basis our progress going forward. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. Good luck during the quarter, guys. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Hey, good morning, Doyle and Patty. Just a question for Doyle. You've been running Weyerhaeuser for a couple of years now, and you've had operational excellence in place for quite a bit of that time. Just wondering if you're happy with the current portfolio of assets? And besides timberlands, what business segment looks good for growth? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Collin on \u2013 I mean Paul on your first point on OpEx, we're encouraged by the progress we've made there. Still more work to do. In terms of opportunities to grow our portfolio going forward. We've consistently said, I think now, over the last couple of years, that we think our biggest opportunity to grow will be in Timberlands. But we would look at growing other parts of our company as well, if we can find appropriate growth opportunities that meet our hurdle requirements and drive value for shareholders. So, that's generally how we think about growth going forward. The beauty of it is we don't have to grow to be successful. But if we \u2013 so we can be very disciplined, we have been and will continue to be. But if we can find the appropriate opportunities to grow this company, that's absolutely something we'll look to do to drive value for our shareholders going forward. Paul C. Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Great. Thanks very much. Best of luck. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Paul Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any closing remarks. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As I understand it, that was our final question. And I would just like to thank, everybody, for joining us this morning for our call. And more importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $180 million, or $0.35 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. I'm very pleased with our third quarter performance as each of our businesses capitalized on operational excellence improvements to deliver strong results despite some market and global macroeconomic headwinds. In addition, we continued to deliver on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We have completed the $700 million share repurchase program authorized in 2014. In August, our board supplemented this program with an additional $500 million share repurchase authorization and also increased our quarterly dividend by 7% to $0.31 per share. This illustrates our confidence in our ability to continue to execute our operational excellence initiatives and capitalize on market improvements going forward. I'll begin the discussion of our business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continued to advance in the third quarter following choppy activity in the first half of the year. Total housing starts as of September, has improved 18% compared with 2014, and single-family starts are up 12%. We continue to anticipate just over 1.1 million starts for 2015. Our customers tell us they expect strong year-in activity for as long as weather conditions remain favorable. With rising employment, strong consumer confidence, historically low mortgage rates and builder sentiment reaching all-time highs, we continue to anticipate steady improvement in the U.S. housing market. Let me now turn to our business segments, starting with Timberlands, charts two to four. Timberlands contributed $126 million to third quarter earnings, comparable to the second quarter. Strong cost controls and operational excellence initiatives offset the effect of reduced Western fee harvest volumes and lower average sales realizations for Western logs. As expected, Western fee harvest volumes declined by 5% compared with the second quarter due to buyer season logging constraints. This year's buyer season was exceptionally severe due to record breaking temperatures and unusually low rainfall. Our employees did an exceptional job of protecting our Timberlands and flexing harvest settings to adjust the changing logging constraints and market conditions. Our tree farms experienced virtually no fire damage with only about 150 of our 7 million acres affected, less than 100 of 1%. Average realizations for Western domestic logs improved slightly in the third quarter as fire season restrictions resulted in tighter log supplies, especially in Southern Oregon and we benefited from an improved mix. Turning to the export markets, Japanese demand remained strong and pricing for our Japanese logs was up slightly in the quarter. After peaking in August, log inventories at Chinese ports have declined as supply has fallen in response to lower pricing. However, Chinese demand in pricing remained challenging due to continued slow construction activity and we flexed volume into more profitable domestic markets. Overall, average realizations for our Western logs declined compared with the second quarter, primarily due to the higher proportion of domestic log sales. In the South, fee harvest volume increased and average log sales realizations improved slightly. Third quarter included earnings of $13 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $8 million compared with the second quarter. Operational excellence initiatives contributed to Timberlands' third quarter results as efforts to optimize harvest settings and road and silviculture expenditures resulted in continued cost improvements. The business remained on track to meet or exceed its OpEx target for 2015. Wood Products, charts five and six. Wood Products contributed $85 million to third quarter earnings, an improvement of $14 million compared with the second quarter. EBITDA increased to $111 million as improved sales volumes and lower operating costs enabled the business to overcome the drag of lower average lumber realization. In Lumber, EBITDA declined $4 million compared with the second quarter. A 3% decrease in average sales realizations was mostly offset by seasonally higher sales volumes and improvements in logs and other costs. In OSB, EBITDA improved by $12 million, due to a 2% increase in average sales realizations and reduced manufacturing and log cost. Engineered Wood Products reported third quarter EBITDA of $36 million, compared with $38 million in the second quarter. Slightly improved sales volumes and realizations for several products were offset by higher manufacturing cost due to planned maintenance downtime. EBITDA for the distribution business increased by $7 million compared with the second quarter due to improved sales volumes and lower overhead cost. Our Wood Products business remains relentlessly focused on operational excellence. Lumber and OSB are on track to achieve their 2015 targets. Engineered Wood Products is tracking significantly above its EBITDA improvement target. Year-to-date, the business has generated EBITDA of $100 million, a $35 million improvement compared with a target of $15 million to $20 million. We made significant progress in our distribution toward our OpEx target in the third quarter as EBITDA improved to $9 million and we expect continued progress in the fourth quarter. At this point, however, we're unlikely to reach our full $20 million target for the year. With that said, I'm encouraged by our level of improvement in the third quarter and this business is highly focused on continuing to improve bottom line performance going forward. Cellulose Fibers, charts seven and chart eight. Cellulose Fibers contributed $79 million to third quarter earnings, compared with $27 million in the second quarter. Pulp market softened in the third quarter due to rising global inventories and the continuing challenge of a strong U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined slightly compared with second quarter. Earnings for this segment increased significantly as maintenance expense declined and pulp production improved due to fewer scheduled maintenance outage days. The third quarter included only four days of scheduled maintenance outages, compared with a 46-day extended outage completed in the second quarter. The Cellulose Fibers business continues to make good progress on operational excellence initiatives as well. Third quarter results benefited from initiatives to reduce energy costs, and chemical costs, and usage. Cellulose Fibers business remained on track to achieve its 2015 operational excellence target. I will now turn it over to Patty, to discuss our fourth quarter outlook. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the fourth quarter is summarized on chart 12, and I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, export log volumes to Japan is expected to increase during the fourth quarter as a result of an active Japanese housing market, and we anticipate a slight improvement in prices. Although construction activity in China is still slow, inventories at Chinese ports started to decline during Q3 and are expected to decrease further this quarter. As a result, we see fourth quarter prices stabilizing. Average sales realizations and volumes for Western domestic logs are expected to be comparable to Q3. Fee timber harvest in the West is anticipated to increase slightly, as fire-related logging constraints have been lifted. In the South, fee harvest volume is expected to be in line with the third quarter and we anticipate roughly similar average sales realizations. Silviculture and logging costs will likely increase seasonally. Overall, fourth quarter earnings in our Timberlands segment are expected to be comparable to Q3. In our Wood Products segment, the fourth quarter is typically the seasonally weakest quarter of the year. Because of the seasonal slowdown, we expect lower sales volumes. Although we have seen an increase in lumber prices thus far in the fourth quarter, average sales realizations for Q4 are expected to be lower than the average of Q3. We expect higher average sales realizations for oriented strand board in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, and we anticipate that Engineered Wood Products' average sales realizations will be relatively flat. Production volumes in the fourth quarter are expected to decline, due to the holiday season and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. This downtime will result in higher per-unit manufacturing costs. Consistent with the normal seasonal patterns, we expect fourth quarter earnings in our Wood Products segment to be lower than the third quarter and slightly lower than the earnings of Q4 of last year, which had much higher pricing. Our Cellulose Fibers business is continuing to experience currency headwinds due to the strong U.S. dollar. Worldwide inventories for softwood pulp stood at 30 days at the end of the third quarter. Typically, industry supply increases during the fourth quarter as there is seasonally not as much maintenance downtime in the colder winter months. As a result, we expect weaker average sales realizations for pulp in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Our final planned maintenance outage for this year was completed earlier this month. The mill is back up and running well. Due to this outage, we will have more planned maintenance phase this quarter, as a result expect that overall maintenance expense will be approximately $10 million higher than Q3. In addition, we expect seasonally higher fiber costs. We anticipate that overall earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be approximately $20 million to $25 million lower in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter. Chart nine summarizes the results of unallocated items. Unallocated items moved from a positive earnings impact of $20 million in Q2 to a negative $27 million in Q3. The largest change was the result of a non-cash charge for the weakening of the Canadian dollar. As we've said in the past, every $0.01 change in the exchange rate is roughly $3 million to $4 million on a pre-tax basis. The other large variance was a lower positive effect for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. Now, I'll wrap with some overall financial comments. Income taxes for the quarter resulted in a tax benefit of $16 million. This was due to a true-up of the effective tax rate for the year, which is now estimated to be lower based on the higher mix of REIT income relative to the taxable REIT subsidiary. In addition, there were discrete items booked in the quarter of approximately $9 million; the largest item being a positive resolution of uncertain tax positions. Now, I'll refer you to chart 10. Cash flow from operations for the third quarter was $282 million, or a reduction of $84 million compared to Q2. The change was primarily the result of a large working capital reduction in Q2 and normal timing of interest payments. Capital expenditures for the third quarter were $112 million, bringing our total expenditures for the first three quarters of the year to just over $300 million. We still anticipate total expenditures for the year to approximate $500 million. There was no change to our scheduled debt maturities and, as you can see from the chart, the first maturity isn't until 2017. Chart 11 details our share repurchase activity, and we have now completed our $700 million 2014 share repurchase authorization. And as mentioned earlier, in August, the board authorized an additional share repurchase program for $500 million. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Patty. We are encouraged by the positive trend in housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. Going forward, we remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. By relentlessly driving operational excellence in each of our businesses, we are laying a foundation that enables us to take full advantage of market opportunities. Our recently announced dividend increase and share repurchase program illustrate our confidence that we will continue to grow shareholder value by capitalizing on these activities going forward. And with that, we'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Maybe a little bit of a detail question, but on the tax rate, well, maybe the easiest way to ask, what type of tax rate should we be anticipating for the fourth quarter? Kind of looks like you're 5% to 10% even after making all the adjustments for the first three quarters. Is that what we should expect for the fourth quarter? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Mark, that's our outlook for the full year and, of course, the fourth quarter will be the last one. As you mentioned, we had a number of things in the third quarter just to true up the rate for the full year, but we'll be over 5% for the fourth quarter. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, great. And also, maybe a little bit of help, if we look at lumber pricing, which has started to move quite positively of late, one could certainly see scenarios where at least the random length average would be higher in the fourth quarter than it would be in the third quarter. Maybe a little bit more color of \u2013 your comments on why you'd expect it to be lower, recognizing maybe you sell more in October and things like that, but if you could give us a little bit of help in understanding how to think through fourth quarter lumber realization, that would be great. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. And Mark, we agree with you. There is a scenario where lumber prices could in fact be higher in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. But let me kind of give you the facts of where we are currently. If you take fourth quarter-to-date average, it's still about $15 below the third quarter average. Now if you take current prices today for lumber, it's basically in line with the third quarter average. So to your point, it's all dependent on what happens from this point going forward. We may be being conservative in terms of what we're assuming for lumber prices, but we all know that, as Patty mentioned, the fourth quarter is typically a slower seasonal period and we'll just have to see what happens in the month of November and December. So that's the way we see it at this point and we'll just watch together because our \u2013 it's nothing but a guess as to what we think's going to happen in the fourth quarter and we'll just have to see how it plays out as we move through the next couple of months. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Understood and totally fair enough. And just any color though in terms of why you think lumber has come back as nicely as it has in the last several weeks? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. I think there's a number of things that have played into that. I think what we understand in talking to our customers and buyers, I think there were very, very low inventories in the system, partially waiting to see what happens when the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired. When that did happen, there was not a lot of lumber that came on. So I think part of it has been a building back of inventories in light of that. I think there have been some slight improvements in the Chinese markets. And our take is, as long as the weather holds, as I said in my comments, we're hearing very positive commentary from our customers in terms of demand in building season. So that's I think what's happened to drive the lumber prices up over the past few weeks. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks so much. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): A number of producers seem to have adjusted their production schedules in 3Q given weaker Wood Products prices. I was wondering what your operating rates were in the quarter across lumber, OSB, and Engineered Wood Products? And if you took any kind of market downtime or cut shifts in 3Q or expect anything like that in 4Q? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, in terms of operating rates, lumber was right at 90%, OSB mid-90%s and ELP in the mid-70%s in terms of operating rates. And I'll let Patty, because she alluded to it in her comments, talk about the fourth quarter and some of the maintenance downtime we have planned for the fourth quarter. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. As you think about the fourth quarter, the fourth quarter is typically when we do our maintenance as well as install capital projects and most of that will happen in the Wood Products business. And it's really across the board. As you think about OSB, for example, we're installing some \u2013 not huge capital but we will take advantage of putting in things across the system. ELP will have some as well, lumber has some capital projects and also we have holiday downtime that happens in the fourth quarter. So if I think \u2013 as we think about our operating rates for OSB, in particular, I think as Doyle said we were in the mid-90s for the third quarter, we would expect below 90% for the fourth quarter. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just switching to the dividend, I mean, historically, you've targeted 75% of FAD over the cycle. And this year, you raised the dividend while your earnings should be down year-over-year, maybe double digits on a percentage basis. I'm just wondering if you could talk about dividend coverage and prospects for continued dividend growth and maybe the confidence that you have going into 2016 that you're going to see earnings growth next year, given we've got a strong dollar and some of these headwinds in Asia that you called out earlier as well? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Anthony, as you alluded to, our guideline, and it is a guideline is 75% of FAD over the cycle. I think the \"over the cycle\" is an important component. To your point, we feel like we are still early in the housing recovery cycle and as mentioned in my comments, we're optimistic that housing will continue to recover and will be 1% to 1.25% in 2016. As a result of that, we think we have a lot of opportunity to continue to grow earnings and cash flow going forward and are confident that we will continue to do that as housing continues to improve going forward. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And just in terms of next year, is your view not only that you're going to see a volume recovery with starts going higher, but that will be a accompanied by price recovery as well or price improvement year-over-year in 2016? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Pricing, as we all know, is difficult to predict. But following up on the conversation we had earlier on lumber, we are encouraged that lumber prices are improving in a slower seasonal period. And our take is, as we move into the strong building season next year, again, assuming housing's at the 1.2% to 1.25% range, we think that will be very constructive for Wood Products, and frankly Timberland prices moving into 2016. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Tyler Langton with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Yeah. Good morning. Thanks. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : I think just with the domestic West Coast prices, I think, Patty, you mentioned that the fires were a little bit beneficial for prices this quarter. Could you quantify that a little bit? I don't know, is there any risk that with the fire season going away, that prices could slip a little bit this quarter, or do you think they should be sort of pretty stable? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Tyler, we did talk about the fact that we expected to have a little more fee harvest volume in the West, but it's not a huge amount, and even in the third quarter, we didn't see as much benefit from the fire restriction as probably many expected, because of the fact that many of the mills had already, seeing the fact that the fire season was going to be so severe, had done some additional things as far as their own log supply. So, I don't see a huge risk related to that but the increase that I mentioned in our fee timber harvest in the West is not a huge increase. I don't think it will have that significant of an impact. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great, thanks. And then just, switching to Wood Products. Could you quantify, and I think you said the lower earnings in the fourth quarter was coming from sort of lower sale volumes, reduced operating rates and some of the maintenance in OSB. Could you kind of roughly break out how much each of one of those would contribute to the decline? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : In terms of the overall impact, I would say that there, the biggest impact of third Q compared to fourth quarter really does come from sales volumes. As we talked about, seasonally, the fourth quarter is a lower quarter for volume, and that's really a statement across most of our product lines, lumber, OSB and ELP. And certainly in distribution as well, we were very pleased with the improvement in distribution for the third quarter, but they will likely be impacted as well from the seasonal volume fall off. Now, having said all that, as Doyle talked about, we are pleased to see that prices in lumber especially and OSB have been coming up in the quarter. Its pricing can be very volatile, and we'll just have to see how it all plays out. But I would say across the board, the biggest negative compared to the third quarter is in sales volume. And actually, we're very pleased, when you think about quarter-over-quarter, last year in the fourth quarter, we had much better pricing than what we're anticipating for this fourth quarter, and earnings are roughly \u2013 maybe a little lower or could be even comparable depending upon where prices are. So I think you start to see the impact of our operational excellence initiative kicking into that. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. And just final question with the distribution, you mentioned a nice increase in earnings. Can you just provide a little bit more detail about sort of what drove that, and sort of how sustainable it is going forward? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, what I would tell you is that it's \u2013 what we've been working on is the basic blocking and tackling of running a distribution. It's making sure we have the right warehouse and cost in places, making sure we're growing profitable sales. So, as Patty said, we were very encouraged by the progress we made in the third quarter, but more work to do. But we are pleased that we \u2013 on the trajectory that we saw in the third quarter and the changes that we're making in that business to position it for success in the future. So, progress, more work to do, but are confident in the plan that we have in place will get us to where we need to be in that business. Tyler J. Langton - JPMorgan Securities LLC : Okay. Great. Thanks so much. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with UBS. Please go ahead. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Hi. Thank you. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Well, can you just offer some broader perspective on the Softwood Lumber Agreement? I guess, we obviously haven't seen much impact in October but just how you see it playing out, I guess, over the next year while the standstill is in place? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, as we all know, the Softwood Lumber Agreement expired on October 12. Just in terms of what's happening on that, there are ongoing discussions between participants on both sides of the border regarding renewing the agreement. As well as you all know, this is ultimately a government-to-government negotiation, and election season has hampered the ability to have those discussions. But we are looking forward to both governments having an opportunity to engage and it's my take, our take that there is a possibility of reaching an agreement prior to the one year standstill playing out. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Okay. And in terms of flows, do you think recent activity is a pretty good indicator that that probably won't have a major impact in terms of flows in the market? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. I think that's exactly right. I think what's happened over the past two weeks or three weeks was in line with what we anticipated but you never know, but I do think that does show that there wasn't a significant impact in terms of flows when that agreement expired. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : All right. And just in terms of the current market, you talked about customers having pretty low inventories and reporting the recent rally. Do you have any view has buying activity over the last couple of weeks been enough or do you think inventories are still light? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. What we think is inventories continue to be lean especially in lumber and OSB. So, yes, there has been increased buying activity, as you alluded to, and we stated, but it's our stance that inventories continue to be on the lean side. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : All right. And you guys have a lot of \u2013 I mean, Patty alluded to some smaller stuff going on on the capital side. But you guys do have a few larger capital projects going on at at least a couple of your sawmills. I was just wondering can you give some \u2013 just kind of walk through what you're doing and actually there is $190 million going on at one project. Can you just walk through some of your bigger projects whether they're fourth quarter 2016 event? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Fourth quarter 2016, I mean... Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : Yeah. I am just saying just walk through some of the bigger projects that you have going on... Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Okay. Gail S. Glazerman - UBS Securities LLC : And what are the OpEx program? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Yeah. You're exactly right. We are, as we have been talking about for a period of time now, spending capital specifically in our lumber operation to support our OpEx initiatives, and to drive down our overall cost structure. So, that's happening at a number of mills, each of our mills has a specific roadmap, that's what's needed to get them to be in lowest cost quartile, and we have specific projects going on. One of the projects, to give you can example, is our Dierks sawmill. Our Dierks sawmill has been a very good sawmill for us for a long time. It's located in a fantastic wood basket. It's close to very good end market, but is a very old mill with an odd configuration. We are basically rebuilding that mill. We are rebuilding that mill on site. As we looked at all the different opportunities to make that mill more cost efficient that was the one that made the most sense. But to your question, Gail, every project that we're doing, the whole focus is to drive down our overall cost structures and that we will have low cost sawmill operation, and we'll be able to deliver on our OpEx initiatives. As we said, we're going to spend roughly total company-wide $500 million in capital, that's inclusive of what we're spending in lumber, and would anticipate the capital spend, as Patty said on the last call, will be in that range for next year as well as we continue on these projects. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Gail, the only other thing that I would add is, as you look at the fourth quarter spend, it will be our highest spend for the year, and as Doyle mentioned, the biggest piece of that will be in the lumber business in addition to the things that he talked about, there are projects that many of the mills really focused on lowering their cost structure. One piece, for example, is in our CDKs that we're putting in the continuous drive kilns at a couple of locations, both to address boiler MACT as well as bringing down drying cost, which is a significant cost. We've got some edger projects, those types of things that really will improve recovery but they really are focused on lowering the overall cost structure. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Doyle, you've really made some impressive progress in all these Wood Products businesses, I wondered just if you looked at the engineered wood business that's had particularly nice gains, will there be kind of two or three key issues you'd point to that have driven that? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, thank you for your commentary and our employees have done a nice job of making improvements and more work to do. In terms of EWP specifically it's really boils down to three things. One is reducing manufacturing cost and specifically controllable manufacturing costs, and that's something we're focused on every day. We've also driven down our overall SG&A cost in EWP business. And then finally we're really focused on growing not only just sales, but growing profitable sales. So those are the three key levers that we've been focused on in EWP, and have been encouraged about the progress that we've made there, and we're focused on continuing to improve that operation going forward. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And over in the OSB business are there any debottlenecking opportunities there similar to sort of some of the capital that you're putting in the lumber to improve the lumber operations? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark I would say in OSB the projects that we're doing, some of it involves debottlenecking, but more than that it's just figuring out a way to continue to improve reliability and drive down cost. As we've talked about, we've got a couple of mills that are world-class and we've got opportunities to improve some of our OSB mills to those same type of levels in terms of reliability and cost structure and that's what our capital expenditures are focused on. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Fine. Last question, I had Doyle, back in September, we had one of your peers announce kind of an interesting transaction with a group of institutional timber investors. Can you just talk about sort of the applicability or non-applicability of that kind of structure at Weyerhaeuser and maybe tie that in with how you're thinking about sort of growth in your Timberlands business over the next few years? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, we thought that it will increase transaction that you're referring to was a very creative transaction and especially did a nice job of highlighting the underlying value of high quality Southern Timberlands. If we were at some point to conclude this type of transaction in the best interest of our shareholders, it's something we would consider. In terms of growth overall markets, we said we are interested in growing our company. Primary opportunity, we think will probably be in Timberlands, but we'll continue to be very disciplined in looking at acquisitions, opportunities as we move forward. Mark Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Good enough. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Doyle, good luck next year. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thanks, everyone. Good morning. I appreciate the details and congratulations again on all the progress on the costs and OE. Maybe, piggybacking off the last two questions from Mark and Gail \u2013 Doyle, I think, what you'd have left in terms of projects, and OE benefit s we head into 2016 is something north of $100 million. I know you'll probably want to talk a little bit about this in December at your Analyst Day, but is there a way to at least catch us upon maybe the opportunity for more OE benefit and is there a way to talk to what you achieved in OE in the third quarter across the segments? If you had it, I'd missed it in the deck or in your comments. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, George, to your point, we will be updating exactly our progress in 2015 later this year and giving more specific guidance on the opportunities that are still in front of us, but to your point, we have made good progress. What I'm most encouraged about is, this is now becoming bottom up driven in our organization as people are really understanding what we're doing in OpEx, and finding additional opportunities. So we will be giving further update on that going forward. In terms of quarter-to-quarter, clearly, if you looked at price and volume and what that would result in terms of earnings, that's one number in our earnings and each of the businesses are higher than that. That delta is primarily due to OpEx. Looking at it, I'll just give you an example, if you look at this morning I actually looked at some numbers and I looked year-to-date 2015 versus year-to-date 2014 because I think it's hard and things move around a lot on a quarterly basis but just looking at Timberland, for example, year-to-date 2014 our earnings in 2014 were $470 million. You look at lower price, lower volume that would have \u2013 you would have thought just backing in those two things, our earnings would have been $370 million year-to-date 2015 and in fact they're $415 million. So that delta, not all of its OpEx, but a big portion of that is OpEx. Similar type numbers for lumber, OSB, ELP. So that's the way we think about it, just taking out the thing, the volume, the price components of it and that's how we know it's showing up in the bottom-line. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : So, could you remind us as you look out and do the buckets for OE change, the deeper we go into this decade or will it be pretty continuous or pretty equal contribution across the various categories for the various businesses? And that's a broad question but if you give us a bit of a feel there. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. I wouldn't say changes substantially, George. We will identify broader opportunities as we move forward. As I said, the encouraging part about this is it's becoming part of our culture, it is being bottom up-driven. So things that, frankly, I would have never thought of as opportunities, our employees are bringing up as opportunities to continue to drive down our cost structure, improve our profitability. So again, we'll get more clarity on that as we move forward. But it really does boil down, as I mentioned earlier, to the basic blocking and tackling of running these businesses, but we are encouraged by the opportunities that we continue to unearth to drive our OpEx initiatives. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Patty. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Morning, Chip. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Morning, Chip. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. First question, we haven't talked about Cellulose today, and I was just wondering what you're seeing in that marketplace in terms of, there's a very small player that's kind of working hard to fill up their mills because things haven't turned out the way they planned. And then you've got obviously two competitors who are involved in conversion projects next year. And could you just give me a feel for how that may or may not impact you in terms of your contracts and what you see for the marketplace? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : You might imagine, Chip, we're right in the middle of that process. So let me just give you a little bit of color. I would say that we are very pleased with the demand that we're seeing for our products from our customers. We've got, as you know, very long customer relationships. So on the volume side, feeling good about \u2013 it's still just the fourth quarter, we're not into 2016 until next year and we'll give you more color as we get a little closer. Having said that, I do expect that there will continue to be some price pressure as we \u2013 moving forward into 2016 as you see supply and demand. But I would say, at this point, we are very pleased with where we are on that front, but more to come. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And regardless of the supply side, would you still characterize the market globally as still a low to mid, maybe even a mid single-digit growth, are you seeing that kind of growth rate? And I know it's very early days, but what do you think this change in policy in China can mean for demand, on going from one child to two children? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, more babies mean more diapers, which means more fluff pulp. So hard to factor that into the cash flow stream, but I know what the direction would be. So I think from that perspective, we feel good about that piece, but I don't know how to quite model that at this point. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then just on a separate note, I noticed the \u2013 and this would be on I guess page eight of the financial package, but the other unallocated expense, which isn't tied to FX or LIFO, was a pretty high number, $23 million. And maybe I missed it, but what was that? And I know it jumps around, but what should we expect that to do from third quarter to fourth quarter? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Sure. We did true up some of our environmental reserves, which is probably the biggest piece of that, it's not all of that by any matter of means, we have a number of things that you saw in the second quarter. The number was I think about $13 million, went to $23 million. The biggest difference really was for a true-up of some environmental reserves that are old reserves and it's just a function of \u2013 this is kind of the time that we go through that process. There are probably some other small reserve true-ups, but that's the biggest number. Going forward into the fourth quarter, I wouldn't expect that that number would be as large as you see it. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, everyone. I had a couple of questions on EWP, first of all. Have you seen any significant pressure from the decline in solid wood, because it seems like your prices were holding in pretty well? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Steve. And good morning, Steve. As you would expect, we have seen a little bit of pricing pressure as the saw log prices have come off. We anticipate, as we mentioned earlier, as saw log prices go up, some of that pressure will abate. So to answer your question, I would say, yes, we've seen a little bit of pressure, nothing significant and not something we're concerned about in the long term. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And do any of the Trus Joist facilities have the ability to participate in this cross-laminated timber market that seems to be emerging? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. We are really encouraged by the cross-laminated timber emerging market. And more and more buildings, as we all know, are using wood. And yes, we are positioned to participate in that as we move forward and there are some big initiatives, as you know, to continue to encourage those efforts going forward. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah, I think it's a great opportunity. And then I have one question on Cellulose. A couple of years ago, when viscose was really, really strong, you introduced your Pearl product that I believe was marketed as an extender, but I don't think you've spoken about it recently. So I was just wondering, is it growing, is it lucrative and are prices moving one way or another? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Steve, it's Patty. It is a smaller part of the overall portfolio, but we are producing the Pearl product, primarily in our Port Wentworth facility, and that does help the overall supply that comes into the fluff market. So it is still a meaningful part for Port Wentworth, still a small part as it relates to the overall pulp manufacturing and supply. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: But your expertise in any future growth would be more in fluff than in the extenders, is that correct? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, the biggest impact for sure would be in fluff just based upon the size of both that market and our capacity, but I wouldn't discount the importance of the Pearl product, especially as a result, as I said, to both the price as well as additional capacity for Port Wentworth. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Unknown Speaker : Hey, everyone. This is Scott Lehmann (47:01) in for Mark Connelly. Good morning. Just two quick questions. The first one is, if you guys see these FX conditions persist for the next year, how would you expect that that would affect the mix of wood that you guys are shipping? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let's talk just a minute about what we're seeing in the export market. As we mentioned, we are very encouraged by what we're seeing in Japan. Housing continues to improve there. And as a result, we expect improved shipments into Japan in the fourth quarter and would expect that trend to continue next year. In terms of Chinese markets, as we referred to earlier, inventories are returning, trending back toward normalized levels. And we think, as a result, prices are stabilizing and getting inventories back toward more normalized levels by the end of this year we think positions China to be a improving market as we move into next year, 2016. Unknown Speaker : Okay. And then just the second and last question. It looks like your price realizations for Engineered Wood Products were both up in the quarter. Do you think that those markets are tight enough to allow you to pass along higher OSB prices, if OSB prices do continue to move higher over the next six months? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : We'll have to see how that all figures out. As we said, for the fourth quarter, which is really on a pricing guidance what we give, think that realization will be basically flat into the third quarter. Unknown Speaker : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Alex Ovshey with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thank you. Good morning, Doyle and Patty. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Alex. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: A couple of ones for you. So, you and others or U.S. based pulp producers have talked about the potential impact of a strong dollar on pulp pricing, assuming the dollar does stay strong. How do you sort of handicap the potential impact to margins in pulp from that? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, I think as Doyle talked about in his comments on the FX, a strong dollar is not a positive business. But I think as we look at the euro right now, if you look year-over-year, it has weakened considerably compared to the U.S. dollar. So, I wouldn't necessarily see that it will be significantly weaker from where it is today. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks a lot, Patty. And then just thinking about the manufacturing portfolio. So a few years back we were talking about engineered wood distribution is businesses that you would potentially exit unless there was material improvement in the profitability which we've absolutely seen. So is there any interest in growing those segments through M&A now that we have seen a very nice improvement in the profitability there? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you for your comment regarding the improved profitability and as I mentioned earlier, a lot of good work from our employees. With that said, in both of those businesses we still got more work to do. In terms of growth generally, we said we would like to grow our company. We'll be very disciplined about how we do that. We think our largest opportunities will be in Timberlands. But if we can find bolt-on type acquisitions and our other businesses that makes sense and drive value for shareholders, that's something we would consider. But our primary focus especially in the two businesses that you just highlighted continue to improve our existing operations. Alex Ovshey - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Thanks, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your final question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James & Associates. Please go ahead. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Collin. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning, Collin. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Just first on the capital allocation front. Going back to \u2013 when you announced your $700 million buyback, I think you guys made it pretty clear that you fully intend to utilize that in context of the TRI Pointe deal. How should we be thinking about really this latest share repurchase announcement? Just given where your cash balance is now, should we view that as you're going to fully execute that or is it just kind of a tool you want at your disposal? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think when we announced the share repurchase our intent when we announced it is to fully execute it. So, we'll continue to update everybody on exactly where we are on a quarter-to-quarter basis, but our intention would be to execute the share repurchase over time. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Yeah, no, it just looked like you had \u2013 there was a little bit of a pause if you completed the full $90 million in the third quarter, and there wasn't really anything incremental for the remainder of the quarter. So that was kind of the \u2013 where the question was coming from... Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, there was nothing to be read into that Collin. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just I'm curious if you can talk a little bit more about \u2013 there have been a few lumber production curtailments announced in the U.S. South recently and obviously in response to where lumber pricing was in the third quarter. And just maybe what have you seen in terms of your Timberlands business as it relates to that? Have you had to get back at pricing at all, have you lost a little bit of volume to a couple mills, just maybe update us in context of some of the announcements in the third quarter? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. In terms of our Southern Timberlands, I would say are \u2013 whether all these \u2013 are these one off. Our demand has been continued to be fairly consistent and pricing in the third quarter was up slightly versus the second quarter. And for 2015 versus 2014, our best guess is prices will be up somewhere in the 2% to 3% range as we had indicated earlier this year. So, yeah, was there some impact from those announcements? Yes. But, it had any significant impact on our Timberlands, either volume or pricing? No. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just bigger picture, I know you've mentioned a couple of times on this call again, Doyle, just the focus on looking at growing potentially that Timberland platform, maybe more opportunities in the U.S. South. But can you just talk about given that we've now seen two of the larger deals that were out there this year either cleared or are in the process of clearing the market, just what you're even seeing in terms of opportunities right now? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's not a lot out there right now, Collin. I would tell you, especially for higher quality Timberlands when something does come, become available, there's a lot of interest, a lot of competition and still a lot of money out there interested in investing in this asset class. But, in terms of specific opportunities other than the two that you just mentioned, not seeing a lot of activity in terms of availability. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just one last one and then just kind of piggybacking off of couple of the other questions. Just \u2013 again, congratulations on all the progress, particularly on the Engineered Wood Products business. Should we think about just given that, there still sounds like some other opportunities you want to explore there on cost savings over time. Do you think about this as now being kind of a minimum of $140 million to $150 million a year in terms of EBITDA business? I mean just maybe speak to the sustainability of the improvement that we've seen here, particularly over the last couple of quarters? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We do think the improvements that we've seen are sustainable. I do believe that we have, as I alluded to earlier, additional opportunities to improve that business going forward. So, to your point very encouraged about the progress, very encouraged about the work of our employees in that business. And there is no reason to the things that we've done aren't sustainable and that there aren't additional opportunities to improve that business going forward. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: All right. Thank you very much. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Collin. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any closing remarks. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me just close by saying thanks everybody for joining in this morning. And more importantly, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. And everybody have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2015 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call over to Denise Merle, Vice President of Human Resources and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Denise M. Merle - Senior VP-Human Resources & Investor Relations : Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2015 earnings. On the call with me this morning are Doyle Simons, CEO; Patty Bedient, CFO; and Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Denise, and welcome, everyone. For the past two years, we've been relentlessly focused on making Weyerhaeuser a truly great company by pulling three key levers to drive value for shareholders : portfolio, performance and capital allocation. In 2015, we've made significant progress in each of these areas. We announced two transformational portfolio changes, a merger with Plum Creek that will create the world's premier timberland and forest products company and the exploration of strategic alternatives for our Cellulose Fibers business. We maintained a relentless focus on improving our relative performance and delivered on our second set of annual operational excellence targets. And importantly, we delivered on our commitment to return cash to shareholders. We increased our dividend by 7%, and we repurchased nearly $520 million of common shares in 2015. Despite ongoing headwinds related to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and global macroeconomic uncertainty, we remain focused on what we could control. And for the fourth quarter, our business has once again delivered solid operating results. Weyerhaeuser reported fourth quarter net earnings of $59 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $121 million or $0.24 per share. Our primary special item for the fourth quarter was a non-cash asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Additional items included costs for the Plum Creek merger and the closure of several distribution centers, and a tax benefit from the expiration of our built-in gains period. I will begin the discussion of our fourth quarter business results with some brief comments about the housing market. The housing market maintained positive momentum in the fourth quarter as favorable weather conditions enabled building activity to continue through December in many areas of the country. Single-family housing starts improved in the quarter and ended the year up 10% compared with 2014. Total U.S. housing starts ended 2015 at just over 1.1 million, an improvement of 11% compared with last year. For 2016, we expect steady moderate growth in the U.S. housing market. We are planning for just over 1.2 million housing starts in an increasing single-family share. With improving job growth and historically low interest rate, U.S. economic fundamentals support a continuing recovery. Despite some headwinds from labor constraint and falling oil prices, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. Most of our customers tell us they are planning for 2016 growth rate in the low-double digits. Let me now turn to our business segment results, starting with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $134 million to fourth quarter earnings, an improvement of $8 million compared with the third quarter. In the West, fee harvest volumes rose seasonally as we exited the third quarter fire season, and average log realizations increased due to a greater percentage of export sales. Each of our export markets improved during the quarter. Log sales volumes to Japan increased and prices rose modestly as a solid Japanese housing market continues to drive demand. So the full-year 2015, Japanese win housing starts grew by 3%. In China, log inventories at the ports declined throughout the fourth quarter as many suppliers curtailed shipments in response to weak third quarter pricing. Although overall Chinese market demand remained relatively flat compared with the third quarter, average realizations for our China export logs increased and sales volumes rose as we flexed volume to take advantage of opportunities created by the tighter Chinese inventory situation. In Western domestic markets, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Realizations for our Western domestic logs declined slightly to a greater mix of hemlock and other whitewood. The flooding experienced in some regions of Washington and in Oregon during December had no significant effect on our operations or infrastructure. In the South, heavy rainfall did affect harvest operations in select wood baskets, but fee harvest declined only 3% compared with third quarter as our Southern Timberlands teams did an outstanding job of flexing harvest settings in response to weather conditions. Although overall market conditions were stable, realizations for our Southern logs declined slightly, due to a shift in geographic mix. Silviculture and forestry expenses declined due to cost control initiatives and weather-related constraints. Fourth quarter included earnings of $19 million from disposition of non-strategic timberlands, an increase of $6 million compared with the third quarter. Wood Products, chart six and seven. Wood Products contributed $48 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items compared with $85 million in the third quarter. Special items for the fourth quarter included a pre-tax charge of $8 million for the closure of four distribution centers, as we continue to improve the cost structure of that business. Adjusted EBITDA before special items for the Wood Products segment declined to $75 million in the fourth quarter, as seasonally lower sales volumes and lower operating rates more than offset improved realizations for oriented strand board. In lumber, EBITDA was $22 million lower compared with the third quarter. Average realizations declined 3% and sales volumes fell 9%. Operating rates declined and unit manufacturing cost rose due to increased downtime, primarily for installation of capital projects that will continue to reduce cost within our Southern lumber system. In OSB, EBITDA improved by $13 million, primarily due to a 14% increase in average sales realizations. This improvement was partially offset by a 7% reduction in sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned maintenance downtime. Engineered Wood Products reported fourth quarter EBITDA of $14 million compared with $36 million in the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime for major maintenance, capital projects, and seasonal holiday shutdowns. Sales volumes declined seasonally, and average realizations were lower due to mix. EBITDA for the distribution business declined compared with third quarter due to seasonally lower sales volumes. Cellulose Fibers, charts eight and nine. Cellulose Fibers contributed $64 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items compared with $79 million in the third quarter. Fourth quarter results included a non-cash pre-tax charge of $84 million for the asset impairment in our newsprint equity affiliate. Pulp prices remained under pressure during the fourth quarter due to continued strengthening of the U.S. dollar. Average pulp realizations declined compared with the third quarter, and maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage dates. Fourth quarter included eight days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with four days in the third quarter. These factors were partially offset by improved sales volumes and strong operating performance. Pulp production rose compared with the third quarter despite the increase in scheduled maintenance outage days and several of our mills set operating records. For example, our Columbus, Mississippi mill operated at nearly 100% reliability in the quarter. I will now turn it over to Patty to discuss our first quarter outlook, and then I'll follow up with some specific comments on operational excellence. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Thanks, Doyle, and good morning, everyone. The outlook for the first quarter is summarized on chart 12. Now, this outlook does not incorporate the merger with Plum Creek. We'll include Plum Creek results after the transaction closes. I'll begin my comments with Timberlands. In the West, export demand from Japan is expected to remain strong, and we anticipate a slight improvement in pricing. The strength of the U.S. dollar continues to dampen significant price increases. Sales volumes to Japan are expected to increase more than 5% in the quarter. Our volumes and realizations for log sales to China are anticipated to increase modestly. We anticipate a slight increase in Western domestic sales realizations as lumber prices are expected to improve later in the quarter. Fee harvest in the West is expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the South, sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly due to mix. Sales volumes will be lower as wet weather contributes to the typical seasonal decline in fee harvest. Earnings from non-strategic land sales are anticipated to be roughly $10 million lower than the fourth quarter. Overall, we expect earnings in our Timberlands segment to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In Wood Products, lumber average sales realizations are anticipated to increase in the first quarter compared to the fourth, although prices have not improved thus far. Realizations for our other product lines as well as overall sales volumes are expected to be roughly comparable to last quarter. We expect less downtime from planned maintenance and capital projects compared to the fourth quarter. And as a result, average unit manufacturing cost should decrease. Channel inventories remain low, with customers generally purchasing for immediate needs. As we enter the spring building season, we do expect to see business improve. We anticipate that overall earnings on our Wood Products segment will be higher in the first quarter compared to the fourth and slightly higher than the first quarter of 2015. In Cellulose Fibers, global softwood pulp inventories as of the end of the fourth quarter were at 29 days, down slightly from the 30 days at the end of the third quarter. This is at the high end of balanced inventory levels. We expect that average sales realizations and volumes for our pulp products will weaken during the first quarter due to continued currency headwinds and the normal effect of the Chinese New Year. Our liquid packaging operation will begin its planned maintenance outage this quarter, and as a result, we expect maintenance expense for this segment will increase significantly compared to the fourth quarter, which had fewer overall maintenance days. We anticipate that earnings in our Cellulose Fibers segment will be significantly lower than the fourth quarter of 2015 and roughly comparable to the first quarter of last year. Now, I'll wrap up with some overall financial comments, and I'll refer to chart 11 for these discussions. Cash from operations totaled $339 million in the fourth quarter, an increase of $57 million from the third quarter. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter were $174 million, bringing our total expenditures for the full year to $483 million, well within our earlier guidance of $500 million. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect total expenditures for the full year to be down slightly from 2015, subject to the outcome of the strategic review for Cellulose Fibers and the transaction with Plum Creek. At the end of the quarter, we had cash of just over $1 billion and we do not have any scheduled debt maturities in 2016. Now, I'd like to update you on the status of our retirement benefit plans. The year-end 2015 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post-employment retirement plans improved by approximately $400 million compared to year-end 2014. This improvement was primarily the result of the increase in discount rates. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2015 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions for that plan this year. Cash paid for all other pension and other post-employment retirement plans in 2015 was approximately $80 million. We expect spending in 2016 to be approximately $60 million. Chart 14 in the appendix details the pension expense by business for 2015. Total expense in 2015 was approximately $42 million, and in 2016, we expect the total amount will be income of approximately $5 million. So with that, I'll turn the call back to Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Patty. I'd now like to switch gears and provide an update on our operational excellence efforts. Throughout the year, each of our businesses remained relentlessly focused on achieving their respective operational excellence targets. Achieving these targets is not easy. They're designed to stretch a business to deliver a step change and relative performance, and that's exactly what is happening through a lot of really good work by our employees. Chart 13 highlights our OpEx accomplishments for 2015 and our annual target for 2016. The Timberlands business delivered $39 million of operational excellence improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $20 million to $30 million. These results were primarily driven by cost efficiency in three key areas. First, harvest and haul cost. We're continuing the implementation of centralized dispatch systems to improve the efficiency of logging and trucking contractors and replacing costly cable logging with steep slope technologies. Second, spending on forest roads. We're adjusting the volume of rock relay during road construction and the level of road maintenance to match expected vehicle travel patterns and local weather conditions. Finally, silvicultural cost. Data we have collected on tree stand growth patterns enable us to custom-tailors silviculture prescriptions to apply pruning and hardwood control only to acres where those activities generate an optimal financial return. With total OpEx improvements of $64 million since 2013, the Timberlands business has achieved the $50 million to $70 million improvement goal we established two years ago. However, we are not done. For 2016, we are targeting an additional $20 million to $30 million of OpEx improvements from our existing Timberlands holdings. This does not include the benefit we will get from applying our OpEx efforts to over 6 million acres of Plum Creek lands. The Lumber business achieved $21 million of improvements in 2015, meeting its target of $20 million to $25 million. Primary drivers include improvements in reliability and process efficiency and rigorous cost management as we continue to drive down our cost net of logs. Each mill is focused on maintaining consistent throughput and improving uptime by resolving process and equipment issues that create bottlenecks or stop production. Capital expenditures for the Lumber business increased in 2015 as we invested in low-risk, high-return projects to further improve the cost structure of our mills. These projects include auto graders and continuous dry kilns. We will capture the full benefits from several of these investments in 2016. With cumulative improvements of over $40 million since 2013, the Lumber business is nearing halfway on its journey to $100 million of controllable manufacturing cost reductions. For 2016, the business is targeting OpEx improvement of $15 million to $20 million. Oriented strand board delivered $24 million of OpEx improvement in 2015, exceeding its target of $10 million to $15 million. Results were driven by improving reliability as our mills focused on eliminating sources of downtime and recovering efficiently from outage events; lowering wax and resin costs as we optimize recipes for multiple products; and increasing our mix of higher-margin products such as flooring. With cumulative improvements of $34 million, the OSB business is more than halfway to its $60 million goal. The business is targeting another $15 million to $20 million of OpEx improvements in 2016. For Engineered Wood Products and Distribution, we set specific bottom-line EBITDA improvement target for 2015 as those businesses remain focused on turnaround performance. Engineered Wood Products improved full-year EBITDA by $35 million compared with 2014, significantly exceeding its $15 million to $20 million target. Each mill maintained a rigorous focus on reducing unit manufacturing cost for all products. For example, maintenance team shared best practices across the mill system, increasing reliability and reducing cost. Engineered Wood Products has made a substantial improvement since 2013. Over the past two years, this business has increased annual EBITDA by almost $70 million, proving that it has the ability to perform. Our focus now is continuing to improve relative performance versus the competition. The 2016 goal for this business will not be a bottom line EBITDA target, but an OpEx improvement target of $10 million to $15 million. Distribution improved full-year EBITDA by $8 million in 2015. The business fell short of its $20 million to $30 million improvement target as it was unable to overcome between effect of severe winter weather early in the year and lower than expected demand in the first half of 2015. 2015 OpEx improvements were largely attributable to improved product margins and reductions in head count, warehouse and delivery expenses. Improvements made to the Distribution cost structure during 2015 have created a stronger foundation for better operating performance next year. In 2016, the distribution business is targeting bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million. Cellulose Fibers. Cellulose Fibers delivered operational excellence improvements of $47 million, significantly exceeding its $30 million to $35 million target. Improvements were primarily attributable to lower energy costs, driven by our new turbine generator at our Flint River mill and a boiler conversion at Columbus and reduced usage of key chemicals as several mills-adjusted processes are tied to their digesters and bleach plants. During 2016, Cellulose Fibers is targeting improvements of $40 million to $50 million. With OpEx improvements of $75 million to-date, this would enable the business to exceed the $100 million goal established in 2013. I'll also mention the reduction in our SG&A. Part of our commitment to operational excellence is having the right cost structure across our company. Two years ago, we committed to reduce SG&A about $75 million and achieve that run rate by the end of 2014. Last year, we told you we had delivered on that commitment, and you can see our performance in this year's results. Compared with 2013, we have reduced our SG&A by over $100 million. Success in achieving our OpEx target was a critical component of Weyerhaeuser's 2015 financial performance, enabling us to offset pricing headwinds in many of our markets. In Timberlands, weaker year-over-year pricing for Western logs created a headwind of over $100 million. By exceeding its operational excellence target, the Timberlands business was able to overcome nearly half of that deficit. Lower year-over-year realizations of 11% for lumber and 9% for OSB created a headwind of over $250 million for Wood Products earnings. However, the segment captured nearly $100 million of operational excellence improvement, significantly mitigating the effect of these lower prices and earnings for Wood Products declined less than $70 million on a year-over-year basis. Cellulose Fibers made the headwind of over $100 million from declining pulp prices, higher fiber cost, and the effects of the West Coast port slowdown. The business offset nearly half of this amount through its OpEx efforts. Looking forward to 2016, our relentless focus on operational excellence remains a key component of our commitment to improve our relative performance and drive value for shareholders. I will close this morning with some brief comments on our merger with Plum Creek and the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business. The joint proxy and registration statement associated with our announced merger with Plum Creek was declared effective by the SEC on December 28. Both ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended that shareholders vote in favor of the proposals. The shareholder vote will be held on February 12 and we anticipate closing the merger in the first quarter. Our joint integration team is making excellent progress as we define staffing needs, establish plan for cost synergy, and position the merged company for a smooth and successful day one. The review of Cellulose Fibers is proceeding well and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete. As we enter 2016, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us. Although the first few weeks of the year have been characterized by market turbulence and global macroeconomic concerns, I am encouraged by the positive trend in U.S. housing and the optimistic tone we are hearing from our customers. Our portfolio changes and operational improvements are positioning Weyerhaeuser to drive long-term value for shareholders. We will remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation, and I look forward to sharing our continued progress with you. And now, I'd like to open up the phone for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): In Cellulose Fibers, your average prices were down, I think, around 10% year-over-year, which is maybe a little bit sharper than the list price decline. Can you remind us, was there any mix issues there or kind of what was driving the price decline? It seemed a little bit sharper than what we might have expected? And then, just related to Cellulose Fibers, you're targeting an acceleration of OpEx improvements in 2016, and I'm just wondering if you could give a little color on what's driving that kind of year-over-year. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Let me start. I'll address your second question with OpEx and then, I'll ask Patty to address your first question. And what I would tell you on OpEx is we're gaining a lot of traction across our businesses and specifically in Cellulose Fibers. What we found there through Cathy Slater's leadership is an abundance of ideas that are percolating up from a bottoms-up approach in terms of continuing to drive down our overall cost structure. The encouraging thing about OpEx overall, Anthony, that we've seen is, it started off as a top-down effort. But as we defined winning, defined exactly what we mean by OpEx and people are incented to drive OpEx, we are having just more and more ideas bubble up in terms of the opportunities, and Cathy has a full slate of those outlined and proved in 2015 the ability to execute on those, and more to come in 2016. So, it's across the board, lower energy, lower chemicals, better reliability, all the safety blocking and tackling of running a Cellulose Fibers business. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, Anthony. This is Patty. Your question on Cellulose Fibers, was it fourth quarter of 2014 to fourth quarter of 2015 in terms of... Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Yeah. Yeah. Year-over-year. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. It really isn't anything significant as it relates to anything out of the ordinary. As you know, we do have a different mix in terms of both our product within our fluff mill, as well as our NBSK mill in Grande Prairie. But I wouldn't say there's anything out of the ordinary or strange about the pricing itself. It's just that the mix can change. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. That's helpful. And then just shifting to Wood Products, can you share your operating rates across the three businesses? And I'm sorry if I missed this, but with OSB, can you just repeat kind of the trajectory of pricing that you're expecting into the first quarter? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure, Anthony. So in terms of operating rates, in the fourth quarter, Lumber was in the high-80s, OSB was in the low-90s, and ELP was in the low-70s. In terms of pricing for OSB, if you look at its current or first quarter to-date, average to-date is down about $7 versus the fourth quarter in terms of the OSB pricing. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the year. Doyle, if we can talk about operational excellence first. So you're two years into the program, you're more than achieving your goals. I'd have to imagine that you're getting to the proverbial fruit that's maybe hanging higher on the tree. So do you need to have a larger funnel to get to the goals in a year like 2015 relative to what would have been the case in \u2013 excuse me, 2016 relative to 2015 or 2014? And then the related question, ultimately, running a business is a lot easier than running numbers on a spreadsheet if you're an analyst. But what's been so difficult about getting the OE benefits to the bottom line and distribution? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Okay. Yeah, thanks for the question, George. On OpEx, I think you said it exactly right. It does get more difficult as you move forward. But as I said in response to the earlier question, what I'm really encouraged about and why we're confident we're going to \u2013 be able to continue to deliver on OpEx targets is because it has become part of who we are. It is being done much more from a bottoms-up approach, George. So whereas previously, you would think that we're identified at the top and kind of driven down and now more and more of these ideas. To your point, it's a larger funnel. More and more of our ideas are coming from our employee base, which they are the ones out there doing the hard work every day. When they understand what the opportunities are, recognize that they are empowered to go do something at those, and then send them (31:33) to do that, it's amazing what can happen. So, you're right, it is a different approach, but very encouraged by the progress. And most importantly, it's becoming part of our culture and that's why we're year-after-year, we believe, we're going to be able to continue to drive operational excellence as we move forward. In terms of distribution, George, it's been \u2013 while we have made \u2013 and I think it's important to highlight, we have made an improvements there. And if you look at it, we've made $40 million plus improvements over the last two years in bottom line distribution EBITDA, but we're still not where we need to be to your point. This year, I hate using weather, but weather did have an impact in the first half of the year, slower than the expected demand, and then the fact that we had kind of eroding commodity prices throughout the year limited the ability to leverage the margin improvements. As we said, we made some significant changes to the cost structure by closing four sites to reduce the footprint, the cost structure and really focus on our growth markets going forward. And I'll tell you, with those changes, we are confident that we're going to be able to continue to improve our distribution business. But still a lot of work to do there and still have work to do, frankly, to prove that we deserve to be in this business long term. With good progress and again with the structural changes we made in the fourth quarter, optimistic about that business going forward. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And my last question and I'll turn it over, two-part, unrelated, I guess that's two questions. First of all, what kind of pricing are you expecting on average for wood sequentially versus fourth quarter to hit your guidance? And then in SG&A, you've more than achieved your target. Should we assume that SG&A is now flat on a going-forward basis? Thanks, guys. Good luck in the quarter. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, George. In terms of pricing, as Patty outlined, we anticipate prices will in fact be higher in Lumber in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. However, that's still in front of us. If you look at it currently, quarter-to-date, prices for Lumber are down approximately $7 versus the fourth quarter average. Encouraging, prices were up $4 or $5 this week. So, we'll see where it plays out. But normally, you start to see an inflection point in Lumber prices mid to late-February as the spring \u2013 as building season kicks in. And we would hope to see the same type of price inflection or improvement in OSB as we move through the quarter as well. And that's what's baked into \u2013 generally baked into our guidance for the first quarter. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah, George. As you think about Wood Products, the primary price increase quarter-over-quarter that we have baked into our guidance is in Lumber and I would say we're looking for something low-single digits in Lumber. And OSB and Engineered Wood, combinations of those two, probably the results would \u2013 in our guidance would be roughly flat from a pricing perspective. But as Doyle has said, thus far for January, one month does not a quarter make, but we are down from the guidance that we have baked into the quarter. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And in terms of SG&A, George, we're always looking to drive down our SG&A costs and as we complete the merger with Plum Creek, as we already identified, there will be at least $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. Most of that will be SG&A they did and then of course operational synergies on top of that. So like I said, we're never done on SG&A and the focus after the closure of the merger will quickly turn to the \u2013 to hard dollar cost synergies that we outlined when we announced that merger. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Collin. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Good morning. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: First question. I just wanted to follow up on George's question. Just as it relates to closing the four distribution centers, can you quantify how much of a lift and run rate as far as EBITDA within the distribution business? How much that specifically will provide a lift in 2016? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, as we said, we did close four sites. These were markets with limited growth potential and high cost. And we think, as a result of that, we've laid out our OpEx target for 2016, and we are confident with these changes, Collin, that we will meet these specific targets that we laid out for 2016 in terms of bottom line EBITDA improvement of $15 million to $20 million in that business. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. I'll just \u2013 is there any way to think about how much of a drag maybe those facilities were in 2015 or you don't really break it out that way? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: We don't really break it out that way, Collin. I'll just tell you, it does significantly improve our cost structure. It gets us focused on the markets that we need to be focused on. And I think it's going to be a big benefit as we move in to 2016. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Then, moving to Timberlands, just maybe as we enter the year here, just update us on your latest thinking as it relates to the potential improvement in sawlog prices in the U.S. South this year? What are you thinking about for 2016 and then, just more broadly (37:09) continue to extend, just how you're thinking about the price recovery in the South? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, if you think about Southern log prices, Collin, our prices were up a couple of percent in 2015 versus 2014, and we would anticipate a similar increase in 2016 versus 2015. From a broader picture, if U.S. housing starts continue to improve, demand for lumber will rise. And we expect the tension and rising prices across the Southern log markets, we are confident that's going to continue to pay out. And frankly, the additional mills, whether it be the Canadians coming down and investing in mills and increasing the productivity of those mills or Klausner adding the three mills that they're adding, that's all positive from a demand standpoint for Southern sawlogs as well. So we are \u2013 we remain confident that we're going to reach that inflection point and see Southern sawlog prices begin to rise on a more aggressive basis than the 2% that we've seen over the last couple of years. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then switching gears and recognizing there are some limitations, I recognize what you can say is related to disclosure. But I do want to touch on the financial projections in the proxies internally within Weyerhaeuser. I was curious if you could provide any color on the kind of a drop in expected EBITDA and expected FAD reference between 2016 and 2017 on really Weyerhaeuser on a standalone basis. Any additional color you can provide on that? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, I don't think there's anything additional that we can say about that at this point. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. All right. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Hi. Good morning, Patty and Doyle. First question is on the \u2013 thanks. As you think about the analysis with the Cellulose division, I understand since most of its legacy proctor (39:22) properties bought 25 years ago, the basis is low. And I guess the way we need \u2013 would help me to think about this, obviously, if you do a spin, you would avoid some capital gain tax, I believe. But on the other hand, if you do the spin, there's a lot of cost, I guess, in terms of setting up a public company that you would not have to incur if you're just doing a direct sale of the assets. And I guess can you give me some feel for the trade-off of that? I mean, can you actually put a rough dollar cost of pursuing a spin versus just a sale? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Chip, this is Patty. I think as we think about Cellulose Fibers strategic review, we're looking at all of those alternatives and evaluating them. I couldn't put any dollars on them at this point. You are correct in that the tax basis for Cellulose Fibers is low. And so, we would have on a cash sale a tax, a gain, but we would have to compare that to what we would get in terms of a spin and both in terms of time as well as cost of setting up a separate company. But as we have done with all of our other strategic reviews over the course of time, we are looking at a broad range of options at this point. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And when you look at the distribution business, I know that it's really nice to see how every business has hit their targets, obviously, Doyle, the last couple of three years except for that one. And I didn't know if you were \u2013 just sort of give us an update on your thinking in terms of sort of how much more of time do they have before you might consider strategic review of that business. And then maybe just more broadly, is your thinking toward all the Wood Products segment, all the manufacturing, has that changed at all in light of the Plum Creek deal in terms of would this be an area that you \u2013 in other words, do you want to be a pure Timber play and maybe it's not as strategic? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Chip, let me \u2013 since it's Super Bowl weekend, let me use a football analogy on distribution. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. But you guys aren't in it? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, I guess (41:45)... Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Yeah. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Sorry. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: ... rough around the air (41:45). Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Don't remind us, Chip. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Everybody's walking around with a frown on their face. But in terms of distribution, Chip, I would tell you, as I mentioned earlier, we have made improvements in that business. I think the business has earned the right to continue to be on the field at this point, but has not earned a spot on the roster. So, like I said earlier, still more to do, encouraged by the progress. Like I said, we made some significant changes in the fourth quarter of 2015 and we're confident that that's going to help us accelerate progress in distribution going forward, so more work to do. In terms of Wood Products overall, Chip, as you've heard us say and me say historically, we believe that this can be a very good business and create a lot of value for shareholders over a cycle, assuming that you run it effectively and get the cost structure to where it needs to be, where you're back at the bottom and that you're fully capitalizing on the upturn in housing that we still have in front of us. We're encouraged by the progress we've made on the overall cost structure and our OpEx improvements and still more to come, and like I said, very well positioned to continue to capitalize on the improvement in housing as we move forward. Chip A. Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Two things. The rating agencies have said that given the terms of the deal, they'd probably downgrade Weyerhaeuser. Since you've said you want to remain acquisitive, would it make sense to scale back or slow down the buybacks to keep the agencies happy? And the second question is maybe a little more theoretical, WestRock has said publicly, it wants to get out of its land deals faster. Would that be something that might fit with your priorities? You've talked about wanting to expand, but is cleaning up those JVs something that might be attractive to you? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, let me talk about the acquisitive part and I'll turn it over to Patty to talk about the rating agency. Mark, we have said that we would like to grow the company. We said that our primary opportunities were in Timberlands and thus, the Plum Creek transaction. I'll tell you, in the near term, our focus and maybe our singular focus is going to be on fully integrating Plum Creek and making sure we fully realize the synergy and the value of that transaction. So, in the near term, that's going to be our primary focus and our plate's full on that. Longer term as we integrate that and get the full benefit, continuing to grow the company assuming we can find the right opportunities is something we would consider, but right now, our focus is on Plum Creek and the integration thereof. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : And Mark, as to your question about the rating agencies, S&P did write that based upon their understanding of what the leverage would look like after we close the transaction in order to repurchase the shares, as we've talked about that, the leverage will be certainly higher than where we have historically been. And so, based upon their understanding, at this point, they would expect that they would downgrade us from BBB to BBB minus, so still investment grade. We are focused on bringing that leverage down as we go forward. We are still committed to the $2.5 billion of share repurchase, but certainly mindful that we'll need to bring the leverage down going forward and we think we'll have good opportunities to do that, both with respect to the broader portfolio of 13 million acres of timberland as well as depending upon the outcome of the strategic review of Cellulose Fibers. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Super. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Patty. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): The whole Weyerhaeuser team has done an impressive job over the last couple of years. I had a few questions. One, Doyle, can you just clarify for us on the review of Cellulose, especially, does that include things like the NORPAC joint venture and the bleached board mill at Longview? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So first, let me say thank you for those comments, Mark. And then secondly, yes, the strategic review of Cellulose Fibers includes all of the businesses in Cellulose Fibers. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then to kind of follow on, on Mark's question about the rating agency, I mean there are some other things that you could look at divesting like the business down in Uruguay, which is still not generating a lot of cash. Any thoughts on that, Doyle? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: As we've said, as part of the integration process, we'll do a thorough analysis of all 13-plus million acres with 13-plus million acres and the fact, Mark, and I think this is an important one to highlight, with the recent tax extender package, reducing the build-in gains period permanently to five years, we no longer have that constraint. So, 13 million acres with \u2013 plus no longer being under the built-in gains tax. We have lots of flexibility in terms of what we could do going forward. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Now, last question I had is to kind of come back to something Collin Mings raised and that is you've got a lot of capital tied up in Southern timberland and you're going to commit a lot more capital here pretty quickly to Southern timberland. But if we look at the cash returns on Southern Timber, they've been pretty anemic for about a decade now. What gives you the confidence that these returns are going to improve significantly over the next few years, and what do you think that trajectory looks like? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Mark, what gives me confidence and gives us confidence is basically supply and demand. And as you know, ultimately that works. And if you just look at it from a housing continuing to improve and housing has improved, it's been slow but steady. So, I think that's going to be what's going to happen on the demand front. And on the supply front, if housing continues to improve, the supply is not going to come from the Pacific Northwest, the supply is not going to come from Canada. Yeah, we see a little influx now because of exchange rates in China, but ultimately, they, being Canada are limited because of the pine beetle situation as to what they're going to be able to provide. So, supply and demand works. We're going to reach that inflection point. And when we do, that's when we're going to see a significant change in Southern sawlog prices. So, yeah, it comes slower than any of us would have expected or hoped, but if you just look at the basic supply and demand, we remain confident that we will in fact see improved prices for Southern sawlog just like we have historically. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): And, Doyle, just to follow on this, we all, I think, buy into supply and demand. But on the supply side, it seems like for many years here because of the weakness in housing, we've really been under-harvesting the growth rates down in the South. So we've got some accumulated inventory, and I just wonder how that accumulated inventory affects the rebound in pricing. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Mark, that's a really good point and there's no doubt that there is some accumulated inventory as housing has improved over the last couple of years, we have started to work through some of that accumulated inventory, but there's still some out there. So that's why I'll say there's still a little bit of time, if housing continues, to improve to work through accumulated inventory. But once we do that, you can hit that inflection point of supply and demand, and that's where you start to see the significant increase in pricing. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. I'll turn it over. Good luck in 2016, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. First, a numbers-oriented question. Just on the Cellulose Fibers business, can you provide us with at least preliminary estimates on the maintenance expense and scheduled maintenance outage days for the \u2013 for 2016 by quarter if possible? Is that something you have handy? Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : No, we can't give it to you by quarter, Mark. I can tell you that as you think about fourth quarter to first quarter and the guidance that there's about roughly $10 million of additional maintenance expense in the first quarter compared to the fourth quarter. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then maybe just as a follow-on to that, the $40 million to $50 million of OpEx improvement in Cellulose Fibers, does much or any of that come from being able to effectively reduce maintenance outage expenses? So will we see it in not variable year-to-year? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That is not a key driver of the OpEx improvement that we laid out, Mark. There is, of course, some benefit as we go into the 18-month schedule, but that's not the big driver of what we saw in 2015 versus 2014 nor we'll see in 2016 versus 2015. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then, maybe lastly, kind of following on Mark Wilde's question a little bit. One of the components of the bullish lumber, as well as log story has been the expected reduction in supply coming from British Columbia related to the beetle, et cetera. It doesn't seem to have happened yet and lots of reasons maybe that (51:48). Are you still of that view that we will see a reduction and any color you can provide on how that might play into the market? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, Mark. We are absolutely confident that that's going to happen and all you have to do is spend some time in that area and see the devastation that the pine beetle has, in fact, caused. You're starting to see some announcement as you know of some lumber mill closures because of that. I think what's happened is, part of that has just been distorted by the fact that there's been less demand from China. So, some of the impact from lumber that would normally would get on to China has come to the U.S. and that has temporarily offset the pine beetle situation. But if you just look at what the allowable cuts are, if you look at just the overall fiber situation in Canada, we are confident that the pine beetle scenario is going to play out. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : And we have time for one more question. Your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Yes. Thanks very much. Just looking at your overall volumes in both Timber, well I guess, Timber, Lumber and OSB. What are you planning for 2016? I noticed 2015 Timber volumes were down but you had gains in Lumber and OSB. Just wondering at a higher level what the plan is. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, we would say unit for 2016 in terms of sawlogs overall, we would then anticipate volumes from being flat to maybe down just very slightly. In terms of Lumber and OSB, part of that of course will be dependent on markets. But as we continue to improve our reliability, we would think Lumber and OSB volumes will be up slightly in 2016 versus 2015. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And just a follow-up, just a flat to down on the log side, is that related to not so robust markets or is that because you're logging at a sustainable level? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think it's more related to the fact that we're logging at sustainable levels. As we said, we have the ability in any given year to flex 5% or maybe a little more depending on markets. So we'll see how that plays out and that will ultimately determine what the harvest levels are. But basically, we are harvesting at sustainable levels. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Great. That's where I'll put the vote. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: All right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. I'd like to turn the call back over to Doyle for any final remarks. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you and thank you for everybody's interest today. Before I \u2013 or in closing today, I want to say some words about Patty as this will be her last earnings call on behalf of Weyerhaeuser as she will retire later this year. Specifically, I want to acknowledge her outstanding work as the CFO since 2007 and personally thank her for partnering with me over the last couple of years as we've taken significant steps to make Weyerhaeuser a truly great company. Thank you, Patty, for all you've done for Weyerhaeuser. Patricia M. Bedient - Chief Financial Officer & Executive Vice President : Well, Doyle, let me, just before you close the call, interject one additional thank you to the analyst community on the call. We are very fortunate as a company to have a whole host of very knowledgeable people, and I've enjoyed the dialogue over the years. And as I do retire from Weyerhaeuser now, I feel very confident in the management team going forward, really pleased with the progress that we've made on portfolio performance and capital allocation, and couldn't be more pleased with my successor, once we close this transaction, Russell Hagan. I think that as we go forward, since I will continue to be a significant shareholder, I think that we have a lot of additional capabilities and levers to pull to create ongoing value for shareholders. So, Doyle, thanks to you and thanks to the whole senior management team and employees of Weyerhaeuser. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Patty, and thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Beth, and welcome everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $70 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $150 million or $0.24 per diluted share. Our first quarter earnings included results from Plum Creek for the period February 19 through March 31. Special items for the first quarter included integration and restructuring charges related to the Plum Creek merger and a strategic review of our Cellulose Fiber business, partially offset by gain on the sale of our corporate campus. I'm extremely proud of the work of our employees in the quarter, as we closed the Plum Creek merger, delivered solid operating performance across each of our businesses, and took significant steps toward achieving the commitments that will drive long-term value for shareholders of our merged company including \u2013 we have specific plans in place to capture $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies, and I am highly confident that we will meet or exceed this run rate target by the end of year one. As part of that, we made and announced nearly all our personnel decisions in the 41 days between merger close and the end of the first quarter. We raised $2.5 billion of attractively priced term loan financing and began to aggressively execute against our $2.5 billion share repurchase authorization. At the end of the first quarter, we had repurchased approximately $860 million or 35% of our authorization at an average price of $27.49 per share, and we close the sale of our corporate campus for $70 million in cash with our move to Seattle on track and scheduled for September. We have continued to execute against our goals as the second quarter has progressed. On April 1, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction announced by Plum Creek in September 2015, receiving $440 million in cash in a transaction that valued 260,000 acres of Plum Creek Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. As of the end of April, our share repurchase program was 50% complete with cumulative repurchases of $1.25 billion or nearly 44 million shares at an average price of $28.62. And finally, earlier this week, we announced the conclusion of a portion of our Cellulose Fibers business strategic review with the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper for $2.2 billion. I will turn now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with some brief comments about the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues to grow at a moderate pace, supported by a continuing job growth and historically low interest rates. As of March, total housing starts had improved 14% year-to-date compared with 2015. Single-family starts have grown even more and are up 23% year-to-date. Although multi-family activity, which is typically more volatile, has driven some choppiness in monthly indicators, first quarter housing activity has been consistent with our expectations and those of our customers. Despite some headwinds from labor constraints, builder sentiment remains extremely strong. We continue to plan for just over 1.2 million housing starts in 2016. Let me now turn to our business segments. Following the merger, we realigned our management structure and our business segments to incorporate the increased scale of our Timberlands operations, as well as the addition of Plum Creek's real estate, energy, and natural resources expertise. For the first quarter, Weyerhaeuser is reporting four business segments : Timberlands; Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources; Wood Products; and Cellulose Fibers. To make it easier to compare current and historical results, business segment results for prior periods have been adjusted to reflect our new segment definitions. We've also revised our definition of adjusted EBITDA to add back the non-cash basis of real estate sold. With this change, EBITDA for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment will better reflect the cash generated by those activities. Going forward, we will focus on adjusted EBITDA for all our businesses. I will now begin the discussion, Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. In Timberlands, we're reporting EBITDA by three primary geographies, Western Timberlands includes Washington and Oregon; Southern Timberlands includes all Southern states; and Northern Timberlands includes operations in Montana, the Lake States, New England, and West Virginia. Results from Canada and Uruguay are reported in other Timberlands. Recreational lease activities continues to be reported within the Timberlands segment and volumes and realizations for our Timberlands business are now reported in tons. Timberlands contributed $129 million to first quarter earnings, an improvement of $22 million compared with the fourth quarter. These results include a higher non-cash depletion and amortization costs due to the step-up in Timberlands basis associated with acquisition accounting and the alignment of our accounting policies. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $39 million to $199 million. Approximately, 12% of Timberlands first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. Western Timberlands contributed $118 million to first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased due to slightly higher harvest for legacy Weyerhaeuser land and a partial quarter of Plum Creek harvest. Average realizations for Western logs declined slightly due to a shift in mix from export to domestic markets. Average realizations for export logs improved and export sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. Sales volumes to Japan increased and pricing improved modestly due to continued strong demand. Japanese wooden housing starts have improved slightly compared with 2015 as mortgage rates remained low and we see some pull forward in advance of a scheduled increased in the consumption tax next year. Volumes to China declined seasonally compared with fourth quarter as construction activity paused during the Lunar New Year period. Average realizations improved slightly. Log inventory to Chinese ports rose during the first quarter, but remained within a normal range for the season and well below the elevated levels experienced during the first quarter of 2015. With inventories in line and slightly improved construction activity, our customers are optimistic regarding current market conditions. In Western domestic market, log supply and demand remained balanced and realizations improved slightly. Southern Timberland contributed $77 million to first quarter EBITDA, $21 million more than the fourth quarter. This improvement was attributable to a partial quarter of Plum Creek operations. A partial quarter of harvest from Plum Creek's 3.4 million Southern acres increased Southern harvest by 40% and more than offset a small seasonal decline in harvest from legacy Weyerhaeuser land. Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly primarily due to mix. Silviculture costs and forestry costs declined as activity was delayed due to wet weather. A partial quarter of results from Plum Creek's Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to first quarter EBITDA. Operational excellence initiatives continue to contribute to Timberlands' results. On our fourth quarter earnings call, we set a target of $20 million of $30 million of OpEx improvements from legacy Weyerhaeuser Holdings. Following the merger, we have now increased the Timberlands' 2016 OpEx target to $30 million to $50 million to incorporate $10 million to $20 million of operational synergies we expect to achieve from the merger this year. The multi-year OpEx targets for Timberlands has also increased to $200 million, including the $64 million achieved in 2014 and 2015 to incorporate operational synergy opportunity from the merger. Timberlands has begun an internal benchmarking exercise to identify best practices in silviculture, logging and transportation, and leverage those learnings across the entire Timberlands portfolio. Although this work is still in the early stages, I'm pleased by the level of energy and teamwork in identifying opportunities across the business. Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, chart 6 and 7. The Real Estate & ENR segment includes sales of HBU and non-core Timberland property as well as lease and royalty income from minerals, aggregates, and oil and gas. These activities were formerly reported within Weyerhaeuser's Timberlands segment. Real Estate & ENR contributed $15 million to first quarter earnings, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter. However, EBITDA increased by $1 million to $34 million as lower EBITDA from legacy Weyerhaeuser operations was more than offset by a partial quarter of Plum Creek results. Total acreage sold increased in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter due to a conservation sale of over 8,000 acres of Maine timberlands. Although a partial quarter of Plum Creek's operations contributed significantly to the segment's EBITDA, the Plum Creek contribution to earnings was minimal because Plum Creek land was marked up to fair value as part of the merger purchase price allocation. Operational excellence for the Real Estate & ENR business will be based on the premium to Timberland values captured from the sale of HBU properties. The first step in defining the size of this opportunity is applying Plum Creek's asset value optimization, or AVO, process across Weyerhaeuser's 6.9 million acres of legacy Timberlands. This process is underway and we anticipate it will be substantially complete in about one year. Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $87 million to first quarter earnings compared with earnings before special items of $48 million in the fourth quarter. Results for Plum Creek lumber mills are reported as part of the lumber business and results for Plum Creek's plywood and medium density fiberboard, or MDF, facilities are reported with Engineered Wood Products. Adjusted EBITDA for the Wood Products segment increased to $117 million, primarily due to improved unit manufacturing costs and seasonally higher sales volume. Approximately 4% of Wood Products' first quarter EBITDA is attributable to the addition of Plum Creek operations. In lumber, EBITDA improved $18 million compared with fourth quarter. Average realizations improved 1% and sales volumes increased 3%. Unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rates and strong operating performance. Fourth quarter included downtime for installation of capital projects. In OSB, EBITDA increased to $31 million, $6 million higher than the fourth quarter and $27 million higher than the first quarter of last year. Unit manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for planned maintenance. This more than offset a 3% decrease in average sales realizations. Sales volumes increased 5%. Engineered Wood Products' EBITDA more than doubled to $31 million, compared with $14 million in the fourth quarter. Operating rates and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher demand, strong operating performance, and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Sales volumes increased seasonally and average realizations declined slightly due to mix. EBITDA for the Distribution business improved to $4 million, $2 million more than the fourth quarter and $7 million more than the first quarter of 2015. This business benefited from improved margins and lower operating cost. Operational excellence continues to contribute to Wood Products results as all four businesses gain leverage from ongoing improvements in controllable cost. The businesses are collectively targeting $55 million to $75 million of operational excellence improvements in 2016. Each business remains relentlessly focused on its initiatives and is on track to achieve its target. Cellulose Fibers, charts 10 and 11. Cellulose Fibers contributed $28 million to first quarter earnings, compared with earnings before special items of $64 million in the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for pulp and liquid packaging declined as prices remained under pressure. Sales volumes declined only slightly as demand for our pulp remained strong despite the seasonally weak Lunar New Year period. Maintenance expense increased due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. First quarter included 16 days of scheduled maintenance outages compared with eight days in the fourth quarter. As I noted earlier, we have announced the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper in a $2.2 billion cash transaction. The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including regulatory review, and we expect it to close in the fourth quarter. This transaction delivers compelling value for our shareholders and we expect to use a substantial portion of the $1.6 billion after-tax proceeds for repayment of the 18-month term loans raised during the first quarter. I want to thank the employees of our Cellulose Fibers business for their dedication and professionalism as they have continued to operate safely and deliver an exceptional customer experience through the strategic review process. As noted in Monday's press release, the strategic review of our liquid packaging business and newsprint and publication venture is ongoing, and we look forward to sharing more information with you when that review is complete. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The overall outlook for the second quarter is summarized on chart 16 of the earnings slides. Please note that the second quarter will include a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Starting with Timberlands, we expect second quarter EBITDA to come in approximately 10% higher than first quarter with second quarter earnings comparable to the first quarter. It is important to note that as part of the purchase price allocation, the Plum Creek Timberlands basis was stepped up to reflect fair value. As a result, new depletion rates were established for the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek Timberlands. In addition to changes in the depletion rate, the accounting policies for amortization of road and other related expenses have been aligned. These changes will result in total amortization and depletion expense of approximately $90 million for the second quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, log export volume is expected to improve in the second quarter as volumes to China increased following the seasonally low Lunar New Year period. Japanese export volumes were elevated in the first quarter and are expected to return to more normal seasonal levels in the second quarter. We anticipate stable pricing for our Japanese and Chinese export logs with a slight decline in overall export price realizations due to the higher proportion of Chinese volume. Domestic log volumes will increase with the addition of the Plum Creek activity with prices remain stable quarter-over-quarter. Costs will be higher due to shifting harvest activity to higher elevation, which is typical during the spring season. In the South, harvest volumes will increase approximately 40% as we benefit from the full quarter of Plum Creek operations. We expect average log prices will decrease modestly as the harvest mix will include a higher proportion of pulpwood logs. In addition, forestry expenses will be higher due to increased seasonal spending. In the North, harvest volumes will be above the first quarter levels with the inclusion of a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. The second quarter typically has the lowest harvest levels of the year because of spring weather conditions with the mud season, which limits access to harvest sites in the Northern operating region. Average sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter levels. Note, that prior to the merger, Plum Creek included their Oregon and Washington activity in their Northern segment. Moving on to our full year Timber harvest outlook. We expect our combined 2016 fee harvest will be 40 million to 42 million tons. The 2016 fee harvest is comparable to the combined Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek 2015 harvest levels after adding Plum Creek's harvest for the January 1 to February 19 pre-merger period. Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources' second quarter EBITDA and earnings are expected to be similar to the first quarter. Higher and better use markets remain active in the Southern states and we expect similar transaction activity in the second quarter as compared to the first quarter. In the second half of the year, we expect transaction counts to increase as more higher and better use properties are identified through our AVO process and brought to market. For the remainder of the year, we estimate the sales mix will be evenly split between Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek lands, with an average basis of 50%. For Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain relatively low, as buyers continue to meet their purchasing needs on a just-in-time basis. Prices for lumber have improved in the second half of the first quarter, and that trend continued into the second quarter. Average April sales realizations were $30 higher than the first quarter average. OSB prices have also rallied, with average April sales realizations approximately $15 higher than the first quarter averages. We anticipate prices will continue to strengthen during the second quarter, as building activity increases. Sales volume for the Engineered Wood Products are expected to be seasonally higher in the second quarter, and we expect continued improvement in this business. Operating rates remain strong across all the Wood Products business lines. We expect overall second quarter EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be significantly higher than the first quarter. In fact, EBITDA for this segment has not been this strong since the second quarter of 2013. This is primarily a result of our improved operational performance and competitive cost structure. Moving to Cellulose Fibers, EBITDA and earnings in Cellulose Fibers business were expected to increase during the second quarter with higher average sales realizations across our product lines. Volumes are expected to be similar to first quarter levels. We anticipate maintenance spending to be similar to first quarter. Other cost of sales are expected to decrease slightly due to lower fiber and energy costs. For our key financial items, cash from operations during the first quarter was $47 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonally lower earnings, inventory buildup, and semi-annual interest payments. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $415 million. Going forward, we anticipate that our normalized cash balance will be in the range of $200 million to $400 million, which we feel is an appropriate level for the capital structure at this time. We completed our planned post-transaction financing in February and March by entering into two 18-month term loans at a floating rate of LIBOR plus 105 basis points or approximately 1.5%. The loans have a total capacity of $2.5 billion. At the end of the quarter, we had drawn down $1.1 billion. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.1 billion, was $6.7 billion at the end of the quarter. We have no debt maturities in 2016 and we intend to pay down the new term loans primarily with proceeds from asset sales. This will allow us to move toward our target debt to EBITDA ratio of 3.5 times. Interest expense for the first quarter reflects a partial quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. Looking forward, our 2016 interest expense will be approximately $450 million for the year. Moving on to capital expenditures, first quarter capital expenditures totaled $73 million. Our capital spending is seasonal and tends to be lowest in the first quarter before ramping up through the rest of the year. We continue to expect 2016 CapEx will be approximately $450 million, excluding Cellulose Fibers. This includes minimal spending for Real Estate and Energy and Natural resources where the focus is on entitlement and royalty contracts and not capital-intensive development. Our 2016 total company tax rate would be dependent upon the mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. We are currently estimating our full year total company tax rate to be approximately 18% to 20%. Due to prior year overpayment, we do not anticipate making a cash payment in 2016. These first quarter estimates do not take into account the impact of the divestiture of the pulp business, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2016. Let me direct your attention to chart 12, which details the major components of our unallocated items. Income before special items improved to $19 million in the first quarter compared with $1 million of expense in fourth quarter of 2015. Improvement was driven primarily by foreign exchange as the Canadian dollar strengthened 7% against the U.S. dollar during the quarter. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Russell. I will close my comments this morning with some brief comments on the merger integration process. Two-and-a-half months after day one, we have made solid progress on merger integration. Our merged corporate area team is operating together out of our building in Federal Way and we have begun the consolidation of regional offices. Each of our senior management team members has spent several weeks on the road meeting with employees and reinforcing our vision and the core values, relentless focus, and key behaviors that will define our success as a merged company. I look forward to building on that strong foundation as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. We are relentlessly focused on improving performance through operational excellence and capturing cost and operational synergies to leverage the full benefit of an improving U.S. housing market and drive long-term value to our shareholders. And now, we like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Hi. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Plum Creek typically gave guidance on annual revenue from the Real Estate business and I was wondering if you would continue that, if you had any thoughts on sales or EBITDA contribution in 2016. And then from your comments earlier, is it safe to say you'd expect Real Estate sales to step-up in 2017 as you apply that AVO methodology to Weyerhaeuser's portfolio? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Anthony, as we indicated, we are right in the middle of applying the AVO process across the entire legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberland base. And as Russell mentioned, we anticipate that activity will ramp-up in the second half of 2016 and into 2017 as you mentioned. As we get a better feel for what those numbers are going to look like, we will provide guidance as we have historically on a quarterly basis to let you know what we think those will look like going forward. But we're excited about the process. We think there's lots of opportunity, and that activity, as I said, will ramp-up in the second half of 2016 and into 2017. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then switching to lumber, prices have been much stronger than we expected year-to-date. And I was wondering if you could give us some sense of what's happening on the ground in terms of demand you're seeing at job sites, how tight inventories are. And I think typically we see a little seasonal weakness in the second quarter. And I think in your comments, you referenced continued strengthening. So, what's driving your confidence there and maybe what's different from previous years? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, we're encouraged by what we're seeing in lumber and the price increases that have taken place to-date, Anthony. I think the key drivers are just improvement in demand, and as I highlighted, especially in single-family housing has been a big part of it. And then the other part, and Russell mentioned this, is just the low inventory levels across the system. So, what we've seen is average prices for April, $30 above first quarter average, and current prices are $10 above the April average, so it has continued to go up. And as we said based on the low inventories, the strong demand, we are very encouraged by what we've seen on the ground in terms of lumber demand and the opportunity for pricing going forward. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. And then just following up on the outlook for Wood Products, you talked about 2Q EBITDA being significantly higher than 1Q. Is there any way you can put a finer point on that or quantify that versus previous years? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Russell mentioned it, you can go back to second quarter of 2013 as kind of a comparable period. The reason \u2013 the other thing, Anthony, and the reason we laid out the price and the detail that we did, you, of course, know the leverage. But in terms of, on an annual basis, every $10 increase in lumber is $40 million on an annual basis. Every $10 increase in OSB is $30 million on an annual basis. I should mention that we talked about lumber, but OSB prices have continued to improve as well, and current prices are up another $7 versus the April average in OSB. So, we try to provide you the leverage that we have to pricing, and I'll tell you on top of that, as you saw in the first quarter results, our Wood Products business is running, operating really well. And we anticipate that's going to continue as we move through the quarter. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Collin. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: First question for me. Just as far as acquisition opportunities from here, Doyle, can you maybe just touch on the final terms with the Twin Creeks JV? And, obviously, we've seen a few larger Timberland deals here announced in the last few weeks. Maybe just your take on the current acquisition environment. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, let me comment on the current acquisition environment and then I'll ask Russell to comment on Twin Creeks. So, in terms of the current acquisition environment, there continues to be a lot of interest in this asset class and, frankly, a lot of money chasing deals. As we've seen announced recently, there have been some deals that are happening. I would highlight on the West some transaction announced at $4,300 an acre and then in the South, of course, our Twin Creeks transaction at $2,150 an acre, and then I think I saw just last night CatchMark announced something at $2,000 an acre. So, I would tell you, as I've said, a lot of increased activity, a lot of interest in the asset class. And I would say, good values being paid for high-quality property. And, now, let me turn it over to Russell to comment on Twin Creeks. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, Collin, as we announced, we closed the Twin Creeks transaction on April 1. And that was a deal that was put together prior to the merger, obviously. And we delayed the close so that we could sit down with the investors and make sure that we'd structured it appropriately, given Weyerhaeuser's differences to Plum Creek. So, the real key items are, the property management agreement under the Plum Creek structure was 15 years. We've shortened that to three years under the Weyerhaeuser, as amended. And then the equity ownership dropped from 25% to 21%. Those are probably the two biggest items that changed in the transaction. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just, Russell, remind us on what can Weyerhaeuser buy for its balance sheet versus what has to have a first right of refusal to the JV? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Right. So, the acquisition right of first refusal is anything under $10 million, Weyerhaeuser can buy on its account. And that's primarily because those would probably be properties that are more adjacent to operations. Anything in between $10 million and $200 million first goes to the joint venture for a period of three years. And so, the remaining $400 million of cash available for acquisitions is completed. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Very helpful. And then I guess, Russell, just \u2013 I wanted \u2013 when the dust settles with the Fibers business and use of proceeds for that. I know in the prepared remarks you're referencing kind of a 3.5 times debt to EBITDA. But are you going to move any of those leverage targets up a little bit given the mix of businesses is going to be a lot more towards timber and less towards manufacturing capacity or what do you stand on that? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, was your question in relation to leverage ratios? Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Yes. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah, I would say that right now we're targeting to 3.5 times, we'll continue to move towards that over time. As we've mentioned, we issued short-term debt. We'll use sale of assets to reduce bad debt over time. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just one other follow-up on Anthony's question, just as it relates to the Real Estate business. I think, Doyle, you've suggested in the past may be 15% to 20% of the combined companies could potentially be Real Estate. Is that still how you're thinking about, again recognizing you're still relatively early in that review process? But would that be fair as we start thinking about 2017 to the comment that it's going to step-up materially? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's exactly right, Collin. We are still comfortable with that guidance of 15% to 20%. And as I mentioned, we anticipate real estate activity will ramp-up second half of 2016 and into 2017 to get us to that range. Every year won't be exactly that, but that's kind of a guideline as to what we anticipate the contribution from Real Estate will be on a go-forward basis after we complete the AVO process. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Perfect. Thanks, guys. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Collin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, everyone. This is actually John Babcock standing in for George. Just two quick questions for you. First on the EWP markets. Demand was a little better than we expected, and just wanted to get a little bit of a sense for what you're seeing in the market and ultimately how that might trend for the rest of the year? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, so we were encouraged by the demand in EWP in the quarter. I think that's primarily driven by the increase in single-family starts. As you very well know, that is by far the biggest driver of demand for EWP and with single-family starts being up 23% in the first quarter, that flowed through to our EWP business. And again, optimistic that housing is going to continue to improve, including an improvement in single-family starts, so that should bode well for EWP for the balance of the year. John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay, great. Thank you. And then secondly, just as the \u2013 with regards to the merger as a whole, as that gets under way, ultimately how do you expect that to impact the pace and trajectory of the operating improvements that you're targeting for the business? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, the key there, of course, is the OpEx targets for Timberland. And as we mentioned, we have raised those targets significantly. In 2016, the original target pre-merger was $20 million to $30 million for Timberlands. We have now raised that to $30 million to $50 million for 2016 to identify the early opportunities to deliver operational synergies, which are, of course, above the cost synergies. More importantly than that, though, we raised the multi-year target to $200 million. So that's an incremental $130 million above what we received \u2013 what we accomplished in 2014 and 2015. So, an additional $130 million that we think we will be able to accomplish over the next two to three years, as we put these two companies together and deliver bottom-line operational synergies. So, really excited about that opportunity. A lot of work going on currently to do benchmarking of the best of each company and start to identify opportunities to drive those operational synergies to the bottom line. So, excited about that as we move forward. John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Just a quick follow-up there, though. I mean with the merger kind of starting obviously in the first half here, do you expect that \u2013 the improvements for this year to be kind of back-weighted? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, let's talk about the two components just to be clear. So, there's cost synergies and then there's operational synergies. In terms of the cost synergies, as I've said, these are hard dollar cost synergies, as I've said in my remarks, we are highly confident that we'll meet or exceed the $100 million run rate that we laid out as a target. I'll tell you that will be somewhat lumpy, but it's not going to be all backend loaded, and we will report out on our progress on that on a quarterly basis as we move forward. As with \u2013 in terms of operational synergies, again, $10 million to $20 million additional on top of what we had already identified for Timberlands in 2016. And then I would say kind of as you've seen distributed kind of evenly over the next two or three years to get the balance of the operational synergies that we've identified as part of the merger. John P. Babcock - Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.: Okay. Thanks a lot, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thanks. Doyle, do you have much visibility into the split of export log business for the year between Japan and China? You talked about seasonality, so I'm kind of hoping you can give some sense of what you think the whole year might look like? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I would think the whole year, Mark, will be in line with kind of what we've seen historically. But let me give you just a little bit of color on what we're seeing in each of those markets currently. And then if that doesn't answer your question, we'll come back to it. But in terms of Japan, as we talked about, volume and pricing were both up in the first quarter. We think \u2013 and a little bit of that was pull forward for people being ready for an anticipated run up before the consumption tax increase. In the second quarter we think demand, because it was elevated in the first quarter, will be down a little bit in the second quarter and price will be down, flat to down slightly. China, encouraged about what's happening there. As you know, the inventories didn't build like they have over the last couple of years in the first quarter, so we anticipate both demand and pricing will be up in the second quarter. And then domestic, as we said, good demand, probably a little bit slightly lower prices in the second quarter. So, as you know in the slides, we break out the percentage of Japan versus China and Korea, and we wouldn't see any significant changes there as we move forward, although in the second quarter, we will anticipate as I just highlighted, China being a larger component. And maybe that continues for the balance of the year if China continues to accelerate in terms of demand like we've seen in the first and going into the second quarter. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Super. That's really helpful. Can I ask just one more question? Can you remind us how much of your OSB is currently going into your EWP business? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Mark, we're going to get back with you with that exact number. It's a small part of it, but I just don't know that number exactly off the top of my head, but we'll get back with you. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Fair enough. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just a couple follow-ups first. On the \u2013 just want to make sure I understand, so the cost synergy is the $100 million. Where will that be showing up? Will that be presumably in the various segments as well, primarily in Timberlands? But that is separate from the operational synergies? And I think you talked about being $130 million over a couple years. Is that correct? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : That is correct, Mark. It will show up in various places, but it'll show up in the segment and then we'll lay out a way for you to track it exactly. But more importantly than that, to your second point, yes, the additional OpEx amount that we've identified for Timberland is above and beyond the hard dollar cost synergies. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Completely different bucket. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then a second quick follow-up, also you'd mentioned 15% to 20% from real estate sales. Was that a reference to EBITDA? And are we talking kind of $300 million to $350 million or so expectations coming from real estate from an EBITDA perspective? Is that how we should think about that? Or was that a different reference? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. It was an EBITDA reference. And again, once this \u2013 we ramp-up, just general guidelines, 15% to 20% of overall EBITDA for the company would come \u2013 we would anticipate would come from the real estate business. Now, like I said, a lot of work to do and identify all of those opportunities, but just to give \u2013 we wanted to give some guidance of what we thought that number could be on a go-forward basis. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay, and then lastly, just understand kind of the expected pace on the share repurchase. I think you had indicated previously that you anticipated about $2 billion of the $2.5 billion would be done quite quickly \u2013 forget the exact terminology. Now, would you be just continuing to draw down on the term loan to execute on that, and then you pay all of that back when the pulp business gets sold? Is that how to think of it? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, Mark, you're exactly right. What we said is $2 billion of the $2.5 billion we would do on an accelerated basis. And I think we've shown that that's exactly what we're doing. Once that's completed, we'll kind of pause and reevaluate the timing on the additional $500 million. You're right, we'll draw down on the term loan and we will use the asset sales and whatever else; but asset sales in Twin Creeks, whatever, to pay down that debt \u2013 that short-term debt. Mark A. Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you very much. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. This might seem kind of silly to just focus on a small part of your portfolio, but with 320,000 acres in Uruguay, you only had $1 million in EBITDA? So is there something about the accounting that keeps the cash or the contribution in South America? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No, there's nothing that would keep cash in any given place, Steve. So, as we've said, as part of this, we're going to be evaluating our 13.2 million acres of Timberland and making decisions as to what we want the long-term portfolio to look like; with 13.2 million acres and no big tax in place, we have lots of flexibility. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah. I mean, I don't know how much managerial bandwidth it takes, but it's not a big contribution. And then switching gears, I assume that NORPAC and the Longview mill will also be sold. I'm just wondering, does that have any implications for your export terminal at the Port of Longview? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: No. That has no implications for that. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Okay, thanks. And one other quick clarification \u2013 maybe I need a hearing aid. I think Russell referenced Q2 2013, and you referenced Q2 2014 when you were talking about the Wood Products run rate? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: If I said Q2 2014 that was a mistake. The reference was to Q2 2013. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Great. It was a better quarter. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi. Thank you; and I know you guys have been working hard the last few months. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Chip. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : First question has to do \u2013 thank you \u2013 is with the pension income. I know \u2013 should that continue to be at the higher level that we saw in the first quarter at roughly, I think, it was $9 million per quarter for the whole year? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. I think on the pension income we're expecting a little improvement in 2016. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And so at the same \u2013 should it be similar in the second, third, and fourth to the amount you showed on unallocated items in the first quarter? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. That would be our expectation. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Okay, that's helpful. And then on the depletion side, I know you said something about $90 million. When I look at the first quarter of 2016 versus 2015, it was up about $37 million. Are you saying it should be up year-over-year therefore by \u2013 are you saying depletion should be up $90 million or EBITDA should be up $90 million from \u2013 which is probably saying the same thing, since EBIT is going to be flat. But I just want to make sure I had that progression right for Timberlands? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So the depletion and amortization for the second quarter will be $90 million and that's a fair number to use through third and fourth quarter also. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then how about the depletion for the real estate segment in the second quarter? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : You can probably look at what the first quarter was like as a pretty good guide. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Even though your real estate sales will pick up a little bit? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Second quarter they will probably be similar to first quarter, and then pick up in the second half of the year. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay, got you. And then next question has to do with the \u2013 I think Doyle mentioned the real estate sales would be ramping to eventually around a $350 million EBITDA level sort of a target out there. Should we see that \u2013 is 2018 a realistic year that you think you'll get there, or is that pushing it too soon? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that's pushing it to too fine a point, Chip. Again, we're right in the middle of the AVO process. Again, what we wanted to do is just give some guidance as to the potential magnitude of the real estate business at 15% to 20% of the overall EBITDA for the company. We're going to learn a lot more as we go through this process. So, we'll be further refining that in terms of the timing as we move forward. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And last quick one, the business you just announced you sold to IP, is that going to be reported as a normal segment until it's sold or are you going to split it out as a discontinued operations, or have you figured that out yet? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : The pulp business will be asset held for sale, so it would be a discontinued operation starting in second quarter. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Oh, okay, important. And so when you give us adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EPS, you will not include the income from that business? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Correct. You'll be able to see it in our presentation, so you can run your calculations. Clyde Alvin Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. Thank you. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Chip. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, we have time for one additional question. Your final question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russ. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. Doyle, I have a couple of portfolio questions. I think one of them you've answered already, and that is just, any potential portfolio repositioning within the Timberlands, maybe concentrating more going forward on plantations in the South and in the Northwest? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. As I mentioned, Mark, as part of the integration process we're going to \u2013 it's going to involve a review of the overall Timberlands portfolio. And again, as I mentioned with 13-plus million acres and no built-in gains tax we've got lots of flexibility as to how we create the most value for our shareholders going forward. So, that work is ongoing. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, and is it fair to say that the focus is going to be kind of plantation forestry, Doyle? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I don't want to exclude anything at this point, Mark. Let us do the work and figure out exactly what we want the portfolio to look like as we move forward. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then the second one I had is just kind of on capital allocation going forward, particularly thinking about what your business investment focus is going to be. You're selling the Cellulose Fibers business. That was clearly a forestry-related business that had a good cash return. And if I look over at kind of Plum, historically, they had invested in a limited scale in things like gravel pit participations, which looked like they were lower return businesses and not forestry-related. So, if we think kind of going forward, are there any bounds you would want us to kind of think about in terms of where you'll put capital and where you won't put capital? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Well, Mark, as you know, we've done a lot of work here at Weyerhaeuser over the past few years to really focus our company. And as we say in where we're headed, we're going to the premier timberland and forest products company going forward. So, I wouldn't \u2013 I think, as you see us, first and foremost, we're going to focus on delivering the value from the Plum Creek merger. As we look to invest going forward, Mark, I would tell you, it's going to be focused on those areas. We do not anticipate moving into other areas \u2013 or non-forest-related areas in any significant way. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. That's helpful. Good luck in the second quarter and through the balance of the year. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Mark. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call... Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I'm sorry. Go ahead. Operator : I'm sorry. Please go ahead. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I was just going to say, as I understand it, that was our final question. I want to thank everyone for joining this morning. Thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser and we look forward to continuing to report out our progress as we move forward. Everybody, have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc. Operator : Good morning. My name is Ginger, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Company's Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I will now turn the call over to our host, Beth Baum. Ma'am, Please go ahead. Elizabeth L. Baum - Director- Investor Relations : Thank you, Ginger. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales from continuing operations of $1.7 billion. Second quarter results include after tax earnings of $38 million from discontinued operations and $11 million of after tax charges for merger and legal expenses. Results for our entire Cellulose Fibers segment are reported as discontinued operations. Excluding discontinued operations and special items, we're into $130 million or $0.17 per diluted share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA from our continuing operations was $413 million and this represents an improvement of $77 million or 23% compared with first quarter results. I'm proud of our second quarter operating performance. Our teams continued to execute well and deliver solid operating results including Wood Products strongest second quarter in over a decade. In the quarter, we also announced the sale of our pulp mills and liquid packaging board facility for collective proceeds of $2.5 billion or approximately $1.8 billion after tax. Closed the Twin Creeks transaction receiving $440 million in cash and in transaction value and 260,000 acres of Southern Timberlands at $2,150 per acre. We purchased over $830 million worth of our common shares, and made strong progress on merger integration and activities as we work together to successfully integrate Plum Creek and fully capture the cost and operational synergies that will drive superior value for our shareholders. Before I turn to our second quarter business results, let me make some brief comments about the housing market. Single family housing starts continued to grow at double-digit rate, and year-to-date activity remains in line with our expectations. Through June, single family starts had improved 15% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis, and total US starts were up 8%. Although supply side constraints such as skilled labor, permitting delays and fees and rising land and construction costs dampened the market's acceleration during the second quarter, solid economic fundamentals including job growth and historically low mortgage rate continued to drive improving housing demand. We continue to anticipate approximately $1.2 million housing starts for 2016 in line with consensus estimates. Let me now turn to our business segment. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $125 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA for Timberlands increased by $21 million to $220 million. Non-cash depletion and amortization costs increased by $25 million following a full quarter of higher depletion rates, resulting from acquisition accounting. Western Timberlands contributed $114 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $118 million in the first quarter. Western fee harvest volumes increased but average realizations for Western logs declined modestly primarily due to a greater proportion of sales to domestic and Chinese markets. As anticipated, sales volumes to Japan declined in the second quarter as first quarter post forward (05:01) demand in advance of a scheduled consumption tax increase which was later delayed. Pricing for our Japanese logs moderated slightly in the quarter. Volumes to China rose due to seasonally higher construction activity and average log realizations were essentially flat. Log inventory to Chinese ports were a little changed during the quarter and remain at normalized levels. In western domestic market, log supply and demand remained balanced during the quarter. Average realizations declined slightly due to mix and per unit logging cost increased seasonally as second quarter harvest includes a greater proportion of higher elevation white wood. Southern Timberlands contributed $99 million to the second quarter EBITDA, $22 million more than the first quarter. Southern (05:51) increased by 40% due to a full quarter of Plum Creek operations. Realizations for Southern logs declined slightly due to mix, as second-quarter sales included a higher percentage of pulp wood. Silviculture and forestry costs increased due to catch-up on first-quarter activity and has been delayed due to wet weather. Northern Timberlands' EBITDA improved slightly compared to the first quarter. The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million operational excellence targets for 2016. During the quarter, internal benchmarking teams completed an initial survey of operational synergy opportunities and prioritized areas with the greatest potential value. A deep-dive comparison of each company's practices in the highest-value areas is under way. We are pleased with the progress to-date and look forward to capturing these opportunities later this year and into 2017. Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $12 million to second quarter earnings compared with $15 million in the first quarter. EBITDA for the second quarter totaled $28 million. For Real Estate, the number of acreage sold declined slightly due to the timings of transaction closings. Average price per acre increased as second quarter included the sale of a high value parcel in Cannon Beach, Oregon. EBITDA from Energy and Natural Resources operations improved slightly. Our Real Estate team is running full out as they apply a concrete to asset value optimization or AVO process to the legacy Wayerhaeuser Timberlands. This work is proceeding well, and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in early 2017. We expect real estate activity will ramp up significantly in the fourth quarter of this year, and into 2017 as this process moves toward conclusion. Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $156 million to second quarter earnings, an improvement of 80% compared with first quarter. By effectively capitalizing on improving market and ongoing operational excellence initiatives, the business delivered its strongest second quarter since 2005. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $189 million, $72 million more than the first quarter. EBITDA from lumber grows to $96 million. This is an improvement of $45 million or nearly 90% compared with first quarter. Average realizations improved nearly 10% and sales volume increased by 8%. The business also had another strong quarter operationally. Western log costs declined and recovery improved and manufacturing costs net of logs decreased due to the continued benefit of operational excellence initiatives. OSB contributed $43 million to EBITDA, $12 million more than the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased 12% and our mills continued to run well. Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased to $45 million, $14 million more than the first quarter. Sales volume rose due to seasonally higher demand and a full quarter of Plum Creek, MDF and plywood operations. Average realizations for solid section and (09:27) declined slightly due to mix. In Distribution, EBITDA rose $5 million compared with first quarter due to improved sales volume, higher margins and ongoing cost control. The business have increased EBITDA about $14 million year-to-date against the 2016 full year target of $15 million to $20 million. Late in the third quarter, we announced changes to improve the profitability of our Montana wood product operations. In the third quarter, we will permanently close the lumber and plywood mills in Colombia Falls. These moves will allow us to align the available logs supply with our manufacturing capacity including adding shift at our Kalispell facilities and best position our Montana operations for long-term success. Wood products remains relentlessly focused on OpEx initiatives and is on track to achieve its 2016 target. During our first quarter earnings call, we indicated we thought the second quarter Wood Products results could be comparable to second quarter of 2013. A time when we were just beginning our OpEx journey and lumber and OSB pricing were significantly higher than it is today. In fact, we've exceeded second quarter 2013 EBITDA by $23 million despite the fact that average lumber realizations in the second quarter were $35 per 1000 (10:46), lower than three years ago and average realizations for OSB were more than $90 per 1000 (10:53), lower than they were in the second quarter 2013. This overall improvement highlights the significant contribution, operational excellence is making to our business results. I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 11. As I previously mentioned, beginning this quarter our entire Cellulose Fibers segment has been reported as discontinued operations This includes results from our pulp mills, liquid packaging board facility, and a printing papers joint venture. Discontinued operations contributed $52 million to pre-tax earnings compared with $29 million in the first quarter. Average sales realization for pulp and liquid packaging rose compared with the first quarter. And sales volumes for liquid packaging increased. Maintenance and energy cost declined slightly. Second quarter results also reflect accounting changes resulting from the reclassification as discontinued operations. Non-cash depreciation expense decreased by $23 million compared with first quarter due to a requirement to seek depreciation on asset held for sale, and corporate overhead expense previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers is now reported in unallocated items. This change affects both current and prior periods. These expenses total approximately $9 million per quarter or approximately $35 million on an annual basis. The effect of these accounting changes was largely offset by charges associated with the strategic review process and other transaction expenses. Yesterday, we received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance in the US for the announced sale of our pulp mills to International Paper. We continue to make progress, remaining regulatory approvals, primarily competition clearance in several foreign jurisdictions. We anticipate closing the transaction in the fourth quarter. Similarly, we have received Hart-Scott-Rodino clearance for the sale of our liquid packaging business and continue to progress with remaining approvals. We expect to close the liquid packaging transaction in the third quarter. The process for our premium paper joint venture is proceeding well. We are actively working with prospective buyers and we will update you when that review is complete. I want to thank our Cellulose Fibers' employees who are maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering strong results throughout the strategic review and sale processes. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items, and our third quarter outlook. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in slide \u2013 chart 14 of the earnings slides. For Timberlands, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will decline slightly or roughly 5% compared to the second quarter due to seasonality and lower export prices. In our Western Timberlands operations, overall, we expect harvest volumes to be similar to second quarter levels. Although Japanese housing activity remained strong, we anticipate crisis will soften as markets adjust to the delayed increase in the consumption tax. In China, seasonally slower construction activity and continued currency headwinds will result in lower sales volumes and moderately lower pricing. Domestic log volumes and prices are expected to remain stable. Operating conditions throughout the Western region have been favorable as the risk of fire has been low. Western logging costs will be seasonally higher in the third quarter as summer weather allows us to shift harvest activities to higher elevations, which have a higher percentage of cable logging and longer haul distances. In the South, fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than the second quarter but on a lower grade mix as third quarter activity typically includes a higher percentage of a thinning volume. Silviculture and road spending will also be seasonally higher. In the North, third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the prior quarter. Note that second quarter harvests are the lowest of the year because of logging and hauling limitations due to spring breakup, or as we like to say in the Northern Woods, the mud season. We expect average sales realizations will be similar to second quarter levels. In Real Estate, and Energy and Natural Resources segment, we expect significantly higher earnings and adjusted EBITDA from real estate sales during the second half of the year. Nearly all this improvement will occur in the fourth quarter. Third quarter real estate activity will be primarily focused on continuing work on the AVO process, in building our inventory of higher and better used properties. We expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly compared to the second quarter, but the mix of real estate sale is slightly heavier to higher basis lands. In the fourth quarter, we expect EBITDA will be more than double the third-quarter level as the first results of AVO assessments in the portions of the US South are taken to market and begin to move through to closing. The Wood Products, inventories throughout the supply chain remain tight as buyers continue to only purchase product to meet their immediate needs, which has been pushing lumber and OSB pricing higher as we enter the third quarter. We're anticipating comparable sales volumes and continued strength in lumber and OSB pricing in the third quarter as housing starts, especially single family, continue to improve and builders move into the late summer building season. We expect to see continued solid performance in Engineered Wood Products. Overall, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the Wood Products segment will be considerably higher than the second quarter. Lumber and OSB prices improved throughout July. If prices stabilize at current levels for the balance of the quarter, the segment is on track to improve EBITDA and earnings by roughly 10% compared with second quarter. However, we believe there's continued upside for both lumber and OSB prices and anticipate earnings could exceed this level. Now, let me direct your attention to chart 10 which details the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $1 million, $9 million lower than the first quarter results, which included a $13 million gain on foreign exchange. Note that unallocated corporate function expenses now include approximately $9 million of costs that were recorded in Cellulose Fiber segment prior to the discontinued operations reclassification. Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $485 million, up $74 million from the first quarter. Cash flow from operations including Cellulose Fibers was $492 million for the second quarter. This is an increase of $445 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. In addition to increased cash flows from Wood Products and Timberlands segments, we saw positive variance in our working capital due to the seasonal decrease in inventory levels quarter-over-quarter. Cash from investing activities was a positive $350 million for the quarter, as we received $440 million in cash proceeds from the Twin Creeks transaction, which closed on April 1. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $101 million, including $12 million of our discontinued operations. We expect 2016 CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $425 million, with Timberlands' capital spending expected to total $125 million for the year, and Wood Products' spending of approximately $300 million. Financing cash flows included $831 million for share repurchases, and $228 million for common dividends. As of June 30, we had drawn $1.4 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.4 billion, was $6.6 billion at the end of the second quarter. We intend to pay down the term loans for the proceeds from our recently announced asset sales. Interest expense of $114 million for the second quarter reflects a full quarter of interest for both the Plum Creek legacy debt and the new term loans. We expect interest expense will be comparable in the third quarter. For our continuing operations, the company anticipates the full-year tax rate will be between 18% and 20% based on the expected mix of REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary income. I'll wrap up with chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchases activities. Through the end of the second quarter, we have repurchased 58 million shares of common stock under our February 2016 share repurchase program at an average price of $29.18 per share. We have continued our repurchase activity during the third quarter and as of August 1, our cumulative repurchases totaled $1.98 billion or nearly 67 million shares at an average price of $29.45. The company did not repurchase shares during the period June 1 through June 28 because of the measurement period for our mandatory convertible preference shares. The mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares on July 1 at a rate of approximately 1.69 common shares per preference share. As a result, common shares outstanding increased by approximately $23.2 million shares subsequent to quarter-end. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, Russell. I will wrap up this morning with some brief comments on integration, synergy and SG&A. We continue to make strong progress on merger integration. I'm encouraged about the teamwork I see among employees at all levels as we work together to service our customers, identify best practices and implement improved processes for our merged company. We have fully identified the sources of the $100 million of hard dollar cost synergies. As of the end of the second quarter, we are capturing about one-third of these reductions on a run rate basis. I'm highly confident we will reach our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one. In addition to capturing merger synergies, we must address the $35 million of corporate costs, formerly allocated to the Cellulose Fiber segment. To ensure our businesses remain competitive, we will eliminate these costs just as we did following the divestiture of our Home Building business. We have been planning for the reductions as part of the strategic review process, and anticipate eliminating these costs within 12 months after closing the International Paper transaction. In closing, I will mention that the move to our new Seattle headquarters remains on track for mid-September. I'm also pleased to announce that we will be holding an Investor Day in New York on Tuesday, December 13. We will send out the details in a press release later this morning. At that meeting, we will provide specific updates on progress against the key targets for our merged company, and you will have an opportunity to hear firsthand from each of our business leaders about their key initiatives as we work together to drive superior value for our shareholders. And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Please go ahead with your question. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Good morning. Timberlands \u2013 as you think about 3Q in the South, I think you talked about softer price mix. If you take the impact of mix shifts away and you just look at same product prices. I was wondering what you're seeing in July and August. Are prices just flat or you're seeing any kind of improvement in Southern log prices? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Now, Anthony, what we're seeing is if you take it \u2013 and you're thinking about it exactly right on what I'd like to say, an apples-to-apples basis, prices we anticipate will be essentially flat in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. And I guess, what do you attribute that to? I mean, presumably lumber mills can pay more for fiber and housing starts are growing double digits. Is there just too much inventory out there? Why aren't log prices improving or inflecting as I think some of us thought that they might now by now? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Anthony, and the question, and we've all talked about it is as what is the inflection point where you see significant improvement in pricing. And we remain confident, as housing continues to improve as you said, as additional lumber capacity comes online in the South we remain confident we're going to hit that inflection point based on where supply and demand reach equilibrium. And at that point, well, we believe we'll start to see Southern log prices begin to return to the levels they were prior to the recession. However, we don't think we're going to see that in the third quarter. We're set to wait as we move forward to hit that inflection point. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. Okay. And then, just in Wood Products, you mentioned the Columbia Falls announcement and adding shifts elsewhere. Was Columbia Falls \u2013 will it end up being kind of net neutral from a capacity standpoint? And then just generally, if you could talk about your Wood Products footprint. Are you adding capacity with the increase in starts or how should we think about for the year? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So for the year, Anthony, overall, we're running our facilities close to 95%, 96% 97% operating rate due to these good markets. So, you always have a percent or two of Creek (25:46), but we don't anticipate adding any significant capacity in the near term. Columbia Falls net-net, you will have lower capacity but higher profitability. As we stated when we announced that, the reason for that move was to align the available fiber with the productive capacity, and by doing this, we are able to run the remaining mills full out with additional shifts, which will ensure the long-term success of our Montana operations and improve the overall profitability of our Montana operations on a go-forward basis. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc. (Broker): Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos from Bank of America. Please go ahead with your question. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. How you doing? Doyle, first question in Wood, obviously, very strong result, better than your guidance. As we look out the next couple of quarters, where do you see the most cost pressure? And you're doing a great job on SG&A relative to the revenue base in the business. That's obviously part of the program at Weyerhaeuser, but where do you start to see some tension here? How long can you hold the line here within Wood? And then I had a couple of follow-on questions on SG&A. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: In terms of cost pressures, George, at this point in time, we don't see any significant cost pressures now. It all runs up, you clearly would have some freight cost pressures and people continue to anticipate that happening at some point, but in the near term, don't see any significant cost pressure. We'd love to see some cost pressure from a log perspective, but not seeing that as we just referenced in the near term. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Yeah. That was part of the question behind the question. The second question I wanted to get into is on Engineered Wood. It sounds like from your commentary that you're pleased with the performance there. And looking at the slide deck, if I thought correctly, we've seen price is drifting a bit lower. If that's correct, what's driving that? Is it again lack of cost push? Is it perhaps somewhat more competitive markets? Single-family starts are obviously doing well, which you would think would be beneficial for Engineered Wood supply, demand and market trend. So, how would you frame that for us? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So, what I would say from a pricing perspective, a big part of that slight downward pressure we've seen is just having to do with mix. As we move forward, George, I would say that there are some price increases. Or a price increase that will be playing out in the West, but a portion of that price increase will be offset by some pricing pressure in the East as you have the dealer consolidation and all the different things that are happening from a customer perspective overall. But going forward, we would anticipate prices would be flat to maybe up slightly. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then the last one if, again, we did our math right. Again, you've done a very good job on SG&A over the last number of years across the businesses. If I look at Timberland, if I look at Real Estate & ENR versus year-ago levels that ratio has ticked up a bit. Obviously, some of that's probably just mixed in Plum Creek. Again, can you help frame what the opportunity there is for cost reductions in the next couple of quarters as you come out of 2016 and head into 2017? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you, George. And the way we look at these cost reductions is pretty straightforward. We say, what was the SG&A and R&D for both combined companies in 2015, and as we said, our goal, and we're confident in reaching that goal, it's about the first quarter of 2017, we will be at that run rate. So, we're modeled \u2013 we're as you would anticipate, George, we're on top of that. We know exactly where we are. We've identified the source of those synergies, and we're starting to realize some of it, more to come as we run through the balance of this year and into early next year. But that's the way we're monitoring it to make sure it does, to your point, in fact, show up on the bottom-line. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay, Doyle. Thank you. Good luck in the quarter. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Collin Mings from Raymond James. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Collin. How you doing? Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good. Good. A few questions here. First, just maybe big picture, talk a little bit more or update us on how you think the softwood lumber negotiations are going to play out, and just kind of your update as far as thoughts if no deal is reached in the standstill period, comes and goes without a deal. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. And as you know, we are very actively involved with and aligned with the position of the US Coalition, and there is an ongoing dialogue between the Coalition and our US Trade representative. I do believe participants send from both sides are interested in a resolution. And I'm frankly encouraged the governments \u2013 each of the governments are continuing to have discussions. As you know, this is a really important issue for Weyerhaeuser, and we remain hopeful that an agreement can be reached prior to the deadline. But we're prepared to move forward if that doesn't happen in follow trade days (31:21). That's kind of where we are. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks for the update there. I think, one thing as far as in the prepared remarks, roughly you talked about CapEx, the $425 million. I think that's down from a comparable $450 million, I think, that's what you had got it to earlier. Is that right? And, maybe, what caused the change there? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes, it's correct. We did lower our CapEx spend. We brought it down a little bit on the Timberlands side as we look at the combined operations for the Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser. We've just refined that number as we move into the second half of the year. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then just thinking about some of the commentary around the expected ramp in real estate sales, maybe just talk a little bit more about order of magnitude, what you're think in the fourth quarter could be as far as the amount of step-up. Again, I know, we talked on prior calls about the overall ramp showing up more in 2017, but just from a modeling standpoint, how should we think about the fourth quarter? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Collin, as we look at the third quarter, we'd expect the third quarter to be pretty similar to the second quarter. And then again, as we bring more of the AVO (32:27) properties into the market and we started ramping up that program, you would expect the fourth quarter to really increase probably double the third quarter volume. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. That was very helpful. And then just one last one and I'll turn it over. Just going back to Anthony's question on Wood Products. How much of your EBITDA is generated from Canada operations at Wood Products? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Collin, I don't know that number exactly off the top of my head, we'll follow up. But most of our revenue is generated out in the US, although Canada is an important part of our overall Wood Products operation. So, I'll have to get back \u2013 we'll get back with you on that. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, guys. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russ. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Russ, is it possible to get a go forward look at annual harvest volumes in the South and in the West? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : As we have guided to our total year volumes, we're at about 40 million tons to 42 million tons. So, as you look at our harvest volume to-date, and then you can extrapolate out to what you think the third and fourth quarter will look like, but we don't provide specific guidance for the volumes on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And is there likely to be a difference between what you'll do, say over the next three to five years in terms of harvest volumes, and then what you might define as kind of long-term sustainable? It seems to me both Longview and some of those (34:13) properties offered opportunities for accelerated harvest in the near years. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: So, Mark, what I would tell you is, as you would anticipate, we're spending a lot of time updating our strategic harvest plans for the combined land base. So, we're right in the midst of that, so we'll give you some \u2013 in the future, we'll give you some look at how we think that'll play out in the time horizon that you just laid out. We're right in the middle of that process currently. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. And then, Doyle, can you just give us something of what you're expecting from Japan over the next couple of quarters? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. So, Japan has been interesting in terms of how this consumption taxes has played out in the second quarter. As we talked about, the volume s down due to the latest consumption tax and prices decline. In the third quarter, Mark, our best guess is that volumes will be kind of flattish. And prices could be down slightly again as consumption tax plays out and also from the competition from the European laminators due to the strong dollar. And then as we look in our crystal ball and the crystal ball isn't always right, but as we look in our crystal ball for the fourth quarter, we would expect some rebound in prices in both Japan and China. That's kind of how we see it playing out. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. And then, final question, just when we think about the SLA, Doyle, is it \u2013 would we be correct if we think the sort of the biggest issue for you guys in how this plays out is really the impact and sort of value of timber coming off of your Southern and your Western Timberlands? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: There's no doubt, Mark, that that is an important component of getting the SLA right on a go-forward basis. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): But if we get tougher restraints, could we see you actually increasing the amount of capital you'd put in the saw mills? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. Mark, as you know, we have an ongoing \u2013 a game plan to \u2013 that we've shared with you and others about the capital that we'll be spending in our Wood Products operation on a go-forward basis to make sure we're positioned well, to fully capitalize on the upturn and get our costs to where they need to be. So, spending capital in our Wood Products operation at about the $300 million level that we've done over a past year or two, we think is going to be the right level, at least in the near term going forward. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Thanks, Doyle. Good luck. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Yes. Thank you, and good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Good morning, Chip. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : So first question \u2013 a couple of just accounting things. One is, I know that when you sold the Cellulose business, and congrats on getting that approval, they at least said that the EBITDA in 2015 was $350 million. And I'm just wondering, would that have really been $386 million or does that $350 million not include that corporate cost number for them? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Chip, I'm not \u2013 that $350 million is really based on their calculations and based on their models. And so, while we did see that number, you definitely want to look \u2013 we're reporting up to the point of where it's going to be out of our system. I really can't comment on how they came up with that particular number. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : So, that's what, it was for 2015? But I guess another way to ask the question is if I look at last year's EBITDA, as you reported it for the segment, then obviously about $36 million of the EBITDA would've been $36 million higher without these corporate cost allocations, is that fair? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. That is correct. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. And then the second question is, I know \u2013 I believe it's just typically the case, but when you make it a discontinued operations, I believe the number you present in your slide includes all the cash costs, but not depreciation. In other words, you said that it made $52 million, but that, I would assume, does not include depreciation or does that bear any depreciation, or for that matter, any interest expense? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yes. So we \u2013 there's $23 million of depreciation associated with that that was \u2013 we stopped, mid-quarter. If you looked at prior quarters, it would be about \u2013 the equivalent would be about $38 million of depreciation. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. So, you actually had $38 million per quarter going into the second quarter, but then you did $23 million in the second, and it'll be zero in the third. Is that fair? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Correct. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just a more broader question, thanks for those details, is when you look at Eastern Canada, I've been hearing that \u2013 and I don't think you guys are terribly active there, but as you think about the lumber market, it seems like Eastern Canada, I'm hearing that their harvest or their growth of timber has actually come back in recent years and that there would be more activity there in lumber and perhaps even plywood, but lumber in particular. If there is any market for off take, OSB plants or pulp mills. And do you agree with that? In other words, do you think that you could see potential supply, leaving aside any kind of trade issues, coming from Eastern Canada or do you think that's not likely? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Chip, I would say, at least from our standpoint, it's in the not likely category. We have not seen what you're referencing and don't think additional capacity or additional capabilities are going to be available in Eastern Canada. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : And would you say it is fair in the Eastern half of the country, I'm not so sure about the West part of the continent that your residuals can often by a very material percentage of your profit? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: That's a \u2013 it's an important part. That's right. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners : Understood. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Thank you. Doyle, is it safe to say that with the better lumber prices and very successful asset sales that you're feeling pretty good that Weyerhaeuser has addressed the rating agencies issues and that at this point, you've got room to execute on your buybacks the way you want to rather than to make them happy. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. Mark, this is Russell. We definitely spend time at the rating agencies to make sure that they understand our deposition and our EBITDA generation. And we're very comfortable with where we're at with the rating agencies and our current investment grade rating. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: And Mark, as you referenced the share repurchase \u2013 we have, as we said, we were going to do it on an accelerated basis. We've essentially completed the $2 billion in, I guess, less than six months and did it in what we think has been a attractive value from our shareholder perspective of less than $29.50 per share. So, pleased with the progress that we've made on the share repurchase. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : That's super. And just one quick comment or question on the log realizations. We've heard that smaller land owners in the South had been more aggressive. Do you think that's one of the reasons why we haven't seen log prices keeping up? Or is that not as widespread as we're hearing? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: I think that is a component of what has happened on the log pricing. Small land owners, you never exactly what motivates them or when they bring things to market. But clearly there, we have seen some of that happening over the past year or two. Mark Connelly - CLSA Americas LLC : Okay. Thanks very much. Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC: Hi. Good morning. A quick question... Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Hi, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC: A quick follow-up on the buybacks. If I remember correctly, it was initially going to be $2 billion of the $2.5 billion was going to be accelerated, and I'm just wondering if you could give some perspective on your approach to that remaining $500 million? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC: Will that be also accelerated or more opportunistic? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. So, you're exactly right, Gail. What we've said is that the authorization for the $2.5 billion, if we will do $2 billion on an accelerated basis, and as I just mentioned, we have essentially completed that. We've also said consistently that once we do, we'll take a pause and we'll work closely with our board to determine the timing of the additional $500 million. So, that's what we'll be doing. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC: Okay. This might be a little off the wall, but (43:14) used to talk about trying to build an export market out of the South? And is that something, an effort that you're continuing, and what your view would be from that, on the long-term? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Sure. We are, as you would anticipate constantly evaluating our markets and the way to grow markets. As you also know, the South is very small in terms of export market currently, but we'll continue to look at opportunities as we move forward, and we think that market will in fact develop over time. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC: Okay. And just one last one, yesterday, your partner with some of the development plans, and around the Carolinas is talking about an accelerated monetization. And I was just wondering if you could give some perspective on how that might affect Weyerhaeuser? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah. So those are the joint venture partnerships that Plum Creek entered into. And we have been in discussions with them, and we're aware that they're seeking to do an accelerated program to divest to some of those properties. Given that's a joint venture, we treat that as equity accounting. We'll see the benefit of that as they execute on that plan. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research, LLC: Okay. Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just wanted to follow-up on the real estate, and the stepping up of activity there later this year and into next year, is that primarily going to be on legacy Weyerhaeuser lands or would we \u2013 should we expect it to be a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek? Because obviously the Plum Creek land presumably were stepped up, but the Weyerhaeuser lands haven't been. Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : So, Mark, this is Russell. We'll see a mix, but we may see some more Plum Creek lands coming in, in the third and fourth quarter, which will result in a little higher bases because of that step-up. As we look at the combined portfolio, obviously, we're focused on getting to the Weyerhaeuser lands through the AVO process. But in conjunction with that, we're looking at all the opportunities on the combined portfolio. And it really does provide us with a lot of optionality as far as which lands to bring to market. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then, shifting gears a little bit, but any kind of big picture thoughts on how you'll be going about the dividend recognizing you had a lot of improvement in your Wood Products business. It's kind of underlying earnings there. Yet, Timber has maybe been a little bit slow to see the price improvement in the South. How \u2013 what might be a kind of a helpful way of thinking through how you'd be approaching the dividend at this point and if it's changed at all as your mix of businesses have changed quite a bit in the last year or so? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yeah, Mark. As you know, we're committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. 2016 is going to be very noisy as we continue to move forward and lots of moving pieces. As we look into 2017, we're going to continue to benefit from cost and operational synergies, continued OpEx improvements, strong housing market, all those types of things. We will be spending time with our board as we move forward to figure out exactly how to think about the dividend on a go-forward basis with the mix of assets that we now have with the much more stable earnings stream that comes from Timberlands and then the improvements that we've made in our Wood Products to take some of the volatility out of that, and most importantly probably to eliminate some of the downside in our Wood Products operation on a go-forward basis. So, all things that would be factoring in to what the appropriate level of our dividend is on a go-forward basis. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And one last one if I could, the tax rate guidance, 18% to 20% I guess a little higher than I would have anticipated. And maybe, what one question would be, does the interest expense \u2013 can that get allocated to taxable \u2013 the taxable REIT subsidiary or does some of that actually run through the \u2013 not get that benefit? Russell S. Hagen - Chief Financial Officer & Senior Vice President : Yeah. So, Mark, we're guiding the 18% to 20% for our full year tax rate. As far as the allocation of the interest expense between the taxable REIT subsidiary and the REIT, we actually have debt that is associated with taxable REIT subsidiary. So, that's allocated and tax effected accordingly. And then, there's debt associated with the REIT assets. So, you'll get a blended rate. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. I'll circle back. Thank you. Operator : That is all the time we have for questions today. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks? Doyle R. Simons - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director: Yes. Thanks everybody for joining. As indicated, that was our final question, and I'd just like to close by thanking everybody for their interest in Weyerhaeuser. Take care. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participating. At this time, you may now disconnect.",

At this time, I'd like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser's Third Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations, you may begin your conference. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Ginger. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the earnings material on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $227 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Our third quarter results include after tax earnings of $65 million from discontinued operations and $10 million of after tax charges for merger related expenses. Excluding these items, we earned $172 million or $0.23 per diluted share. This is an improvement of over 30% compared with second quarter and over 40% compared with a year ago. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $434 million, an improvement of $21 million compared with the second quarter. Our employees delivered strong performance in the quarter, as operating results improved across each of our businesses with Timberlands driving increased EBITDA through merger synergies and Wood Products achieving its highest third quarter earnings in 12 years. However, these results reflect only some of our quarterly achievements as we also closed the sale of our liquid packaging board business, completed the move to our new corporate headquarters in Seattle and completed our commitment to a $2 billion accelerated share repurchase. I'm proud of what our teams accomplished and the pace at which they continue to operate as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Third quarter housing activity was roughly in line with our expectations and we are anticipating nearly 1.2 million housing starts for 2016 in line with consensus estimate. Although total housing starts for September were weaker than expected, the headline number was driven by the volatile multi-family sector. Single-family starts have continued to grow at a favorable pace. Through September, single-family starts are up approximately 10% compared with 2015 on a seasonally adjusted basis and low inventories of homes for sale reflect continued steady demand. As we enter the seasonally weaker fourth quarter, we're encouraged by the strength of some timber permitting activity, new home sales and continued solid builder confidence. Although constraints such as skilled labor permit delays and fees and rising costs for land and construction maybe functioning as a governor on supply side growth, rising employment and wages and favorable mortgage rates continue to drive improving housing demand. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts three to five. Timberlands contributed $122 million to third quarter earnings and $223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA increased about a $3 million compared with the second quarter. Western Timberlands contributed $109 million to third quarter EBITDA compared with a $114 million in the second quarter. Western fee harvest volumes decreased and average log realizations were largely flat. Sales volumes to Japan improved moderately during the quarter, as low mortgage rates continued to drive strong housing activity and the effect of the delay in the consumption tax increase continue to fade. Average realizations for Japanese logs declined slightly early in the quarter, but stabilized as the quarter progressed. Sales volumes to China decreased due to timing of shipments and a slight seasonal decline in demand and average realizations decreased modestly. Log inventory to Chinese ports declined during the quarter and remain within a normalized range. Western domestic markets remained solid during the quarter and pricing for domestic logs improved marginally, as some markets were tensioned by fire related harvest restrictions and increased mill demand. Western logging costs benefited from operational excellence initiatives during the quarter. Although we anticipated a seasonal increase in per unit logging cost due to the harvest on higher elevation stands, crews were able to mitigate this cost increase through new harvesting technology that improves productivity on steep slopes and reduces the need for the highest cost cable logging operations. Southern Timberlands contribute a $108 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million more than the second quarter. Seasonally higher log sales volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher silviculture and forestry costs and a 1% decrease in average log price realizations. This decline was partially attributable to mix as third quarter harvest included a slightly higher proportion of pulp wood. Southern logging cost benefited from operational synergies with merger integration progress enabling further optimization of logging and hauling activities across the combined ownership. Northern Timberlands' EBITDA improved $3 million compared with the second quarter. Seasonally higher volumes were partially offset by weaker realizations and seasonally higher road and forestry expense. Subsequent to the end of the quarter, we announced a strategic review of our Uruguay operations. This review will enable us to ensure that we're best positioning the business for long-term success and maximizing value for our shareholders. We look forward to providing further information after the review is complete. The Timberlands business remains relentlessly focused on capturing operational excellence and synergies, and is on track to achieve its $30 million to $50 million target for 2016. Internal benchmarking teams are rolling out their initial best practices that resulted from comparing a subset of high-value activities at each company. We are pleased with the progress to-date and look forward to continuing to capture the benefits later this year and into 2017. Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, chart six and seven. Real Estate and ENR contributed $15 million to third quarter earnings, compared with $12 million in the second quarter. EBITDA increased by $9 million to $37 million. Real Estate EBITDA increased by $7 million. Average price per acre declined slightly as we sold a greater percentage of lower value Northern acres compared with the second quarter. Contribution to earnings increased minimally due to a proportionally higher land basis as the northern properties are legacy Plum Creek holdings that were marked up to fair value in acquisition accounting. Our Real Estate team is making strong progress as they applied Plum Creek's asset value optimization process to the legacy Weyerhaeuser Timberlands. Work began first in the U.S. South and that process is entering the latter stages. As we wrap up portions of the Southern analysis, the focus will turn to the West. Work remains on track and we continue to anticipate the process will be substantially complete in the first half of 2017. Wood Products charts eight and nine. Wood Products contributed $170 million to third quarter earnings, an increase of $14 million compared with the second quarter. These earnings are the strongest since third quarter 2004 when we operated roughly twice the number of manufacturing facilities we do today. Adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter totaled $203 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled to $85 million. Average realizations increased less than 1% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes decreased slightly due to downtime for capital projects and weather. Log cost for Canadian mills increased primarily due to weather and Western log cost were also higher. EBIDTA for OSB increased to $63 million, an improvement of over 45% compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations increased 7%. Operating performance was very strong and the business benefited from operational excellence initiatives to reduce spending on controllable manufacturing cost, wax and resin. Engineered Wood Products contributed $43 million to EBITDA compared with $45 million in the second quarter. Sales volumes for Solid Section and I-Joists increased modestly and average realizations were flat as improved pricing in the West was offset by slightly lower Eastern realizations and a weaker product mix. EBITDA for distribution declined slightly to $7 million, primarily due to a seasonal shift in products mix. The business remains focused on improving margins and lowering costs. Year-to-date, Wood Products earnings have nearly doubled compared with 2015 and operational excellence has made a meaningful contribution to that improvement. The Wood Products segment has made good progress on this year's OpEx initiatives, and remains generally on track to achieve this 2016 target. I will now turn to discontinued operations, chart 11. Discontinued operations, which was formally our Cellulose Fibers segment, contributed $65 million to after-tax earnings in the third quarter. This includes an after-tax gain of $41 million on the sale of our liquid packaging board business, which closed on August 31 for gross proceeds of $285 million. Excluding this gain, net earnings from operations declined $14 million compared with the second quarter. Maintenance expense increased significantly and pulp production declined due to additional scheduled maintenance outage days. This was partially offset by higher average sales realizations for pulp, primarily due to mix. On October 4, we announced an agreement to sell our printing papers business to One Rock Capital Partners. This completes the strategic review of our Cellulose Fibers business announced in November, 2015. Both this transaction and the sale of our pulp mills to International Paper are on track to close in the fourth quarter. I'm proud of the contribution our Cellulose Fibers employees have made to Weyerhaeuser, and I want to thank them for maintaining their focus on operating safely and delivering a superior customer experience throughout the strategic review process. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA will increase slightly over the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate harvest volumes will be lower than third quarter levels. However, we expect sales realizations will increase modestly in each of our export markets as housing activity remains strong in Japan and Chinese demand remains solid. Domestic log sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase slightly in the fourth quarter, as a result of steady domestic demand and seasonally lower available log supply. Western logging costs will continue to benefit from the results of our operational excellence initiatives. Southern harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher than third quarter. Minerals have adequate log inventories entering the fourth quarter and average sales realizations are expected to be flat quarter-over-quarter. Silviculture and road spending will be seasonally lower in the South during the fourth quarter. In the North, fourth quarter harvest volumes will decrease seasonally from third quarter levels, as third quarter is typically the best operating quarter of the year. Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings for the fourth quarter are expected to be slightly higher than the third quarter, while adjusted EBITDA will be about double from third quarter results. It is important to note that the real estate sales include a mix of legacy Weyerhaeuser properties and Plum Creek properties. And that the Plum Creek properties have proportionally higher basis, because they were marked to fair value in the purchase price allocation. This results in lower earnings when these properties are sold. For Wood Products, we expect lower demand due to seasonal decline in building activity. Channel inventories remain lean as buyers purchase for immediate needs. We expect lumber sales realizations in the fourth quarter will be flat to slightly down compared to third quarter levels. We expect OSB prices will decrease, giving back much of the third quarter gains. Engineered Wood Products prices are expected to be similar to the third quarter. We anticipate seasonally lower sales volumes across all product lines in the fourth quarter, and a slight increase in manufacturing costs, as a result of the holiday season, and scheduled downtime to complete maintenance and capital projects. Overall, we expect fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA and the earnings for the Wood Products segment to be seasonally lower than the third quarter. We do however, expect adjusted EBITDA will be nearly double the fourth quarter of 2015. Moving on, chart 10 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items was $5 million, $4 million higher than the second quarter. As a reminder, unallocated corporate function expense now includes about $9 million of expenses, previously allocated to Cellulose Fibers. On October 31, our partner in the Southern diversified timberland venture redeemed our interest. Following the redemption, Weyerhaeuser now holds all of the equity interest and consolidates the timberland venture as a wholly-owned subsidiary. As a result in consolidation, the investment was eliminated and the note payable to the timberland venture has been classified as intercompany debt. At the end of the second quarter, the investment in the timberland venture was $825 million and the note payable was $830 million. These items no longer appear on our balance sheet as of September 30, for financial reporting purposes. Chart 12 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $769 million, an increase of $284 million from the second quarter. This is higher than our targeted cash level and we expect the balance will decrease as we pay down the term loans with proceeds from previously announced Cellulose Fiber asset sales. We expect these sales will close by year-end. Cash from investing activities during the quarter, included $285 million from the sale of the liquid packaging board business. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $129 million, including $29 million for our discontinued operations. CapEx for our continuing operations will be approximately $200 million in the fourth quarter, $150 million will be for Wood Products which typically has a highest capital spend during the fourth quarter. Financing cash flows for the quarter included $231 million for common dividends and $11 million of preferred dividends, which represent the last dividend payment on the mandatory convertible preference shares. During the quarter, we drew an additional $300 million on our term loan. And as of September 30, we had drawn $1.7 billion of the $2.5 billion available under the term loan facilities. Long-term debt, not including the term loan balance of $1.7 billion was $6.6 billion at the end of the third quarter. Interest expense was $114 million in the third quarter. We expect interest expense will be similar in the fourth quarter. For our continuing operations, the company now anticipates the full year tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the expected mix of 2016 earnings between the REIT and the taxable REIT subsidiary. I'll wrap up with chart 13, which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During the third quarter, we repurchased 10 million shares of common stock for $306 million completing our post-merger goal of repurchasing $2 billion of our shares on an accelerated basis. Overall, under the $2 billion accelerated program, we purchased a total of 68 million shares of common stock at an average price of $29.49 per share. On July 1, the mandatory convertible preference shares converted to common shares, as a result of the conversion, the company issued approximately 23 million shares. We ended the quarter with about 748 million shares outstanding. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Russell. I'll wrap up with some brief comments on merger synergies and integration. We continue to implement the changes necessary to achieve our $100 million hard dollar cost synergy target. As of the end of the third quarter, we have achieved about two-thirds of these reductions on a run rate basis. I'm highly confident, we will meet or exceed our $100 million run rate cost synergy target by the end of year one. We've also fully identified the sources of reductions for the $35 million of costs formally allocated to Cellulose Fibers and are on track to eliminate these costs within one year of closing the International Paper transaction. The integration with Plum Creek continues to progress well. Working together will be the foundation of our success and I'm encouraged by the team work I see within and between the businesses and functions of our merged company. I'm excited by what we've achieved and where we're going, and I look forward to continuing to share our successes with you as we work together to drive value for shareholders, through a focused portfolio, industry leading performance and disciplined capital allocation. And now with that, I'd like to open the floor for questions. [Operator Instructions] Operator : Your first question comes from Anthony Pettinari from Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi. Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Doyle, I had a question on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, earlier this year there seemed to be some optimism \u2013 a new agreement would be negotiated. And over the past couple of weeks we've had U.S. legislators and the Canadians issuing statements, saying the other side isn't serious. I was wondering if you were surprised by the lack of an agreement at this point and kind of where we stand here, and with the exploration of the standstill period, I guess the U.S. Lumber Coalition has talked about initiating trade cases and to the extent that you're able, I was wondering if you could give us any thoughts on that process. Doyle Simons : Yes, Anthony as we previously said, we're very actively involved with and fully supported of the U.S. Coalition, and frankly, we would prefer the certainty of a negotiated agreement and hopeful that one will be reached. And as you mentioned, the governments are having ongoing negotiations and those are pretty fluid right now. With that said, as we've said consistently, any agreement would need to be consistent with the objective identified in the Obama-Trudeau joint statement, which is to maintain Canadian exports at or below an agreed U.S. market share to be negotiated. So, where we are now, I think is ongoing negotiations, but if no agreement is reached, we would expect a petition will be filed soon and then, we'll see how it plays out from that point forward. So, that's kind of where we are in the approach we're taking. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then, just switching gears to Wood Products. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the pricing environment in engineered Wood Products? I think there were some price initiatives on the table earlier this year, and in 3Q, prices seem to be flattish to maybe down a little bit. I was wondering if you could just talk about the forces that are impacting that market and kind of outlook for 4Q? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So, there are a lot of moving pieces in the pricing for EWP currently. To get to your second part of your question, we anticipate EWP prices will be essentially flat in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Regarding the price increase, the price increase that went into place within the West in the second quarter and third quarter that was successful, but was offset by some pricing pressure in the East. As you know, Anthony, there's been a lot of dealer consolidation in the Eastern markets and a lot of jacking around has occurred in those markets. So, up in the West, down in the East, which has resulted in the net pricing that we saw in the third quarter, we think that's stabilized and anticipate essentially flat prices in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Hey. Good morning, everyone. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire : Just wanted to follow-up on the Wood Products, obviously a really strong quarter, like you highlighted in the prepared remarks [indiscernible] year-on-year. But it seemed like it could have been maybe even a little bit better if lumber margins had been closer to where they were in 2Q. And I know you mentioned maybe some downtime and weather-related issues. But just wondering if you could dig into that a little bit more and talk about the margins in lumber and where they might be headed from here? Doyle Simons : Yes, so I think, there were three things that impacted our lumber results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. And as you mentioned we had a strong second quarter in lumber, but three things in the third quarter. One was we had slightly lower sales volume. Two, as you mentioned, lower operating rates that was due to weather and some downtime for installation of some capital projects as we continue to invest capital in that business to drive down our overall cost structure. And then third and the most surprising one for us that log cost increased in Canada, that was weather-related, and as you may know Canada has been very wet this year and as a result having to spend additional dollars to get wood to the mills, so that had an impact. And then also we had higher log cost in the West, that's consistent with what we reported in our Timberlands operation. So those both higher log costs in Canada and the West impacted our margins and results in the third quarter versus the second quarter. Going forward, we would anticipate as we said, lumber prices in the fourth quarter to be essentially flat to maybe down just a little bit in fourth quarter versus third quarter. Brian Maguire : Okay. Great. And then just a follow up one on the Real Estate segment in the fourth quarter. I know you said, you'll be about double in the EBITDA. Is that the start of maybe a trend higher here as you're getting through the process of evaluating everything, can we start to think about it being somewhere closer to that neighborhood and where you've been historically or is there just some lumpiness in it and then we're kind of back to lower levels in 2017? Russell Hagen : Brian, this is Russell. On the Real Estate as we mentioned, we expect fourth quarter to be double the third quarter, and then we would expect that trend to continue as we work into 2017, and work through our AVO process, and really start bringing some of the Weyerhaeuser properties in through the Real Estate program. So as we've indicated, our target for the Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resource business is at 15% of total EBITDA, and so I would expect that in 2017, we will start moving towards that target. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks very much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the George Staphos from Bank of America Merrill. George Staphos : Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for the details. I want to... Doyle Simons : Good morning, George. George Staphos : How are you doing, Doyle? I wanted to dig into Wood Products a bit further. Can you comment at all \u2013 maybe provide a few more details in terms of where you stand with being \u2013 as you've termed to black at the bottom, I know we'll get more color probably in December on this, but what other initiatives do have going on or where you stand in terms of the \u2013 are you \u2013 you're certainly not a 100% done, but where you stand in terms of being done on that project? And the related question was on operational excellence you said, as you were talking about Wood, if I heard you correctly that you're generally on track, now that's fine. But I kind of took your comments, as maybe there were some areas that weren't progressing quite as well as you'd like, if that was a correct assessment, where do you need to see some accelerated pick up? And then I had a couple of follow-ons either way. Doyle Simons : Okay. So, George, to your point, we will be talking about both of those issues extensively in our December investor presentation, which we're looking forward to. But let me give you a sense on both of those. In terms of black at the bottom, as you know and we've talked about consistently over the past two years to three years, that has been our focus, in terms of our operational excellence initiatives, driving down our cost, the capital that we're spending, and we've made a lot of progress on that front. As you said, we're not there yet. But I would say, we're 60% to 70% of where we need to be, maybe even a little more than that in terms of getting our cost structure where we're black at the bottom. And as we've said before, what we measure that against is what happened back during the recession in the 2007, 2008, 2009 type timeframe. So, a lot of progress made there, more work to do. In terms of generally on track, George, I wouldn't over focused on the, generally. I would say, we are on track, in terms of our OpEx initiatives, still I guess, three months left in the year. So, didn't want get up over our sleeves, but again, we will give you a report on that in December but \u2013 and very pleased at the progress we're making in our Wood Products operation and frankly also in our Timberland operation, in terms of delivering against our OpEx targets for 2016. George Staphos : All right. Thanks for that, Doyle. Two last ones and I'll turn it over. As we think about value return and the dividend, certainly the company has done a very, very good job of returning value to shareholders over the last couple of years, so this is not a complaint. As we think forward for the dividend, should we more or less think about it trending with the realizations that you can get in Timberland, in terms of what drives the next level of \u2013 if there's anything left for that matter of a sustainable pickup in the dividend growth rate? And then, just Russell, on the term loan, should we expect that you will be paying that down pretty quickly from here on a going forward basis? Thanks, guys, and good luck on the quarter. Doyle Simons : Thanks for those questions, George, and I'll address the dividend increase and then, I'll ask Russell to answer the term loan question. So, in terms of the dividend, again as we've said it consistently, we are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. 2006 is a very noisy year, as we all know as we do these various transactions, but looking into 2017 as we think about it, we're going to benefit from our cost \u2013 continue to benefit from our cost and operational synergies, continued OpEx improvements and what we believe will be stronger housing markets. To your point, we're also going to benefit from a portfolio perspective, from a much more stable earnings streams for Timberland. And as we just talked about improvements made in Wood Products cost structure to eliminate some of the downside. So with all that said, we'll be working very closely with our board to determine the right level of dividend going forward. And Russell, if you'll address the term loan question. Russell Hagen : George, as I mentioned, we have $1.7 billion drawn on the term loan as we start closing on the Cellulose Fibers transactions, we'll start paying that down, so we would expect that to be paid down hopefully by year-end or soon around that time. George Staphos : Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from Chip Dillon from Vertical Research Partners. Chip Dillon : Yes. Good morning, Doyle and Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Chip. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Chip Dillon : First question is, I might be mistaken, but I think you're earning maybe more than 100% of the cumulative profits in the engineered wood business, that's quite a turnaround. And I really seriously wanted to ask you about, with these kind of some numbers and looking at the rest of the industry and it looks like you're not necessarily transferring raw materials in low, so how are you doing it? Is it because of the distinctiveness of some of your products or would say that maybe it is being vertically integrated or maybe there is something else that we're missing? Doyle Simons : Yeah. I would not attribute it a much of it Chip to being vertically integrated. I would attribute it to all the things that we've been working on now for two years or three years starting to fall to the bottom line in terms of log recovery, controllable spend, preventive maintenance. Chip you've heard us talk ad nauseam about, it's the basic blocking and tackling. And I think, we're starting to see the benefit of that hitting the bottom line. And the other part of it, as you mentioned is kind of the products that we bring to market and the additional value that we give for some of those products. So I think it's a combination of both, but I think really the reason for the improvement that we've seen over the last two years or three years have primarily been driven by just basic blocking and tackling in that business. Chip Dillon : And I suppose, it's safe to say, it's no longer sort of in the category that you put it in when you had first Investor Meeting with us? Doyle Simons : Chip, I'm happy to say that it is no longer in that category. I think that business has proven the right, to be part of our portfolio on an ongoing basis. Now you constantly got to earn that right, but that business as you highlighted, and I appreciate you saying it, has made a dramatic turnaround in terms of bottom line performance. Chip Dillon : And then just a couple of quick ones and turning it over \u2013 before turning it over is, could you update on what you \u2013 and you might have mentioned this, what you see CapEx at this year? And I know it's early, but directionally where should it go next year? And then lastly for Russell, I know there is roughly a $600 million tax bill tied to the sale of the Cellulose business, does that tax actually get paid in cash sometime in 2017? Russell Hagen : So the first question on CapEx, as we've indicated, we're focused on about $425 million CapEx this year, a $125 million in Timberlands and $300 million in Wood Products. I think next year we expect around that general amount maybe just a little more in Timberlands as we bring in the combined Plum Creek and Weyerhaeuser properties. As far as the tax bill on CF, we would expect that to be paid hopefully again by year-end, but possibly in the first quarter. Chip Dillon : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Gail Glazerman from Roe Equity Research. Gail Glazerman : Hi. Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Gail. Gail Glazerman : I assume this is baked into your guidance. But can you talk about any impact you had from Hurricane Matthew either in terms of your operating facilities or your timber operations? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So, yeah, we're fortunate, Gail, from the hurricane perspective that we had minimal damage to our Timberlands operations due to the hurricane a couple of days or maybe a little few more that we were kind of out of the woods in the Atlantic region, but very minimal damage. In terms of \u2013 from a Wood Products perspective, we had some production loss as you would expect at our Atlantic mills, we had some minor water damage to some finished lumber, but nothing that's [Technical Difficulty] (34:32) financially. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And going back to Softwood Lumber Agreement, can you just give a little bit of color on how it's affecting your conversations with customers, and how they may be preparing forward as they look out to the building season next year? Doyle Simons : I mean clearly, there's some uncertainty regarding the Softwood Lumber Agreement and how it plays out, Gail. But I wouldn't say it's affecting the way our customers are thinking about their ongoing business. And, in fact, customers continue to be \u2013 especially homebuilders continue to be very optimistic about the demand that's out there in terms of new home sales and just underlying demand for new houses. So, it's a minor part of our conversation, it's not a major part, but our customers continue to be optimistic for the balance of 2016 and into 2017. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And just one last one. Can you give any sort of color on the export markets, particularly maybe some of the competitive dynamics in terms of logs from Russia, and New Zealand, or even some finished Wood Products from Europe going into Japan, just what you're seeing, and how that's been trending? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So, let's talk about that, and bottom line is we're encouraged by what we see in the export market currently. From a Weyerhaeuser perspective, we anticipate that \u2013 from \u2013 in Japan, which as you know is our most important market, that pricing will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, due to steady demand and lower log supply that always happens in the fourth quarter. We think volume maybe down a little bit, but that's just going to be due to timing and the way the shipping worked. In China, we continue to see a solid demand, anticipate higher prices in China in the fourth quarter, and encouragingly inventories actually came down a little bit in third quarter versus the second quarter. They are currently at 3.38 million cubic meters, which is down from where they ended at the second quarter. In terms of just overall views on it, we've seen a slight increase in imports into China from Russia, but nothing significant, and New Zealand seems to have kind of stabilized. So, that's what we're seeing overall in export markets. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And in terms of European competition in Japan with finished goods? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So, that's the challenge that our customers face is Glulam that comes in from Europe, currencies have not been helpful from that perspective. But the good news in Japan is housing is growing 6%, 7%, 8%, and our customers continue to have very good demand for our Doug Fir which is used of course to build houses. And these solid logs or solid lumber is a preferred building material post and beam construction. Gail Glazerman : Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Wilde from BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : Doyle, first question. It sounded from your comments like maybe the AVO process was going a little bit slower than expected. You said you expected to have it substantially done by the end of the first half of next year, I think initially we've been talking about it sort of by late this year, very early next year? Doyle Simons : No, Mark, I wouldn't say it's slipped. Our focus has been on the South. And as I said, we are in the process of wrapping that up. Currently, we're in the latter stages of it. We'll then be moving to the West, and it may take us into the second quarter to complete it in the West. But I would actually tell you it's going very well. Our biggest opportunities as we said all along are in the South, so we're pleased that we're wrapping that up. And as Russell mentioned, I think we're going to start to really see the benefit of that in early 2017, as we move forward with this process. So, I would categorize it is right on track. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. That's helpful. And Doyle, can you give us a little bit more color, background on the Uruguay announcement? And then, if you were to dispose that, what you would likely do with the capital? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So Mark, as we previously mentioned, as part of this merger integration, we've been in a review of all 13-plus million acres of our timberland. As you know, Uruguay is a project that was started back from the ground-up back in the mid-1990s and is just now really coming into maturity. Our focus going forward is going to be primarily domestic and we think there may be an opportunity to position Uruguay with what I would call a more natural sponsor that maybe more focused on those markets going forward. In terms of what we'll do with the cash, as you would anticipate Mark, we'll run that through our capital allocation priorities as we do everything and figure out the best use of that cash to drive value for our shareholders long-term. Mark Wilde : All Right. And Doyle just if I could, the one other kind of block of land that seems like a little bit of an outlier is these kind of Northern Timberlands in New England, and the Great Lakes, they're not plantations. It's a little different business than what you have in the South or the West, any thoughts there? Doyle Simons : Mark, I would answer that this way and consistent with what we've said before. We're in the midst of a review of our overall timberland portfolio with 13-plus million acres that we now have, we have lots of flexibility as to how to create the most value for our shareholders, so we'll be factoring all that in, as we move forward. Mark Wilde : Okay. Last question I had Doyle is just, back on the SLA one more time. I am just curious, from your perspective it seems to me that we're likely to have a more protectionist administration, no matter who is elected come January. And I am just curious about whether you share that view? And whether you think that's having any effect on sort of the negotiations right now? In other words, are the Canadians perhaps more interested in getting something done with this administration rather than waiting to see what they get come January? Doyle Simons : Yeah. Mark, I would say, I don't think the election is currently having much effect on the negotiations. And in terms of predicting what in the hell may happen in this election or what the implications of that maybe is probably not somewhere that I should go or I'm qualified to go. So, we'll see how the election plays out, but we are encouraged, Mark, at this point about the negotiations that are going on between the government and we'll just have to wait and see how this plays forward? Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. Sounds good. Good luck in the fourth quarter and into next year guys. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Mark. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Connelly from CLSA. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Doyle, two things. Obviously the step up in basis affects the real estate profit that you report. But it doesn't mean that the sales are any less attractive. Can you give us a sense of whether these were higher or lower than average quality sales? Russell Hagen : Mark, this is Russell. I think on the call, as we mentioned a lot of those transactions were in the Northern properties, it's not that they weren't lower quality, it's just lower price per acre than you would see in the West or in the South. Mark Connelly : Okay. Doyle Simons : But Mark, you're exactly right on your first comment that \u2013 yeah that doesn't mean they're not quality sales just because they were written up. So thank you for making that point, that's exactly right. Mark Connelly : Yeah. Russell, what I was really trying to get at is relative to what you do in the North, was this pretty typical stuff? Doyle Simons : Yes, I think those are typical transactions that you'd see in the North. Mark Connelly : Okay. That's helpful. And then just one simple question. How much of higher OSP prices that we saw in the quarter actually hit engineered Wood Products in the quarter? I'm just trying to get a sense of how fast that flows through. Doyle Simons : About $2 million impact in the quarter Mark. Mark Connelly : Perfect. That's all I need. Thank you very much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from Collin Mings from Raymond James. Collin Mings : Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Collin. Collin Mings : I guess, just first one, just recognizing you're taking a pause right now, [indiscernible] Cellulose Fibers sale is being finalized. Just maybe update us on how you're thinking about the remaining $500 million under the share purchase reauthorization, again, especially here with the stock at 30 box or so, not too terribly different than kind of the average repurchase prices of $2 billion that you completed this year? Doyle Simons : Yeah, Collin as you'll recall when we announced the merger with Plum Creek, we said at that point in time that we were going to do $2 billion of the $2.5 billion on an accelerated basis. And as you just alluded to, we completed that actually in a little less than six months. We also said at that point in time, when we announced it, that subsequent to that, we would take a pause and work closely with our board to determine the timing of the additional $500 million, see where we were on our Cellulose Fibers transaction and a lot of other factors. So we're in that pause period, we will work closely with our board to determine what the timing is going to be on the additional amount. And as you alluded to, where our stock is trading, will be an important component of that decision. Collin Mings : Okay. And then just following up on the commentary as far as the outlook for Q4. Just on Timberlands, you indicated that it would be up modestly relatively to 3Q, but could it actually be higher year-over-year relative to 4Q 2015, or is it likely to fall somewhere in between? Doyle Simons : Yeah. I'd have to go back and look at the 4Q 2015 numbers because as you very well know, Collin there is lots of moving parts with 4Q of 2015. We didn't have Plum Creek as part of the company. So, we'll have to get back with you on exactly that. But what I would say, as we said in the guidance, we do think it will be up in the fourth quarter versus the third quarter, and a big driver of that, as I mentioned earlier is what we're seeing in export markets. Collin Mings : Okay. And then, just one last one from me. Just as you're budgeting for 2017 and given kind of the lack of momentum clearly in log pricing in the U.S. South this year. I mean just curious how you're thinking about shaping up harvest activity for next year again recognizing, you're not providing guidance on harvest volumes at this point. But just how does that factor in Doyle? This is as you've referred to before just a stubbornly low log pricing in the U.S. South as you think about harvest plans? Doyle Simons : Yeah. Well, we are working on our harvest plans right now, Collin. As we put the two companies together, we think we're going to have the opportunity to maximize the harvest plan on a go-forward basis. As part of that, we will factor in what we think is going to happen with Southern sawlog prices. We do remain convinced that we are going to reach the inflection point where Southern sawlog prices are no longer stubbornly low, but start to head in the right direction. We're encouraged by what we see, as I mentioned earlier about continued growth in housing, and are also encouraged by some of the announcements we've seen regarding additional capacity coming online in 2017 in the South. So all of that will be factored in and we'll be providing more color on that as we move forward. Collin Mings : All right. Thanks, Doyle. See you in December. Doyle Simons : All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from Steve Chercover from Davidson. Steven Chercover : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I was hoping you could recap the dissolution of the timber joint venture, if I'm not mistaken, the counterparty was The Campbell Group, and I think, you said the debt in the note will negate one another. But is there any kind of capital call? And then I had a second question. Russell Hagen : Sure. So this is Russell. As I mentioned, we did dissolve that at the end of August. And when we did that, if you recall that was 450,000 acres in six states, it was a joint venture with The Campbell Group. They redeemed their interest and so we received the note back, distributed to Timberlands. There is a small gain in recognition at about $6 million, but there is no additional capital calls and there is no continuing ongoing obligation. Steven Chercover : Okay. Well, that's good news. And then I thought \u2013 and hopefully this is just a red herring that the IRS was challenging the structure and there was some discussion or litigation with them? Russell Hagen : So you're correct. So our 2008 \u2013 Plum Creek's 2008 income tax return is currently being audited. And as you recall Plum Creek, we appealed that to the IRS but we could not reach a resolution. And so recently Weyerhaeuser filed a petition in the U.S. Tax Court and as you are aware this will take a number of years to resolve, but we remain confident that in our position, we do expect a favorable outcome from the U.S. Tax Court. Steven Chercover : And I assume that Weyerhaeuser didn't put out a filing because it's not material, but can you tell us in a worst case scenario what the financial impact might be? Russell Hagen : Yeah. We're not going to \u2013 we won't do that. But we will say, I'll reiterate, we're very confident in our position and expect we'll get a favorable outcome. Steven Chercover : Okay. And it does failed to meet the test of materiality I assume? Russell Hagen : We've not reserved anything related to this. Again we're very confident that we're going to succeed in this. Steven Chercover : Great. Thanks, Russell. Russell Hagen : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from Mark Weintraub from Buckingham Research. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. A couple of follow-ons. First, going back to the dividend, the fact that there hasn't been an increase in 2016, you mentioned a lot of moving parts and there was also the question on share repurchase and you mentioned wanting to have the Cellulose Fiber sale done as well. Should one read the fact that there hasn't been a dividend increase so far this year? Is that because the way fundamentals have played out or is that because you would want to wait to see to get the asset sales done [indiscernible] before that would even be contemplated? Doyle Simons : Mark, as you would expect, we factor all of what you just outlined into a dividend decision will, as I mentioned, continue to work with the board to figure out what the right timing and what the right level is for a dividend increase as we move forward. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then in terms of the AVO process, you indicated that the Southern analysis would be done well before the Western analysis relatively soon. Will you \u2013 when that part of the analysis is done, will that be shared with the investment community or is the intent to wait until the whole analysis is concluded? Doyle Simons : Mark, as you would expect, we will be providing a significant update on that at our December Investor Meeting. So we'll tell you where we are, how we're thinking about it and how the South is playing out and maybe even preliminary kind of how we're thinking generally about the West. So all those details are still being fleshed out, but we will be giving a significant update at our December Investor Meeting. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Great. And then lastly, a real small one. But on the Uruguay, if you were to go forward with a sale, would that potentially be taxable or would that not be a taxable event? Russell Hagen : So, the Uruguay assets \u2013 this is Russell, the Uruguay assets are held in the combination of in the REIT and the TRS, and so, we would have some minor tax leakage. We really haven't gone into that point yet, but we would expect probably some tax leakage because of the TRS held that assets. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Doyle Simons : Thank you Mark. Operator : Your next question is from Paul Quinn, from RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Yeah. Thanks very much and good morning. Doyle Simons : Morning, Paul. Paul Quinn : Just a question on Wood Products. It looks like you did a very good job on the OSB segment a little bit \u2013 I don't know a little bit off versus our numbers on the lumber side. It looks like costs were up, I think you cited weather and capital projects maybe you could just outline what the capital projects you had in the quarter and how much of that was an effect on lumber cost? Doyle Simons : Yeah. So as we mentioned lumber was off basically for three reasons. One was this lightly lower sales volume, second one as you just alluded to was lower operating rates due to weather and downtime for installation of capital projects and then the third and the largest to try to quantify this, which I think is where you're headed, Paul was the log cost increase primarily in Canada, but also in the West as we mentioned earlier. So, the downtime for installation of capital projects went for any one big project as you know we are spending roughly $300 million a year in capital in our Wood Products operations. Some of that's maintenance capital, but some of it's also capital that we're putting in to drive down our overall cost structure and we just had a couple of those projects that hit in the third quarter and there will be more of those in the fourth quarter. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then I just had a question on Softwood Lumber, just trying to understand Weyerhaeuser's position on this. Without knowing quota levels or any kind of levels of taxation under CVD or AD duties, from a theoretical standpoint, what's better for Weyerhaeuser, a quota or a combined duty? Doyle Simons : Well, I would say, ultimately a quota is the best for all parties involved because it's simpler, it establishes what the levels is, there's a certain level of certainty. So what we would like to end up with Paul, as we have said along is an agreement rather than having to go through the legal system and having a quota in place, very simple quota in place that sets forth the amount of imports from Canada into the U.S. Paul Quinn : Well, thanks. That's all I had. Best of luck. Doyle Simons : Thank you. All right. Thank you. Operator : And there are no further questions at this time. Presenters, do you have any closing remarks? Doyle Simons : Yes. Let me make a couple of closing remarks. As I've already alluded to, I just wanted to remind everybody that we will be holding our Investor Day on December 13, at the New York Palace Hotel. We look forward to that, and we look forward to seeing many of you there. And I would just conclude by thanking everybody for joining us this morning, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : This does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for participating. At this time, you may now disconnect.",

My name is Brent, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Brent. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2016 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you Beth and welcome everyone. 2016 was a transformational year for Weyerhaeuser. Through our merger with Plum Creek and a $2.5 billion divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers business we became a focused timberland and forest products company and nearly doubled the size of our timberland holdings. In the midst of executing these portfolio changes, we maintained our relentless focus on performance.  In 2016, we increased full-year EBITDA by almost 55% to nearly $1.6 billion. We delivered the highest annual wood products earnings in over a decade. We captured merger cost synergies faster than expected and raised our 12 month run rate target by 25% and we achieved over $100 million in operational excellence improvements. Finally, we returned $2 billion of cash to shareholders through the repurchase of common shares.  For the full-year 2016, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of just over $1 billion or $1.39 per diluted share or net sales of $6.4 billion. These results include the solid fourth quarter performance I will highlight this morning. Our fourth quarter net earnings were $551 million or $0.73 per diluted share on net sales of $1.6 billion. This includes after tax earnings of $489 million from discontinued operations, primarily the gain on divestiture of our pulp mills and after-tax special charges of $44 million for a tax adjustment associated with repatriation of Canadian earnings following our Cellulose Fibers divestiture, merger related expenses, and some non-cash real estate impairments.  Excluding these items, we earned $106 million or $0.14 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter totaled $400 million. This is an improvement of over 60% compared with a year ago and represents substantial increases in each of our operating businesses. Before discussing our business results in more detail, I will make a few comments on the housing market. Single family housing activity continued a steady improvement in the fourth quarter. Single family starts rose 10% compared with the third quarter and ended up the year up 9% compared with 2015. Total U.S. housing starts finished the year at nearly 1.17 million, a 5% improvement from 2015. As expected, the single family share of activity increased during the year and multi-family activity remained volatile. For 2017, we expect single family housing starts to increase by over 10% and we anticipate total housing starts of approximately 1.25 million to 1.3 million.  Economic fundamentals support a trajectory of continued steady housing growth. Employment and wages are rising. Consumer confidence is strong, mortgage rates remain historically favorable, and public surveys indicate that builder confidence remained near historic highs. Although builders are managing through some constraints such as availability of skilled labor, stringent permitting requirements, and land and construction cost inflation, our customers echo the optimism seen in builder surveys and feel confident that housing market will maintain solid upward momentum. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with timberlands. Chart 4 to 6, timberlands contributed 123 million to fourth quarter earnings, 1 million more than the third quarter and 223 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western timberlands contributed $101 million to fourth quarter EBITDA compared with 109 million in the third quarter. Export log volumes declined due to seasonally slower construction activity and timing of shipments. Average realizations, however, improved moderately across all export markets as market dynamics remained favorable.  In Japan, housing activity remained solid with wooden housing start up 8% for the full year. Japanese lumber inventories which were elevated for much of 2016 after a delay in the consumption tax increase continued to decline to the seasonally slower construction period and are now at more normal levels. This created favorable supply demand dynamics and supported improved pricing in the quarter. Pricing for our Chinese export logs improved also. Fourth quarter log inventory to Chinese ports were largely flat with third quarter levels and we experienced continued strong takeaway throughout the quarter. In the Western domestic market, sales volumes were lower as mills took holiday downtime but average realizations improved slightly. Low mill inventories drove demand particularly in Southern Oregon market.  Our Western crews did a good job adjusting harvest plans to adapt to record October rainfall. Our fourth quarter harvest lines were unaffected by weather and we had no infrastructure damage. However, per unit logging cost and road spending increased compared with the third quarter due to the wetter weather. Moving to the South, Southern timberlands contributed 112 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, up 4 million compared with the third quarter. Southern markets remained flat as mills had adequate inventory, and average log realizations were largely comparable to the third quarter. The harvest volumes increased modestly as fourth quarter typically included a higher volume of stumpage sales. As in the West, our crew successfully flexed target settings to adjust to November severe weather and we had no material damage to our timberland.  Silviculture expenses declined as fourth quarter typically includes fewer site preparation and hardwood management activities. EBITDA for Northern timberlands totaled $7 million. This was unchanged from the third quarter on comparable prices and volumes. The strategic review of our Uruguay operations is proceeding well. We continue to see strong interest and look forward to providing further information when the review is complete.  Real estate, energy, and natural resources, chart 7 and 8. Real estate and ENR contributed $13 million to fourth quarter earnings. Excluding special items, the segment earned $27 million, $12 million more than the third quarter. EBITDA increased nearly two thirds -- let me start over, EBITDA increased nearly two and a half times to $90 million. Our average price per acre declined due to mix as fourth quarter included a large transaction in Montana where timberland prices are regionally lower. For the full-year 2016, we sold approximately 83,000 acres or roughly 0.6% of our land base. Fourth quarter special items included $14 million of non-cash impairments. These resulted from a change in strategy for several small legacy real estate projects that were formerly targeted for development. The asset value optimization work continues to proceed well. As we indicated during our December Investor Day, we have finished applying the AVO process across our Southern ownership and are in the process of listings in the 500,000 newly identified acres. Our focus has now turned to the West where we are evaluating our Washington and Oregon acres. This work is going very well and remains on track for completion by mid-year 2017. Wood products, charts 9 and 10. Wood products contributed $99 million to fourth quarter earnings. The business delivered full-year 2016 earnings of $512 million, the strongest annual earnings since 2005. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $132 million, $71 million lower than the third quarter primarily due to seasonally lower sales volumes and operating rates. Lumber contributed $57 million to EBITDA, $28 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes declined 12%, average lumber realizations decreased 2%, and Western log costs increased. Operating rates were lower and unit manufacturing cost increased due to planned downtime for installation of capital projects at several of our Southern mills. Heavy rains and regional flooding resulted in modest weather related downtime in some of our Western and Southern locations and higher manufacturing costs for our Canadian mills. EBITDA for OSB totaled $46 million, $17 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes declined 18% and average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Operating rates declined due to downtime for planned maintenance as well as repairs to our Sutton, West Virginia mill. As we previously disclosed, the Sutton mill experienced a fire on November 1st. This was an insured event. Repair activities progressed rapidly and successfully and the mill resumed full production around year-end. The net fourth quarter financial impact of this fire on OSB business was approximately $5 million, the amount of our deductible as we brought the mill up and received insurance reimbursements faster than expected. We anticipate no net financial impact from this event in the first quarter as modest repair expenses should be offset by reimbursements received within the quarter.  Engineered Wood Products contributed $26 million to EBITDA, $17 million lower than the third quarter. Sales volumes for Solid Section and I-Joists declined approximately 10% and operating rates were lower due to planned maintenance and holiday downtime. Average realizations increased modestly. EBITDA for distribution totaled $5 million, slightly lower than the third quarter. By focusing on improving product margins and tightly managing cost, the business performed well in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter. I will now turn to discontinued operations chart 12. We closed the sale of our pulp mills and printing papers business on December 1st and November 1st respectively. This completed the divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers segment. Net after tax earnings from discontinued operations of 489 million are primarily comprised of the gain on these two divestitures. Chart 13 operational excellence, as I mentioned in my opening remarks I'm proud that each of our businesses maintained its relentless focus on improving relative performance and delivered strong 2016 operating results throughout the merger integration process. Each of our business has met or exceeded its 2016 operational excellence target. Timberland has delivered 42 million of operational excellence improvements primarily from merger related operational synergies.  In Wood Products OPEX improvements included $16 million in lumber, $21 million in OSB, $12 million in Engineered Wood Products, and $15 million of EBITDA improvement for distribution. The benefits of these improvements are clearly visible on our bottom line. In total wood product EBITDA improved by almost $270 million in 2016 compared with 2015. A $41 per thousand square feet year-over-year improvement in our OSB realizations created a tailwind of $120 million and an $11 per thousand feet improvement in our lumber realizations provided a tailwind of approximately $50 million. The remaining $100 million improvement was largely attributable to nearly 65 million of wood products OPEX and the addition of the Plum Creek wood products mills. For 2017 we are targeting additional operational excellence improvements of $95 million to $125 million across our businesses. This includes $40 million to $50 million in timberlands, [Indiscernible], $20 million to $25 million in OSB, $10 million to $15 million in Engineered Wood Products, and $5 million to $10 million in distribution. I will now touch briefly on our merger cost synergies. We have been achieving our targeted cost synergies faster than anticipated. And as we mentioned in December the scope of opportunity has exceeded our initial expectations. We raised our cost synergy target by 25% to $125 million and remain highly confident we will achieve this full amount on a run rate basis by the end of first quarter 2017. We also remain on track to eliminate the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to our sale of fibers business no later than 2017 year end. I'll close this morning with a few comments on the softwood lumber agreement. Although discussions between U.S. and Canadian negotiators continued through the end of 2016 we have been unsuccessful in reaching an agreement. With the change in administration, negotiations are currently on hold while U.S. trade representative and Department of Commerce appointees are confirmed and take office. In the meantime the U.S. International Trade Commission and Department of Commerce have continued to evaluate the petition for countervailing and anti dumping duties filed by the U.S. Coalition at the end of November.  On January 6th the ITC unanimously determined that there is a reasonable indication that the U.S. has been materially injured by imports of softwood lumber products from Canada. The U.S. Department of Commerce is currently conducting an investigation that will result in a determination regarding preliminary duties. We expect the announcement regarding preliminary countervailing duties in late April with an anti dumping determination following in late June. Our preference remains for a negotiated agreement. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative and we look forward to resuming negotiations. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook. Russell S. Hagen: Thank you, Doyle and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter is presented in chart 16 of the earnings slides. In our timberlands business we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter. And our Western timberlands operations we expect increased log sales volumes and slightly higher average sales realizations in the first quarter primarily driven by higher export mix. Export volumes to Japan and China are expected to increase as a result of the timing of shipments and continued favorable demand.  Domestic log sales volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter as a result of continued stable demand. Western road costs will decrease due to lower road spending which is typical in the winter months. Southern harvest volumes are expected to be seasonally lower than fourth quarter level as a result of harvest timing in some of our southern markets. We expect average sales realizations for the first quarter to be similar to fourth quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South will be higher than in the fourth quarter as we perform more forestry activities such as competition control and fertilization during the first quarter of the year.  In the North we anticipate first quarter sales volumes will be slightly lower than the fourth quarter. But we expect average sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter levels. Real estate, energy, and natural resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter are expected to be slightly -- significantly lower from the fourth quarter as a result of the timing of our real estate sales, the first quarter EBITDA comparable to the first quarter of 2016. We typically close fewer transactions in the first and second quarters of the year as recreational buyer traffic slows during the winter months. The spring and summer months are the most active selling seasons with the largest portion of the sales closing in the second half of the year. We continue to expect over 250 million of EBITDA from our real estate and energy and natural resources business in 2017. As we discussed at our December Investor Meeting, we expect land bases as a percentage of real estate sales to be between 45% and 65% for the full year 2017.  For wood products we anticipate higher sales volume across all product lines in the first quarter as we enter the spring building season. We expect manufacturing costs will improve as our operating rates return to normalized levels following fourth quarter's decreased levels resulting from maintenance and capital project installations. Realizations remained relatively strong going into the fourth quarter as we did not experience the seasonal declines in wood product pricing that typically occur during the holiday season. We anticipate lumber and OSB sales realizations in the first quarter will be comparable to fourth quarter levels. Overall for wood products we expect adjusted EBITDA and earnings for the first quarter will be higher than the fourth quarter and will be roughly $50 million dollars higher than the first quarter of 2016. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. For the fourth quarter, the $31 million earnings experienced in unallocated items is driven by $20 million increase in non-cash charges related to LIFO inventory adjustments, profit elimination, and foreign exchange. Moving on to our retirement and pension plans, the year-end 2016 funded status of our defined benefit pension plans and post employment retirement plans decreased by $383 million compared to 2015 as a result of the decrease in the prescribed discount rate.  Discount rates decreased by approximately 20 to 30 basis points for both the U.S. and Canadian plants. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2016 and we don't anticipate any cash contributions in 2017. Cash paid for all other pension and other post employment retirement plans in 2016 was nearly $100 million which included onetime payments related to the Plum Creek merger. We expect cash payments in 2017 will be approximately $70 million. We expect to report approximately $100 million of noncash, unallocated pension and post retirement expense in 2017.  Chart 14 summarizes our key financial items. As Doyle mentioned we closed the sale of the Cellulose Fibers pulp mills on December 1st pursuant to U.S. GAAP to receive and use of cash proceeds from the sale are recorded in different categories within our cash flow statement. The 2.2 billion of cash proceeds from the sale is showing cash from investing activities. Immediately following the close of the sale on December 1st we used a portion of the proceeds to pay off the $1.7 billion term loan which you can see in cash flows from financing activities.  Finally, we paid $494 million of taxes related to the sale of our Cellulose Fibers mills in the fourth quarter which is recorded in cash from operations and results in the negative $151 million of net cash from operations. Excluding the cash taxes paid on the Cellulose Fibers sale during the fourth quarter of 2016, cash from operations would have been $343 million. Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of long-term debt. We have one scheduled maturity in August of 2017 for $281 million which we intend to repay with available cash. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $207 million including $22 million related to discontinued operations. Net of discontinued operations, capital expenditures for the full year 2016 was $425 million. Looking ahead to 2017 we expect total CAPEX will be approximately $435 million, $300 million for wood products and $135 million for timberlands. Interest expense was $108 million in the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense will be approximately $400 million in 2017. Our 2016 effective tax rate for continuing operations was approximately 18% slightly above our earlier forecast due to a tax adjustment reported as a special item in the fourth quarter in connection with the sale of our Cellulose Fibers business. For 2017 we expect the tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of our earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. I\u2019ll wrap up with chart 15 which provides some additional detail on our share count and repurchase activities. During 2016 we repurchased 68 million shares at an average price of $29.49 per share. There were no share repurchase activity in the fourth quarter and we ended the quarter with about 749 million shares outstanding. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons : Thank you Russell. I am proud of our 2016 achievements. We have transformed our portfolio, delivered strong operating performance, and taken substantial strides towards a successful and value creating merger integration. And in 2017 I'm very optimistic about the opportunities in front of us. We remain strongly committed to driving industry leading performance, capturing merger synergies, fully capitalizing on improving markets, and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation to drive superior value for our shareholders. And now I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Doyle R. Simons: Good morning Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : With regards to the CAPEX guidance, and I think you said 300 million for wood products. Is it possible to say if you're adding or debottlenecking capacity in lumber and OSB for the year and roughly what percent capacity growth you might anticipate? And then specifically with regard to the anti dumping duties which we might get in spring/summer, are you taking steps to rebalance capacity between the U.S. and Canada in your system? Doyle R. Simons: So let me start with your second question regarding the anti-dumping duties and we are not taking any steps to rebalance, Anthony. As we've talked about previously, if you look at our Canadian operation, about a third of our Canadian operation is sold -- of our production is sold in Canada, a third is sold in export markets outside the United States, and a third comes into the U.S. Overall, our Canadian lumber operations is roughly 20% of our overall lumber operations, so you take that 20% times a third it's not a big part of the driver for our lumber operation. In terms of CAPEX Anthony, the $300 million is in line with what we've done over the last couple of years, and our primary focus in our CAPEX in our Wood Products operation is low risk, high return projects that drive down our overall cost structure and that's been a key part of accomplishing our OPEX. With that said, some of those projects do in fact result in debottlenecking and additional capacity, and as we've also stated we are in the process of rebuilding two of our mills Dirk's and Millport, which have been really good mills for us historically. But, in order to significantly dive down the cost structure of those mills, we essentially needed to rebuild them in place and that will result in some additional capacity as well. But again, the primary focus is on the cost side where we will be increasing capacity as a result of some of the projects that we've put in place. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just regarding the real estate guidance for 2017, should we expect land sales to be weighted towards the South and maybe the North as you're still working through AVO in the West and if you could just talk generally about the demand you're seeing for timberlands and rural lands and if you could highlight any difference in demand between the West and the South? Russell S. Hagen: Sure Anthony, this is Russell. So as you know the real estate business is a little lumpy but getting through our AVO process in the South, and as Doyle indicated, we're starting to work through to bring some of that AVO work to market. So we identified the 500,000 acres and now we're starting to bring a portion of that into the marketplace. I would expect the activity to be weighted a bit to the South. We still have opportunities in North obviously and we will be looking at that. As we get through the AVO process in the West, we'll start looking at what opportunities there are to bring that to market. And as far as demand for the rural real estate, the South definitely has continued demand. There's a really strong recreational buyer activity in the South. We do have demand in the North obviously but it is a little different buyer, and it's more of a small plot, small timberland plot-type ownership. But we see good strong demand in the South for recreational properties. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks. Hi, everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the detail and congratulation on the progress. First question, I just wanted to double check something. I thought I heard you say Russell that the pension liability ultimately went up, I want to say something like $300 million, but you didn't anticipate funding being required this year. If I heard that correctly, could you discuss why and I think you also threw out a pension expense figure for this year but I did not catch that, if you could repeat that that will be great? Russell S. Hagen: Sure, so the pension liability or the pension \u2013 the funded liability was down $383 million and as far as the pension expense it did increase. And that's really a function of a couple of things. Well, the first is the return on the pension assets, so we did decrease our rate down from 9% to 8%, and then we have additional amortization pension loss. So that's really driving the increase. And that total on an unallocated basis is $100 million. And as far as the funding, you know, the funding requirements are really prescribed by GAAP funding and then IRS funding. So we don't have any funding requirements in 2017. George Staphos : Okay, thank you for the clarification there. Could you talk about what operating rates recognizing it's early in the year and a lot can change, what kind of operating rates do you think you'll be running at across the major wood products businesses? And then as it relates to distribution and engineered wood products, are you finding any opportunity to further marry those businesses and have them coordinate to a greater degree, as the -- and take share within the large builder pack market? Doyle R. Simons: George, in terms of operating rates, we are optimistic about demand as we move into 2017 for all of our products. So I would tell you there will be some seasonality as there always is, but I would anticipate lumber operating in the low to mid 90's, OSB operating in the low to mid 90's, ELP normally operates about 10% lower than that, so I would anticipate that being in mid 80's type range. But as I said, we are encouraged by what we're seeing in terms of demand. And as we talk to our customers, they are bullish on housing and increasing demand for all of our products in 2017.  In terms of the coordination between engineered wood and distribution, that's something that\u2019s here where we also have done a lot of work on. And I would tell you those two operations are working more closely together than they ever have historically. And that's been very beneficial in driving improvements in both our EWP and our distribution business and I think there will continue to be further opportunities for that coordination as we move forward. George Staphos : Doyle is there a way to size if at all what kind of benefit you might get from that in 2017? And then my last question, not that you haven't had great performance on this over the last couple years, but I noticed a little bit of a pickup in G&A, is that just still the residual effect of just putting Plum Creek into the business or are there other expense categories that are growing that you'll need to manage for in 2017? Thank you and good luck in the quarter. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you, George. In terms of G&A I would tell you that the slight increase in fourth quarter versus third quarter is just timing. We are if you look at where these companies were before we combine them in 2015 versus where we're going up in 2017, we're highly confident that we're going to meet or exceed our $125 million target by the end of the first quarter of 2017. And as I said earlier we are at a basically $100 million run rate through the fourth quarter of 2016. So in really good shape on our G&A and as I mentioned earlier the $125 million is 25% higher than what we originally factored in when we announced the merger.  In terms of the engineered wood products and distribution coordination and quantifying that George, as you would expect that is difficult to quantify but that is part of the OPEX improvements that we've highlighted in 2017. And there maybe some upside as these two operations continue to work closer together and figure out a way to drive value for customers and improve bottom line profitability. George Staphos : Thank you for the details. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Hey, good morning. First question from me just as it relates to the lumber dispute. As we enter the potential look back window, have you started to see any change in Canadian shipments for the U.S. just more broadly in the marketplace? Doyle R. Simons: You know Collin it's hard to tell yet. I mean we're only into the -- through the month of January and as you know the look back will be roughly 90 days. So, hard to determine yet if there's been a significant change in the Canadian activity. As you know Canadian activity was up significantly in 2016 and we'll be watching how that plays in 2017. A lot of rumors floating around as to what may or may not happen but too early to tell what changes if any the Canadians maybe taking as we move into 2017 in the potential look back period. Collin Mings : Okay, thanks for that Doyle and then switching gears just I maybe splitting hairs here but just your guidance on real estate seem to maybe be a little bit more optimistic than the December Investor Meeting, just given kind of language around looking for it to exceed the 250 million in adjusted EBITDA. Am I reading too much into the language choice there or is there something kind of driving maybe a little bit more optimism on the real estate front? Doyle R. Simons: Well Collin what I would tell you is as we continue to learn more about our real estate operation and what the opportunity is there, we continue to be encouraged by the AVO process and what that is unveiling. So we are confident that, that number will be over $250 million for 2017. Collin Mings : Okay and then curious just given the potential for tax reform, can you touch on how important 1031 exchanges are to the real estate business. I know that's something that Weyerhaeuser legacy has engaged in to some degree but how do you think about it now just kind of given your current pack that it\u2019s on a combined basis? Russell S. Hagen: So Collin this is Russell, as far as the 1031 program you're correct, Weyerhaeuser had used that in the past and that was primarily because they were in the built in gains period. So now that they're out of the built in gains period so on a combined basis rather built in gains period it\u2019s really not a tool that we would use going forward in a meaningful way. Collin Mings : Okay great. I'll turn it over. Thanks guys. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you Collin. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Can you give a little bit more color on what you're seeing in the export market, A lot of other commodities have seen a big uplift in volumes to China, are you sensing any of that at all in either log or lumber either from North America or some other parts of the world? Doyle R. Simons: So Gail we continue to be encouraged about what we see in the export markets. Let's start with Japan as you know that's our biggest market. So as we said earlier prices were up in fact in the fourth quarter which was encouraging. Volumes were down but that was due to seasonality and frankly some of the timing of our shipments and how the ships played out that were going to Japan. In the first quarter in line with your point we do anticipate volumes will be up. And our best guess right now is flat pricing but we continue to be encouraged by what we see out of Japan. Housing market activity was up 8% roughly through the month of November which is the last data point that we have. As we look to China encouraging there as well. As you know log inventories continued to be at normal levels, pricing was in fact up in the fourth quarter. Volume again was down seasonally and as we move into the first quarter continuing to anticipate good demand out of China and we anticipate volumes up in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter. Gail Glazerman : Okay, can you give a little bit more color on the charges on some development projects, are there any projects that we might have heard of, or are they just really small? Russell S. Hagen: Yeah, this is Russell. So as we've gone through an AVO process part of that is also to identify any kind of small development projects and Weyerhaeuser had done some small development activities really around and tied it with maybe some minimal infrastructure type investment. As we went through the portfolio, given the change in our strategy as it relates to development, we chose to move those into an HPU [ph] category and sell through those a little quicker. And because of that we took the impairment against those assets but so very small properties -- properties and we don't expect to have any material impairments going forward in future. Gail Glazerman : Okay, Doyle, can you give any sense of where your customer log inventories are positioned moving into the year? Doyle R. Simons: Yes, I would say customer log inventories in the West are kind of towards the low end of normal as we as we move into the year. And I would say in the South they are kind of at normalized levels in terms of where you would have seen log inventories historically. Gail Glazerman : Okay, and just last one. Obviously you're looking for fairly stable Southern pricing in the first quarter, can you give any perspective on what your outlook is for the year, are you seeing any sense of traction of building? Doyle R. Simons: You know our take is the first and second quarter we would anticipate pricing to be essentially flat. We do think there's the possibility of slight improvements in pricing as we move to the second half of the year and then as we look further out than that we continue to be quite optimistic about the improvement in Southern log prices. As housing continues to improve that will drive demand. As you also know there are significant projects that are being built and will be coming online in 2017 and 2018 type timeframe that we think that's going to drive 12 million to 13 million green tons of additional demand.  And then of course a big component of this will be what happens with Canada and we think either as a result of hopefully a negotiated agreement which will result in a quota or the duties that that will have an impact on the amount of lumber that is coming in from Canada which will result in more demand on Southern saw logs. So all those factors we are encouraged by what we see there and like I said are hopeful that we'll see some slight improvement in the second half of this year but more importantly as we move into 2018 and beyond. We think we're going to see some pricing power as a result. Gail Glazerman : Okay, thank you. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. A couple follow ups first. Do you guys get a sense of inventories of the customers on logs, do you have a view where they are on lumber and OSB? Russell S. Hagen: Mark, I would tell you that our sense is inventories for lumber and OSB are pretty thin. I would say it is on below normal levels and that seems to be how our customers are running their business but I would say inventories are latent. Mark Weintraub : Okay, bit of a hypothetical but have you been able to do any work, have any thoughts if a border tax adjustment were to be part of a new tax bills, etc what would that mean for lumber and for that matter OSB coming in for Canada. I don't know if you've gotten any -- it would be treated any differently or any thoughts on implications there? Russell S. Hagen: Hey Mike, this is Russell. As far as the border tax adjustment we've kind of looked at the implications of that. But as Doyle mentioned given we have relatively low volumes coming in from the Canadian operations into the U.S. we're primarily a domestic producer and sell into the domestic markets. We don't think it would have a material impact on our operations or in fact on us. Mark Weintraub : I guess, coming from kind of the other angle, would it have material implication on wood coming in from Canada not produced by you essentially, homebuilders not going to be as inclined to buy the woods from the Canadian and essentially act as a further umbrella for U.S. pricing? Russell S. Hagen: I mean yes, that could be a factor and the amount of volume that comes down from Canada I would say that's a possibility. Doyle R. Simons: But a lot of these changes to the markets we're doing a lot of work on it but it's still too early to know exactly how these will play out under this administration. But a lot of moving parts that could have frankly potential benefits for our company going forward. Mark Weintraub : Understood, appreciate it. I wondered just if whether there was anything that would be different about materials coming in from \u2013 wood products coming in from Canada, but there's nothing that's being talked about that would differentiate it from anything else coming in from anywhere is that fair? Doyle R. Simons: At this point that is generally fair. More work to be done and more specifics to be learned but I think to your point if anything it should be a net positive for our company and the U.S. industry. Mark Weintraub : Okay, thanks so much. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes, good morning everyone. Doyle R. Simons: Good morning Chip. Chip Dillon : First question is Doyle, I remember it was about three years ago when you got into your current role, it seem like you had like a couple years where you were going to improve the pretty much the whole wood products business and I think it's fair to say you've exceeded expectations. But I was under the impression that after those two years CAPEX might come down and you would sort of be in a position where maybe you would have viewed -- accelerated a lot of opportunities. What I think of seeing today is CAPEX is staying elevated but to be fair you're also having continued high targets. In fact it looks like lumber and OSB they're higher for savings in 2017 and 2016. So the question is what changed, has it been that since you've been in there you have found new things you can do to plants you've already worked on or are you just expanding the number of plants that you are putting capital in, in order to get these savings? Doyle R. Simons: And so it's good question, Chip. So, what we -- when we started this process as you were recalling as you highlighted two or three years ago, a lot of the improvements were non-capital improvements because our take was show -- these mills needed to show that they could make operational excellence improvements without capital. And then if they could do that then they earned the right to capital to further drive down the cost structure. So we initially said okay let's do this without capital. Once you show that and you earn the right to capital which will further drive down the overall structure of our mills set. So as you said we've made good progress. There's still more work to be done but we now have confidence Chip as we put in this capital that we will in fact continue to deliver on these OPEX improvements and more importantly than that continue to drive down the overall cost structure of our mail system where we will in the current upturn that we're in outperform the competition. And when things do eventually roll over, which we think was many years from now we will be back at the bottom. Now with that said Chip I don't want to give you the sense that this $300 million of capital is going to be the level forever. We think there's a couple more years of spending at this level to get our mills fully positioned to where they need to be from a cost perspective and then you would see capital fall off to a more normalized level in the $200 million to $250 million range. Chip Dillon : Okay, so 200 to 250. Now -- then the second question is it seems like as we've looked at the situation here we are in 2017 that there would be a lot of TMO [ph] type partnerships that were established 10 to 15 years ago that are coming up for, I guess they\u2019re maturing or the partnerships are at a point where they might dissolve. And yet it seems like the timberland market has stayed pretty solid. I don't know if it's great but it's been pretty solid and I didn\u2019t know if you had any thoughts as to are you seeing a lot of these partnerships sort of extend themselves or are you instead seeing them dissolved but there's just a solid demand sort of have new replacements in terms of investors to take over these ownerships. Doyle R. Simons: Chip, what I would tell you -- I think timberland markets do continue to be strong and we see that over and over especially for high quality timberland there's a lot of interest in its investment class and for high quality timberlands there's a lot of interested buyers both domestic buyers and frankly international buyers starting to show up. So as these TMOs do mature and that is happening some of them you see being extended due to performance. Some of them you see trading back and forth but a lot of interest in continued in this asset class and like I said any process that is being run and there are some being run and we participate in just about all of those. There are a number of interested parties who are part of that Chip Dillon : Okay, and then last question quickly. Any update on sort of your thinking about either the dividend, dividend policy at this point? Doyle R. Simons: Yeah Chip, so as we mentioned at our Investor Day kind of over 90% of our business assets is in timberlands and as you have just highlighted a significantly improved cost structure for wood products. Our go forward cash flow will be much more stable and that's intentional. We're in the process of discussing the payout ratio with our Board and we will update you when those conversations are complete. But we think there is the opportunity to increase the payout ratio as we look forward.  In terms of a dividend increase, as we have consistently said for the past few years we are committed to a sustainable and growing dividend. As we look into 2017 we're clearly going to benefit from cost and operational synergies, continued OPEX improvements, and as we've talked about this morning stronger housing markets. So, all those things will be factored in as we work with our Board on decisions regarding our dividend. Chip Dillon : Great, thanks for the update. Doyle R. Simons: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good morning and congratulations on the strong 2016 results. We are seeing some inflation out in the economy these days with a lot of commodity prices moving higher, just wondering if you're starting to see that in your business from cost pressure and related to that maybe just wondering if some of the higher oil and gas prices might have any benefit on the energy part of the real estate segment just in terms of royalties and if that's kind of factored into your outlook or not? Doyle R. Simons: So, on the second part of your question, clearly higher natural gas and oil prices will benefit our Energy and Natural Resources segment. We have a lot more leverage to natural gas and forever rough numbers just to give you a sense, every dollar improvement in natural gas, $5 million to our bottom line all else being equal. But as you would also anticipate when pricing increases that also gives you the opportunity to go lease more. Don\u2019t have quite that type of leverage to oil but as oil prices continue to improve there will be more opportunity from a leasing perspective.  In terms of commodity price push we're starting to see a little bit of that not big numbers at this point but that -- turning to that, that is why OPEX is so important as we are at some point going to see some cost push and a big part of our operational excellence efforts are to make sure we are doing things that offset that or frankly more than offset that so that the benefits we see from our increased pricing and volume fall directly to the bottom line. Brian Maguire : Okay great. And then the other area where there has been a lot of volatility lately has been just in currencies and you get some sensitivity to the end. Just wondering, what kind of an impact the post election move in the dollar is having on realized pricing or competitive trade flows, particularly into Japan where I know you've got some competition from some European producers? Doyle R. Simons: Yeah, as you said the strong U.S. dollar continues to be a headwind for us. All other currencies that are important to us weaken versus the U.S. dollar after the election. Some of them has strengthened slightly this December but they overall net-net remain weaker than where they were at the end of the third quarter. In Japan as you said the risk there is the strong U.S. dollar pressures. Prices our customers products compete with lower cost lumber imports from Europe but as I said earlier despite all that we continued to have good demand for our logs into Japan and we actually saw some fall off in the imports that were coming in from Europe during that time period. So net-net while it's not positive we work through that and continue to have good demand from our Japanese customers and part of that is built on the long-term relationship and unique relationship we have with our customer base in Japan. Brian Maguire : Okay, just one last one of I could just on the corporate expense in the quarter and the outlook there going forward I think there was maybe a LIFO or inventory hit there in the quarter. As soon as maybe just a year end true up but just thinking about what kind of run rate level we're at going into 1Q there and as you remove some of the stranded costs from Cellulose Fibers, where you think we would become ending the year there? Russell S. Hagen: So this is Russell. As far as the $14 million LIFO adjustment that was a combination of LIFO and profit elimination and that was really a function of increasing inventories at year end. Then also bringing on some of the Montana inventories that were legacy to Plum Creek and so we increased log inventories particularly in those regions for anticipating when to break up. So it's really just an increase in inventory versus the driver for the LIFO on profit elimination. As Doyle mentioned we're on track to capture our synergy targets 125 million by the end of the first quarter and then we are on track to capture the additional $35 million of CS training costs by the end of 2017 and we're making good progress on both those accounts. Brian Maguire : Okay, thanks very much. Russell S. Hagen: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with CLSA. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thanks Doyle. I'm just expanding on Chips question, are the nature of the operational excellence improvements in timberlands any different now? I'm just curious whether things are evolving there and maybe maturity schedules and things are getting involved? Doyle R. Simons: I would say the biggest difference in timberlands versus where we were the first two or three years are the additional opportunities that have been presented as a result of combining. Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek. So a portion of the $42 million that we got in 2016 was due to those operational synergies, the ability to rebalance wood flows, to minimize cost, and increase realization, optimize the silviculture practice cost based on our larger scale. And then frankly just best practices in harvesting and transportation both again as a result of scale but maybe even more importantly learning from each other. There were some things that Weyerhaeuser and when we got in there looked at it did better and lower costs than Plum Creek and there were some things that Plum Creek did.  So as we move forward while we're confident in having what I would say were a fairly significant targets 40 million to 50 million in 2017 and I would anticipate a similar number in 2018 are because of the opportunities that have been created by combining these two companies taking best practices, taking advantage of the larger scale both from ability to service customers, rebalance wood flows, and drive down the overall cost structure of our timberlands operations. So really excited about that and I can tell our folks are really excited about it as they almost on a daily basis find additional opportunities for OPEX as a result of the combination. Mark Connelly : That sounds great. Just one point of clarification, in real estate you mentioned a shift to the South but is there anything lumpy or should we start to think of this is a relatively normal quarter in terms of realizations? Doyle R. Simons: So as I mentioned earlier in my comments, the first and second quarter are pretty kind of low volume of sales and so we're guiding for lower amount in fourth quarter. Real estate sales can be a little lumpy, it depends on the character of the transactions and so it's a little difficult to predict. And then the second half we'll see it will pick up. So, that's pretty much the pattern we would expect pretty low in the first and second quarter and then picking up in the third quarter and then a lot of closings really occurring in the fourth quarter. Russell S. Hagen: And Mark in terms of the value from the different components is really it is depending on as you very well know there's different value components in the North. It tend to be lower per acre South than that and then of course the West even higher than that on a per acre basis. So it's really just going to depend on what the mix is and as Russell said at least initially it will be more weighted to the South than the West and then as we move to the West as we complete our AVO process that will factor in on the per acre value. Mark Connelly : Very helpful, thank you. Russell S. Hagen: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning Doyle, good morning Russell. Doyle R. Simons: Good morning Mark. Mark Wilde : Doyle, I wonder if you and Russell could just give us some sense of kind of how your appetite is right now for kind of timberland acquisitions and where your biases would be just regionally? Doyle R. Simons: You know Mark, I\u2019ll tell you that right now our focus, what I like to say number one, two, and three is continuing to make sure we fully capitalize on the value that we can create by combining Weyerhaeuser and Plum Creek and driving the synergies and other benefits to the bottom line. So that's what we are primarily focused on. As we continue to work through that, and as I like to say earn the right to continue to grow we will be looking at Timberland acquisitions to potentially grow our company. With that said with the scale we have and diversity of geography we have we don't have to grow so we can be very disciplined as we move forward.  In terms of South versus the West we're basically like both of those markets and would look so it's not a waiting more to one than the other. We both -- we like both the South and the West and would look to potentially growing both of those as we move forward. Mark Wilde : Okay and then on the other side of the equation Doyle just I know you're still in the midst of the evaluation down in Uruguay but can you just give us some sense of sort of any tax consequences on that sale? Russell S. Hagen: Hey Mike, this is Russell. Pardon me, yes thanks for the qualification. If that were the case we would have minimal tax impacts on that transaction. Mark Wilde : Okay. Doyle the last question I had is just over an engineered wood. I know that there have been some conversations about sort of more fire code restrictions around particularly I-Joist, can you just kind of update us on what that situation is and how Weyerhaeuser kind of deals with those changes in regulation? Doyle R. Simons: Good question Mark and there are a lot of various regulations, potential regulations regarding that. I can tell you we\u2019re doing an immense amount of work on that front. We've got a really good technology group that is looking for different applications that you can put on engineered wood products that will in fact extend what's called the burn through test, extend that and as a result of that meet any additional requirements that may be put forth from that. So again a lot of work being done on that, very encouraged about what we've seen so far in the test that we're running and think we will be well positioned as we go forward in EWP. Mark Wilde : How widespread is this Doyle, is this just kind of a state by state or is this more of a national basis? Doyle R. Simons: No, it's clearly state by state that's the way these things work. Again a lot of uncertainty regarding exactly what that may look like and what the timing may be. But we've been on top of it and feel good about the opportunities to deal with this on a go forward basis. Mark Wilde : Okay, just the last question also on I-Joist. I just I notice in your graph that prices of I-Joist have been kind of trending down over the last around four to six quarters yet at the same time kind of the inputs are like OSB for web stock are actually going up. So, would you expect to see kind of those higher input costs starting to roll through to I-Joist prices here over the next few quarters? Doyle R. Simons: Yeah Mark, I do think there is the opportunity for price improvement in EWP as we move through 2017. Mark Wilde : Okay, very good. Good luck this year guys. Doyle R. Simons: Alright, thank you. Operator : And your final question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn : Yeah, thanks very much and good morning gentleman. Just a question on software negotiations, you mentioned that government employments haven't been made yet so there's no government to government negotiations. But maybe you could just give us some color on whether the industry is talking and whether you're making any progress and when you expect government to government negotiations to start. Doyle R. Simons: Yeah, I think it's going to take a little bit of time Paul to get the appointments in place and approved and get up to speed. So I can't tell you exactly when negotiations will start again. But it's going to take a little bit of time. In terms of the U.S. coalition a lot of work continues to be done just to -- so we don't lose any momentum during this period of time. I think the U.S. coalition are all on the same page and like I said are hopeful of a negotiated settlement as we move forward. Paul Quinn : Great, that is all I had. Thanks a lot guys. Doyle R. Simons: Alright, thank you. So as I understand it that was our final question. I would like to thank everybody for joining us this morning. And as always really appreciate your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Take care. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. Operator : Good morning. My name is Brent and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. Thank you. I would now like to turn the call over to Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth L. Baum - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Brent. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $157 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding after-tax special items of $10 million for merger-related cost, we earned $167 million or $0.22 per diluted share. This is over 2.5 times of earnings from continuing operations we reported in the fourth quarter and one year ago. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $454 million, an improvement of 14% compared with the fourth quarter and 35% compared with the first quarter of 2016. I am very pleased with our first quarter performance as we illustrated the power of leveraging internal improvements across improving markets. Our employees did an outstanding job of capitalizing on operational excellence initiatives, merger-related synergies and strengthening market conditions to achieve outstanding operating and financial results in the quarter, while also fully delivering on our increased $125 million merger cost synergy target. One year into our merger with Plum Creek, I'm proud of what our teams have accomplished and the dedication and focus they continue to display as we work together to be the world's premier timber, land and forest products company. Before turning to our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Housing activity began 2017 on a very solid trajectory. Total housing starts averaged over $1.25 million for the first quarter, an improvement of 8% compared with last year despite some unusually wet West Coast weather. Single-family starts rose 9% in the month of March and are up 6% year-to-date. Leading market indicators are also favorable. Single-family permits are up 13% compared with first quarter of last year and builder confidence remains near record highs. Employment and wages are rising, consumer confidence has surpassed pre-recession levels, and interest rates, although increasing, remain historically low. Our customers are reporting robust demand with strong activity in California as winter weather has mitigated and signs that an increasing number of millennials are entering the home-buying market. Labor and lot availability remain the most active constraints, but builders are motivated to manage through these challenges and capture the benefit of favorable market conditions. The spring selling season appears to be off to a robust start and we continue to expect between $1.25 million and $1.3 million total housing starts for 2017. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $148 million to first quarter earnings, $25 million more than the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA rose to $242 million. Western Timberlands delivered $133 million of first quarter EBITDA, an improvement of over 30% compared with the fourth quarter and 13% more than a year ago. The market for Western domestic logs was stronger than expected during the quarter as the combination of solid building activity and low mill inventories drove demand, while unusually wet and snowy winter weather reduced the available log supply. Our Western team did an exceptional job of taking full advantage of our scale and operability, flexing harvest settings to some lower elevation tracks and leveraging our strong road system as they directed additional volume into the most tensioned domestic markets. Domestic log sales volumes and realizations increased compared with the fourth quarter and unit logging and road costs decreased due to lower logging elevations, continued operational excellence improvements and deferrals from silviculture, and road maintenance activities due to wet weather. Turning now to our export markets, in Japan, housing activity remained solid with year-to-date start-up of approximately 5% through February and demand for our logs has remained steady. Although Japanese construction activity typically moderates in the first quarter due to winter weather, log sales volumes were up slightly and average realizations increased compared with the fourth quarter. In China, log sales volumes declined compared with fourth quarter due to timing of shipment and our intentional decision to flex volume into this strong domestic market. Average log realizations improved and market conditions remained favorable. Log inventories at Chinese ports remain within a normalized range, having risen early in the first quarter before declining in March as construction activity resumed following the Lunar New Year holiday. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $96 million to first quarter EBITDA, lower than the fourth quarter due to seasonally lower harvest volumes and slightly lower average realizations. Southern markets remain flat as log availability was plentiful due to favorable weather and mills are holding adequate inventory. Fee harvest volumes declined seasonally compared with the fourth quarter and average log realizations were slightly lower due to a higher proportion of pulpwood sales. Although pulpwood log realizations weakened during the quarter as seasonal maintenance and other mill shutdowns reduced demand, realizations for our delivered saw logs were comparable. Northern Timberlands contributed $8 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $1 million compared with fourth quarter as the region benefited from OpEx initiatives to reduce contract logging costs. Fee harvest declined seasonally and average realizations were comparable. The Timberlands business made good progress on its operational excellence and synergy initiatives in the first quarter. Regional teams continue to identify and roll out best practices for optimizing spending and value creation for our silviculture activities and improving wood flows to further reduce cost and maximize the realization we capture from every log. The business is on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017. The strategic review of our Uruguay operations continues to proceed well with strong interest from multiple parties. We look forward to providing further information when the review is complete. Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and E&R contributed $26 million to first quarter earnings and $43 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $47 million compared with the fourth quarter but improved $9 million compared with the first quarter of last year. Fourth quarter is typically our seasonally strongest quarter, while first quarter typically reflects the lowest level of transaction activity. Earnings were comparable to fourth quarter earnings before special items as first quarter had a lower average land basis on the mix of property sold. Average price per acre improved by $500 due to mix. Approximately three-fourth of our first quarter acreage sales were located in the U.S. South with the remainder predominantly in the Pacific Northwest. In contrast, fourth quarter included a large transaction in Montana where timberland prices are regionally lower. Our team continues to make excellent progress applying the asset value optimization process to our Western Timberland and I remain very confident we will meet our target of completing this work by mid-year. Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $172 million to first quarter earnings, an increase of nearly 75% compared with the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $75 million to $207 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $99 million, $42 million more than the fourth quarter, primarily due to a 5% increase in average realizations. Lumber sales volumes increased 6%. Operating rates and manufacturing costs improved due to strong operating performance and reduced downtime for maintenance and capital projects, although several Western mills did lose small amounts of production due to weather. EBITDA for OSB totaled $66 million, $20 million more than the fourth quarter and more than double the first quarter of 2016. Average sales realizations increased 3% and sales volumes increased 21%. All of our OSB mills ran extremely well in the quarter and unit manufacturing costs declined due to higher operating rate and strong OpEx progress on controllable manufacturing cost. Engineered wood products contributed $37 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $11 million compared with the fourth quarter. Sales volumes for solid section increased 11% and I-joist volumes were up slightly. Operating rates rose seasonally and unit manufacturing costs improved due to less planned maintenance and holiday downtime. Average realizations for solid section and I-joist declined slightly due to mix as first quarter typically includes a greater proportion of commodity and industrial products. Distribution EBITDA totaled $8 million, an increase of $3 million compared with the fourth quarter and double the EBITDA of one year ago. This business continues to make progress by improving product margins and tightly managing warehouse, delivery, and selling costs across increased sales volumes. Each of the Wood Products' businesses made good progress on their respective OpEx initiatives during the quarter with OSB and distribution demonstrating particularly strong results. We continue to expect collective OpEx benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017. I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On April 24, the Department of Commerce announced preliminary countervailing duties on Canadian lumber producers. For most producers, the duty will be approximately 20%. These duties will become effective upon publication in the Federal Register. For some producers, the duties will also be imposed retroactively effective 90 days prior to publication. The Department of Commerce continues to evaluate the coalition's petition for antidumping duties, which would be additive to the countervailing duties announced earlier this week. We expect a preliminary decision on the antidumping duties to be reached on June 23. We appreciate the action the U.S. government has taken to address the unfair trade practices that are harming U.S. lumber producers. The government will continue its investigation throughout of 2017 as the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission collect and evaluate additional information in support of final determinations on both the duties and material injury to U.S. producers. These determinations are expected in early November and late December, respectively. We continue to prefer the certainty of a negotiated agreement. Formal discussions remain on hold, pending confirmation of the U.S. Trade representative. In the meantime, the coalition is working closely with both the Office of the USTR and the Department of Commerce. We look forward to resuming formal negotiations and are hopeful we will be able to reach a quota-based agreement. I will close this morning with a couple of comments on merger cost synergies and other cost reductions. As I mentioned earlier, we are very pleased to achieve our merger cost synergies ahead of schedule and at levels that exceeded our initial expectations. We captured our original $100 million run rate target at the end of 2016, several months earlier than anticipated, and have now exceeded that by 25%, fully delivering on increase of $125 million run rate target by year one deadline. Approximately 80% of these costs have been achieved through reductions in controllable SG&A, while the remainder have come from cost of sales. We remain on track to eliminate the $35 million of cost formerly allocated to our sale of Fibers business no later than 2017 year-end. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the second quarter is presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the first quarter and comparable to second quarter of 2016. Western saw log markets continue to perform well with solid domestic and export demand, while Southern saw log markets remain flat. We also expect seasonally higher road, logging and silviculture costs as we begin the spring and summer months. In our Western Timberland operations, average sales realization should increase slightly, but fee harvest volumes are expected to decrease modestly. Japanese export log volumes and average sales realizations should be comparable to the first quarter supported by continued strength in the Japanese housing market. Export log volumes to China are expected to be higher in the second quarter as a result of the timing of shipments and continued favorable demand. Average sales realization should be comparable. Domestic log sales volumes are expected to decrease slightly compared to the first quarter, while average sales realizations should increase slightly supported by continued steady demand. Western road costs are expected to be higher than the first quarter due to additional road spending which is typical as road building activities increase in the second quarter and the catch up on activity which was not completed in the first quarter due to weather. Logging costs were also increased due to planned shifting of harvest activities to higher elevations. While an increase in higher elevation logging is typical in the spring months, they'll be more notable than usual because we flex some first quarter activities to lower elevations due to unusually wet and snowy weather. Southern harvest volumes are expected to be higher in the second quarter, as more favorable weather allows for increased access to harvest areas. We anticipate average sales realizations for the second quarter will be similar to first quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South is expected to increase due to typical seasonality. In the North, we anticipate second quarter sales volumes will be significantly lower than the first quarter due to spring breakup season. Average sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter levels. Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. As is typical for the real estate business, activity will begin increasing in the spring and summer months with a large portion of sales closing in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect over $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017. For Wood Products, higher sales realizations for lumber, OSB, and engineered wood products, along with higher sales volumes for most product lines, will result in significantly higher adjusted EBITDA in the second quarter. Overall, we expect earnings and EBITDA to improve by approximately 20% to 30% compared to the first quarter. Before moving to unallocated items, I'd like to highlight a new accounting standard we've adopted in the current quarter which changes how we report pension and post-retirement costs. Previously, we recorded this activity within cost of products sold, general and administrative expenses and other operating costs. The new accounting standard results in a reclassification of most of these costs to a new line item below operating income titled non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit costs or credits. The total amount recorded in the statement of operations does not change. Looking at chart 10, unallocated items, the $28 million variance in earnings before special items compared with the fourth quarter is driven by a $33 million increase in non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit cost. As I mentioned on our fourth quarter call, this expected variance is primarily the result of the annual update to our pension and postretirement actuarial assumptions, which included a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the liabilities of both our U.S. and Canadian plants. We expect to record approximately $20 million to $25 million per quarter of non-cash pension and postretirement expense in unallocated throughout the remainder of 2017. As stated in our prior earnings call, we do not expect to make any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017. And we anticipate cash payments in 2017 of approximately $70 million for all other pension and postretirement plans. Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $455 million. Cash from operations during the quarter was $35 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to inventory and other working capital build, as well as the timing of semiannual interest payments. The current quarter also included $59 million in net taxes paid, primarily attributable to the foreign tax payments associated with the 2016 gain on the divestiture of our pulp mills. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $75 million. We continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $135 million for Timberlands. Financing cash flows included $233 million for common dividends paid in the first quarter. Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6.6 billion of long-term debt. We have a scheduled maturity in August of 2017 for $281 million, which we intend to repay with available cash. Interest expense was $99 million in the first quarter. We expect interest expense to be similar in the second quarter and approximately $400 million for the full year. We continue to anticipate the full year 2017 tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Russell. I noted at the beginning of today's call that internal improvements and strengthening market conditions can create a powerful combination. Our first quarter results demonstrate this. And with a solid improving housing trajectory, favorable dynamics across our Wood Products businesses and continued leverage from operational excellence and merger synergies, we are well-positioned to deliver continued strong results. Although markets are improving, we will not lose focus on the factors under our control. We remain committed to fully capturing the benefits of our merger with Plum Creek, achieving industry-leading performance and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation to drive superior value for our shareholders. And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : Your first question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Doyle, a couple questions around the South. One, can you update us on where you're at with the capital program at the Southern saw mills and whether a resolution on this trade issue could lead you to invest more capital in Southern lumber operations? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, Mark, as we have consistently talked about, we are focused on investing capital to drive down our cost in our overall Wood Products operation. For last year, this year and for probably the next couple of years, we will be investing at approximately $300 million level in our Wood Products operation overall. We would not anticipate investing more than that during the timeframe. And, in fact, after investing at the $300 million level for the next couple of years, we would anticipate going back down to what I would call a more normalized level of between $200 million and $250 million. We are very encouraged by the initial returns on the capital that we have spent. And that part of the capital in our lumber operations \u2013 specifically again the focus is to drive down cost to low risk, high-return project. But we also will be increasing capacity modestly as we rebuild a mill in Dierks and that will be coming on later this year and also a mill in Millport. So, net-net that will add about another 300 million board feet of capacity but again, the focus is on driving down our cost. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And just one related question. I noticed in looking at some of the trade data that the Southern log export volumes are up more than 100% year-to-date. I know Plum had been doing some work in trying to develop these markets. I wondered if you could talk about what you are doing to kind of participate in this and whether there are any things you can do to encourage kind of more log export volume out of the South because it looks like it would really help to kind of create a little more tension in the markets down there? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: We agree with you, Mark. We think it would be helpful from that perspective and we're doing a lot of work on identifying and promoting export activity out of the South. We've had some initial successes still at a very small level but spending a lot of time talking to potential customers and starting to develop those markets and frankly are pretty optimistic about it. It's still early, still small volumes but we think there's a real opportunity to expand Southern export markets as we move forward. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. And then just lastly, Russell, are you guys \u2013 can you give us any number for what you expect to pay in countervailing duties on the Canadian operations this year? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yes. So we've done the calculation on the countervailing duties with the volume coming out of our Canadian operation into the U.S. And based on a high-level estimate, we would expect about a $6 million cost on a per quarter basis. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. All right. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. I just wanted to delve a little bit further into operating rates in the supply side across your wood businesses. So recognizing you've got the capacity coming on later on in wood products and in lumber, Doyle, currently, what would you estimate of your operable capacity what your operating rate is? One of your peers was reporting yesterday that they've obviously been able to take up their production through capital projects and optimization programs. Do you have further ability to flex your existing capacity without running at impractical levels either from a waste or safety standpoint? And then, on OSB, I think, you said production was up something like 20%. Congratulations on the performance. What further ability do you have to take your production up and do you think you garnered a bit more share than peers in this quarter and why? And then, I had one follow-on. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, in terms of operating rates, George, in the quarter, lumber was in the low-90s. As we mentioned, our OSB operation ran very well. It was in the high-90s and ELP was in the mid-80s. You're always looking for opportunities to increase reliability and, therefore, increase production. Our mills are running well. There's always, what I call, creep in terms of being able to increase production but there's not big steps other than what we've already talked about in response to Mark's question of what we're doing on the lumber side to increase significantly incremental capacity. So, what we're focused on is running reliably and at the lowest cost as possible. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And, I guess, on OSB, you're pretty much \u2013 if you're in the high-90s, you're pretty much tapped out. Would that be fair and do you think you garnered more share than peers in the quarter? And if so, was it geographic mix or something else do you believe? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Other than creep, I would agree with you. We are almost maxed out in OSB and don't believe we necessarily grew share. We've been running at pretty high levels in OSB other than taking some maintenance downtime and those type of things. So, we just ran extremely well in OSB in the quarter and demand for the product was very good despite the fact that the first quarter is normally a slower seasonal period. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Appreciate that, Doyle. Thank you. My last one, I'll turn it over, as we think about the AVO program, and I realize the details will come out in June, so maybe this is getting a little ahead of the curve. If we think about the premiums that you've been getting in the South, would it be fair to say that in the West you'll be less likely to achieve that same premium probably because development and land values for that matter in the West are harder to do and higher priced respectively or how would you have us at least preliminarily think about that? Thank you, guys. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: What I would tell you is that we were encouraged by the process so far in the West. As you also said, we'll be talking more about that when we wrap it up. With that said, as we very consistently have said, we're looking for a premium of 30%. And I would anticipate that we will achieve that premium or more in the West just as we have in the South. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. That's great. Thank you, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just a clarification. On the OSB, that big percent increase in volume, that was versus the fourth quarter where you were fire impacted? Was that also against the prior year first quarter? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Mark, really good question, and glad to be able to clarify. You're right. A big part of the pickup in first quarter versus fourth quarter was due to the fact that Sutton was running for the full quarter. My comments were more due the fact that in OSB in the first quarter we ran in the high-90s, as I indicated, but quarter-to-quarter you're exactly right. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Great. Thank you. And then you mentioned in the prepared remarks about a 20% to 30% improvement in EBITDA. Was that specific to Wood Products or was that for the company as a whole looking 2Q v 1Q? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Again, thanks for clarifying. That was a specific comment regarding Wood Products and that range is due to the fact that we don't know exactly what prices are going to do from this point forward. If prices stayed where they are today or moved up, it would be at higher end of the \u2013 towards the 30%. If they rolled or turned down from this point, it would be closer to the 20%. So that's the reason for the range. With that said, Mark, that comment was very specific to Wood Products. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Great. And then, lastly, is there any visibility at all as to timing on when duties might become quotas? And I realize you certainly don't have anything specific, but are we talking potentially quarters or is that more likely a process that could take years? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: You're right, Mark. We don't know exactly, but I would be \u2013 I am hopeful that we could be in a situation where we could enter into a negotiated agreement \u2013 a quota-based agreement sometime this year. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And then, lastly, if I could. On the duties that are being collected, what happens to those duties? Is that determined yet or is that yet to be decided? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Well, those duties go to the U.S. Treasury and are held by the U.S. Treasury. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Might they go back to U.S. sawmills as I think they did last time or not necessarily? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. Not necessarily. That was a negotiated agreement, as you will recall, after many months back and forth. Some of it went back to U.S. sawmills. Some of it went back to the Canadian producers. So, that was part of the negotiations. So, I don't think \u2013 we'll just have to see how this plays out as we move forward. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe. Please go ahead. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Hi. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Just starting on the Western log market, the weather that you suggested that impacted your ability to harvest some higher elevation, how much do you think that contributed to the overall market pricing in the quarter? And have you started to see kind of better harvest conditions take some pressure off? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, as I said in the comments, Gail, we were very pleased with our ability to leverage our scale operability, get roads during the quarter to capitalize on the tight markets. What I would tell you as we moved into the second quarter we continue to be encouraged by what we see in the West, continued strong demand. To your point, the mill inventories remained thin, especially in Oregon. They're better than they were at some points in the first quarter. But mill inventories continue to be thin. And I would tell you overall, as Russell indicated, we anticipate prices in the West to be up slightly in the second quarter. So, weather has improved. We are able to move up into the higher elevation in the second quarter. But we're very pleased with our ability to capitalize on what happened during the first quarter. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. Thank you. And going back to the trade agreement, do you have any sense of how the markets might have anticipated that and how much that might have played into what you saw in lumber pricing in the first quarter? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Gail, as you know, it's hard to determine how much, if any, impact the overhang from the waiting for the quarters to come out had on pricing. What I will tell you is I think key drivers to the pricing improvement were the fact that inventories were very lean going into the first quarter and demand was better than expected. I think all you have to do is look at OSB which didn't have the whole tariff situation and those prices ran as well. So, I'm not going to tell you that the SLA didn't have an impact on pricing in the first quarter because I'm sure that it did. But I think it was more \u2013 had more to do with the volatility in pricing that we saw. I think underplaying supply and demand was the biggest driver of the improvement in lumber pricing that we've seen year-to-date. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : And do you feel that the CVDs as announced were pretty much in line with what the market was expecting or do you think there's tons of surprise that it was 20% and not fairly lower? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I think there was a lot of speculation as you very well know, Gail, on what those rates would be. What I will tell you is they came in about where we expected that it would. And I think now we'll wait and see what happens in the antidumping and what the overall number is as we move forward. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. And just, finally, can you talk a little bit what you're seeing in terms of log export markets, in particular the competitive environment there? Any incremental or release in (35:09) pressure out of Russia, for instance, going into China? Any incremental competition Japan from Europe? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yes. So, what I would tell you is we continue to be encouraged by what we see in the West overall, including the key export markets which, of course, for us are Japan and China. In terms of Japan, Japan housing market remains solid. 2017 total starts are up almost 5% year-over-year through February. Demand and pricing per logs, as we said, was solid in the first quarter and we anticipate that's going to continue into the second quarter. In terms of China, inventories there are in good shape which as you know is a real key. And in March, it's roughly 3.8 million cubic meters. We anticipate that inventories are going to remain at reasonable levels through 2017. And in the second quarter, we anticipate volumes are going to rise and we'll have log prices that are comparable to the first quarter levels. And we anticipate as we move through the balance of the year continued strong demand and pricing to be up slightly for the remainder of the year in China. I do not see any big moves in terms of competitors kind of maxed out in terms of the infrastructure challenges that we have. So, we did see an increase in U.S. exports to China so far in the first quarter of 2017 and that number is up pretty significantly versus first quarter of 2016. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Collin. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: First question just going back, Doyle, in February, I believe you indicated that you're hopeful we'll see some slight improvement in log pricing in the U.S. South as we move into the second half of the year. Just can you update us on your thinking here just in context of what's happening on the lumber side of the business? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yes. So, what I would tell you is, at this point, Collin, we don't expect any \u2013 let me start about what we've seen in saw log pricing. So, if you go back and look at the last four quarters in terms of just saw log pricing, it's been very flat. You've seen some pressure on pulpwood pricing, but saw log prices has been very flat over the past four quarters. As we look into the second quarter, we don't expect any significant improvement in saw log pricing. We do continue to believe there is some potential for, maybe, some minor pricing traction in late 2017 as demand continues to grow and the Canadian (38:04) markets decline, whether it's due to duties or, hopefully, as I mentioned, earlier in negotiated agreement. Now, longer-term, as we've talked about, we're very optimistic that due to the additional housing demands, the incremental capacity that's coming online in the U.S. South and right now that's at least 12 million tons of additional demand that's in the process of coming on line and then again less lumber from Canada. We think all of those things are going to add up to provide us with the opportunity for much better pricing on Southern saw logs as we move into 2018 and beyond. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. Thanks. That's a helpful update there. And then maybe switching gears, can you just maybe touch more on your outlook for OSB pricing throughout the year just against the backdrop of, clearly, better pricing here at start of the year, better residential construction activity, but then also the potential for more supply? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, we're optimistic about OSB pricing for the year of 2017. We talked about that it was up nicely in the first quarter. But as you look at where it is in the second quarter, current prices are up probably 10% versus the first quarter average. And we think based again on the strong housing demand that we've seen and the current supply, that OSB pricing should be good for the year 2017. As we move into 2018, as you highlighted, there will be some incremental capacity that comes online. But we're going to frankly need some of that as housing continues to grow. And the other observation I would make is it takes a while for a new capacity to get up and be fully running. So, we'll see how that plays out, but we're hopeful that supply and demand continue to be in good shape as we move forward. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Thanks. And then just one last one from me, just going back to the OpEx goals. And, again, in the prepared remarks, you highlighted you were on track to achieve that in the Wood Products side. Is there any way to quantify or think about how much of the 2017 goals were captured in the 1Q number versus what you saw ahead of you as far as the runway of just kind of the OpEx side of things regardless of what happens with product pricing? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, what I would tell you is in Timberlands, as we talked about, we're right on track for the $40 million to $50 million. So, I would say in the quarter, we got about what you would expect if you just do it on a quarterly basis. In terms of our Wood Products operation, Collin, as we said, we had particularly good quarters from a OpEx perspective in OSB and distribution. So, I would tell you at least for \u2013 and it's just one quarter out of four but through the first quarter we're ahead of schedule in both of those businesses and I would stay right in line with our other two businesses which are lumber and EWP. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: That's helpful. Thanks, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: It sounds like the U.S. and Canada nearly had a softwood lumber deal late in 2016 and someone on the Canadian side thought they'd get a better deal with President Trump. I guess that's true if the bonehead moved on Canada's part. But as the largest U.S. lumber producer, presumably you are privy to the details. So, can you say whether the terms were similar to the deal that expired in October of 2015 and...? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: No. Steve, not surprisingly, we don't have any comment on negotiations that go on between the U.S. and the Canadian governments. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. Well, clearly, the two countries need one another. So, it sounds like you're looking more for a quota. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Well, clearly, the two countries need one another. And, as I said, we are very hopeful of a negotiated agreement between the U.S. and Canada as we move forward. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Okay. And then I'll switch gear with one other question. You made some nice progress on engineered wood and it's great that it wasn't driven by price. But it's interesting to me that price is down when generally high lumber prices I thought were conducive to substitution into EWP. So, why were prices down...? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yes. So, what I would say \u2013 I'm sorry. Go ahead. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Well, I was just going to say why are they down and are there any initiatives to raise prices? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. There are in fact initiatives to raise prices and we have announced a 7% to 10% price increase and are encouraged by the progress we're making on that. Of that 7% to 10%, we should realize that by the end of the third quarter with maybe 25%, 30% of that in the second quarter and most of the balance of that to be realized in the third quarter. To your first comment, the reason prices were down slightly was primarily due to mix and the fact that the first quarter typically includes a greater mix of commodity and industrial products, which carry a lower price. So, just as you indicated, positive lumber pricing good for EWP and we anticipate EWP prices moving up for the balance of the year. Steven Pierre Chercover - D.A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: I just want to \u2013 I had a question on timberland values. (43:57) report was questioning some of the softness in the market and we see the transactions that are there. They seem to be a little bit all over the place. But the idea of softness was sort of \u2013 and it's more in the U.S. South with the idea of disappointing U.S. South saw log prices and higher discount rate. Are you seeing that at all or are you seeing more robust market conditions? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: No, Paul, we haven't seen that at all. What I would tell you is demand for high-quality, well-managed timberland remains very strong. As investors continue to view timberland as an attractive part of their portfolio, timberland valuations remain steady. We're participants to all the major deals that come to market and have not observed any changes in the valuation trends overall. As you very well know, there was a big transaction that happened this quarter by one of our competitors. That was at a nice level in terms of value per acre. So, we continue to see strong interest from a diverse group of investors in every deal that comes along, again, for high quality, well-managed timberland. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And just on a potential deal on softwood lumber. You guys are clearly in favor of quota. Would you like to share with us sort of what percentage of quota you would like to see? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Paul, that is ongoing \u2013 or those will be ongoing discussions between the Canadian and U.S. government. And, again, hopefully, we can reach a agreement that works for all involved by the end of this year. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. Fair enough. Thanks a lot. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Yeah. Hi, guys. It's actually Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. So, firstly, a little bit on the land sales. You're guiding for EBITDA of $250 million this year. So, over the next five years or even more, we know there's quarterly seasonality, but how lumpy will this EBITDA be on a year-on-year basis? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, on the Real Estate, yes, as you indicated, that can be a little lumpy because it's more transaction-based. But I think what we'll see coming in, as I indicated in the second quarter, will be comparable to first quarter and then we'll see a majority of the transactions close in the fourth quarter. That's probably the typical pattern of closing any cash flow that you'll see in this business. We just don't get a lot of activity in the winter months and then it backloads at the end of the year. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Sure. So, on a yearly base, let's say, from 2018 and onward, do you expect a lot of variability on a year-on-year basis? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: No. I think we've indicated that we would expect the Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business to contribute anywhere from 10% to 15% of our total adjusted EBITDA. And so, that's pretty much where we target that business. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Okay. Perfect. And just on the acquisition front. Given that Wood Products are performing very well, are you considering selective acquisitions on that front and if so, which specific categories, lumber, OSB? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, what we've said is currently our priorities number one, two and three are making sure we successfully merge Plum Creek and get to the bottom-line all the benefits from that merger. And as we indicated earlier, we made a lot of progress, but still have more to do. So, that is our primary focus. As we move forward, we will look for opportunities to grow our company. We think our biggest opportunities will probably be in Timberlands. With that said, if we can find appropriate acquisitions in Wood Products, especially if it's close to our timber base, those are opportunities we would look at from a bolt-on perspective. And we'll continue to identify opportunities for that as we move forward. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Makes sense. And just clarify, you mentioned you preferred if it's close to \u2013 if the mills will be close, I guess, to the Timberland assets, but you would be open to do separate transactions, let's say, lumber mill that's not a part of a bigger operation with Timberland as well. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I'm not sure I understood your question. Say that again? Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Sure. I think you mentioned you would be open to acquiring some wood product asset that may not be close to Timberland assets. Is that correct? So, you'd be... Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Well, we would factor in everything in terms of potential bolt-on acquisitions. It would probably be more attractive if it was close to our Timberland. But would we' necessary rule it out if it wasn't near our Timberland? Probably not. But, again, our Timberland base most sawmills, for example, would be more than likely aligned with our Timberland base. Salvator Tiano - Vertical Research Partners : Perfect. Thank you very much. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hey. Good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Really strong result in Wood Products. I think the pricing that everyone tracks public benchmark price is up a lot. Your own realizations seem to lag it maybe just by a little bit. I was wondering if there's a little bit of a timing lag on recognizing some of the market prices. Maybe pre-sell some volume a little bit ahead of time. Is that the case and is that something that we should just expect going forward? And could you kind of quantify how much of a lag there might be? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, there clearly is a lag and especially in strong markets like we had in the first quarter. With extended order files the lag tends to be maybe, if anything, a little longer than normal. But what I would tell you as we've moved into the second quarter, prices have continued to improve. As I indicated earlier, current prices for OSB more than 10% \u2013 ARC (50:19) realizations are up more than 10% versus the first quarter average. And we've also seen a nice improvement in lumber prices with quarter to-date lumber prices up roughly $30 versus the first quarter average. So, you're exactly right. There is a lag, but it is ultimately realized and the lag is a little longer when you're at the situation where you have extended order files, which is a good thing. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks for the help there. Just sticking with Wood Products, really good engineered wood product volumes. Just wondering if any of that, in your mind, had to do with pre-buying ahead of the price increases that are out there in the market for the spring? And just wondering if that would have been a factor in the strong volumes. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I think that may have been a small factor. I think it was more driven by what we've seen on the housing front, Brian, but I can't tell you there wasn't any pre-buying. But as we move through the second and third quarters I indicated earlier, we will fully capture the 7% to 10% price increase that's being put in place. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then switching gears, you made some comments at the Investor Day back in December about the dividend just kind of reevaluating the payout ratio and how you and the board would think about it going forward. It's been a while since we've gotten a change in the dividend. Just wondering about your updated thoughts on it and timing and how that strategy is coming together. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. So, as we've consistently said, we are committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. With 90% of our assets in Timberlands and a significantly improved cost structure for Wood Products. Our go-forward cash flow will be much more stable than it's been historically. We continue to work with our board on the appropriate payout ratio and the timing for increasing the dividend going forward. And as you would expect the board factors in many things when considering the appropriate dividend level, including the pace of improvement in housing, Southern saw logs and Wood Products as well as the benefits from our internal initiatives for operational excellence and operational synergies. So, that's how we're currently thinking about it. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: And in terms of timing, is there a particular meeting within the year where the board takes it up or pay special attention to it? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: We have no specific cadence in terms of our dividend review. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Great. Just one last one for Russell, if I could, on the \u2013 the working capital seemed a little bit \u2013 like a little bit of a bigger use of cash than historical. Maybe that's due a little bit with the Plum Creek in there, but I know that had to do with the taxes coming out of the Cellulose Fiber sale. But just wondering about your thoughts on for the full year how you think working capital will be a source or use of cash or maybe flat? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I would expect it to be pretty consistent with the prior years. You're right. We did have probably an increase in working capital just because of the addition of the Plum Creek lands. We have inventory builds in the North, particularly in Montana, which would mean you'd see an increase in some working capital in the first quarter which we saw. But I wouldn't expect anything out of the ordinary for the remainder of the year. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. I'd now like to turn the call back over to Doyle Simons for closing remarks. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: As I understand, that was our final question. And I just like to close by thanking everybody for joining us this morning. And, as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect.",

George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Krista Kochivar, Director of Finance and Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Krista Kochivar - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer, and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Krista, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $24 million or $0.03 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding after-tax special items of $188 million, we earned $212 million or $0.28 per diluted share. This is more than 1.5 times the earnings from continuing operations we reported in second quarter 2016, and an increase of about 27% from first quarter 2017. After-tax special items for the quarter include a $147 million noncash impairment charge related to the sale of our Uruguay operations, a $31 million charge for Flak Jacket remediation, $8 million for softwood lumber duties and $2 of merger-related cost. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $506 million, an improvement of 23% compared with second quarter 2016 and over 11% compared with first quarter 2017. Each of our businesses delivered strong second quarter operating results with Wood Products leveraging improving markets and ongoing operational excellence initiatives to achieve record adjusted EBITDA in the quarter. In addition, in the quarter, we announced the pending sale of the Uruguay operations, completed the asset value optimization process for our Western timberlands, and eliminated roughly two-thirds of the $35 million of costs formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business, and continue to expect to eliminate the remaining cost by the end of the year. Before covering our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. Housing starts continue to move higher. After a robust start to the year, the pace of starts slowed early in the second quarter before picking back up again in June. Year-to-date, total housing starts are up approximately 4% and single-family starts are up 8%. Leading market indicators remain favorable. Employment and wages are rising, consumer confidence continues to be strong, and mortgage rates decreased from first quarter levels. Single-family permits are up 9% compared to last year and we are seeing especially strong single-family building activity in California and in the South. We expect total housing starts of approximately 1.25 million in 2017. Let me now turn to our business segments. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands' contribution to earnings before special items was $135 million, $13 million less than the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $222 million. Western Timberlands delivered $124 million of second quarter EBITDA, a decrease of $9 million compared with first quarter but an increase of $10 million compared to a year ago. The market for Western domestic logs remained strong in the second quarter, supported by robust building activity in the West and low mill inventories. Log supply remained tight as record rainfall in the Pacific Northwest continued throughout the second quarter. Domestic log sales volumes and realizations increased slightly compared with the first quarter and road and forestry costs increased seasonally even though we deferred some of the projects as a result of the wet weather. Turning now to our export markets, in Japan through May, total housing starts increased 2% compared to the prior year, while post-and-beam starts were up 4%. Our log sales volumes decreased slightly due to the timing shipments and average realizations were comparable to the first quarter. In China, market conditions remain favorable and log sales volumes and average realizations increased compared to the first quarter. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined slightly again in June and remain within a normalized range. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $91 million to second quarter EBITDA, $5 million lower than the first quarter which benefited from seasonal seedling sales. Fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared with the first quarter and average log realizations were unchanged. Northern Timberlands contributed $2 million to EBITDA, a decrease of $6 million compared with the first quarter as fee harvest volumes declined seasonally due to spring breakup. Average realizations were higher as a result of a mix shift to a greater percentage of hardwood. The Timberlands business made good progress on its operational and excellence initiatives in the second quarter. Regional teams continue to implement best practices for harvesting and transportation. Optimizing wood flows over a larger footprint allows our teams to minimize cost and increase realizations. The business remains on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017. Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real Estate and ENR contributed $23 million to second quarter earnings and $37 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA declined by $6 million compared with first quarter but improved $9 million compared with the second quarter of last year. During the second quarter, our real estate team completed the asset value optimization or AVO process review on our 2.9 million acres of Western timberlands. The AVO process identified approximately 365,000 acres where we expect to capture our targeted premiums to the underlying timberland values. We will bring these properties to market over time including some in the second half of this year. Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contribution to earnings before special items was $238 million in the second quarter, an increase of 38% over the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $67 million to $274 million, an increase of 32%. EBITDA for lumber totaled $127 million, $28 million more than the first quarter, due to a 7% increase in average sales realizations and a 5% increased in lumber sales volumes. EBITDA for OSB totaled $87 million, $21 million more than the first quarter and more than double the second quarter of 2016. Average sales realizations increased 12% and sales volumes were comparable to the first quarter. All of our OSB mills ran extremely well again in the second quarter. Engineered wood products contributed $52 million to EBITDA, an improvement of $15 million over the first quarter. Average sales realizations increased for all products during the second quarter. We also captured a larger percentage of the February price increase in the quarter than we are originally anticipated. Distribution EBITDA totaled $13 million, an increase of $5 million compared with the first quarter and an increase of $4 million compared to the second quarter of last year. The distribution business remains focused on margin improvement and controlling operating and selling cost. Each of the Wood Products businesses is making good progress on their respective OpEx initiatives through the first half of the year. We continue to expect collective operational excellence benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017. I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On June 26, the Department of Commerce announced preliminary antidumping duties on Canadian lumber producers. For most producers, the duty will be approximately 7%, and will also be assessed retroactively. The antidumping duties are additive to the countervailing duties which were announced at the end of April. Combined, these duties average between 25% to 30% for most producers. The government will continue its investigation through the remainder of the year as the Department of Commerce and International Trade Commission collect and evaluate additional information in support final determinations of the duties and the level of material injury to U.S. producers. These determinations are expected later this year. The U.S. Coalition [U.S. Lumber Coalition] continues to work closely with the Department of Commerce and we remain hopeful we will be able to reach a quota-based agreement. Before I turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook, let me touch on the Flak Jacket issue we disclosed last week, as well as an update on capital allocation. Regarding Flak Jacket, our top priority is to take care of our customers and their customers. We're working proactively to quickly implement solutions and remediation is already underway or completed in over 100 houses. We've halted all production sales and shipments of these products and we are collecting unused products from our customers. We are absolutely committed to doing the right thing and resolving this situation as quickly as possible. Finally, capital allocation. Since converting to a REIT in 2010, we have communicated a target pay-out ratio of 75% of our funds available for distribution over the cycle. Following the merger with Plum Creek and the divestiture of our Cellulose Fibers business, it is clear to us and to our board that Weyerhaeuser's cash flow profile is significantly different than it was in 2010. After divesting of our home building and Cellulose Fibers business, doubling our timberland holdings, and significantly improving the cost structure of our Wood Products operation, our cash flow is more stable and predictable. Considering these factors, we have determined that the company no longer requires the level of retained cash flow implied by a 75% pay-out ratio and we have made the decision to increase our target pay-out ratio to 85% over a cycle. Going forward the board will continue to regularly review the dividend in light of a full range of external market conditions as well as for internal improvements. We expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase will be improving pricing for Southern saw logs, as that will generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream to provide strong support for the dividend over time. Now let me turn it over Russell to discuss our third quarter outlook. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be slighter lower compared to second quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations, with fee harvest volumes expected to decrease modestly compared to the second quarter. Japanese export log volumes will increase, while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher compared to the second quarter, supported by continued strong demand in Japanese housing market. Export log volumes to China are also expected to increase, with slightly higher average sales realizations. Third quarter domestic log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the second quarter, with lower sales volumes. Western road spending was deferred due to record wet weather in the second quarter. Spending in the third quarter will increase as we expect to complete the deferred road work in addition to our typical summer road activities. Logging costs are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, because we tend to log in higher elevations during the summer. In the South, we expect higher harvest volumes if the weather improves from a very wet second quarter. We anticipate average sales realizations for the third quarter will be comparable to second quarter levels. Silviculture spending in the South is expected to increase due to seasonality as well as weather-related deferral of activities from the second quarter into the third quarter. In the North, we anticipate third quarter sales volumes to be significantly higher than the second quarter, as we move past the spring breakup season. Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to nearly double in the third quarter as compared to the second quarter and continue to ramp up in the fourth quarter, which is when we typically expect the largest portion of the real estate transactions to close. We continue to expect over $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017. Turning to Wood Products, we anticipate third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to second quarter. Strong demand and low inventories throughout the supply chain have led to continued strong July pricing for lumber, OSB and engineered wood products. Overall, we expect comparable quarter-over-quarter lumber sales realizations and slightly higher OSB and engineered wood product sales realizations. Sales volumes are expected to be consistent in lumber and engineered wood products with a slight decrease in OSB. Looking at chart 10, unallocated items. The $26 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with the first quarter is primarily the result of a $14 million reduction in non-operating pension and other post-retirement benefit costs. In the second quarter of each year, we finalize prior year-end estimates. And as a result of this work, we now expect to record approximately $15 million per quarter of unallocated non-operating pension and post-retirement expense for a total of $60 million in 2017. Our total anticipated cash payments for pension and post-retirement remains unchanged at $70 million for all of 2017 with no funding required for our U.S. qualified pension plan. Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $701 million, an increase of $246 million from the first quarter. Cash from operations during the quarter was $489 million, an increase of $454 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $87 million. We continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $135 million for Timberlands. Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with $6.6 billion. Earlier this week, we completed refinancing of our $550 million term loan, which was scheduled to mature in 2020, replacing it with a new $225 million term loan maturing in 2026, and prepaying $325 million in cash. In addition to this refinancing, we also have a scheduled bond maturity of $281 million in August of 2017. Interest expense was $100 million in the quarter. The repayment of the August maturity, which has an interest rate of 6.95% will reduce interest expense by approximately $20 million annually. We anticipate full year 2017 tax rate will be between 15% and 17% based on the forecasted mix of earnings from our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. Now, I'll turn the call back to Doyle, and look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Russell. Looking forward, we are extremely well positioned to continue to capitalize on the improving housing market and remain relentlessly focused on driving value for our shareholders through operational excellence and disciplined capital allocation. And with that, I'd like to open up the floor for your questions. Operator : And your first question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Southern log prices were flat quarter-over-quarter. I think that's first quarter since 2015 that prices weren't down sequentially. I was just wondering if you could talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in Southern log markets, are you seeing price stabilization or improvement, or was that just mix? Any kind of additional color you could give there would be helpful. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. Anthony, and what we're seeing in the South is, just as you said, flat saw log pricing. At this point, we do not expect any significant improvement in saw log pricing in the third quarter. We would anticipate it would be flat with Q2. But as we move forward, we do see some potential for some pricing traction as we enter into 2018. If housing demand continues to grow, as you very well know, there's more capacity that's being put in place in the South. The Canadian share of U.S. lumber market, we believe, is going to decline due to either the duties or hopefully a negotiated agreement. And the other thing I would tell you that we're encouraged about is that the export markets out of the South are starting to grow and, in fact, we recently signed a contract for weekly shipments to India. We are also sending weekly shipments to an existing Western customer in China. So we think that has the potential to grow over time. So all of those things we think will ultimately lead to improvement in Southern saw log prices as we move forward. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Got it. And understood it's a probably very relatively small amount, but is it possible to quantify export shipments out of the South or maybe where you think they could be by the end of the year? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, so like I said, we're encouraged. It is a small amount at this point in time but we think over time it could grow to 400 to 500 containers a week, which would be, just to give you a sense, equivalent to a small sawmill. So that will make a difference in the marketplace. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then just following up on the quota. There have been press reports the DOC might be near a quota that would cap Canadian share at 27% or 28%. I was just wondering if you could give any more color about your preference for a quota versus continuation of duties, and just striking the right balance between resolving the issue quickly but also making sure that your concerns and the Lumber Coalition's [U.S. Lumber Coalition] concerns are adequately addressed? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, and as we've said, Anthony, the U.S. Coalition continues to work very closely with the Department of Commerce and we remain hopeful we'll be able to reach a quota-based agreement and we like the certainly of a negotiated agreement. However, as we've also said, we want the right agreement. And if we don't get that, we'll let the process continue to play out in terms of the duties. So, again, a lot of discussions going on. We continue to be hopeful of a negotiated quota-based agreement which we think would be the best outcome. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Hey, good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Gail. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : I guess just staying on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, I guess the preliminary duties phase out in August and there could be a gap between final duties, just how do you expect \u2013 any sense how customers might react to that? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: That's a good question, Gail. As you very well know, we've seen a improvement in lumber prices that's \u2013 so let me say it this way, the overall trend in lumber prices that we've seen, we think has ultimately been driven by supply and demand. And that's due to the fact that inventories are lean and demand continues to be strong. On top of that, we've seen that exacerbated a little bit by the fires over the past few weeks. The way I see it, the uncertainty around the SLA has driven the volatility in pricing but the overall pricing trend has been driven by fundamentals of supply and demand. As the countervailing duty goes off in August, I think we'll continue to see volatility in pricing as that happens. Exactly how that will play out, we'll just have to wait and see, but again encouraged by the underlying supply and demand dynamics. And we're just going to have to see how the SLA plays out going forward and specifically what impact that has at the end of August when the CVD lapses for a short period of time. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : All right, thank you. And can you give a little bit of perspective, I guess Southern Yellow Pine was weaker than SPF, and just how you see that relationship building over the next couple quarters? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, so you're exactly right, those kind of got out of sync during the quarter. I think there were a number of drivers of that, part of it was the duties that have come into place, part of it was FX, and with the Canadian dollar strengthening versus the U.S. dollar. And then of course the fires that have impacted BC over the past few weeks. So I think all of those things resulted in the relative change in SPF to Southern Yellow Pine. I think going forward, you'll see the normal gap that we've normally seen between those come back to normal as those factors play out. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : All right. And just to go to the guidance, you mentioned, I think, that you expected a little bit of improvement in Japanese log prices in 3Q, is that correct? And I'm just curious because I thought log volumes showed a little bit of pressure in June. I'm just wondering if you could give a little more color on the competitive dynamics you're seeing in Japan? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure, and as we said in our comments, we continue to be encouraged by what we see overall in Western log markets, and domestic markets demand continues to be strong, primarily driven by what we've seen in the California market. In Japan specifically, to your point, post-and-beam construction continues to grow at about 4%. And in the third quarter, we do anticipate kind of steady demand and potentially slightly higher prices in the third quarter. So, that's how we see Japan. And then China, as you know, inventory continues to be in very good shape, 3.5 million cubic meters, and there we expect higher volume and slightly higher prices in the third quarter as well. That's how we see the export markets. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. One just really quickly one. You mentioned that you're doing one just really quick one. You mentioned that you're doing weekly deliveries to a customer in the China out of the South, is that cannibalizing the business that you have from the West at all? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Business out of the West is very strong right now, as I just indicated, and in fact, total log imports into China from the U.S. are up 35% year-to-date. So, the amount that we are sending into China is an existing customer, but it's both a growth in overall volume as well as displacing a little bit out of the West. But we're fine with displacing a little bit out of the West based on the strong markets that we see in China. Gail S. Glazerman - Roe Equity Research : Okay. Thanks so much. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Mark. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Good morning. Wanted to follow up a little bit on the change in the dividend policy and the tying to Southern saw log pricing over the long-term. Should we understand by that that there could be modest or moderate increases in the divided prior to the recovery in Southern saw log pricing? And then you can get bigger ones when there is visibility on that recovery or is it that there really likely wouldn't be any dividend increases until you saw that recovery? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Mark, as we've said, the board's going to continue to review the dividend. It's going to consider all conditions, external market conditions as well as internal improvements and things we're doing. As you very well know, our largest asset is our Southern Timberlands, and very purposeful, we've said we expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase will be improving pricing for Southern saw logs. Because that's what's going to ultimately generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream that would provide additional strong support for the dividend over time. So that's the way we're looking at it and the board is looking at it. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And I realize this is a really tough one. But do you have any \u2013 what's your perspective on the potential timing of that recovery in Southern saw timber pricing now versus where your thought process would have been previously? And what drivers are \u2013 are there any meaningfully different drivers? And I realize you addressed this in some of your preliminary comments, but any additional color you could give would be welcomed. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure, Mark. And we continue to expect improvement in Southern saw log pricing as we move forward for all the reasons that I highlighted. Housing demand continuing to grow, we're encouraged by what we see there. Continued investment in the South and even yesterday or whatever it was, the announcement of a acquisition by one of our Canadian friends in the South and believe that they will spend additional capital to ramp up production there. We'll see whether we get a quota or the duties stay in place, but that's going to be helpful. And then, again on the margin, we talked about in the export market. So hard to tell exactly when, but we think as we move into 2018 as housing starts grow to north of 1.3 million, that we could reach the inflection point where we start to see some improvement in Southern saw log prices. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. That's very helpful. And then, just lastly, curious why do you prefer quotas over duties? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, Mark, the reason we like the quotas versus the duties, is it's simple, it's effective, and we think it'll allow the U.S. industry to grow to its natural size. Now, with that said, if we can't get the right agreement in place, we can make the duties work as well. But we just like the certainty of having a duty in place. Everybody understands exactly what that is, and then go forward based on that. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Good morning, Doyle, good morning, Russell. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Mark. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Doyle, let's just come back to that Softwood Lumber Agreement one more time. I'm just curious, if we don't get a deal in the next few weeks, and then we're in a point where we've reopened these NAFTA negotiations, is that going to kind of preclude getting a deal done on lumber until NAFTA is redone? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Mark, it's hard to answer that question, because we don't know exactly how that's going to play out. I do think if the SLA gets drug into NAFTA that could prolong our ability to reach a negotiated agreement, but there's just a lot of uncertainty exactly how the SLA will interplay with NAFTA at this point. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): You have a guess on your side? I mean, I think we're all kind of scratching our head. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I don't. Yeah, and I wish I could provide more clarity, Mark, but we're kind of scratching our head too just because it's just an unknown. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. The second question I had, Doyle, I know you guys have been very focused on kind of integrating Plum Creek. I'm curious as to whether you think you're at a point where you might start to look at some meaningful acquisitions. There is a lot of timberland that's potentially in the market over the next year or two. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Mark, as we've consistently said, our priorities number one, two and three have been the integration of Plum Creek. We've made very good progress on that, and I'm pleased with where we are. As we move forward, we would potentially look at timberland acquisitions but, as we've also said, the beauty of our portfolio is we are very well positioned and we don't have to grow anywhere. So with that said, we can be very, very disciplined in looking at potential timberlands acquisitions. If we find opportunities that we think will drive shareholder value, that's something we would consider. Otherwise, we'll just continue to focus on what we can do internally to continue to drive improvements in our overall performance and shareholder value. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. That's fair. Last question I had, Doyle. Just any more color on options around fireproofing on the I-joists, the thing that I think Flak Jacket was an attempt to deal with? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Mark, right now \u2013 I'm sorry, go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Well, I was just going to say, and I'd also like to get a sense if I could about how big, how many markets that that really is an issue in right now, because I think a lot of this is state-by-state regulation? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: It is state-by-state regulation, Mark. And our focus right now, as you would anticipate, is making sure we're doing everything we can with our customers to resolve the situation with Flak Jacket. As we move forward, we'll be determining how we want to proceed on any future product that would have this fire retardant material. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay, fair enough. Good luck in the second half of the year, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Hi, good morning, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Chip. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah, I had a question just on \u2013 first question is, a few weeks ago, we saw that one of the large privately held wood products companies is announcing an engineered wood facility in South Carolina. And I know you've seen a great improvement in your results in that business, but my perception is that's mostly internally driven, not really market driven. So what are your thoughts about that? Do you think the market can handle that addition to capacity? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: You know, Chip, and thanks for making your comment on the internal improvements and clearly part of the improved performance in WP has been internal improvements. But with that said, those markets are also improving. As you very well know, we put in a price increase. That was in February. We saw a significant benefit of that in second quarter. We'll see a little bit more benefit from that in the third quarter. And I just give that background to say as housing continues to improve, we as an industry will need some additional capacity. Now, how that matches up when this mill comes online and it will take a while to get this mill online. As you very well know, startup takes a while. How that meshes with where we are exactly on housing starts remains to be seen, but as housing continues to improve and gets to 1.4 million, 1.5 million, 1.6 million, whatever the number is, there will be additional capacity that will be needed in engineered wood products. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And I don't know, either you or Russell, what are your thoughts about the \u2013 you mentioned that obviously the board is going to think about how to approach the dividend in terms of the ongoing rate. But you know it's interesting, obviously the saw timber tie-in in the South makes total sense because saw timber prices of course tend to be a lot more stable than wood products. But you still have this great Wood Products business that's doing very well. Now, I know other companies, one specifically for years has practiced sort of a variable dividend. And then there is another one who yesterday said that they are considering that, just because that is obviously more appropriate given the volatility you have there. Would that be something that you personally would consider or recommend to the board as an override to the ongoing quarterly dividend in years or periods where the wood business is particularly strong? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, this is Russell. As Doyle said, our objective is a growing and sustainable dividend over time. Clearly, the Wood Products business is performing well. We are pinned on Southern saw log as being the catalyst. However, we would take into consideration depending on where the market is at, but our primary focus is growing a steady dividend over time. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Got you. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A.D. [D.A. Davidson] Please go ahead. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks, good morning. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Steve. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: I recognize it was a wet spring here in the West, but it sure has been hot and dry in the last month, so are any of your Western lands now operating under harvest restrictions? And is that incorporated into your Timberlands guidance? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: It's a good question, and you're right, it was a very wet spring and now, at least where we live, we haven't seen rain in a month or so. So, at this point in terms of Washington and Oregon, nothing is under a fire restriction at this point in time, but as we all know, that could change quickly as we move forward. So basically, what's incorporated, Steve, in our guidance is kind of what I would call a normal fire season, if there is such a thing. If that changes, you could see further restriction or further tightening, I would say, of log markets in the Pacific Northwest. I would mention in Montana, we do have restrictions in place and no logging at this point in time is allowed after 1 PM. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Yeah, I kind of thought we might be going to Hoot here soon. Okay. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thank you very much. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: It very well could happen. Steven Pierre Chercover - D. A. Davidson & Co.: Thanks. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investments. Please go ahead. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : The first question I have is as land sales pick up in the back half of the year, will there be much change in the mix or will realizations per acre be similar to the first half of the year? Just I noticed that realizations were up nicely in the first half. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: James, this is Russell. As Doyle mentioned, we completed the Western analysis for our AVO or asset value optimization. And we're very pleased with those results and so we'll see some of those acres coming into the market in the second half of the year. As we indicated, third quarter will be double second and then we'll see a ramp-up in the fourth quarter. Those properties will have a higher value than the Southern or the Northern properties. So you may see a change in the average per acre value coming through the program. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : Okay, that helps. And then on EWP, switching gears, you mentioned that you had more price realization in the second quarter than you expected, could you comment on how much you expect to get remaining in the third quarter? And will that be it for the February price increase or will some bleed into the fourth quarter? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, so in the second quarter, we realized about 70% of the price increase which, as we mentioned, was higher than we originally anticipated. In the third quarter, we would anticipate an additional 20% and then the balance, the 10%, to show up in the fourth quarter. So that's kind of how we see it playing out. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : Perfect. Thank you very much. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Hi, good morning, guys. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Just following up on the use of cash line of questions. Looks like you have a balance sheet that's up to about $700 million of cash, and you should get some proceeds from the Uruguay sale soon. Just wondering how share repurchases might fit into the capital reallocation strategy? And as you're contemplating where to move the dividend in a sustainable way, if share repurchases could be a solution to \u2013 a little bit of a release valve for some of that cash that's building up on the balance sheet? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. And as we've consistently said in terms of our priorities for capital allocation, first and foremost is returning cash to shareholders. That'll be primarily through a growing and sustainable dividend. But Brian, as we've indicated, we're also open to share repurchase where appropriate and, as you know, we currently have a authorization of $500 million in terms of share repurchase. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And then one \u2013 I see you chose to exclude the $11 million duties from the Wood Products adjusted EBITDA. I just wonder in the thought process there, if you guys are viewing that as a one-time thing in nature, maybe because they'll lapse at the end of August or they'll eventually be replaced by a quota? And then maybe could you clarify, is that $11 million tied to the actual lumber sales in the quarter or was there some impact from 1Q sales due to the retroactive nature of the duties? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, Brian you're \u2013 this is Russell \u2013 correct, we did put that as a special item and there's two components. One is the retroactive countervailing duties and then the go-forward countervailing and antidumping duties. And so we do view those as pretty unique relative to the overall lumber operations and that's why we put it in the special items. And then you're correct, it will drop off in August 28, until there is an actual final determination and then the duties are reinstated. So it'll be a little lumpy coming through if we put it into the operations. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And if we were to think about what an actual, theoretically if the duties did stay at the current levels, and actual expense in the quarter would have been something closer to $6 million or $7 million instead of the $11 million? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, probably $6 million to $7 million. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. And the one last one from me, we've seen a big move in the Canadian dollar in the last couple of weeks and months. Could you remind us the impact to your earnings, every $0.01 or so move in the $1 might have? And then thinking beyond just the translation impact, any impact you might expect on trade flows from that? And historically have you seen Canadian imports of lumber dry up a little bit and a little bit more production shift to the U.S. when this has happened? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, we noted that the change in the relationship on the FX for the Canadian dollar and the U.S. dollar, but we've been operating in a relatively strong dollar environment and we don't really see material impacts on those interquarter shifts. So we really don't look at what is the impact on a per $0.01 shift on that. So we don't think there'll be a material change in the inflows, it'll really be a primarily driven by the SLA and then also some of the restrictions resulting from fires up in Canada. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co.: Okay. Thanks very much. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Yeah, thanks very much. Morning, Russell and morning, Doyle. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Paul. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Morning, Paul. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Just thanks for the updated pay-out ratio that you targeted $0.85, I understand the catalyst is on Southern log price movement. Just on that question, we had a lot of deferrals in the U.S. South following the recession in 2008 to probably 2014, just wondering what your assessment is of the current growth versus drain in the overall South? Are we harvesting more than the trees are growing down there, and when do you think we'll start to see some tension in the market? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Paul this is Russell. As we look in the South, again as Doyle mentioned, with continued strength in the housing market and continued increase in production, we're definitely seeing some rebalancing in some wood baskets. And I expect that as we continue to see the housing market recover and less Canadian volume coming into the U.S. market, we'll see those pensioned (44:22) over time. But it's not consistent across the entire South, but we're definitely seeing some benefits, particularly in the Atlantic South where those markets are starting to tension. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. And then just on the guidance, when you guys for Q3 when you're guiding for Timberlands to be slightly down, is that like a 5% number and then one of the things that surprised me was the lower fee harvest volumes expected in the West and what's the result of that? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, in terms of the guidance we said slightly so I would say that 5% or less in terms of what that would mean in terms of dollars. And then in terms of the lower harvest in the West that's primarily due just to timing. As you know, a lot of what we call farmer wood comes on the market in the quarter, which can have a negative impact on pricing. We tend to back off during that period of time and then capitalize when pricing tends to be a little bit better. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then just lastly, just on this potential Softwood Lumber deal, I'm pretty aware what happens in Canada on this side. Just it seems like a black box in terms of the Coalition's acceptance of the deal. Maybe you could give us some broad strokes, is that a two-thirds vote requirement and is that on a volume weighted basis for lumber producers in the U.S.? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, Paul, what I would tell you is the Lumber Coalition continues to be very united in terms of the approach on the Softwood Lumber Agreement, and is united behind, as we mentioned earlier, a quota-based agreement. So, I think if a deal can be negotiated that works for both sides, that's something that the U.S. Lumber Coalition would in fact support. Paul Quinn - RBC Dominion Securities, Inc.: All right. That's all I had. Best of luck. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: All right. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with the Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, George. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : How're you doing? If I had one last quick one on SLA, recognizing that it might not be something you really want to get into. But just for the record, what do you think the odds are that, as there has been some speculation, that there might be an agreement before the NAFTA discussions begin middle of next month. And to the extent that you can comment at all, has there been a significant narrowing in your view of the bid-ask spread in terms of the quotas that both sides have seemingly wanted to apply? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: George, as you know, there have been a lot of discussions and negotiations between the parties, and what I would tell you is we do in fact remain hopeful that some type of framework can be agreed on before we get into this NAFTA issue. Trying handicap it would be just pure speculation. But again, we do remain hopeful, and we think some progress has been made. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. No, Doyle, that's actually quite helpful. Thank you for that. Russell, quick one for you. Remind me the basis for the land sales the rest of the year, what should we be modeling for, for the segment? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: George, I'd say the basis is probably 40% to 50% for the full year. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. And then, back to the question of supply coming into the market, and recognizing, one, that it's ultimately good for the Timberlands business and hopefully the Southern business in terms of saw log pricing, and pulpwood pricing, and then also that your view is going to be ultimately that housing growth will absorb the capacity coming on. There has been a lot of capacity announced, as mentioned earlier, you have the EWP facility going up in Southern Carolina. You have the lumber projects in South Carolina and Northern Carolina, Florida, and you have an OSB announcement of a restart, I think today. Which of those markets do you feel have the most ability to absorb the oncoming capacity? And which would give you maybe a little bit of caution in terms of the absorption rate, at least initially, and why and why not? Thank you, guys, and good luck in the quarter. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, George. And what I would tell you is going from the ones I think have the most ability to absorb to where it may be a little lumpier in terms of absorption, I would say first is lumber. I think this additional lumber capacity is going to be needed and it's going to be absorbed without significant disruptions or potentially any disruption to the market. EWP, I talked about. We talked about it a little bit earlier, and we think as housing continues to grow, additional EWP capacity is going to be required and that capacity that's been announced is still quite a bit out in terms of when that will come online. And then finally OSB. As we know, OSB tends to come on in big chunks and I think clearly we need additional capacity, the industry probably needs additional capacity as OSB markets are tight and housing continues to grow. And we'll just have to see how that production phases in. One thing I would note is new mills, it always takes longer to start them up than most people factor in. And then some of these are restarts of mills that have been down for a very extended period of time. It will take some time to ramp those up as well. So that's how we think about the additional capacity that's slated to come online. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And then on that latter point, Doyle, you'd say six months to a year in terms of the startup curve for an OSB mill restarting? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: That's probably as good as any, George. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Thank you, guys. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : At this time, there are no further questions. Please continue with any closing remarks. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I'd just like to close by thanking everyone for joining us this morning and, as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude Weyerhaeuser second quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth L. Baum - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $130 million, or $0.17 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.9 billion. Our third quarter results include after-tax special items of $129 million, primarily related to previously announced charges for product remediation. Excluding these special items, we earned $259 million, or $0.34 per diluted share for the third quarter. This is an improvement of over 20% compared with second quarter 2017 and 50% higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $569 million, 12% more than the second quarter and over 30% higher than one year ago. I am very pleased with our third quarter operating performance. Employees across the company worked together to overcome a variety of weather-related challenges and each of our businesses delivered strong operating results including another record quarter for Wood Products adjusted EBITDA. We also continue to deliver on our efforts to simplify our operations and strategically optimize our Timberland portfolio by completing the sale of our Uruguay operations for over $400 million and then October redeeming our ownership interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and announcing an agreement to sell 100,000 acres of non-strategic Southern Timberlands for $225,000 per acre. We have also eliminated over 80% of the cost formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business and remain on track to achieve the full $35 million of reductions by year-end. Before I discuss our business results, let me make a few brief comments regarding the housing market. The U.S. housing market continues its upward trajectory. Although September housing starts weakened sequentially as hurricane suspended construction activity, single family starts rose 6% year-over-year in September and are up over 9% year-to-date. With construction labor temporarily drawn to the repairing model activity to support hurricane recovery efforts, we now expect total housing starts of approximately $1.2 million in 2017. With continued favorable housing market fundamentals including solid single-family permit activity, strong builder confidence, rising employment and wages, and consumer confidence at 13 year highs, we continue to anticipate steady improvement in the housing market for several years to come. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with timberlands, charts 3 to 5. Timberlands contributed $131 million to earnings before special items compared with $135 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $220 million. Western Timberlands delivered $111 million third quarter EBITDA, $13 million lower than the second quarter but $2 million more than a year ago. Fee harvest volumes declined 16% compared with the second quarter. Mandatory state fire restrictions limited working hours for our Washington and Oregon crews in July and August and forced us out of the woods completely for up to two weeks in September. This year's Western fire season was extremely severe, but we experienced no material damage to our timberlands. All Western Timberlands employees did an outstanding job of proactively assessing fire risk and rapidly deploying resources as needed, and less than 1,000 of our 2.9 million Western acres were affected. The severe fire season limited log availability, driving strong Western domestic market conditions throughout the quarter. Mill inventories remain tight and pricing for domestic logs improved moderately due to continued steady demand. Export demand also remained favorable, with higher log sales volumes and realizations across all markets. In Japan, year-to-date housing starts have risen 1% through August and post-and-beam starts are up 2%. Our customers log and finished product inventories are relatively low and demand for our logs remains solid. In China, demand is steady and pricing strengthened as customers competed against strong demand from U.S. domestic buyers. Log inventories at Chinese ports were stable throughout the quarter and remain within a normal range. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $95 million to third quarter EBITDA, $4 million more than the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased compared with the second quarter but were modestly lower than planned as most Southern regions lost a few production days due to hurricane activity. We experienced no material damage to our Southern lands and our employees and contractors did an excellent job of safely staging equipment to avoid damage, and enable crews to resume operations as quickly as possible. Overall Southern market conditions improved during the third quarter as wet weather limited log availability, and Southern sawlog realizations increased slightly compared with second quarter. Our average log realizations were comparable to second quarter as third quarter included a higher proportion of pulpwood due to seasonal thinning activity. Forestry cost increased slightly. Northern Timberlands contributed $4 million to EBITDA, $2 million more than the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased seasonally, but were less than planned as mandatory fire restrictions curtailed harvest activity in Montana for nearly six weeks. Average realizations declined due to mix. Timberlands continues to make strong progress on its operational excellence initiatives and is well positioned to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2017. Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts 6 and 7. Real estate and ENR contributed $47 million to third quarter earnings, an improvement of $24 million compared with second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA doubled to $74 million. The average price per acre sold was lower than second quarter, as third quarter included a large sale of lower value Montana acres. Wood Products, charts 8 and 9. Wood Products contributed $241 million to third quarter earnings before special items, an increase of $3 million compared with second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA improved $4 million to $278 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $117 million, $10 million lower than the second quarter. Sales volumes declined approximately 4% as we were forced to curtail operations at our Princeton, British Columbia mill for over a month due to a nearby forest fire. Log cost for our Canadian and Western mills also increased. These factors were partially offset by a 2% increase in average lumber sales realizations. Although log availability was challenging in the West due to fires and in the South due to extremely wet weather, our Timberlands and Wood Products teams work together to develop creative solutions and keep our mills running. Our Western operations expensed no log-related downtime in the quarter, and we lost only a few operating shifts across our Southern lumber system. OSB contributed $102 million to EBITDA, $15 million more than the second quarter and nearly $40 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 11% compared with the second quarter. Operating rates and sales volumes declined slightly due to a small increase in planned maintenance downtime. Engineered wood products contributed $50 million to EBITDA compared with $52 million in the second quarter. Manufacturing costs increased due to rising fiber prices for fiber, resin and OSB, and seasonally higher maintenance. This was largely offset by improved sales realizations as we captured most of the remaining benefit from price increases implemented during the first half of this year. Distribution contributed $12 million to third quarter EBITDA, $1 million lower than the second quarter, but $5 million more than third quarter 2016 despite direct hurricane activity in several of our markets. Our Houston, Atlanta and Jacksonville employees did an exceptional job of developing and implementing plans to keep our associates safe and resume operations as fast as possible following Hurricanes Harvey and Irma. All three sites fully rebounded from storms with negligible damage and resumed normal operations within several days. Each of the Wood Products businesses is on track to achieve their respective OpEx initiatives, and we remain confident we will deliver collective benefits of $55 million to $75 million from this segment in 2017. I will now give a brief update on remediation efforts for our Flak Jacket product. We are absolutely committed to doing the right thing to take care of our customers and resolve this situation as quickly as possible. As of yesterday, remediation was complete or underway in over 80% of the affected houses. We expect the vast majority of the work will be completed by year-end with a significant portion of the costs covered by insurance. I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. Through most of the third quarter, Canadian softwood lumber imports were subject to preliminary combined countervailing and antidumping duties of 25% to 30%. On August 25, the countervailing duties which were assessed at approximately 20% for most producers were statutorily suspended pending the International Trade Commission's final determination of injury. U.S. continues to collect preliminary antidumping duties which are assessed at approximately 7% for most producers. The Department of Commerce is collecting and evaluating additional information to support its determination regarding final countervailing and antidumping duty levels. We expect that determination to be released no later than November 14. We anticipate the collection of countervailing duties will resume around year-end following the ITC's final determination regarding material injury to U.S. producers. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the Department of Commerce, and we remain hopeful we will be able to negotiate a quota-based agreement. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter as presented in chart 12 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher compared to third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we anticipate fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be higher than third quarter as we plan to make up most of the third quarter volume loss due to summer fire restrictions. We anticipate domestic sales realizations will increase in the fourth quarter as demand remains solid and mills looked to build inventories in advance of winter weather. Japanese export log sales volumes will increase modestly compared to third quarter volumes while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter supported by continued solid demand in the Japanese housing market. Chinese export log volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Western road spending was delayed in the third quarter due to fire restrictions. Spending in the fourth quarter will increase as we expect to complete the deferred roadwork by year-end. In the South, we expect slightly higher harvest volumes as we make up for volume not harvested in the third quarter due to hurricanes and wet weather. We anticipate average sales realizations for the fourth quarter will be comparable to third quarter results. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase as we deferred activities from the third quarter into the fourth quarter due to wet weather. We also expect hauling costs will increase as we compete with hurricane recovery efforts, which is increasing demand for truck transportation. In the North, we anticipate fourth quarter sales volumes and sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. As Doyle mentioned, on October 12, 2017, we announced the redemption of our ownership interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and the termination of the management agreement, which will occur at year-end. The Twin Creeks activity was reported in Other Timberlands and will no longer be included in our results starting in the fourth quarter. Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to significantly increase as compared to third quarter as the fourth quarter is when we typically expect the largest portion of our real estate transactions to close. We continue to see strong HBU interest in activity across our markets, although transaction volumes in several Southern markets have paused temporarily following hurricane activity. We currently expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy & Natural Resources business in 2017. Turning to Wood Products, we anticipate fourth quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to third quarter. Strong demand and low inventories throughout the supply chain have led to historically strong October pricing for lumber and OSB. Overall, we expect modestly higher quarter-over-quarter lumber and OSB sales realizations, and slightly higher engineered wood product sales realizations. Sales volume for lumber and OSB will be comparable with the third quarter. In addition, we expect a slight increase in log cost for our Western lumber production compared with the third quarter. We expect the decrease in engineered wood products sales volumes in the fourth quarter as well as higher input costs and increase per unit manufacturing cost due to planned seasonal and maintenance downtime. Chart 11 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of nearly $500 million. Cash from operations during the quarter was $323 million. Capital expenditures for the third quarter totaled $97 million. And we continue to expect our full year capital expenditures to total approximately $435 million, $300 million for Wood Products, and $135 million for Timberlands. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending. Investing cash flows for the quarter also included $403 million of proceeds from the sale of our Uruguay operations. Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with $6 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter, we completed the refinancing of our $550 million term loan which was scheduled to mature in 2020, replacing it with a new $225 million term loan maturing in 2026 and prepaying $325 million. In addition, we paid down a scheduled bond maturity of $281 million during the quarter. Interest expense was $98 million in the quarter, a slight decrease from the second quarter due to a lower average balance of debt outstanding that resulted from the debt pay-down during the third quarter. And now, I'll turn it back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Russell. I am proud of our third quarter performance as employees across our businesses and functions once again worked together to overcome challenges and produce strong operating results. Looking forward, we remain focused on delivering continued operational improvements and capturing the full benefit of market conditions to drive value for our shareholders. With that, we would like to open the floor for questions. Operator : And your first question from the line of Mark Weintraub of The Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thank you. Just one sort of maintenance fee type one. The $20 million in other in the unallocated items, was that reversal of LIFO or what was that $20 million? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Mark, this is Russell. That $20 million is really related one-time gains of sale assets and some operational true-ups, so we wouldn't expect that to occur in the fourth quarter. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. Any single significant one or multitude of smaller items? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Really it's multitude of smaller items. We sold some surplus offices and we had some true-ups on some gain calculations. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Okay. And any updated thoughts on Southern saw timber pricing and the outlook for next year. It does seem there's been an acceleration of capacity announcements for additional lumber. And just wanted to get your updated thoughts on where that supply-demand balance in saw timber is and when an inflection point might conceivably be reached and we get some improvement in pricing? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah, Mark. And we do think there's some potential for some pricing traction as we enter 2018, really driven by four things. Number one, as we mentioned, housing demand continues to grow and we are constructive on housing as we move into 2018. Secondly, as you just highlighted, more capacity is being added, and I'm particularly encouraged by number of recent announcements, including GP announced a greenfield mill in Talladega and said they are evaluating potential additions in Georgia, Texas or Mississippi, all of which would be good locations. Canfor said they are going to increase their Southern production by 300 million board feet and they're evaluating a potential greenfield mill in the South. I think this week's announcement of Potlatch and Deltic getting together and their intent to significantly increase lumber production. West Fraser's purchase of Gilman and their plan to increase capital spending, our 300 million board feet of additional capacity at Dierks and Millport that we've talked about. And all of that is on top of about 1.2 billion board feet of additional lumber capacity that's happening in 2017. So, all of that is good on the demand side. The other thing I would point out \u2013 or two other things I'd point out is the Softwood Lumber Agreement. We do fundamentally believe there's going to be less lumber coming in from Canada, either as a result of final duties or hopefully a negotiated agreement. And then the final factor is we're really encouraged by the development of the Southern export markets. We are now shipping to India out of Charleston, South Carolina. We're shipping to China out of the Wilmington, North Carolina. We're continuing to work to develop exports out of other ports including some in the Gulf South. And while it's still early on that, those volumes as we've previously said could be equivalent to a small mill in the 2018 timeframe. So, we think all of those factors are coming together. And as I've said, we are hopeful that we could see some pricing traction on Southern sawlogs beginning in 2018. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: That's super helpful. And lastly tying into that, as you think about the dividend is that mostly going to be determined by what you're expecting to happen in timber profitability? Or the strength that we've had in Wood Products, is that enough that it really does factor into your willingness to move sooner rather than later on the dividend degrees of magnitude? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. So, let me give you some thoughts on that. Yeah. We are as we've said committed to a growing and sustainable dividend. And going forward, the board will continue to regularly review the dividend in light of a full range of external market conditions as well as our internal improvement. As you very well know, our largest asset is our Southern Timberlands, and we expect the biggest driver for a substantial dividend increase, will be improving pricing for Southern sawlogs as we just talked about, as that will generate a sustainable and growing earnings stream that provides strong support for the dividend over time. With that said, there may be opportunities for incremental increases before that occurs. So, that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Mark Weintraub - The Buckingham Research Group, Inc.: Thanks a lot. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: I had a question on the OSB market. Prices have obviously rocketed up following the hurricanes. Can you give us a little color in terms of what you're seeing in the OSB market right now in terms of pricing and demand? And then, in terms of your ability to meet customer demand in 4Q, I think you said sales volumes in 4Q for OSB would be similar to 3Q. I think, normally, those volumes kind of fall seasonally. If you're running involves (24:01) kind of floppish sequentially, is that you're just running at higher operating rates or are you deferring maintenance or debottlenecking some capacity? Just any kind of color you can give on OSB market and your ability to meet customer demand would be helpful? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, you're exactly right. OSB markets have been very strong. And I would tell you current realizations for Weyerhaeuser are approximately $40 above the third quarter average, and that's been primarily driven by just underlying strong demand and thin inventories. Anthony, as we look into the fourth quarter, nothing customary what's going on there. As we said, we did take a little bit of downtime in the third quarter for maintenance. We'll take a little bit in the fourth quarter, but we're not doing anything to try to adjust from a market perspective. That's just how the maintenance fell during the year. But we continue to be optimistic about OSB markets. As we all know, we are moving into a little bit slower seasonal period, so that may have some impact. But we continue to be constructive on OSB markets as we move through the fourth quarter and into next year. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. And then, you announced the Twin Creeks exit earlier this month. Can you remind us why that didn't fit Weyerhaeuser's portfolio versus when Plum Creek entered that JV? And then, when you think about the opportunity to acquire timberlands, are you seeing compelling opportunities in the South, any specific regions, and is valuation an obstacle? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, Anthony. This is Russell. As far as Twin Creeks, you're right, that was originally formed by Plum Creek with institutional investors, and then Silver Creek was the manager of kind of the overall relationship. We did close on that transaction last April. Weyerhaeuser had the property management requirements for that, and then we retained a 21% equity interest. As we look at our 13-million-acre portfolio today and the strength of our balance sheet, we really don't need a structure like that to continue to grow the business. When we had originally \u2013 or when we had closed in April, we shortened the timeframe from the original 15 years that was negotiated by Plum Creek down to three years, with the intent of having a transition out of the venture, and we had the opportunity to exit the venture a little early, and so we took that opportunity. As far as acquiring timberlands. Go ahead. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Yeah. No. Just from here on out, in terms of interest level and opportunities in the South, how do you characterize it? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. We see strong timber pricing in the South. And fortunately, we're in every wood basket in the Southern market. And so we have an opportunity to see really everything that's coming into the market and then everything that's adjacent to us in those markets. So if we see an opportunity to acquire that fits our portfolio and creates shareholder value, we'll pursue that. Anthony Pettinari - Citigroup Global Markets, Inc.: Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Yeah. I'd like to actually, Russell and Doyle, just come back on that last question. I thought a couple of quarters ago that you were suggesting the real focus was on the integration of the two companies rather than acquisitions. Is that view now shifted as you get deeper into the integration of the two companies? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. Good question, Mark. And we're about 18 months into the integration of the two companies. I can tell you at least from my perspective, it has gone very well. We still have some work to do, but most of the hard lifting is behind us. As you know, we exceeded our original synergy target and continue to make improvements by implementing the best practices from each company. So as we look forward, we would consider potentially \u2013 potential acquisitions. With that said, we're going to be very disciplined, Mark, as we move forward. As Russell said, we are in every major market in the South. We have a good presence in the West. So, we don't feel compelled to grow because we are in every market, so we will be very disciplined, and look for opportunities where we can clearly create value for our shareholders through timberland growth opportunities. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): All right. And then, Doyle, just kind of turning to that Southern Lumber issue because you're correct. You pointed out a number of these initiatives that are out there, and from what we understand in the market, there's actually even more behind that potentially. Are you guys looking at any potentially a greenfield or the acquisition of more lumber capacity? Or indeed, what would be your view sort of overall on kind of growing the Wood Products portfolio? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. And so, as we look at potential growth of the company, as we very consistently said, we think our biggest opportunities will be in timberland. With that said, we would absolutely look at what I would call bolt-on acquisitions in the lumber business especially if it met up with our strategic footprint on our timberlands. In terms of growing capacity, I think our bigger opportunities, Mark, will be by investing in our existing mills, things like Dierks and Millport, as opposed to building a greenfield mill. As we look at the return opportunities from those two options, we think that's the best approach for Weyerhaeuser going forward. Mark William Wilde - BMO Capital Markets (United States): Okay. Very good. I'll turn it over, Doyle. Good luck in the fourth quarter. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Mark. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Thank you. Hi, guys. Good morning, and thanks again for the details. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, George. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : How are you doing? I just want to pick up on the lumber capacity question that Mark keyed up. So, as I recall, Dierks and Millport add 8%-9% to your capacity over the next couple of years, and I remember there's one project comes on this year, and then the other one comes on next year. Can you correct me if I'm wrong in any of that? And what ability do you have to flex your existing capacity beyond this project in the 400-million board feet you're getting from it? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, you're right in terms of the timing. Dierks is in the process of coming on now. We'll see the benefit of that in early 2018, and then Millport is later in the year and into 2019. In terms of flexing our existing mills, George, the \u2013 we will continue to work on that. Part of OpEx, of course, is increasing the productivity and the reliability of those mills. And I would tell you we should be able to do that 2% to 3% on an annual basis, and we'll continue to focus on that going forward. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : And, Doyle, on that front, you don't need to add shifts to get there, correct? That's just through improving the reliability, in theory, if you needed to. Even though, I know it's not necessarily a good thing from a safety and operating standpoint. You could add later shifts in the workday or a third shift or something to that effect. Would that be a fair assessment? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: That is a fair assessment. The 2% to 3% is just by running our mills more reliably. As you know, we're spending capital at our mills so that helps in some ways to run our mills more reliably. And that does not include any additional shifts. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. One question, can you let us know where currently realizations in lumber are versus your third quarter average? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. As I mentioned, OSB's current realizations are up $40 versus the third quarter, and lumber is up $15 to $20 versus third quarter levels. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : Okay. Two more, and I'll turn it over. One thing \u2013 if we look at the timber outlook for exports, to Asia in particular, the next several years, are there any specific points that give you encouragement? And the question behind the question is, obviously, you're still largest in terms of your exports to Japan. Japan has been kind of a flat to declining market for U.S. exports, I believe, over time. And Japan has been growing its ability to supply its own timber over time as well. So, key points of optimism, if any, in terms of the Asian export market opportunity, considering what's been going on with Japan? And then, lastly, SG&A, it looks like you're more or less plateauing there after really a very good performance early in the OpEx program. Is there anything left to do there? Thanks. And welcome back, Beth, as well. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. We're all glad to have Beth back, so thanks for that comment. In terms of Japan markets, George, as you know, the big driver for us in Japan is post and beam construction. As we said, that is up roughly 2% year-over-year. That for post and beam construction, they need \u2013 the Japanese need the Doug Fir that we are able to produce and supply. And as you look forward, most projections have overall housing in Japan as you said flat, but post-and-beam construction continuing to grow and we are, by far, the largest supplier to Japanese saw-millers of the Doug Fir that's needed for the post-and-beam construction. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: And then as far as SG&A, as we mentioned, we've achieved $125 million SG&A target and that was related to the costs associated that we're going to remove from the Plum Creek integration. So, we're very pleased that we achieved that target, and then as Doyle mentioned, we're 80% into the $35 million of the SG&A cost related to what we call the stranded costs related to cellulose fibers. So, our $160 million target, we feel we'll meet that target by the end of the year. Going into 2018, we'll have a continued focus on SG&A. Our OpEx efforts in our manufacturing in the timberlands. We have a very similar mindset as it relates to SG&A. So, that's always an area that we will have a lot of focus on and looking for opportunities to improve and reduce those costs. George Leon Staphos - Bank of America Merrill Lynch : All right. Thanks, Russ. That's very helpful. Good luck in the quarter. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : You're next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Hey. Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Collin. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: First question from me, just going back to Mark's question earlier, maybe I'm posing a little bit differently in terms of the dividend policy adjustment to 85% of CAD over the cycle and again the prepare remarks about housing. Just more specifically, Doyle, where do you think the company and how does the Board think about Weyerhaeuser \u2013 where Weyerhaeuser is in terms of the cycle, early, middle, late innings? Just given that there's some moving pieces between the housing outlook, wood product pricing, how do you characterize that in terms of what inning we're in? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. I still think we've got a lot of runway in front of us in terms of housing, Collin. As you very well know, housing, it's historical average, about $1.5 million in starts. This year, we think we're going to be at $1.2 million. So I would say we're in the early to maybe mid-innings in terms of overall \u2013 the overall cycle because, as we all know, it's ultimately going to be driven by housing. And also, as we said in our remarks, we think for a number of years, housing is going to continue to improve. So lots of runway in front of us. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Okay. And then switching to \u2013 thinking about CapEx and again in context of where we are in this cycle. I know, Doyle, in the past, you've kind of talked about some of the capital that has been put into the \u2013 really to the company on couple different fronts, and maybe seeing that kind of peak at this point in the cycle. Is that still consistent with your thinking or just going back to some of the prior questions about the opportunities that you see across the businesses, could maybe there be \u2013 maybe a longer runway of elevated CapEx, just given kind of the cash flow you guys are throwing off right now and maybe some of the opportunities? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. Collin, what I would tell you is we \u2013 our CapEx this year is going to be roughly $435 million, $300 million in wood products and $135 in timberlands. We're still working with the Board, but we would anticipate a similar type number in 2018. And then as we've also said, we think over time, we would see that start to tail off in our wood products business as we complete the projects that we're focused on and deliver on our OpEx initiatives and make our wood products business where it will be black at the bottom. And just to remind everybody, we believe we'll be roughly 85% of the way there by the end of this year. Collin P. Mings - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.: Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks, Doyle. Bye. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Collin. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Hi. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Gail. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : In your comments in terms of the fourth quarter, you mentioned repair and remodel, perhaps stealing some thunder from new home construction, and I'm just wondering kind of how you think that plays out as you move into 2018 because I presume we're not going to finish kind of all that repair work, and labor seems to be pretty tight in the homebuilding side? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. I think if you look at repair and remodeling markets overall, Gail, and I said \u2013 directly to your question, we continue to be encouraged there and those are up probably 7% to 8%. The remark we made or I made was regarding the hurricane activity and what we've seen in some markets is the labor that would normally be used to be building new houses is fixing houses that were damaged as a result of the hurricanes. I think we'll continue to see some draw from that as we move into 2018. However, some of the houses that were damaged were completely damaged and those will in fact be new houses that will show up in the housing starts number as we move into 2018. As you know, there's normally a tail on the amount of time it takes to completely recover from hurricane efforts and especially in Houston I would tell you I think that that's going to be somewhat of a tailwind in those markets through 2018. But there's no doubt labor continues to be the biggest constraint whether it's in the overall single family construction or finding labor available to work on the repair of the homes that were damaged from the hurricanes. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. And just again kind of similar question, kind of looking past fourth quarter into 2018, but do you expect any material after effects from the fires in D.C.? And I think one producer yesterday said they're starting to compete a little bit in the U.S. with Canadian wildfires. Just how extreme do you think that might be over the next couple quarters? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I think it clearly had an impact as we talked about in the third quarter. As we move into the fourth quarter, that seems to be normalizing. So, other than the ultimate effect it's going to have on the availability of logs in Canada, which were already being impacted, of course, by the southern pine beetle, I don't see any specific impacts as we move into 2018 and beyond. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. But it was kind of that log availability that I was trying to get some insights into. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : And maybe I missed it, but your comments on kind of the OSB outlook, I don't think you really addressed the new supply coming on and just if you could talk about how that fits into your outlook relative to current incredibly strong realizations there? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, as we \u2013 as I said, we continue to be constructive on OSB markets as we move forward. With that said, clearly, there is additional capacity coming online, and we'll see exactly how that comes online and what the timing is. One thing we know about OSB capacity is it's pretty lumpy in terms of coming online. So, I think there will be some disruptions and impacts on pricing as the OSB capacity comes online over the next couple of years. Frankly though, we're going to need \u2013 we, as an industry, are going to need some additional OSB capacity as housing continues to grow. So, there won't be an exact match, of course, between supply and demand and the timing thereof. But if you look \u2013 if you assume housing is going to continue to grow and then you look at the incremental supply that's going to come online, those should be fairly well matched. There will be some timing issues, as we all know, as we work through that. Gail Glazerman - Roe Equity Research LLC : Okay. Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question if from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Hey. Good morning, everyone. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Just a question on the balance sheet. I think the leverage is down now. Net leverage is almost to 3 times. And it sounds like after you got the Twin Creeks proceeds, then you have, it sounds like, higher EBITDA sequentially in the 4Q. You'd probably be down, closer to that 2.5 times range to exit the year. So, I'm wondering if you've had any change of thoughts on where that leverage should sit and just kind of general thoughts about redeploying all the cash flow from the Uruguay sale. I know a lot of that was to pay down debt, but that obviously reduces the net leverage. Just any thoughts on the \u2013 where the leverage should go from here and whether it's the dividend or share repo or acquisitions kind of where you would sort of prioritize putting incremental cash to work now? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Sure. So, Brian, as we've stated in the past, our target net debt-to-EBITDA is 3.5 times. You're correct. We're now below that, and that's a function of we had some debt pay-downs this year. We're down to $6 billion of debt, and then we've had growth in EBITDA. And so, that's favored the ratio. So, as far as going forward on the proceeds, we'll look at the proceeds and we'll do our capital allocation program and really allocate that capital in the best way possible to create shareholder value. But that's something we continue to work with the Board on going forward. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: But Brian, I do think it's important to note that our financial priorities have not changed, continue to be consistent and, first and foremost, is returning cash to shareholders primarily through growing dividend, but also share repurchase. So, that's number one on the list. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That's great. And then just on the Wood Products, it's obviously great performance with the run-up in product pricing, but also a lot of work on the OpEx side. I think last year you got about $65 million of OpEx savings this year that's sort of the midpoint of what you're targeting I think. And just \u2013 I know you want to get the 2017 savings in before you start to think about 2018 too much. But could we be in for another year in 2018 where there is something in that ballpark in terms of OpEx savings? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. We, as you would anticipate, are still working on that, Brian. But I would tell, I would \u2013 we would anticipate something in a similar ballpark. And as I mentioned earlier, by the end of this year, we're going to be 85% of the way to being what we call black at the bottom, and assuming we get a similar type number and have a similar type target in 2018 and achieve that target, we would be close to 100% of the being black at the bottom by the end of 2018. So, that's how we're thinking about things, are encouraged by the progress we made, know there is more work to do. And we're also encouraged by the fact that now mostly ideas are being bottom up driven, rather than top down driven, and that's also a very positive development for our company. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. That sounds great. Yeah. Combined with the cellulose fiber stranded cost removal sounds like a pretty good uplift from cost takeout there. And then, just on the \u2013 one last one on the Flak Jacket remediation, just trying to think about how the cash impacts of all this, as it sounds like you've spent $190 million in the quarter, and maybe there's some more to come in 4Q. Just wondering if you got any insurance proceeds yet or maybe the timing on when you'd expect to get that sort of can you kind of think about the impact to cash flows starting from October and going forward? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. Brian, what I would tell you is we expect to receive the reimbursements in 2018 and are very confident on our claim, and we will break those out on a quarter-by-quarter basis as those come in so everybody can track it. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. And, Brian, I would add, we've actually spent $60 million in the quarter. That's the cash expenditures. Brian Maguire - Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC: Okay. Great. That helps. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Thanks. Doyle, you said that the Southern land didn't get much damage from the weather. Do you have a sense of other people's Southern land? People we've been talking to don't seem to see a lot of damage in general. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. I would agree with that, Mark. And talking to some of our competitors, I think, unlike some previous hurricanes where you've been around a long time as I have, there was extensive timberland damage. I think that was mostly avoided with these two hurricanes. So, I think from an overall timberland perspective, we were very fortunate as an industry. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Just one more question. On the real estate acreage that you sold, could you give us a rough sense of how much of that was stepped-up land versus not stepped-up? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: We'd have to get back to you on the details, but a lot of the transactions that were closed in the last quarter were in the Montana area. And so, that property would have been stepped up. Mark Connelly - Stephens, Inc.: Okay. Super. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of James Armstrong with Armstrong Investment. Please go ahead. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : Good morning, and congrats on a good quarter. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : First question is your Western log realizations, as you pointed out, are up really nicely year-over-year. Assuming a more normal fire season next year, do you expect the same pricing trend or should log prices stabilize a little bit more as we go into 2018 in the West? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. So, we're really encouraged by what we see out of the Western markets. I think there's no doubt that the fire season helped on a temporary basis. But as you look at the domestic markets, the log decks were \u2013 are thin coming out of fire season. I think more importantly from a domestic market, California housing continues to be very robust. Those permits are up 17%. And we think California is going to continue to kind of outpace the market because it lagged the market for so long. So, from a domestic side, we think demand is going to be strong. We are also, as we look into 2018, encouraged by what we see from export markets, both Japan and China. So, we're optimistic about Western log markets as we move into 2018. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : Okay. That helps. Switching gear to Wood Products. You've addressed a lot of the questions. But do you have any insight on your customers' inventory levels? Have any of your customers really been able to rebuild inventories, or are they still tight after all the hurricane events and other \u2013 in the strong market? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Yeah. What I would tell you is customer inventory levels continue to be lean. Now, I would anticipate as we move into a slower seasonal period, Thanksgiving and Christmas and the winter months, you would start to see our customers have the opportunity to rebuild inventories but currently, inventories continue to be lean. James Armstrong - Armstrong Investment Research : Perfect. Thank you very much. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yes. Good morning. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Chip. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Yeah. Doyle, my first question has to do, and I apologize if this was asked, but if you could talk a little bit about plywood. I know it's not a big business for you, but there's been some bumpiness with imports. And as I think about OSB and the fact that there's less and less substitutability or at least in practice, are you seeing anything that might cause plywood to maybe recouple with OSB, or at least be stronger than it's been in recent years notwithstanding that the last month, few months have been good? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Chip, we don't see anything that's fundamentally changed in those two markets. As you know, we've all watched them together over the past many years in the substitution from plywood to OSB. But as we look forward, we don't see anything fundamentally changing in that relationship. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And then the second question is when you look at your distribution of cash, Doyle, and I know you talked a bit about this already, but there seems to be some reluctance to, I guess, to create a steady component of the dividend from Wood Products, and obviously, because of the cyclicality. But how do you wrestle with the fact that it's making so much money now and could continue to? And how do you balance between a stable dividend and distributing cash during periods of very strong Wood Products results, which frankly could persist for a while? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Chip, I'm not sure I would agree with the reluctance comment. What I would tell you is we very purposefully raised our payout ratio from 75% to 85% over the cycle to reflect the fact that we think we have raised the floor on our Wood Products operation due to the significant change we made in our cost structure. We will continue to work closely with our board on the appropriate dividend level going forward, factoring in Wood Products markets and the fact that we're optimistic on Wood Products markets as we said earlier and also, factoring in what we're seeing on the Timberland side. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Okay. And quickly for Russell. I don't know if you gave us the specific guide on the real estate EBITDA for the fourth quarter, but if you could just let me know that and what basis we should expect it would be? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: So, on the EBITDA, we're going to be at about $250 million. And then the basis... Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: For the year. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: For the year, excuse me. So, for the year, $250 million. And then on the basis, we would expect about 40%. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : And that's for the year as well? Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Correct. Chip Dillon - Vertical Research Partners LLC : Thank you. Operator : And everyone, we have time for one final question. And it comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Yeah. Thanks very much. Good morning, Doyle, Russell and Beth. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Paul. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Good morning, Paul. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Hey. Two questions. One on Timberland portfolio. You guys have done a number of things in the quarter \u2013 in the past, selling Uruguay, redeeming Twin Creeks, selling $100,000 in the U.S. South. What can we expect going forward here on your portfolio? And I'm specifically thinking about the North, which historically hasn't been part of the Weyerhaeuser portfolio? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: And so, Paul, what I'd tell you and what we've consistently said is we're constantly reviewing our overall Timberland portfolio. We do feel good about the moves we made, both through Uruguay and Twin Creeks, as Russell said earlier, to focus and simplify our portfolio. But we'll continue to look for ways to create value for our shareholders going forward, whether that's through potential acquisitions or potential dispositions from a portfolio perspective. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. And then, maybe just a question on softwood lumber. Canadian companies seem pretty pessimistic on an agreement. In fact, West Fraser went as far as to say that Coalition seems unwilling to negotiate. I don't want you to get into negotiation on the call. But just from your perspective, what's stopping the agreement at this point? Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: I'm not sure anything is necessarily stopping an agreement at this point, Paul. As we said, we continue to be hopeful that we will be able to reach an agreement with the Canadians. We're working very closely with the Coalition and the Department of Commerce. We fundamentally believe that a quota-based agreement is the best option going forward for all parties involved because of the certainty and the simplicity that it brings to the tables. So that's how we're thinking about it and we'll continue to pursue and hopefully be able to reach an agreement with the Canadians going forward. Paul Quinn - RBC Capital Markets : Okay. Best of luck with that and your financials going forward. Thanks. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you, Paul. Russell S. Hagen - Weyerhaeuser Co.: Thank you. Doyle R. Simons - Weyerhaeuser Co.: As I understand it, that was our final question. I just want to end by thanking everybody for joining us this morning and, as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes the Weyerhaeuser third quarter 2017 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2017 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter 2017 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Beth, and welcome, everyone. Weyerhaeuser delivered strong financial and operational performance in 2017. I\u2019m proud of the team work, dedication and creativity our employees displayed throughout the year, as they work together to accomplish goals, overcome challenges and deliver strong results. In 2017, we increased full-year adjusted EBITDA by 31% to nearly $2.1 billion; generated over $1 billion of Wood Products EBITDA, the most since 2004; captured nearly $140 million of operational excellence improvements; grew Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources EBITDA by nearly 30%; completed the asset value optimization process for Western Timberlands; delivered a 55% premium to timber value from real estate sales; exceeded our merger costs synergy target by 25%; and fully eliminated $35 million of costs formerly allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business. We also further simplified and optimized our portfolio by divesting our Uruguay operations, redeeming our ownership in the Twin Creeks joint venture, and selling 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands for collective proceeds of over $700 million. Finally, we increased our dividend for the sixth time since 2011, consistent with our commitment to return cash to shareholders through a growing and sustainable dividend. These accomplishments are reflected in our financial results. For the full-year 2017, Weyerhaeuser reported net earnings of $582 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, on net sales of $7.2 billion. This represents a 40% improvement in full-year earnings from continuing operations. For the fourth quarter, Weyerhaeuser earned $271 million, or $0.36 per diluted share, on net sales of $1.8 billion. Fourth quarter results include a $37 million after-tax benefit from special items. Excluding special items, we earned $234 million, or $0.31 per diluted share for the fourth quarter. This is more than double our earnings for fourth quarter 2016. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $551 million, 38% higher than one year ago. Before I discuss our business results in more detail, let me make a few comments regarding the housing market. The U.S. housing market finished the year on a solid note, as strong demand and favorable weather in many areas enabled building activity continue \u2013 to continue late into the year. Total annualized housing starts averaged $1.25 million for the fourth quarter, an increase of almost 7% compared with the third quarter. For the full-year 2017, U.S. housing starts totaled just over $1.2 million. As expected, growth in single-family starts was strong, while multi-family activity remained volatile. Single-family housing starts rose approximately 8.5% compared with 2016. Approximately 71% of total starts were attributable to single-family homes, compared with 67% one year ago. This mix shift is very beneficial for Wood Products demand. Entering 2018, housing market fundamentals remain favorable. Millennials are becoming more active in the market and homeownership among households headed by someone under age 35 rose to 36% in the fourth quarter from 34.7% a year earlier. Builder confidence is holding strong at levels comparable to prerecession highs. Permit activity is healthy. Single-family permits increased 9% for the full-year 2017 and total permits averaged over $1.3 million in the fourth quarter. Economic growth remains solid, employment and wages continue to rise and consumer confidence remains historically strong. Although constraints on labor and lot availability may provide some guardrails for the rate of building activity, our builder and dealer customers see significant opportunity to serve continued pent-up demand and are optimistic for a strong 2018. For 2018, we expect single-family housing starts to increase by nearly 10% with total starts approaching $1.3 million. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $166 million to earnings before special items, $35 million more than the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $252 million. Western Timberlands delivered $140 million of fourth quarter EBITDA, $29 million more than the third quarter and $39 million more than a year ago. Fee harvest volumes increased 14% compared with the third quarter as favorable logging conditions and strong production by our harvest crews enabled us to catch up on volume that cannot be harvested during the severe third quarter fire season. Western domestic market conditions were strong throughout the quarter, as underlying demand remained steady and mills rebuilt log decks depleted during the third quarter fire season. Pricing for domestic logs increased throughout the quarter. Per unit logging and hauling costs increased slightly due to higher contract trucking rates and additional high elevation logging. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, prices rose steadily throughout the quarter, as Japanese demand remained solid. Log and lumber inventories for our Japanese customers remain relatively low and they are running at high operating rates. Log sales volumes were comparable to third quarter and stronger takeaway was offset by timing of shipments. In China, demand for our logs remains steady and pricing strengthened as customers competed against strong demand from U.S. domestic buyers. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined slightly during the quarter and remain within a normal range. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $101 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, $6 million more than the third quarter. Demand improved as mills resumed normal operations following third quarter weather events and our fee harvest volumes increased 6%, compared with the third quarter as we caught up on production days lost during hurricane activity. Average sawlog and pulpwood realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Unit transportation costs increased slightly due to higher fuel and trucking rates. Northern Timberlands contributed $9 million to EBITDA, $5 million more than the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes increased as we caught up on Montana harvest, they cannot be accessed, while mandatory fire restrictions were in place. Average realizations improved due to mix. Finally Timberlands fourth quarter results include a $99 million non-taxable gain on the previously announced sale of 100,000 acres of Southern Timberlands for $2,025 per acre. This is reported as a special item. The quarter includes non-earnings contribution from operation of the Twin Creeks joint venture due to redemption of our ownership interest. Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, Chart 7 and 8. Real Estate and ENR contributed $50 million to fourth quarter earnings, $3 million more than the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $13 million to $87 million. Fourth quarter transaction volume was slightly weaker than expected, as some activity paused due to buyer uncertainty regarding the several budget and tax policy. The average price per acre sold increased compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales included a greater proportion of Southern acres, while third quarter included a large sale of lower value Montana acres. For the full-year 2017, the Real Estate business sold just over 97,000 acres, or approximately 0.7% of our land base. Real Estate significantly exceeded its 30% targeted premium to timber value, capturing an average premium of 55% in 2017. Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $221 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items, compared with $241 million in the third quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $258 million for the fourth quarter and over $1 billion for the full-year 2017. This is the highest annual EBITDA since 2004 and over $150 million more than EBITDA from 2005, when we operated almost double the number of facilities and production volumes were over 60% higher. EBITDA for lumber totaled $116 million comparable to the third quarter and more than double a year ago. Average sales realizations for lumber improved 4%. This was offset by higher log cost for our Western and Canadian mills and a 5% decrease in sales volumes, as shipments from our Canadian mills were delayed due to weather-driven disruptions in rail transportation. OSB contributed $104 million to EBITDA, $2 million more than the third quarter and $58 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 2% compared with the third quarter. This price improvement was largely offset by 6% decrease in sales volumes, again, due to issues with Canadian rail transportation. Resin costs also increased. Engineered wood products contributed $34 million to EBITDA, $16 million lower than the third quarter, but $8 million more than a year ago. Sales volumes declined seasonally and manufacturing costs increased due to higher prices for OSB, fiber and resin. Distribution contributed $5 million to fourth quarter EBITDA, compared with $12 million in the third quarter. This business focused on managing cost and product margins and performed well in what is typically a seasonally challenging quarter. Fourth quarter results for the Wood products segment include a pre-tax charge of $50 million for remediation for our Flak Jacket product. This charge reflects higher than expected labor costs, resulting from the strong demand for home remediation services following Hurricane Harvey and Irma. As of yesterday, we have completed remediation in 99% of the affected houses. We continue to expect a significant portion of the cost will be covered by insurance. I will wrap up the Wood Products discussion with a few comments on the Softwood Lumber Agreement. On December 7, the U.S. International Trade Commission issued its final determination, affirming material injury to U.S. lumber producers. Final countervailing and anti-dumping duties became effective on December 28. These collective duties are assessed at approximately 20% for most producers. Fourth quarter results include a $9 million net pre-tax benefit from an adjustment for the final applicable periods and rates associated with the countervailing and anti-dumping duties. Final duties will remain effective for a minimum of five years unless reduced upon appeal by NAFTA or the WTO. Although Canadian producers have initiated appeals to both bodies, we expect the process will extend for several years before the panels reach a decision. The U.S. coalition continues to work closely with the U.S. Trade Representative, and we remain hopeful, we will be able to negotiate a quota-based agreement. Chart 12, operational excellence. As I mentioned in my opening remarks, our Timberlands and Wood Products business achieved almost $140 million of operational excellence improvements in 2017. Timberlands delivered standout performance, significantly exceeding its $40 million to $50 million target. The business captured $66 million of operational excellence improvements, primarily from merger-related operational synergies. Wood Products captured $71 million of operational excellence at the high-end of its $55 million to $75 million target. Lumber and OSB met their targets with improvements of $21 million in lumber and $20 million in OSB. Engineered wood products and distribution exceeded their targets capturing $16 million and $14 million of improvements, respectively. Although we have captured almost $500 million of operational excellence improvements since 2014, we have more opportunity to improve our relative performance in each of our businesses. In 2018, we are targeting OpEx improvements of $40 million to $50 million in Timberlands and $40 million to $60 million in Wood Products, including $20 million to $25 million in lumber, $5 million to $10 million in OSB, $10 million to $15 million in engineered wood products, and $5 million to $10 million in distribution. Finally, we fully delivered on our commitments to eliminate the $35 million of costs formally allocated to our Cellulose Fibers business by 2017 year-end. Identifying and capturing these cost reductions require collaboration across corporate functions and operating segments and I\u2019m proud of the team work that enabled us to achieve this goal. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter is presented in Chart 14 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to fourth quarter earnings before special items. In our Western Timberlands operations, we anticipate continued strong realizations and favorable domestic demand. We expect harvest volumes to decrease modestly compared to the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter included additional volumes that were deferred from the third quarter because of fire restrictions. Japanese export log sales volumes and average sales realizations are expected to increase compared to the fourth quarter. We are seeing continued strong demand in the Japanese housing market combined with low-channel inventories, which is providing strong price support. Chinese export log volumes and average sales realizations are expected to decrease modestly compared to the fourth quarter on seasonally softer demand due to the Lunar New Year. In the South, we expect seasonally lower demand and sales volumes, and we anticipate average sales realizations for the first quarter will be comparable to the fourth quarter. We also expect higher fuel and trucking costs. In the North, we anticipate first quarter sales volumes will decrease, while sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Full-year 2018 harvest volumes for the South and the North are expected to be comparable year-over-year. In the West, we expect harvest volumes to decrease slightly compared to 2017, as a result of our previously announced exit from Twin Creeks joint venture, we will no longer have harvest volume to report in the category titled Other. Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter. In Real Estate, we typically closed fewer transactions in the first and second quarter of the year, as recreational buyer traffic slows during the winter months. The summer and fall months are the most active selling seasons with the large portion of sales closing in the second-half of the year. We expect Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources adjusted EBITDA for the first quarter to be comparable to the first quarter of last year. We expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources business in 2018. Land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales should be between 40% and 50% for the full-year 2018. For Wood Products, we anticipate first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter earnings before special items. For Lumber, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly higher. For OSB, we expect the average sales realizations will be lower quarter-over-quarter. Engineered wood products sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. We recently announced price increases of 6% to 12% for engineered wood products, which we will begin capturing in the second quarter. Sales volumes and operating rates are expected to increase quarter-over-quarter for all product lines, as we typically have lower production in the fourth quarter due to seasonal and maintenance downtime. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. For the fourth quarter, the decrease in earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA compared to the third quarter are driven primarily by an increase in non-cash charges related to intercompany profit elimination and LIFO inventory adjustments, as we rebuild depleted log inventories in our export yards and wood products mills during the fourth quarter. In addition, fourth quarter unallocated items include pre-tax special items of $42 million of insurance reimbursements for environmental remediation costs incurred in prior years and $14 million of Plum Creek merger and integration costs. Following the successful completion of the merger, we do not anticipate additional merger integration costs in 2018. For our pension and postretirement plans, the year-end 2017 funded status decreased by $138 million compared to 2016, as a result of a decrease in discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 60 basis points for the U.S. plans and 20 basis points for the Canadian plans. We did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan in 2017, and we are not required to make any cash contributions in 2018. Cash paid for all other pension and postretirement plans in 2017 was $78 million. Our required cash payments for these plans 2018 will be approximately $60 million. We expect to record approximately $100 million, or $25 million per quarter of non-cash, non-operating pension and postretirement expense in 2018. Chart 13 summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $824 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter was $354 million. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $160 million and for the full-year 2017 are $419 million. Looking ahead to 2018, we expect total CapEx will be approximately $420 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $120 million for Timberlands. Investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also include approximately $108 million of proceeds from redeeming our equity interest in the Twin Creeks joint venture and $203 million of proceeds from selling $100,00 acres Southern Timberlands to Twin Creeks. Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with $6 billion of debt outstanding. Interest expense was $96 million in the fourth quarter. We expect interest expense will be approximately $380 million in 2018. Moving on to taxes. Following the enactment of the federal tax reform, we benefit from the lower federal tax rate on the earnings generated by our taxable REIT subsidiary. These earnings will now be subject to federal tax at 21%, rather than the prior 35%. The new law does not affect our REIT status, or the provisions that allow us to pay capital gain dividends to our shareholders. Further, we do not anticipate any limitations on our interest deductibility. In our fourth quarter results, the net tax adjustment was included in special items. The adjustment is primarily to remeasure our net deferred tax assets, following the reduction in the federal tax rate. We currently expect our 2018 effective tax rate will be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of our earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions. Russell Hagen : Thank you, Russell. 2017 was a strong year for Weyerhaeuser as we successfully completed our merge integration, further focused our portfolio, delivered improved financial performance across all our businesses and returned cash to shareholders by increasing our dividend. Going forward, I\u2019m extremely optimistic about 2018 and our ability to continue to improve performance through operational excellence, fully capitalize on market conditions and demonstrate disciplined capital allocation to drive value for shareholders. And now, I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first questions is from line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please go ahead. Mark William Wilde : Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Mark. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Mark. Mark William Wilde : Just to start off, I wondered if you could talk just a little bit about the markets, because we\u2019ve gotten off to a much stronger start than I would have expected here in January in all of these Wood Products markets. How do you read what\u2019s going on here? Doyle Simons : Yes, Mark, I\u2019ll tell you. I\u2019m encouraged by what we see in the Wood Products market. If you look at lumber markets, you\u2019ve got growing demand from housing going up, and as I said, optimistic about what we\u2019re going to see in 2018. I\u2019m encouraged that the millennials are showing up, also anticipate strong repair remodeling markets. You\u2019ve got lean inventories. You\u2019ve got high operating rates. You\u2019ve got less lumber coming in from Canada and that was down roughly 5% in 2017 versus 2016, and now, we\u2019re moving into the stronger building season. So encouraged by what we\u2019re seeing in lumber markets. Likewise in OSB, clearly have growing demand, driven by the same things I just outlined again, lean inventories, high operating rates. Now, we all know there\u2019s new capacity coming on. But I think, this industry should be able to absorb that capacity assuming demand continues to grow, which it will. Now there will be some volatility and lumpiness as that new capacity comes online. But the other thing about the new capacity, Mark, as you very well know, it takes \u2013 normally it takes longer to bring up new capacity, especially when you\u2019re bringing up capacity of mills that have been down for an extended period of time. So overall, pretty optimistic about what we\u2019re seeing. And then, of course, in engineered wood products, as we mentioned, we have announced a price increase of 6% to 12%. And we think in terms of that, we all should \u2013 we\u2019ll start to realize that in the second quarter and by the end of second quarter probably have half of that, or maybe a little more that we will realize by the end of the second quarter. So overall pretty optimistic about wood products markets. Mark William Wilde : Okay. And then just as a follow-on question. Well \u2013 but this Western log market just is also surprisingly strong. I wondered, if you want to put any more color behind that? And also, is there any effect from the weakening in the U.S. dollar? Doyle Simons : So, Mark, as you said, Western log markets have been very positive. We continue to be encouraged about what we see in those markets. Domestically, you\u2019ve got the strong demand and pricing improvements, and Japan continued solid demand low inventories. We anticipate higher prices and volumes in Q1 versus Q4. Post and beam construction was up, which is the key driver for us, I present in in 2017 versus 2016. And in China, we\u2019ll have a little policy here as we go through the Lunar New Year. But if you just look at 2017 versus 2016, log exports were up from the U.S. to China up over 10% and we can \u2013 we expect continued strong markets. Overall, it\u2019s a weaker \u2013 as we said a strong dollar is bad for Weyerhaeuser, or weaker dollar is a positive for Weyerhaeuser. So if the dollar does weaken, net-net that will be a positive for us overall in these markets. Mark William Wilde : Right. Thanks, Doyle. I\u2019ll turn it over. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Randy Toth : Good morning. This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony. Doyle Simons : Good morning. Randy Toth : We\u2019re hearing a lot of commentary from companies that we cover in regards to freight tightness and labor tightness. I just want to know how you guys think that might impact you in the 2018? Doyle Simons : Yes, we like other companies are in fact seeing that type of tightness, as we mentioned in the fourth quarter, a real impact on wood products earnings as a result of transportation issues, specifically in rail out of Canada, but also in trucks out of Canada. And one mill, for example, that we have in Canada, shipments from rail were delayed by over two weeks and one much better from a rail perspective. So as we move into 2018, we think that will continue to be a headwind in terms of availability, but more so increasing rates, both on the truck and rails side. And we\u2019re going to work really hard to offset that through our operational excellence initiatives in 2018. Randy Toth : Okay, thank you. And then can you talk a little bit about timber exports out of the U.S. South. I know, they grew quite a bit in 2017 although off a small base. How much are you guys participating in that, and do you think that growth is sustainable? Doyle Simons : Yes. We are participating in that and it\u2019s a key initiative for us. What we would tell you is, while you\u2019re right, it is off a low base. We anticipate that in 2018, our shipments could be three times higher than they were in 2017. And our best guess now is the takeaway that will go into export markets would be the equivalent, just to try to dimension it a small sawmill in the U.S. and what they would use. So you\u2019re right. It\u2019s off a small base, but growing. We\u2019re spending a lot of time and resources developing that market and are very optimistic about that market long-term. Randy Toth : Okay. Thank you very much. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Everyone, good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the year Doyle and Russell. I guess, the first question I had, maybe piggybacking off of Mark\u2019s earlier question. So where do you see your customers log decks at present in the West? And overall, if you had mentioned, I\u2019d missed it. Where do you see lumber inventories overall in the channel? Do you think things are more or less back to normal? Are they still below normal in terms of average inventory levels, any thoughts that would be helpful? And I had a couple follow-ons? Doyle Simons : Yes. So if you look at lumber inventories, they are pretty lean across the entire system. If you look at log decks in the West, as you know, they got very, very low during the fire season. They have started to rebuild. I would say, they\u2019re kind of somewhere between low and normal, but log decks are being rebuilt in the West. George Staphos : Okay. And Doyle, one question I had for you. On that subject, are wood margins high enough do you think across the market in the West present demand destruction on Western log? So in other words, are you seeing a sufficiently strong lumber prices out there and demand to keep pulling Western logs? Doyle Simons : Yes. The answer is yes. The \u2013 we have not seen any \u2013 what you would call value destruction from that pricing and demand continues to be strong. Where the competition is occurring is between domestic logs and Chinese logs, because as prices have run up, those are competing directly against each other. And the beauty of our system is, we\u2019re able to play that and thin logs to where we can create the most value. George Staphos : Okay. Two last questions, I\u2019ll turn it over. One segueing off that comment and then comment just on OpEx. So one thing that we noticed in the deck and as always, we appreciate the detail. The Chinese export log revenue seemed to drop a bit more sequentially 3Q to four 4Q than it did last year just eyeballing it. And you mentioned, there\u2019s further sequential drop off in the first quarter coming up because of Lunar New Year, which didn\u2019t seem to have as much of an effect last year. Is there something else going on in China that we should be mindful of, or that you\u2019re maybe guarding against as a kind of a what-if. And then in terms of OpEx, congratulations on the performance there. What gives you confidence, I guess, four years into the program that with all the work you\u2019ve done in OSB and lumber that there\u2019s still more in the tank in 2018? Thank you guys and good luck in the quarter. Doyle Simons : George, in terms of what\u2019s going on in China, it\u2019s pretty simple that the reason it\u2019s down in the fourth quarter versus third is the strength in domestic markets. And as I\u2019ve just mentioned, we can swing back and forth. And as domestic markets have continued to improve, we are selling more to the domestic market and less to China. It has nothing to do with a falloff in China, as I mentioned, actually log shipment overall to China were up. And I mean, from an industry perspective, we\u2019re up 10%. George Staphos : Yes. Doyle Simons : And we\u2019ll get through this Lunar New Year and you never know what impact that will have, but we continue to anticipate strong demand in China in 2018. In terms of OpEx, as mentioned in the earlier comments, we\u2019ve made good progress. We have made good progress in 2017, but there\u2019s much more opportunity in front of us. But the reason I\u2019m so encouraged by what\u2019s happening in OpEx is, when we first started this program three or four years ago, it\u2019s very top down-driven. Now what\u2019s happening is, it\u2019s bottom-up driven. Our employees are out working in the mills, are out working in the Timberland every day are finding additional opportunities to drive OpEx improvements, that\u2019s how we\u2019re defining winning, that\u2019s how people are being compensated. So encouraged that we will be \u2013 can able to meet or exceed the targets that we\u2019ve laid out in 2018. Although, as you\u2019re exactly right, it does get harder. We\u2019ve got most of the low-hanging fruit and you did see the numbers in Wood Products come down slightly in 2018 versus 2017 which is indicative of that, but encouraged by the opportunities that we have in 2018 and confident we will meet those targets. George Staphos : Thank you very much. Good luck on a quarter. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Russell Hagen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Hey, good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Collin. Collin Mings : Just to start for me. Just given the growing flexibility offered by the balance sheet, just maybe talk a little bit more about how you\u2019re approaching external growth on the Timberland front this year, especially just given the recent termination of the Twin Creeks JV? Russell Hagen : Yes, Collin, this is Russell. As far as how we look at the timber markets, we have 12.5 million acres in the United States and we\u2019re in every major wood basket. And we have a team that really all they focus on is timber valuations and making sure that we understand kind of the relative values in the market. So we see everything coming on to the market. And if there\u2019s an opportunity that fits within our portfolio and we can create shareholder value, we\u2019ll take a hard look at that. But we always approach this in a very disciplined manner. Again, our goal over the long-term is to continue to grow the business and increase shareholder value. But we\u2019re going to do it very disciplined. Collin Mings : Okay. Any sizable transactions out there kind of in the pipeline, or anything on that front? Russell Hagen : There\u2019s a couple of transactions that I think will carry over into 2018 that were kind of in the pipeline in 2017 that didn\u2019t close. But beyond, probably what\u2019s in the broader news and what\u2019s available, I don\u2019t see anything else meaningful. Collin Mings : Just sticking with the kind of capital allocation just on the debt maturing this year, Russell, do you plan to pay that off with cash and recognizing it, it\u2019s still early, but you got pretty meaningful maturity in 2019 at a pretty high-cost, just how are you thinking about the debt maturity here just when you\u2019re still well below your kind of targeted debt to EBITDA number? Russell Hagen : Yes. So let me take that in a couple of steps. The first is, we do have $62 million maturity that we actually paid off yesterday and that was a pretty high coupon rate about 7%. We paid that off with available cash, because it really wasn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t make sense to go and refinance such a small maturity. As far as our $1.8 billion, I think that you\u2019re referring to are the future debt maturities. We have a lot of flexibility around that and we\u2019re well positioned from a balance sheet standpoint to address that when it comes up, but we don\u2019t see any concerns with that. As far as our leverage ratios, you\u2019re correct. We are \u2013 have a target leverage ratio of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA and that\u2019s really over the cycle. So in some years, we\u2019re going to be a little lower and some years we\u2019re going to be little higher. Right now, we\u2019re a little lower and that\u2019s a function of \u2013 we have paid down some debt and restructured some debt, but we\u2019ve also had improvement in our EBITDA. So we see that. We\u2019re in a very comfortable position, and it provides us with a lot of flexibility should an opportunity arise and we want to go tap the capital markets. Collin Mings : Okay. And then one last one for me just as far as on the Timberland guidance. Just given the strength particularly on the West just given log pricing momentum there that would start 2018, can you maybe just quantify how much we should expect in terms of the downtick in harvest volumes? I think in the prepared guidance remarks, you suggested that the West would be down and the North and South would be flattish year-over-year. But again, at least, in the first quarter which seem to imply a pretty meaningful year-over-year decline in the Western volume. So just how should we quantify that? Russell Hagen : Sure. So, first, big picture. We\u2019re harvesting on a sustainable level. So in the West, as we mentioned at our Investor Day last year, the harvest will decline modestly in 2018, and that\u2019s really a function of working through the older age timber on the Longview acquisition. And so we\u2019ll see the harvest level, level out starting in 2018 and then we\u2019ll see moderate growth in that in 2023. Collin Mings : Okay. And should we think about any other noise seasonality as it relates to those harvest volumes? Russell Hagen : Coming into the first quarter? Collin Mings : Just in the West in general, yes? Russell Hagen : Yes. So in the West, we\u2019re going to have some seasonally lower volume in the West. Collin Mings : Okay. I appreciate the color, guys. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi, good morning, guys. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire : A couple of times, you mentioned some negative impact from rail and trucking issues in Canada in the Wood Products segment. I just wonder if there\u2019s any way you can size that? Is it like a $5 million or $10 million hit to EBITDA in the quarter, or more immaterial than that? Doyle Simons : You\u2019re talking about in the fourth quarter? Brian Maguire : Yes, in the fourth quarter? Doyle Simons : Yes, Brian, it was a significant issue in the fourth quarter, and it was primarily due to just the lack of trucking in Canada. As I mentioned, at one of our mills, shipments were delayed for \u2013 I said trucking, I mean, rail. So let\u2019s back up. So we\u2019ve got rail and truck issues, both of those were a problem in the fourth quarter. For example, one of our mills, shipments were delayed for a full two weeks due to rail issues, primarily due to the extremely cold weather in Canada. With that said, because of the surge in \u2013 demand in the fourth quarter for trucks, trucking availability was also a problem. So I would say, the \u2013 it was a probably $10 million to $15 million hit in the fourth quarter. Part of it was due to higher prices, but more so, we just couldn\u2019t ship the volume, because there wasn\u2019t rail or trucking available and that primarily happened in the month of December. Brian Maguire : Okay, that helps. And then it sounds like 1Q maybe seeing some similar disruptions, maybe not just in Canada, but in the South, I know down here in the Gulf states, we\u2019ve had a lot of these winter storms we don\u2019t normally have. Just wondered if there\u2019s going to be an impact maybe in the Southern logs or Southern Wood Products that you\u2019re seeing so far in 1Q? Doyle Simons : I think in 1Q, it\u2019s going to be more just higher cost as opposed to just not being able to ship. As I mentioned in my earlier comments, I do think rail and trucking will be a headwind, as we move into 2018. We\u2019ve not seen the disruptions in terms of availability that we saw in the month of December. But we do have higher rates going in and just both in truck and rail. We\u2019re about currently 60% truck, 40% rail. We will be shifting more to truck when possible just because as we look at the options that\u2019s the better one as we move forward. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just one on Southern log prices. It\u2019s sort of an area we start off thinking, maybe this will be the year we start to see a little bit of tension in the market and prices start to pick up. And since it\u2019s Groundhog Day today, I thought you maybe could give a little bit of an outlook on how you think that prices could go this year, if it\u2019s going to be more of the same, or do you think maybe by the end of the year we could start to see some upward tilt on those prices? Doyle Simons : Yes, it\u2019s a great question, Brian, and I appreciate the color. Let me tell you how we\u2019re thinking about it. And we do think there\u2019s some potential for some pricing traction in 2018, and let me tell you why. Number one, it all comes down to housing demand, as I said, continues to grow. And we\u2019re quite optimistic that housing will continue to grow and we\u2019re especially encouraged about what we\u2019ve seen in terms of the millennials finally starting to show up in the market and frankly, that\u2019s what\u2019s been missing. We also expect a strong year from repair remodeling and are projecting that to be up roughly 7.5%. Maybe even more importantly than that is that, there is a lot of capacity being added in the South, as you know. It seems like every week, there\u2019s an announcement of new capacity that\u2019s being added, or at least being considered. In terms of the numbers, about 1 billion board feet of new sawmill capacity came online in 2017. There\u2019s another 2 billion board feet slated to come online in 2018 and 2019, and another 1 billion board feet on top of that, that\u2019s currently under consideration. Just to put that in perspective that\u2019s on a base of about 20 billion board feet in the South, so that\u2019s a big increase. And to your point, we already are starting to see some benefits in certain markets, where additional capacity has come online. The third part of this is, of course, on the supply side and there is less lumber coming in from Canada, I think, that\u2019s going to continue either as a result of the final duties, or negotiated agreements. Just to put that in perspective, that number went down from 33% in 2016, down to 30% in 2017. And as you look at just absolute lumber shipments from Canada, those were down over 5% in 2017 versus 2016. And then finally, as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019re very encouraged by development of Southern export markets. We\u2019re going to ship three times as much in 2018 as 2017, and as I mentioned, that should be equivalent to a small mill. So I think, all of those things are going to start to come together, and we are hopeful that we will start to see some pricing improvement as we move through 2018. Brian Maguire : Okay. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks, again. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chercover with D. A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Chercover : Thanks, and good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Steve. Steven Chercover : So you gave us a little update on your views on Southern log pricing. And I just wanted to understand, if you could \u2013 for your specific projects that Arkansas, Mississippi and Alabama, how they\u2019re going to kind of ramp up over the course of next year? So what\u2019s the timeframe? Doyle Simons : Yes, great question. So if you look at the two projects \u2013 our two big projects, let me start off by saying, just overall the capital that we\u2019re spending in our lumber operation should increase our productivity 2% to 3% a year. On top of that, the two projects, number one is Dirk\u2019s, Arkansas, that will start up this summer and as an additional 80 million board feet of capacity. And then our Millport mill, which we\u2019re rebuilding will start up in early 2019, and that\u2019s an additional 215 million board feet of capacity. So that\u2019s on top of the 2% to 3% that we\u2019re getting through the additional capital that we\u2019re spending. Steven Chercover : Okay, great. And then one on the softwood lumber file. The recent \u2013 I \u2013 and then I recognize the big difference between airplanes and lumber. But does the ITC ruling between Bombardier and Boeing have any impact on softwood lumber file, because I mean, the Canadians are certainly trying to link it in the NAFTA talks? Doyle Simons : Yes. So we don\u2019t think that has any impact on the discussions. We, as I said earlier, remain hopeful. We\u2019ll be able to reach a quota-based agreement. And frankly, negotiations are temporary sidelined due to the focus on NAFTA. But we would believe those negotiations will remain separate from the overall NAFTA discussions. Steven Chercover : So I don\u2019t recall if you\u2019ve ever specified what the actual volume limit would be with 30 billion board feet, or 20 billion board feet from Canada? Doyle Simons : In terms of the limit based on what Steve? I\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t understand your point. Steven Chercover : Sorry. Well, I guess, if there\u2019s a quota that it\u2019s a volume limit as opposed to a market share limit so? Doyle Simons : Now the quota that we have been discussing and again, it\u2019s still being negotiated would be a percentage, whatever it\u2019d be 25, 27, 29, whatever the number may be, that\u2019s the way the discussions have gone. It\u2019s not a hard limit on volume, it\u2019s a percentage quota. Steven Chercover : Okay. Thanks, Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. First, just wanted to follow-up on the color you\u2019re giving, particularly on the lumber capacity in the U.S. I thought that was very interesting and helpful. You had mentioned 2 billion board feet in 2018 and 2019, I assume that was in each year, just wanted to clarify that? Doyle Simons : That was the total for 2018 and 2019. And then on top of that, Mark, we\u2019re not factoring in the, as you know, there\u2019s a lot that\u2019s been saying, okay, we\u2019re going to do this, but the ground has not been broken and that\u2019s another 1 billion. So if you look at total 2018, 2019, it could be up to 3 billion. Mark Weintraub : Okay, okay. So I think, you said another 1 billion in 2020, and that was what you\u2019re referring to? Doyle Simons : What I meant to say, Mark \u2013 yes, here is what I meant to say is 1 billion in 2017, 2 billion total in 2018/2019 with the chance that there could be another 1 billion on top of the 2 billion in 2018/2019 and that\u2019s to your point would probably show up in 2019, maybe some of that in 2020. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. Thank you. And in curiosity, do you have handy a view on outside of the U.S. South? What net capacity change in North America over that timeframe might be? Doyle Simons : Mark, I don\u2019t have those numbers here in front of us. I think, there will continue to be potential capacity that could happen in the West. In Canada, as we all know, I think, if anything their capacity going to shrink because of the lack of fiber due to the pine beetle situation. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And then shifting gears to real estate, two question. So you provided $250 million EBITDA estimates for 2018. I was hoping to get any preliminary indication on likely cost basis. And maybe just any color around that as well, given that that\u2019s only a little bit higher than this year and maybe I misremember. But I had thought the expectation was that that number would likely be going up, as you had finished some of the reviews during 2017? Doyle Simons : Yes. So let\u2019s talk about that. So what happened in 2017 is and we came in a little lower than 250 guidance, is there ended up being no federal dollars that were allocated for conservation projects. This is the first time in many, many years, where no money has been provided to the various federal agencies for conservation projects. And just to give you a sense of the magnitude, that directly impacted two deals, that would have generated approximately $40 million of EBITDA in 2017. As we move into 2018, we\u2019ll see \u2013 we\u2019re hopeful that that happens. But our guidance is based on there being little to no federal dollars that are put in place. So that\u2019s the fundamental shift as we look forward into 2018 chance, there\u2019s some upside there, but that\u2019s the number that we\u2019re comfortable with assuming no federal dollars. In terms of the\u2026 Russell Hagen : Yes, Mark, this is Russell. As far as bases, we\u2019re guiding to about 40% to 50%. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And just, Russell, just one clarification. I assume, when you had talked about there being a couple things in the pipeline on Timberland side that was an,industry or was that a Weyerhaeuser specific comment? Russell Hagen : No, it\u2019s industry. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thank you. Russell Hagen : Thank you for that clarification, Mark. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thank you, Doyle. Some of our\u2026 Doyle Simons : Good morning, Mark. Mark Connelly : Good morning. Some of our clients tell us that they see hurricane rebuilds taking away from overall construction activity, because too much of the available labor in those markets is shifting away. Can you give us your thoughts on that and what do you see \u2013 how you see that the sort of labor construction thing playing out this year, because you\u2019ve got a bigger [Multiple Speakers] assumption? Doyle Simons : Yes, there\u2019s no doubt that labor is the constraint. And as we talked to all of our customers, that\u2019s the one thing we hear over and over. I think in some of the select markets, as you had indicated, some of the labor that would normally be used for new housing is being used for, call it, repair and remodeling as a result of the hurricane. So I think that will put a little bit of a damper on housing in those markets, maybe in the near-term. Longer-term, there\u2019s a number of houses, as you know, that were completely destroyed. So those will end up in new housing. So I think, limited impact from hurricanes in terms of new housing starts in the short-term. Long-term, as we know, it always takes longer to rebuild from these things. But net-net, I think, that\u2019s just going to be another positive for housing as we move forward. Mark Connelly : Absolutely. Just one more question. On the operational excellence thing, I\u2019m sorry to keep coming back to it. But the shift to bottoms-up opportunities, is this sort of a new leg of opportunity there? Are you going to start to tell us the operation excellence as targets are going up again? I just wonder if you could give us\u2026? Doyle Simons : Yes, it\u2019s a great question. As I said, if you look at over the last four years started off very top down driven low-hanging fruit. Now it\u2019s moving more into the things that are tougher but it\u2019s being bottoms-up driven, because frankly, I\u2019m not smart enough to figure out what the new things are that we can do, but our folks are. So, in terms of the size of the opportunity, we\u2019ll continue to identify those on an annual basis. I don\u2019t think, they\u2019ll be going up substantially. My best guess is, they\u2019ll remain at these levels for at least the next couple of years and then we\u2019ll go from there. Mark Connelly : It\u2019s a good problem to have. Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Gail Glazerman : Hi, good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Gail. Russell Hagen : Hi, Gail. Gail Glazerman : Can you give some color on where your Lumber and OSB prices are currently versus the fourth quarter average? And was there anything kind of mix, or timing-related that helped drive your pricing up not necessarily to it is relative to in the months trend? Doyle Simons : Yes. So what I would tell you is, on the current and these are quarter-to-date realizations versus fourth quarter, Gail. Just to give you a sense, Lumber is about $10 higher, OSB is about $50 lower, because as we know, we had a big run off. I would say, both Lumber and OSB are trending in the right way. And as we move towards the building season, as I mentioned in response to an earlier question, we anticipate that trend will continue. In terms of OSB pricing, Gail, and I think you\u2019re talking about the fourth quarter. I would tell you, there\u2019s a couple of things. Number one is, as you look at it versus the indexes, there is a lag that we have. And so, when things are going down, ours don\u2019t fall as quickly, so that\u2019s part of it. And then just, as you also know, we have some premium flowing product, which helps skew it in a positive way as well. So I would say, those are big \u2013 two big things. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Thank you. And on the Southern log exports, can you just remind us to what extent the destination markets overlap with where you\u2019re shipping from the last? Doyle Simons : Yes. The good news is there, they don\u2019t overlap at all. Now, let me clarify that. We\u2019re sending to China and India. So of course, we do send out the West Coast to China, but these are going to different ports and for different uses than our Western log. So there\u2019s no the term I use cannibalization of logs that are coming from the South into China versus the West. So some of them are to new customers in China, some of them are to existing customers, but that are either going into different ports, or and all of it is for different uses than the Western logs are being used for. Gail Glazerman : Okay, helpful. And just one last one. In terms of Western log market, do you have any perspective how much extreme weather, both in terms of the winter last year with all the snow and rain, as well as the dry summer might have supported pricing, and if we got kind of more normal weather as we move through the summer, what your outlook might be? Doyle Simons : Gail, there\u2019s no doubt that the weather in 2017 was kind of a catalyst to get prices \u2013 well, prices are moving for the weather, but for prices to continue. I will tell you though, weather has stabilized. And as I mentioned earlier, we continue to be very encouraged by what we see in the West and that\u2019s primarily from a demand perspective. Japan continues to be solid. China is strong. In domestic markets, primarily driven by California, and as you know, California was slower to recover now. California is going permits, they are up 15% in California and we think that trend is going to continue. So, whether it\u2019s going to cause some volatility. But if you just look at overall supply and demand, I feel it\u2019s pretty good in the West. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes. Good morning, Doyle. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Chip. Chip Dillon : Thanks for all the information. One sort of couple of big picture questions. One is, could you just tell us, in your view, as you look at OSB and plywood, there has been decades of substitution out of plywood into OSB. And I guess, have we reached a point where there\u2019s very little substitution, meaning that all the use of plywood is basically in specialty areas, or in extreme cases, do you think several points of those markets could switch back and forth? And then I had a second question, if you could just talk a little bit about with the obvious high margins that lumber mills, I believe, are making in the South, in particular, and again that might get crimped in some point in the future, as you mentioned, as demand goes up for logs. Would it ever make sense for Weyerhaeuser to consider acquiring sawmills, just given that you would own them immediately and maybe it would be cheaper than building? Doyle Simons : So Chip, on the OSB plywood substitution, you\u2019re right, I mean, we\u2019ve seen that trend over, over many years. I think, it\u2019s kind of in balance now. Now that doesn\u2019t mean that there won\u2019t be some temporary shift. But overall, I don\u2019t see any fundamental shifts back and forth between OSB and plywood. In terms of lumber mills in the South, as you said and you\u2019re exactly right, very high margins there. As we have consistently said, we would look at growing our Wood Products business on a go-forward basis. We think our bigger opportunity is in Timberland, but we will look at growing Wood Products business. I think, lumber would be a business that we would be interested in growing, especially if it tied in with our overall strategic footprint from a Timberland perspective. In terms of how we would grow, number one is, doing projects like Dirk\u2019s and Millport. And then secondly, would be exactly what you said in finding acquisition opportunities, where at a value, where we think we \u2013 at a price where we think we could create shareholder value. Going and building greenfield mills is probably not a step that we\u2019re going to take. But we would be very interested in sawmills to acquire assuming again, we could do it at a price where we could create value over the cycle. You can assume that the margins that are currently in place are going to stay that way forever. Chip Dillon : Gotcha. And we hear a lot about the overgrown situation in the South, too much inventory, and you\u2019re giving some reasons why that could be alleviated in the near-term. But every county in the Southeast isn\u2019t the same. And could you maybe point out where you \u2013 where we should look for early indications of return in sawlogs, maybe particular states or parts of states that you kind of look for? Doyle Simons : Yes, I\u2019ll just give you one example. There\u2019s a couple of new mills that have started up kind of along the Arkansas, Louisiana border. And as I mentioned earlier, we are starting to see some benefit in some of those areas, where you\u2019ve seen some of this new capacity startup. So that\u2019s an example of where we are starting to see some benefit and some potential pricing tension in that market, and there\u2019s a lot of markets like that across the South. The good thing about Weyerhaeuser, as you know, we\u2019re just about in every markets. So as that starts to happen, we will participate in that pricing tension. Chip Dillon : Understood. Thank you. Operator : Today\u2019s final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn : Great. Thanks. Good morning, Doyle and Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Paul. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Paul. Paul Quinn : Just had a couple of quick questions. One on the labor issue side, whether you\u2019re seeing contractor inflation. Your contractors coming back to you and asking you for significantly more money, because they\u2019re having issues with getting labor on their side of the \u2013 harvesting \u2013 on the timber side? Doyle Simons : We are starting to see a little bit of that. It\u2019s much more prevalent on the transportation side than on the actual logging side. But we are seeing \u2013 starting to see a little bit of pressure on their logging side, as well as we move forward. And as I said, I think, inflation, there\u2019s labor inflation or truck inflation, it\u2019s going to be a headwind for us as we move into 2018. And we\u2019ll just kind of work really hard to offset that through our operational excellence efforts. Paul Quinn : Okay And then just turning to. U.S. South exports, what are your, and I might have missed this, but what are you looking at the Indian market and how do you view that market going forward? Doyle Simons : Yes. The Indian market is \u2013 so as I mentioned, we are focused on two markets, China and India. India is currently the smaller of those markets. Unlike China, where we had a presence, this is a new presence, but we\u2019re spending a lot of time on the ground there. And we\u2019re encouraged by the opportunity that we see, and I\u2019ll tell you there\u2019s a lot of interest in that market. So, we\u2019re still in the early stages, but encouraged and think that\u2019s a market that has real opportunity to grow as we move into 2018 and beyond. Paul Quinn : Great. That\u2019s all I had. Best of luck, guys. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Russell Hagen : Thank you. Doyle Simons : As I understand it, that was our final question. Let me end by thanking, everybody, for joining us this morning. And as always, thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude the Weyerhaeuser fourth quarter 2017 earnings conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Beth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s first quarter 2018 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Beth and welcome everyone. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $269 million or $0.35 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion. First quarter results include net after-tax charges of $6 million for special items. Excluding special items, we earned $275 million or $0.36 per diluted share. This is an improvement of 18% compared with the fourth quarter and 65% higher than a year ago. I\u2019m extremely pleased with our first quarter performance as we fully capitalize on strong lumber, OSB and Western log markets to drive outstanding results including the highest first quarter wood product EBITDA on record. Adjusted EBITDA for the company totaled $544 million, 20% more than a year ago and comparable to fourth quarter. Before I discuss our business results in more detail, let me make a few comments regarding the housing market. The housing market continues to grow at a healthy rate. Total housing starts for the first quarter average 1.32 million units on a seasonally adjusted annual basis the highest quarterly average since the second quarter of 2007. This is particularly notable given that a challenging winter delayed the start of the building season and a portion of the eastern United States. Year-to-date, total housing starts have improved 8% compared with a year ago and single family starts are up 7%. Permit activity is also healthy with total permits averaging over 1.3 million for the first quarter. Activity in the West has been particularly strong including in California where permit activity has increased 47% through February compared with a year ago. Builder confidence is high and our customers are reporting a strong start to the spring selling season supported by continued employment growth, rising wages, historically strong consumer confidence and growing participation by the millennial home buyer. The consistent optimism we hear from our customers reinforces our confidence that the housing market is well positioned to manage labor and lot challenges and build on it solid upward trajectory. For 2018, we continue to expect approximately 1.3 million total housing starts with single family start up nearly 10%. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands Charts 4 to 6. Timberlands contributed $189 million to earnings before special items, $23 million more than the fourth quarter and $41 million more than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA increased to $268 million. Western Timberlands delivered $165 million of first quarter EBITDA, $25 million more than the fourth quarter and $32 million more than a year ago. Western domestic market conditions were favorable throughout the quarter as strong lumber prices drove solid demand for logs. Mill inventory levels were moderate in most regions although log supply in southern Oregon remained tight due to continue winter weather. Pricing for domestic logs strengthen through the quarter. The harvest volume decline slightly compared with the fourth quarter, which had included fire season catch up volume. Forestry expenses were seasonally lower. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, log sales volumes and realizations improved nicely compared with the fourth quarter. Demand for our logs remained very solid as our customer sales volumes are strong. Compared with the year ago quarter sales volumes were slightly higher and realizations improved substantially. In China average realizations were flat compared with fourth quarter, while sales volumes decline modestly as construction activity paused seasonally for the Lunar New Year. Log inventories at Chinese ports increased during the Lunar New Year period but take away bounce back sharply if construction activity resumed and we anticipate inventories were returned to normal levels over the next several months. Overall, Chinese demand for our logs remains very solid and our volumes and realizations are substantially higher than a year ago. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands contributed $98 million to first quarter EBITDA comparable to the fourth quarter despite a seasonal decline in the harvest volume. The harvest declined 8% compared with fourth quarter but it increased 6% from the first quarter of last year. Challenging wet weather in several regions created market opportunities in the quarter as operability was limited and mill inventory decline below the target levels. Our teams did an exceptional job of leveraging our significant scale to flex volume take advantage of available harvest settings and increase deliveries to key customers while simultaneously ensuring adequate log decks at our own mills. For example, on one weekend a team in the Gulf South delivered over 200 truckloads of logs to one of our lumber mills while continuing to fulfill commitments to all other customers. Average sales realizations for southern sawlog and pulpwood increase slightly compared with the fourth quarter. Our per unit harvest and hauling costs decreased modestly as we flex to more accessible harvest settings and forestry costs declined due to wet weather. Northern timberlands contributed $6 million to EBITDA, $3 million less than the fourth quarter. The harvest volumes declined seasonally and average realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. The Timberlands business is making good progress against this 2018 operational excellence initiative and is on track to achieve it\u2019s $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for 2018. Our teams continue to generate and implement ideas to improve the productivity of harvesting and hauling operations, reduce the road maintenance and construction cost, optimize spending on forestry activities and ensure we maximize the revenue from every log we harvest. Real estate, energy and natural resources, Charts 7 and 8. Real Estate & ENR contributed $25 million to first quarter earnings and $41 million to adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million lower than the fourth quarter but comparable to a year ago. Fourth quarter is typically our seasonally strongest quarter while first quarter usually reflects the lowest level of transaction activity. Average price per acre sold increased compared with the fourth quarter due to mix. Over half of the acre sold in first quarter of 2018 was located in Montana, where Timberland prices are regionally lower. In contrast the majority of sales in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of 2017 were located in the U.S. South. EBITDA from energy and natural resources declined slightly compared with fourth quarter due to seasonally lower sales of construction materials. The real estate business is well positioned to meet or exceed its 30% targeted premium to timber value for 2018. Wood products, Charts 9 and 10, wood products contributed $250 million to first quarter earnings before special items, $29 million more than the fourth quarter and $78 million more than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $286 million, this is the highest first quarter EBITDA own record for this business and an improvement of nearly 40% compared with the year ago. Canadian rail transportation remained a challenge throughout the quarter and our Wood Products team did an outstanding job of devising creative ways to mitigate the disruptions about repositioning, available rail cars and shifting volume to trucks. Although the overall effect on our first quarter results was relatively minimal we did experience some shipment delays resulting in lower sales volumes for lumber and OSB compared with a year ago. EBITDA for lumber totaled $140 million, $24 million more than the fourth quarter and over 40% more than a year ago. Lumber pricing rose steadily during the first quarter as demand remained very solid. Channel inventories were low and transportation delays limited availability. Compared with the fourth quarter our average sales realizations improved 7% and sales volumes increased 3%. This was partially offset by higher Western oil cost. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for lumber includes charges of $5 million for countervailing and anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. The duties are calculated based on the final combined rate of 20.23% and are no longer reported as a special item. OSB contributed $92 million to EBITDA, $12 million lower than the fourth quarter but 40% more than a year ago. Compared with the fourth quarter a 6% decline in average sales realizations was partially offset by a 6% increase in sales volumes. Engineered wood products contributed $45 million to EBITDA and $11 million more than the fourth quarter and $8 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved 1% to 2% compared with the fourth quarter as we began to capture the benefit of our first quarter price increase. Sales volumes for solid section products improved due to seasonally higher demand but I-joist volumes declined as East Coast sales lagged due to winter weather. Manufacturing costs decreased due to lower prices for oriented strand board. Distribution contributed $15 million to first quarter EBITDA, the best quarter results ever reported for this business. EBITDA improved $10 million compared with the fourth quarter and $7 million more \u2013 and $7 million compared with a year ago. This business continues to focus on managing cost and product margins. Fourth quarter Wood Products results include one special item, a pretax benefit of $20 million from product remediation insurance proceeds. Each of the Wood Products businesses made good progress on their respective OpEx initiatives during the quarter, with teams focused on reducing controllable costs, improving mill reliability, enhancing product margins and maximizing the benefit of focused capital investments. We continue to expect collective OpEx benefits of $40 million to $60 million from this segment in 2018. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. Russell Hagen Thank you, Doyle, and good morning. The outlook for the second quarter is presented in Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we\u2019re expecting second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than second quarter of last year but approximately $25 million lower than the first quarter due to normal seasonality. In our Western Timberland operations, we expect second quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate slightly higher log sales realizations will be more than offset by seasonally higher unit logging costs and increased road and forestry costs. Log and haul costs will increase due to the planned shift of harvest activity to higher elevations in the spring months. Western road costs are expected to be higher than the first quarter due to additional road Zbuilding activities, which is typical in the second quarter. Japanese export log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter while sales volumes are expected to decline modestly due to the timing of shipments during the second quarter. We are seeing continued steady demand from our Japanese customers. Chinese export log volumes are expected to increase in the second quarter as construction activity has picked back up, following the February holidays. We anticipate average sales realizations will decrease slightly compared with the first quarter. In the South, we anticipate second quarter average sales realizations and fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be higher in the second quarter due to additional thinning activities and increased fuel and trucking costs. Silviculture spending in the South is expected to increase, which is typical coming into the spring season. In the North, we anticipate second quarter harvest volumes will be significantly lower than the first quarter due to spring break-up. Average sales realizations are expected to increase modestly compared to the first quarter. Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter are expected to be comparable with the first quarter. As is typical for the Real Estate business, the summer and fall months are the most active selling seasons, with the largest portion of sales closing in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources business in 2018. First quarter land bases, as a percentage of real estate sales, was slightly lower than our full year guidance of 40% to 50% due to the mix of acres sold. We continue to expect that land bases, as a percentage of real estate sales, will be between 40% and 50% for the full year 2018. For Wood Products, we anticipate second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the first quarter earnings before special items. Sales volumes are expected to increase quarter-over-quarter for all product lines. We expect slightly higher average sales realizations for lumber and significantly higher sales realizations for OSB, partially offset by higher Western log cost. Engineered wood products sales realizations will also be higher as we continue to capture the 6% to 12% price increase we announced early in the first quarter. Operating rates are expected to improve in the second quarter with a seasonal increase in demand. Overall, we expect adjusted EBITDA for our Wood Products segment to improve approximately 15% to 20% compared to the first quarter if lumber and OSB pricing remain at or near current levels for the balance of this quarter. Looking forward, we expect to take maintenance downtime in the third quarter at our Grayling OSB mill as we undertake a scheduled press replacement. As a result of this extended outage, we currently expect our third quarter OSB sales volumes will be approximately 10% lower than the third quarter of 2017. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Adjusted EBITDA decreased compared with the fourth quarter due to the higher non-cash charges for elimination of intercompany profit in inventory and LIFO. This was primarily driven by increasing values for softwood lumber and Western logs and seasonally higher inventory volumes. As stated in our prior earnings call, our pension and post-retirement benefit costs increased in the first quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $100 million of non-cash, non-operating pension and post-retirement expense for the full year 2018. First quarter unallocated items also included a pretax special charge of $28 million for environmental remediation associated with a formally owned mill site. Chart 12, summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $598 million. Cash from operations from the first quarter was $136 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to inventory and other working capital build as well as the timing of semiannual interest payments. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $81 million. We continue to expect total CapEx will be approximately $420 million, $300 million for Wood Products and $120 million for Timberlands. Moving on to debt. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.9 billion of debt outstanding. We repaid $62 million maturity during the quarter using available cash and we have no remaining maturities in 2018. Interest expense was $93 million in the first quarter. We expect interest expense of approximately $380 million for the full year. Moving on to taxes. We continue to expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of our earnings. Now I\u2019ll turn the call back to Doyle, and I look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Russell. First quarter was an outstanding quarter for Weyerhaeuser, and we have much more opportunity ahead. With a strong housing market trajectory, favorable market dynamics across our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses and a culture focused on operational excellence, we have the tools and runway to further improve on these strong financial results. Looking forward, we are relentlessly focused on capturing the full benefit of the opportunities in front of us in 2018 and beyond to drive as much value as possible for our shareholders. And now I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : From a big picture perspective, you\u2019re generating record cash from the Wood Products business and leverage seems fairly conservative to hear. I\u2019m wondering if you could just share how you\u2019re thinking about capital allocation at this point? And with regards specifically to maybe acquiring timberlands, how would you weigh opportunities that maybe you\u2019re seeing in the South versus maybe just repurchasing your own shares? You still have, I think, $0.5 billion roughly on the share repurchase authorization. Doyle Simons : Anthony, good question. And our financial priorities remain unchanged, first and foremost. We\u2019re committed to returning cash to shareholders. As we continue to capitalize on very favorable market conditions and our OpEx improvements, we\u2019re expecting strong cash flow generation for 2018. Our board will continue to regularly view opportunities to return cash to shareholders and this may come in the form of a increased dividend or as you pointed out, opportunistic share repurchases as appropriate. And we do have $500 million of authorization. Secondly, we\u2019ll continue to invest in our businesses. As you know, we\u2019re going to invest roughly $420 million back into our businesses this year. And then in addition, we\u2019ll look at growth opportunities going forward, primarily in Timberland but we\u2019ll be very disciplined in terms of growth opportunities as we move forward to make sure any acquisition that we may make would be value accretive for our shareholders. And then finally, our balance sheet, as you know, is in really good shape. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about capital allocation. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. And then just a clarification on the 2Q outlook. I think you\u2019re expecting higher average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. I know that you have maybe a little bit of lag with Random Lengths. Do you expect with kind of lumber and OSB prices in 2Q could maybe stay roughly in the same range that they are where they are currently here at the end of April? Or do you think those spot prices might decline or step down a little bit in 2Q as some of these kind of weather and transportation issues resolve themselves? Russell Hagen : Yes. So let me answer that in a couple of ways. Number one, just to give you a sense, as you said, there is a lag and as prices have moved up, it takes some time to catch up. Number two, just to give you a sense of where we are currently, quarter-to-date in lumber pricing, we\u2019re up roughly $10 versus the first quarter average and quarter-to-date in OSB, we\u2019re up roughly $40. As we look out, we continue to be encouraged by what we see in the markets. Fundamentally, the improvement in pricing and the markets overall is being driven by continued growth and demand, which is being driven by the improvement in housing and thin inventories across the system. In the first quarter, we all know we had some transportation issues. It\u2019s going to take a while, a couple of quarters, for those to fully resolve in the industry. And as that additional capacity comes online, our additional inventory comes online, is going to be coming online in a period which is a stronger building season. We did have some disruptions on the demand side during the first quarter due to weather. Those should be behind us and we\u2019ll be moving into a stronger building season. So as we factor all that in, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about prices for lumber and OSB as we move through the balance of the year. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Couple or three questions and thanks for all the details. I guess, the first question, Doyle, obviously, it sounds like weather and transportation impacted the volume trends that you otherwise would have seen in the first quarter. Is there a way to put a number, an approximate one, in terms of what your shipments would have looked like if you had a more normal, both logistics and weather environment, in the first quarter, recognizing it\u2019s wintertime every time in the first quarter? But what do you think you might have lost in terms of volume trends in the quarter? Doyle Simons : Yes, let me \u2013 rather than answering it in volume trends, let me try to answer it in terms of dollar impact on the quarter, George. And our best guess \u2013 and as you indicated, there\u2019s lots of moving parts, but our best guess is that weather had a roughly $5 million \u2013 and I\u2019m talking about our Wood Products group, had a roughly $5 million negative impact in the first quarter. And that the transportation challenges, specifically rail in Canada, had a $5 million impact. So the total of those two things is probably a $10 million \u2013 roughly a $10 million impact on our first quarter versus what you would call a more normal first quarter, if there is such a thing. George Staphos : Okay. Appreciate that Doyle. Second question, obviously, you have a couple of projects coming to maturation over the next year or so with Dierks and Millport. What ability do you have within your system as it\u2019s currently constructed, in other words, no new, no steel and concrete? But given what you have right now to tweak your capacity, where would you have more flexibility whether it be in lumber \u2013 that\u2019s where I\u2019d guess, but waiting on your answer, or OSB or wherever, should demand continue to, hopefully, it\u2019s a high-class problem, materialize positively. Doyle Simons : Yes, great question. And you\u2019re right, the biggest opportunity is in lumber. We will have both Dierks and Millport coming online as we move to late this year and in early next year. Those will increase our capacity by roughly 6%. And then on top of that, George, just through ongoing capital and just running better, we think we can increase our capacity by another 2% to 3% on top of that 6% that\u2019s going to come from Millport and Dierks. So that\u2019s our biggest opportunity on the volume side as we move forward. George Staphos : Okay. And just for clarification, 2% to 3% is an annual figure or that\u2019s total over the rest of the cycle? Doyle Simons : Now thank you for the clarification. That is an annual figure, 2% to 3%. George Staphos : I\u2019ll turn it over, I\u2019ll come back with an additional question later. Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Good morning everyone. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire : My first question, just looking at Chart 5, I\u2019m sort of struck by the huge gap between Western and Southern log prices. And it\u2019s always been a big gap, but we\u2019ve opened up to about $100 a ton difference. Just I know they\u2019re sort of different markets to a large degree. But I just wondered if there\u2019s \u2013 if you\u2019ve ever seen a gap this wide before, and if there\u2019s ever \u2013 if there\u2019s really a point where you or others could look to arbitrage that? I mean, I know shipping costs overland are prohibited, but just also thinking about the export market and some of the opportunities you\u2019re trying to create out of the South, just wondering if the super wide gap that\u2019s opened up could potentially just change some of the thinking behind what a Western market is and what a Southern market is. Doyle Simons : Brian, so you\u2019re right, there is a large gap. We\u2019ve been very encouraged by what\u2019s happened in the West and think there is additional opportunity as we move forward. In terms of arbitrage for the reasons you identified, very difficult because of the high cost of trucking logs from one portion of the United States to another. I think more likely what\u2019s going to happen is you\u2019re going to see that gap close as Southern log prices start to move in. And as we think about Southern log prices, Brian, we\u2019re actually encouraged by what we see in the South, and we are starting to see some very early signs of pricing improvement in markets. If you say, well, what are the key drivers of that? Number one, continued growth in demand, and you heard what we had to say about our optimism about housing. Number two is the declining share of \u2013 declining Canadian share of the U.S. market. That\u2019s 26% year-to-date versus 30% last year. Third and very importantly is all the new Wood Products capacity that\u2019s coming online. Specifically, the 4-plus billion board feet of capacity additions that are coming online 2017 to 2020. Just to give you a sense, that\u2019s 20% of Southern capacity. And as that new capacity comes online, we expect to see those specific wood baskets tension and put upward pressure on sawlog pricing overall. And in fact, we\u2019re already starting to see that in a couple of areas with new capacity. One is in Central Mississippi, where the new Beuren mill is up and running and prices have moved up over there. And then secondly, even in markets where the capacity isn\u2019t up and running yet, but it\u2019s been announced, for example, the Warrenton, Augusta, Georgia area, the new mill announcements by GP and Canfor have already caused that wood basket to tension. And then the final thing, which is regarding your comment on the Southern export markets, we are making really good progress in developing our export business out of the Southern U.S. We\u2019re already running an export program on the Atlantic Coast out of Charleston and Wilmington, and we\u2019re also working to establish a new program out of the Gulf South, which we expect to have up and running in a few months. We expect to triple the size of our export program in 2018, which we did \u2013 try to mention that, would be comparable to a midsized sawmill. And we think there is meaningful potential for significant additional upside in both China and India going forward. So that\u2019s how we think about the South. And to your original question, we think that gap will close over time as a result of improving Southern log prices. Brian Maguire : And just related to that, the exports that you are starting to see out of the South, are the realizations there comparable to Southern realizations? Or are you seeing any signs of a little bit better pricing because it\u2019s the export market? You\u2019re recognizing that your shipping costs are going to be higher obviously. But netting that against the shipping costs, will the netbacks to the mill on exports be comparable to other Southern sales that you you\u2019ve got? Doyle Simons : What I would say is, to date, they\u2019re comparable to a little bit better. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just one last one from me on just the Timberland markets themselves. It seems like \u2013 recently, some others have written about transaction activity being really slow, really \u2013 starting maybe in the second half of 2017 continuing into 2018. Just wondering if you\u2019re seeing that also as you bring some parcels to land \u2013 some land parcels to market. And any sense what could break that logjam? Is it prices that need to move lower or do people need to feel a bit better about the housing markets or interest rates? Just any color you can give on that would be helpful. Russell Hagen : Sure, Brian. This is Russell. I\u2019m going to break it into two pieces. One, I think you\u2019re asking a little bit about our Real Estate program. That\u2019s definitely a different market than the Timberlands, the broader Timberland market. So just on Real Estate on the first quarter, it was comparable to last quarter. Second quarter should be comparable to first quarter, and then we\u2019ll start seeing activity pick up as people get into the marketplace. And then we\u2019ll see a majority of that closings in the fourth quarter. And that\u2019s pretty typical for the Real Estate business. On the Timberland side, it has been a slow first quarter, and that\u2019s pretty typical also. We would expect that the transaction volume for 2018 will be comparable to 2017. We are seeing fewer transactions or fewer offerings in the market kind of in the beginning. But I think that will start loosening up as some of the TIMOs start bringing some of their properties out of some of the funds that are terminating or coming to full life. But overall, we think the market should pick up in the second half of the year. Brian Maguire : Okay. I appreciate the color. Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Gail Glazerman : Hey Good morning. I guess, I just wanted to dig into the lumber and OSB markets a little bit more and the impact, just maybe psychological impact of some of the supply shortages. I guess, one, can you just give a little more color on where inventories started the year on both the producer and the customer side and where you think they are currently? And just any \u2013 maybe a little bit more color, you did try to lay out the argument as to why maybe things won\u2019t get worse. But as that \u2013 as those inventories do clear from Western Canada, how confident are you that the market will be able to absorb it without kind of easing off some of that panic that was in the market earlier? Doyle Simons : Yes. So as you look at inventories, Gail, other than the build and mills in Canada, inventories throughout the system remain very lean, both for lumber and OSB. In terms of the \u2013 those inventories at the mills becoming available, I would tell you all indications are that\u2019s going to take some time. Seeing railway is hiring more people, putting in new cars, but they\u2019ve indicated it\u2019s not going to be until the third quarter until that actually starts to make an impact. So I think that additional inventory that\u2019s at the mills is going to come online over time, not in one big chunk. And it\u2019s going to come online at a time, as I said, where we\u2019re going to need more because if we\u2019re going to be in the seasonally strong period when we have winter weather behind us and there will be more building activity. Gail Glazerman : Okay. And then just switching gears. Realize you have the $20 million insurance recovery in the quarter. There was a headline earlier in the week that kind of suggests that maybe you\u2019re having some issues. And could you just give an update on where \u2013 about a court case kind of seeking $260 million. Can you just put some color on that and where you stand? Doyle Simons : Yes, the court case \u2013 all it was, was there was a filing to clarify venue for any disputes that may arise regarding coverage. We\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made. We\u2019ve recovered $20 million in the first quarter, another $5 million so far in the second quarter. And we remain confident that we will recover a significant portion of the costs associated with Flak Jacket ultimately. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Just one last one. Obviously, somewhat of a moot point, given the delivery issues in the quarter. But just your latest thinking and what you\u2019re hearing on the trade dispute and how that fits into current NAFTA negotiations. Doyle Simons : Say that again, Gail. I\u2019m not sure I followed your question. Gail Glazerman : Just your current thinking on the softwood lumber trade dispute and where that may or may not be impacted relative to current NAFTA negotiations. Doyle Simons : Yes, good question. So the SLA negotiations have been sidelined due to the focus on NAFTA. The two are not, as you know, directly linked, but there have not been ongoing discussions. Bottom line is we remain hopeful that, over time, we will be able to reach a quota-based agreement. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Salvator Tiano : Hi, guys. This is Salvator Tiano filling in for Chip. How are you? Doyle Simons : Good. How are you doing this morning? Salvator Tiano : Great. So a couple of questions. Number one, just clarify, to dig a little bit deeper into George\u2019s earlier question. On OSB and lumber sales, you mentioned I think a $10 million combined hit, but how should we be thinking in terms of what can be recovered in the second quarter? Is there anything that\u2019s just been pushed there and we can see even stronger volumes? Or is this also higher expense-related and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it anymore? Doyle Simons : Well, if it\u2019s product that was made that we weren\u2019t able to ship for whatever reason, that could show up in the second quarter. If it was weather-related and we weren\u2019t able to make it, which was \u2013 we did have some downshifts in the \u2013 primarily in the Southern U.S. during the first quarter, not able to make that up. So I would say it\u2019s a combination of both. Salvator Tiano : Can you provide kind of any clarification with regard to \u2013 out of this $10 million, what can be recovered? Or is it something you cannot comment? Doyle Simons : I would say a portion of it will be recovered in the second quarter. Not able to quantify that exactly. Salvator Tiano : Okay. Understood. And the second big picture question here. Just wanted to get your thinking now that we\u2019re seeing indeed more lumber mills coming via South. What do you think will be required to start seeing higher timber prices there in terms of perhaps additional projects, the inventory \u2013 kind of the log inventory clearing? What is your thinking towards moving to higher prices on a more sustainable basis? Doyle Simons : Yes. As we said earlier, we\u2019re encouraged by what we are seeing in the South. A key driver of that is the additional capacity that is coming online. The additional amounts, roughly 4-plus billion board feet, which is 20% add in the South, that\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019re encouraged by that. That, combined with the increase in the Southern export market, less lumber coming in from Canada and just, very importantly, the overall improvement in demand driven by housing growing at 7%, 8%, 9%, all are positive things that are going to result in us reaching that point where \u2013 the inflection point where we will start to see improvement in southern log prices. And as I mentioned earlier, we\u2019ve already started to see some slight improvement in some select markets where additional capacity has either come online or decided to come online. Salvator Tiano : Perfect. Thank you very much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Hey, good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Collin. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Collin. Collin Mings : First question. Doyle, you touched on this already on the \u2013 really the Canadian side of things, but you guys were pretty successful delivering results in 1Q despite some of the cost pressures out there. Can you maybe just talk a little bit more about the trucking and labor cost pressures? You discussed that in detail a little bit last quarter. How are those kind of looking as you go into 2Q now? Doyle Simons : Yes. So from a trucking perspective, truck availability continues to be challenging across the U.S. and Canada. We expect, as we indicated in the \u2013 in our earlier call, that we expect these challenges to persist. And trucking rates are, in fact, increasing somewhere in the 5% to 8% range, but we are working really hard to mitigate those cost increases through OpEx. And then in terms of labor, that\u2019s just going to be a constant headwind. But again, a lot of work that\u2019s going on there to make sure that we\u2019re all setting that through OpEx. And then the final thing I would highlight is things like resin costs are going to be a headwind as well. But we\u2019ll work to either \u2013 both to primarily to reduce our usage of resin to the extent we can and other ways to offset that cost pressure. Collin Mings : Okay. And then just switching to the Real Estate front. I mean, you noted in the past that there have been some maybe government funding issues that was keeping a lid on sales activity, to some extent, on the Real Estate side. Any change or any sense that, that is changing on the margin at all? Or again, do you expect that to kind of be a headwind relative to maybe what adjusted EBITDA from that segment would have been otherwise? Russell Hagen : Collin, this is Russell. You\u2019re correct, the federal budget include $200 million for conservation funding. That\u2019s a real positive. But those types of transactions take a little bit of time to form up, and so we would expect to see the benefit of that coming in really in 2019. As far as our outlook for 2018, as we stated, we still \u2013 we expect to hit the $250 million of EBITDA for the Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources business. And meet our premium targets of 30%. Collin Mings : All right. That\u2019s it from me. Congrats on the quarters guys. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Collin. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Doyle. Good morning, Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Mark. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : I want to just start out by you saying that I think this Wood Products performance is pretty impressive. Because if you look back the last time you were running like this was in the mid-2000s and we had much higher housing starts and the Weyerhaeuser footprint was much bigger in Wood Products. Doyle Simons : Thank you for saying that Mark. Our folks have done a lot of really hard work to get to where we are today. More to do, but appreciate that acknowledgment. Mark Wilde : Yes. I wondered, Doyle, you\u2019ve talked for the last three or four years about this goal of kind of black at the bottom. Where would you say you are on that metric right now? We know they\u2019re not going to always be great. Doyle Simons : They\u2019re not always going to be great and that\u2019s the way we\u2019re running our company and, specifically, the Wood Products group. We\u2019ve made a lot of progress in that front. And basically, just remind everybody what we\u2019ve done is gone back and recreated the results that were during the last recession. Hopefully, we never go back to those. But making sure that we have a cost structure in place that if we do go back to that \u2013 that type of situation, that we would be generating positive cash flow. Very encouraged by the progress we\u2019ve made there as a result of the OpEx work. We were roughly 90% there at the end of 2017 and anticipate being 100% of the way to being black at the bottom by the end of 2018. So a lot of really good work, a lot of good progress on that. And Mark, you\u2019re right. We know things won\u2019t stay this way forever, but the beauty of the work we\u2019ve done, it allows us to fully capitalize on the upside, but also, when this thing does roll over, which we know it ultimately will, we will be in a cash flow positive position on a go-forward basis. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then I noted, Doyle, in response to an earlier question about acquisitions, you said that, primarily, you would be focusing on Timberland but you didn\u2019t say exclusively. If you were going to do things in building products, can you just give us some sense of what\u2019s your criteria would be? Doyle Simons : Sure, Mark. So we\u2019ll \u2013 like I said, we will be focused primarily on Timberland. But we do think there may be opportunities for what I would call more bolt-on acquisitions in Wood Products that some of the key criteria would be if it fit into our wood basket, that would be a positive. But even more than that, it would be making sure that we were acquiring a mill or a set of mills at a price where we could generate long-term value for our shareholders on a go-forward basis. So we\u2019ll continue to actively look for those type of bolt-on acquisitions. Most assets, I think, are pretty fairly valued right now from a Wood Products perspective, but we\u2019ll continue to look but be disciplined in acquisition opportunities on our Wood Products side. Mark Wilde : Okay. Last question I had is for either you or Russell. I\u2019m just trying to get a sense. Given this big move we\u2019ve had in the West Coast log prices, whether that is really starting to constrain some of the domestic converters, whether the log price is just too high for them to carry at this point, whether it\u2019s for plywood or lumber or whatever. Doyle Simons : Mark, because of the run-up in lumber prices, in plywood, but more specifically in lumber prices, even at these higher Western log costs, lumber mills \u2013 I think most lumber mills are profitable. I know ours are. So that margin is still there to be had based on current log prices and current lumber prices on the West Coast. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fairly good. I\u2019ll turn it over. Thanks, Doyle. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Steve Chercover : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Steve Chercover : So first off, we\u2019ve been hearing about new sawmill capacity coming on stream in the South for some time, but it sounds like the ramp is slower than anticipated. And it sounds like some of the equipment deliveries are behind schedule. So maybe you can confirm that, and is it impacting any of your projects? Doyle Simons : So not impacting our projects at all. As I indicated, Dierks will be up later this year and Millport early next year, and we are on schedule on both of those projects. In terms of the overall increase in sawmill capacity, we anticipate that that\u2019s going to be 4-plus billion. We anticipate the timing of that is roughly 1 billion a year, 2017 to 2020. Clearly, a some of that is \u2013 been pushed back a little bit because of the lack of contractor availability. But it will \u2013 our sense is while it is being delayed somewhat because of the competition for contractors, it\u2019s ultimately going to come online but maybe pushed back temporarily. Steve Chercover : Got it. And then my second question was on the work at Grayling. I want to clarify, first of all, is it a press rebuild because I thought you said replacement? So which is it and will you gain any capacity? Russell Hagen : So Steve, this is Russell. It is a press replacement. And as far as the capacity, the capacity will be about the same as prior. So this is just an old press and it\u2019s time to replace it, and it will make the mill much more cost-effective as we go forward. Steve Chercover : Got it. And could you just remind us, I missed it, the financial production impact in Q3? Russell Hagen : About 10% is what we said on the sales volume in Q3 compared to prior \u2013 the prior year. Steve Chercover : Great. Thanks Russell. Thank you both. Russell Hagen : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Doyle, so you are mentioning about 1 billion a year in lumber, I think, in the U.S. South, which I guess is not that much. If we think about a 50 billion-plus market, that\u2019s only 2% or so. Now is there also incremental capacity that you think is also going to be coming on in addition to that? And/or what would be happening in some of the other regions? And might there actually even be even possible offsets in Western Canada, for instance? Doyle Simons : Yes, it\u2019s a good question, Mark. So what I would say is the way we\u2019re thinking about these numbers is, it is a 20% \u2013 the 4-plus billion board feet is a 20% increase in Southern capacity. But if you look across the entire system, it\u2019s much more like a 5% increase across the entire industry. As you further indicated, we don\u2019t anticipate much, if any, additional increase in the West. And in fact, we think there will be shrinking capacity in Canada. So net-net, while there is a lot of capacity coming on in the South, we think, from a supply and demand perspective for lumber, that\u2019s going to continue to be very good as we look forward. As you know, operating rates are already north of 90%. If you look at the numbers, demand is growing 7%, 8% a year. And this additional supply, if you look at it from an overall industry perspective, not just the South but overall industry perspective, it\u2019s growing about 5% a year. So demand, we think, is going to continue to outpace supply, which should be positive as we move forward. Mark Weintraub : And so following up, it\u2019s very encouraging to hear some pricing power in some of those markets in the U.S. South saw timber. I guess, one of the toughest things, for me at least, to try to figure out is when things get good, where can U.S. saw timber prices go? I mean, I know where they went historically. But what would be the \u2013 what are \u2013 what\u2019s the kind of framework that maybe would be helpful in thinking through where U.S. saw timber prices could potentially go in tighter markets? Doyle Simons : Yes. So if you look at it historically, prior to the recession, Southern sawlog prices were $15, $20 higher than they are today. So I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason at all that as these things tighten up, and they will as we indicated, that you could see that type of pricing improvement. If you use the West as a market or as a reference point, there\u2019s even more opportunity in front of that, especially as we start to develop these export markets. So if things really get humming domestically because of all the additional capacity that\u2019s coming online, you\u2019re going to have less coming in from Canada as we talked about, and then you have an export market on top of that. You can paint a scenario that could be pretty good for Southern sawlog prices in the future. Mark Weintraub : Thanks. That\u2019s exactly where I was trying to go. So you do use the West, are you willing to hazard an estimate to what that would mean for U.S. Southern sawlog prices could go to be at kind of equivalent basis? Doyle Simons : Yes, I haven\u2019t done that exact math, Mark. But Southern \u2013 in the West, sawlog prices recovered fairly quickly after the recession to where they were before. And they\u2019ve gone up significantly past that level in the West. And again, with all the key drivers that I just outlined, I don\u2019t see any reason that you couldn\u2019t see over time the same type of improvement in the South that we\u2019ve seen in the West over the past few years. Mark Weintraub : Great. Thanks very much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thanks. How much impact do you think the freight issues are having on lumber prices? Because there\u2019s so many supply challenges in the past year, that\u2019s hard to keep track of what\u2019s going on, on the supply side. Doyle Simons : Yes, Mark, I think fundamentally, what\u2019s happening on lumber and OSB is you just have continued growth in demand, coupled with a balance on the supply side of the equation, which is shown in the lean inventories throughout the system. Now there\u2019s no doubt that some of these temporary disruptions like freight are having a temporary impact. But I would say yes, we had freight disruptions or challenges in the first quarter, but we also had \u2013 on the supply side, but we also had weather challenges on the demand side. So as we think about it long term, we\u2019re optimistic because, again, it\u2019s ultimately lean inventories throughout the system, coupled with where we are in terms of the demand side of the equation. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about it. We\u2019re going to continue to have these one-off situations that happen. But as long as inventories continue to be at low levels and we continue to have growth in demand, which we anticipate because of what\u2019s happening on the housing front, we\u2019re pretty optimistic about pricing going forward. Mark Connelly : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. A question on Timberlands, do you think that the geographic mix of the EBITDA you\u2019re generating that we saw this quarter and last quarter is going to persist? I mean, obviously, log prices are up in the West. But is there something structural happening in mix or volume that we should be thinking about between the South and the West? Russell Hagen : So are you referring to Real Estate sales or\u2026 Mark Connelly : No, I\u2019m thinking about Timberland, the overall realizations that you\u2019re getting there, not the Real Estate side. Doyle Simons : So Mark, I\u2019d say there\u2019s nothing structural that\u2019s changing there. As you know, we\u2019ve seen much more pricing improvement in the West than we have in the South over the past few quarters. But in terms of structurally, nothing that should change significantly in that mix of earnings going forward. Mark Connelly : So no significant gains in silviculture or anything like that in the South relative to the West? Doyle Simons : There are gains in silviculture, for example, on \u2013 in both. As we\u2019ve indicated, longer term, there will be \u2013 from a harvest level perspective, the West will be coming down or did come down \u2013 will be coming down this year, whereas the South in the near term will be going up. But other than that, no structural changes. Mark Connelly : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks, Doyle. Doyle Simons : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much. I just wanted to understand the criteria around the black at the bottom phrase and the testing that you\u2019ve done. What\u2019s sort of log, lumber, OSB price matrices? Doyle Simons : Paul, good question. Basically, what we did is we went back and looked at what those prices were back in the depths of the recession and said, okay, if we go back to that type of situation, what type of cost structure do we need in our Wood Products system to be black at the bottom? So that\u2019s the work that we\u2019ve done to model what \u2013 where we needed to be. Hopefully, again, we don\u2019t go back to a recession as deep as the one we saw back in 2008, 2009, but that\u2019s the way we modeled it. Paul Quinn : So there\u2019s been quite a bit of investment in \u2013 across a number of OSB as well as lumber mills that would suggest that the cost curve, it didn\u2019t push down. Do you expect that those recessionary conditions are going to be the next \u2013 similar to the next recession? Or is it \u2013 there\u2019s a whole bunch of mills out there that haven\u2019t had a lot of investment and those marginal mills will come off and that\u2019ll be the bottom? Doyle Simons : Yes. And we\u2019ll have to see how that plays out. But I think you highlighted exactly what we\u2019re focused on, is making sure that when the next recession happens, and we all know it will, that our mills are well positioned. There will be other mills in the industry that would \u2013 have not focused on cost or capital has not been spent in where they will absolutely not be black at the bottom and will be well positioned to continue to run during the next downturn. Paul Quinn : All right. Fair enough, good results. Thanks guys. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Doyle Simons : So as I understand it, that is our last question. I would like to thank everybody for being on the call this morning and, as always, for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining today\u2019s call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute, to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead ma\u2019am. Beth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with Forward-Looking Statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Beth and welcome everyone. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $317million or $0.42 per diluted share on net sales of $2.1 billion. Second quarter results included net after-tax charges of $15 million for special items. Excluding special items, we earned $332 million or $0.44 per diluted share. This is an improvement of 21% compared with the first quarter and 57% higher than a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the Company totaled $637 million, 17% more than the first quarter and 26% more than a year ago. I\u2019m very pleased with our second quarter results. Our business has delivered solid operating performance and capitalized on very favorable markets for lumber, OSB and Western log. This enabled us to drive our highest wood products EBITDA own record and Weyerhaeuser\u2019s highest quarterly EBITDA since 2006 when the Company\u2019s operations were nearly three times larger than they are today. Before I discuss our business results in more detail, let me make a few comments regarding the housing market. Housing market fundamentals remain strong, employment growth continues, wages are rising and consumer confidence has surpassed previous session has. Although mortgage rates have risen, housing affordability remains very favorable compared with historical averages. First time in entry-level buy where [agent] (Ph) enter the market and builder sentiment remains positive. As is been the case for this entire recovery, housing data remain volatile; total starts surged to 11 year highs in May, didn\u2019t pull back in June and those variations will likely continue as heat, wet weather and many other factors affect monthly construction activity. However, year-to-date trend illustrates a steady upward trajectory we anticipated. Through June total housing starts have averaged approximately 1.3 million on a seasonally adjusted annual basis and improvement of nearly 8% year-to-date. Single-family starts have improved by over 8%; permit activity range strong with total permit averaging over 1.3 million year-to-date. Our builder customers still there, effectively navigating labor and lot availability and cost and are well-positioned to continue meeting pent up demand. For 2018, we continue to expect approximately 1.3 million total housing starts with single-family starts nearly 10%. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberland, Charts 4 to 6. Timberland contributed $161 million in second-quarter earnings compared with $189 million in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $240 million, $28 million lower than the first quarter, but $18 million more than a year ago. Western Timberland delivered over 152 million of second-quarter EBITDA, $13 million lower than the first quarter, but $28 million higher than a year ago. Demand Western domestic logs remained favorable throughout the quarter as record lumber prices built continue purchases and average log sales realizations improved slightly. Pricing in some regions softened late in the quarter due to a seasonal increase in log supply from non-industrial landowners. However, many Oregon markets remained tangent as mills built log deck in advance of the third quarter fire season, which has begun earlier than usual. Fee harvest volume declined slightly compared with the first quarter. Unit logging and hauling cost increase due to rising fuel costs and longer hauling distances as snow diminish increase began to harvest higher elevation stand. Silviculture and road expenses also increased. This activity typically accelerates in the second quarter due to improved weather. Turning to our export markets, in Japan demand for our logs remain solid and average log sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Log sales volumes declined slightly due to timing of shipments. Compared with the year ago quarter, sales volumes were moderately higher and realizations improved substantially. In China sales volume increased nicely compared with the first quarter and average realizations were slightly higher, construction activity and daily log take away remain very solid and log inventories at Chinese ports declined during the quarter. Overall Chinese demand for our logs remains very favorable and our volumes and realizations were significantly higher than a year ago. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $84 million to second quarter EBITDA compared with $98 million in the first quarter. Average log sales realizations increased slightly due to a heavier mix of pulpwood and slightly lower pulpwood realizations; average realizations for southern saw logs were flat. Fee harvest declined 2% versus the first quarter and per unit harvest and hauling costs increased due to additional spinning activity and higher fuel costs. Other revenue also declined seasonally. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA declined due to higher fuel costs and lower average pulpwood realizations. Northern Timberlands contributed $3 million to EBITDA, $3 million less in the first quarter but a $1 million more than a year ago. Fee harvest volume declined seasonally as spring break up, limited activity in some areas, average realizations improved compared to the first quarter as strong lumber prices built demand for hardwood saw logs. Timberlands business is making good progress against this 2018 operational excellence initiatives and is on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for the year. Key focus areas include improving the productivity of harvesting and hauling operations, reducing road cost, optimizing forestry spending and maximizing the revenue from every log we harvest. Real estate, energy and natural resources, Chart 7 and 8, real estate and E&R contributed $22 million to second quarter earnings and $47 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA was $6 million higher than the first quarter and $10 million more than a year ago. Contribution to earnings decreased slightly compared with the first quarter due to a higher average land basis for the mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased significantly compared with the first quarter due to mix. Quarter acreage sales in Montana where Timberland prices are regionally lower. EBITDA from energy and natural resources increased compared with first quarter, due to seasonally higher sales of construction materials. The real estate business is solidly on track to meet or exceed its target 30% premium to timber value for 2018. Wood products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood products contributed $349 million to second quarter earnings before special items, nearly $100 million more than the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $385 million. This is the highest quarterly EBITDA ever for this business, an improvement of over 40% compared with a year ago. EBITDA for lumber totaled $195 million, 55 million more than the first quarter and over 50% more than a year ago. Compared with the first quarter our average sales realizations improved 9% and sales volume increased by nearly 11%. This was partially offset by higher Western and Canadian log costs. Lumber prices increased through much of the second quarter as strong building activity drove consistent demand and rail supply issues continue to constrain shipments for many Canadian producers. As rail service began to normalize late in the quarter, industry shipment volume increased with flaming lumber usage typically moderate - as the second quarter concluded, pricing and selling, while channel inventories recalibrate. All of the worst Canadian rail destructions have been resolved. Transportation logistics remain challenging for both rail and product shipment due to tight supply and strong summer times shipping demand. Our wood products team has done an outstanding job of inviting options such as direct tracking, additional reloads and rail car repositioning to flow product to customers and as of today we have cleared all of our shipment backlog. Second quarter charges for countervailing and anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber totaled $6 million, compared with $5 million in the first quarter. At our first quarter 2018 these duties are no longer reported as a special item. OSB contributed a $129 million to EBITDA, 37 million more than the first quarter and nearly 50% more than a year ago. Pricing rose throughout the quarter due to continued strong demand and average sales realizations increased about 17%. Sales volume increased 2% and fiber costs increased slightly. Engineered wood products contributed $58 million of EBITDA. $13 million more than the first quarter and $6 million more than a year ago. Average sales realizations improved approximately 3% compared with the first quarter as we continue to capture the benefit of our early 2018 price increase and sales volumes improved due to seasonally higher demand. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the first quarter as improved operating rate offset higher prices for oriented strand board. Distribution contributed $12 million to second quarter EBITDA $3 million more than the first quarter and slightly lower than one year ago due to higher fuel and labor costs. This business remained highly focused on managing costs and product margins. Second quarter with products result include one special item a net pretax charge of $20 million for finalization of remediation costs associated with our Flak Jacket product. Wood product is on track to achieve its OpEx target of $40 million to $60 million in 2018 teams are highly focused on reducing controllable costs, increasing by recovery, improving new reliability, enhancing product margins and maximizing the benefit of focused capital investment. I will now turn it over Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thank you, Doyle and good morning. The outlook for the third quarter is presented in Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberland\u2019s business as customary, we expect our third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be seasonally lower than the second quarter slightly higher than the third quarter a year ago. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect third quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the second quarter. Domestic law demand is expected to be stable during the third quarter with third quarter average sales realizations at level slightly below the second quarter average. Third quarter realizations could be higher if a severe fire season limits regional log supply during the quarter. Japanese export log volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter while average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower. Overall we are seeing continued steady demand from our Japanese customers. Chinese export demand remains strong, however sales volumes are expected to soften, which is typical during the summer months. Long realizations are expected to be slightly lower. Western Road costs are expected to be seasonally higher, log and haul costs will also increase as we continue to harvest at higher elevations to the summer months, resulting in longer haul distances. Fuel costs are also expected to increase. In the South, we anticipate third quarter average sales realizations will be comparable to the second quarter and fee harvest volumes will be seasonally higher. Civil culture and forestry spending in the South is expected to increase as we perform more hardwood management and site prep work during the dry weather and continue our thinning activity. We also anticipate higher fuel cost and per unit log and haul expenses. In the North, we anticipate third quarter harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the second quarter, as we move past the spring break-up season. Real estate and energy and natural resources, earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the quarter are expected to be 35% to 40% higher than the second quarter. As is typical real estate business, markets are most active in the summer and fall months with the largest portion of sales closing in the fourth quarter. We continue to expect approximately $250 million of adjusted EBITDA from our real estate and energy and natural resources business in 2018. Second quarter land basis as a percentage of real estate sales, was slightly higher than our full year guidance of 40% to 50% due to the mix of a acres sold. We now anticipate that land basis will be at the higher end of this range for the full year 2018. For wood products, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be 10% to 15% lower than the second quarter, significantly higher than a year ago. This includes a $25 million impact from extended maintenance downtime at our Grayling OSB mill, as we undertake a scheduled press replacement. Although pricing is soften from record highs, we anticipate lumber and OSB prices will stabilize over the next few weeks and average realizations for the third quarter will be moderately lower than the second quarter average. Sales volumes for lumber should be comparable to the second quarter. The sales volumes for engineered wood products should increase. Third quarter OSB volumes will be approximately 10% lower than the second quarter due to the Grayling press replacement. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The $26 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with first quarter is primarily attributable to the non-cash elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and life of reserve. During the first quarter, we incurred expenses as we built inventory of logs and lumber at higher prices; in the second quarter we began to deplete those inventories. Our unallocated pension and postretirement benefit costs also decreased; each year in the second quarter we finalize prior year end estimates for pension plan assets and liabilities. As a result of this work, we now expect to record a total of approximately $75 million in non-cash, non-operating pension and postretirement expense for the full year 2018, reduction of $25 million from our prior guidance. This should result in a non-operating pension and postretirement expense of approximately $19 million for each of the remaining quarters in 2018. Chart 12, summarizes our key financial items. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $901 million, cash from operations during the second quarter was $597 million an increase of 461 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $97 million. We continue to expect total CapEx will be approximately $420 million, $300 million for wood products and $120 million for Timberlands. Moving on the debt. We ended the quarter with approximately $5.9 billion of debt outstanding. We have no remaining maturities in 2018. Moving on the taxes, we continue to expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of earnings. Finally I would like to update you on our share repurchase activity. During July, we have purchased $75 million or approximately two million shares an average price of $34.82 per share; as of yesterday we have 425 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now, I will turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your questions. Doyle Simons : Thank you Russell. Our second quarter financial performance was the strongest in over a decade and I\u2019m incredibly proud of the effort our teams have put into achieving these results. They reflect several years of hard work to capture OpEx opportunities. Improved relative performance in each of our businesses and position us to capitalize on the markets we are experiencing today. At the same time, we have significant runway ahead; our operational excellence work is not complete and with favorable housing fundamentals, strong market outlook and a relentless focus on improving our relative performance. We will be well-positioned to derive as much value as possible for shareholders. And now, I would like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Doyle you are generating record cash from wood products. You are very conservatively levered coming into the quarter and now you are kind of more under levered. I was wondering if you could talk about capital allocation, are there properties out there in the market that are potentially good value, are there parts of our portfolio that could be augmented through acquisition or Russell talked about your share repurchases in July. Are there opportunities to accelerate your buybacks is that a sign of things to come, kind of any thoughts you could share will be helpful. Doyle Simons : Sure, let me talk about our how we think about capital allocation and our financial priorities. And first and foremost as we talk about as returning cash to shareholders. As you alluded to, as we continue to capitalize on strong marketing conditions and our OpEx improvements we are generating lot of cash. We are committed to returning cash to shareholders, primarily through a growing dividend. But also through opportunistic share repurchase as Russell just mentioned in last week or so we have repurchased $75 million of shares and we will continue to work very closely with our Board to review opportunities to continue to return cash to shareholders through a growing dividend, share repurchase or both. In terms of other uses, we are our CapEx is going to be roughly $420 million this year, probably similar level next year and then it will start to trend down. We will also look for growth opportunities. Anthony and as we said, those would be primarily in Timberland where we will be very disciplined in finding opportunities that we think create incremental shareholder value on a go forward basis. And with our land base that allows us to be very disciplined and very choosy as to what opportunities we look at from a growth perspective. And then finally in terms of capital allocation and you alluded to, it\u2019s we are committed to maintain a strong balance sheet, but our balance sheet is in very good shape currently. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on wood product side, do you still expect to complete the black at the bottom initiative by year-end. And then where do you think wood products CapEx could shake out moving forward, kind of relative to the 300 million you expect this year and do you see opportunities after the work at the New York signal port for CapEx investments in your lumber mills. Doyle Simons : So in terms of the CapEx, Anthony as you know we are about $300 million this year, I would anticipate a similar number next year and then start to trend down probably an ongoing number round numbers would be in the 250 range in terms of in terms of CapEx. In terms of additional opportunities, we will continue to find opportunities to spend capital in our wood product operation primarily to focus on driving - continuing to drive down cost and some of that $250 million will be spent on exactly those type of projects. In terms of black at the bottom and to just remind everybody what that is, when you go back and re-create the situation that occurred back in the last downturn. So we modeled that and we figure out what our cost structure needed to be to, if we have that type of situation again which none of us anticipate or hoped that we do. But if we do go through another recession that level, we wanted to make sure that our wood products operation would be positive cash flow and by the end of 2018, when we accomplish our $40 million to $60 million of OpEx we will be at the level where we would be black at the bottom if we went back into what we refer to as the great recession. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I will turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian McGuire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian McGuire : Hey good morning everyone. Just want to ask on some of the inflationary cost pressures you talked about in like fuel and transportation in general, kind of are he worse one. But you know labor I suppose also probably seems to be tighten. Just wondered if you could comment on what trends at the exit of the quarter head into 3Q and the outlook for the back half of the year you are seeing, are you are expecting some pick up in those inflationary pressures and are there any opportunities to put in for charges or other things to sort of offset it or do you just let the market prices to take care of that? Doyle Simons : So, as you just referenced, we are experiencing cost inflation, its primarily related to fuel and transportation, labor and input costs are also rising but to a much lesser extent. Just to give you a sense, those cost owned from a fuel and transportation were up less than $5 million in the second quarter versus the first quarter. So there are numbers, but we are doing everything we can to manage those and offset those that primarily through our OpEx efforts and things like improving our efficiency, our truck scheduling, capital and non-capital improvements to efficiency, of our materials usage all those type of things are things we are focused on to track to offset the inflationary costs that we are experiencing and probably will continue to experience for the next few quarters. Brian McGuire : Okay, I appreciate that. Obviously in the quarter lumber and OSD prices gone pretty high it\u2019s correct, lately just wondering maybe you can share your thoughts on where you think that the correction needs to eventually re-pace out at and how much of it is just tied to seasonality and how much of it is just tied to the better rail availability and logistics and better supply availability in general? Doyle Simons : Sure and we have spent a lot of time thinking about this and let me kind of give your our perspective on what has happened in the lumber market this year. So if you start back in Q1 we had late inventories, we had continued growth and demand driven by housing that was partially offset by weather, you had supply constraints primarily due to transportation, so you had a positive pricing environment and prices worked nicely in the first quarter as we all know. You then moved into the second quarter, did have lean inventories, had strong demand driven by continued improvement in housing and seasonality, you had continued supply challenges, although the transportation got better late in the second quarter, but in the second quarter you had a very positive pricing environment and prices were up sharply. As we moved into the third quarter, inventories were still in good shape, but we had slower demand seasonally, we had the transportation challenges abating, resulting in more supply. So, not surprisingly pricing is pulling back which is normal seasonally. Looking forward to your point. While we continue to see some volatility, we anticipate the remainder of 2018 and 2019 that lumber prices will continue to be at favorable levels supported by lean inventories, strong U.S. housing demand and a lagging industry supply response. And in connection with what's happening right now as Russell said in his comments, prices are solved we anticipate that they will stabilize over the next few weeks and that's what we have built into our third quarter projections. Brian McGuire : So stabilizing around current levels that maybe just modestly lower than moreover today is that about right? Doyle Simons : Correct. That is correct. Brian McGuire : Okay, that makes sense. Just one last one for me, team in housing starts were weak, we don\u2019t want to make too much out of one month, lot of noise in the numbers, but some people were calling out maybe impact of higher lumber prices, maybe given some of the homebuilders pause and caution do you see any signs of that and do you think with this correction back in the lumber prices we might see some pick up back in that starts, actually now. Doyle Simons : We heard some of that. You got to remember that you know only roughly 2% of the cost of a new house is attributable to lumber prices. So while I think it may have some effect on the margin both when it\u2019s up and when its down, I don\u2019t think that\u2019s a big catalyst for what happens on the housing starts our housing sales numbers. Brian McGuire : Okay. Thanks very much. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : Thanks everyone. Good morning, thanks for all the details Doyle and team. Doyle maybe starting out big picture, I had a couple of nuts and bolts to follow. You have been through more than one cycle. What gives you comfort given your many years of experience and a lot of that in wood products, that this isn\u2019t based on what we are seeing the markets concern is in the beginning of a bigger downturn. What gives you comfort based on your experience, putting aside we know what the longer term housing start number should be based on demographics, what base on your experience tells you this is a path that still has a lot of run way. Doyle Simons : Well I think it\u2019s all the things or some of the things that you just referred to. If you are talking specifically about housing George, it just is the demographics, it\u2019s the wages, it\u2019s all the things that ultimately drive demand for housing and all of those continue to be very positive. We spend a lot of time with our home builders, customers and they continue to be positive and are seeing good activity. If you are talking about the lumber OSB, I have learned anything and I think you know nice way is - what you say is the nice way of saying. I have been around a long time and I\u2019m getting old and that\u2019s correct. [Technical Difficulty]. The one thing I have learned George and I think you learned as well, the supply and demand ultimately is what matters and if you just look at, let\u2019s just take lumber for example while there is additional supply coming on the south. The additional supply that is coming overall from a lumber overall prospective is less than its going to be needed to meet the demand if housing continues to grow with the rates we think is going to and supply and demand ultimately matters and that\u2019s why we made the comments, I made it little bit earlier that we feel optimistic about lumber prices being generally favorable for the foreseeable future. George Staphos : Alright. Thanks for that Doyle, I guess maybe to the point you are mentioning on supply and demand is one of the question I have is good segway. Can you comment on what you are operating rates look like over the back portion of the year again within the key wood products businesses and whether there has been a significant change in your outlook or the rates were running at in the first half of the year, just as for seasonality if you could. And then two quick and I will turn it over. One how do you define modestly down comes your pricing sensitivity would that be like within 5% from current level and then there is capacity going in panels, but it\u2019s obviously not in OSB, it\u2019s in MDF and other products that don\u2019t really compete against yours and Grayling as well. But does that create any kind of labor competitive issues for you as you are operating there and bringing that new press on. Thank you guys, good luck in the quarter. Doyle Simons : Thank you, George, what I would tell you on operating rate is for the first half of the year lumbers run in the mid 90s pretty much flat, OSBs running in the mid 90 and ELP lowing running in the high 80s low 90s. And I would anticipate continued strong markets as we talked about and those type of rates going forward, excluding our scheduled maintenance, of course including scheduled maintenance of our Grayling mill being down the entire third quarter as we had previously announced. In terms of your last question regarding additional capacity coming online and what the impact that has on labor. Labor is a constant struggle, it\u2019s something we spend a lot of time on, we feel like we have done a pretty good job on finding that labor that we need, but as additional capacity comes online that will continue to be a challenge going forward. I think to your other question George referenced what we think is going to happen with lumber and OSB prices and what we deem, but moderately I guess I would say as I think as we said earlier, we do think and had built into our third quarter numbers that prices will stabilize over the next few weeks. So that\u2019s kind of what we have built in. I think it\u2019s also important to realize, we are talking about averages-to-averages. So if you look at it right now our third quarter to-date averages, lumber and OSB are basically in line with the second quarter. Now clearly spot prices are down as we have talked about, but if you look at quarter-to-quarter I think it's important that you realize that there is some averaging that happens there in terms of what we built into those numbers. George Staphos : Thank you very much Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Gail Glazerman with Roe Equity Research. Please go ahead. Gail Glazerman : Hey good morning. Maybe just sticking on pricing for a second, you are looking for pretty near term stabilization and I\u2019m just wondering given that the recent - spend actually if anything in correlation of the decline. Are you seeing that I mean are you seeing those signs emerge or is that still somewhat hopeful that over the next few weeks incremental supply trend in Western Canada or whatever will work its way out? Doyle Simons : Yes. Gail as you said, at least in the last week the decline has accelerated. So we are not yet seeing signs of that, but as we step back and look at supply and demand fundamentals we are and who knows right, but we are hopeful and we do anticipate that prices will stabilize. If they don't then we will need to adjust the numbers for that. Based on everything we know today prices ran up more than I think anybody anticipated in the second quarter, they are now recalibrating, we will see where that is, but fundamental supply and demand balance has not changed other than the timing issues. Gail Glazerman : Alright. Then maybe shifting to southern. I guess with log and lumber market, last quarter you talked about seeing some pocket of tension perhaps starting to build on some of your log market and taking a step back, lumber production, the data is pretty lagged, but it\u2019s only up for the 2% in the south through April, but it was up 10% in the west. I\u2019m just wondering does that surprise you and are you seeing southern outputs starting to respond or do you think that\u2019s really just capacity constraint, it doesn\u2019t seem consistent with the operating rates being reported on industry level? Doyle Simons : I think in the south Gail, our sense of what is happening there, there is a lot of additional capacity that you know that\u2019s been announced, but it's taking a while to get that built and get that fully up and running. So I think that number will continue to grow as we move forward, but it\u2019s just going to take a little time to get there. Gail Glazerman : And on the log side are you still seeing some pockets of retention around where there has been announcements. Doyle Simons : Yes. You know we are, we are encouraged about what we have seen, some of the pockets where new mills has started up and there is a mill and Weyerhaeuser, Mississippi where it started up and we have seen some tension in there and then in Georgia there's a couple mills that have been specifically announced not yet started, but we have seen some tensioning in that wood basket. So we are starting to see pocket tensioning and with that gets where additional capacity is either come online or been announced. Gail Glazerman : Alright and just on last quick one. There has been a lot of headlines lately on labor negotiations at West, I\u2019m just wondering if you can get some insight into where that\u2019s stands. Doyle Simons : Yes. So there had been some headlines regarding labor relations, we are negotiating with our labor union housing in the West, we are continuing to work with union leaders and we look forward to reaching an agreement on that front. Gail Glazerman : Okay. Thank you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Thanks. Good morning all. Doyle Simons : Good morning Collin. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Collin Mings : Going back to Anthony\u2019s question just on capital allocation front. Just as you think about the affirmation strength in wood products the balance sheet and the progress toward the black of the bottom initiative has the thinking regarding tying a more sizable dividend bump to southern log prices evolved at all. Doyle Simons : You know Collin as we said, we are generating a lot of cash in the Company. Right now we are spending a lot of time with our Board regarding how to best deploy that cash, as Russell talked about we have bought $75 million of shares back and will continue to work with our Board regarding the proper level of a dividend going forward. Southern Saw Log will be a factor, clearly that is considered an important factor, but it\u2019s just one of many factors that we and the Board think about regarding the appropriate dividend level going forward. Collin Mings : Okay. Switching over to wood products, recognizing there is some seasonality, but on EDP just how you think about the sustainability of kind of recent EBITDA generation from that segment in particular, because again it\u2019s a very strong results during the quarter and kind of some - strength there. Doyle Simons : Yes, we are encouraged by what we see in EWP, as you know Collin we had a price increase announced in early 2018, we have captured about half of that, we anticipate capturing the other half through the fourth quarter. Demand continues to be good for that for that product, our teams have done a really nice job of figuring out ways to lower cost and run more efficiently and more effectively in our EWP operations that were encouraged by what we have accomplished, but we think we still have some runway ahead of us. Collin Mings : Okay and than just one last one for me, I will turn it over. Just can you expand on prepared remarks on Japan, it appears wooden construction starts there have been trending down year-over-year for several months. Just what are you doing from your customers in our market, how they responded is really the shrink in log prices in the specific North West over the last several months. Just if you could put a little bit more color on the Japan business just given how format is your export platform. Doyle Simons : Sure and I will try to do that, it is important. What I would tell you is Japanese demand remains steady, log inventories are moderate, post in being - while general housing starts are down I think 4% year-to-date post in being which is our market is relatively stable, I think down 1%, 1.5% so far this year. Our outlook for third quarter is for stable volumes and slightly lower pricing and the other thing you should probably start to think about is there is another consumption tax increase scheduled for the fall of 2019 and we do typically see some demand pull forward and advance of such increases, assuming that actually plays out. So that\u2019s kind of how we think about Japan. Collin Mings : That\u2019s helpful color. Thanks Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Mark Wilde : Good morning Doyle. Good morning Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning Mark. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Mark Wilde : Doyle just to kind of start out here, I wonder can you give us an update on your first half Southern log exports. I mean you have had some pretty aggressive targets for this year in terms of kind of year-over-year improvement in Southern log exports? Doyle Simons : Yes, we are encouraged by what is happening in the Southern exports markets. We are continuing to grow our export business out of the south. as you know, we have been exporting Southern yellow pine from the Atlantic coast, that\u2019s the India and China and then early this month in July we expanded our operations by starting up another program out of the Gulf South and fiscally New Orleans, where we are shipping to China from New Orleans. As we had originally said, we expect to triple the size of our export program in 2018 versus 2017 and we are on track to do that and as you look further out we think there's potential for significant additional upside as we move into 2019 and beyond. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then switching over to distribution, do you have any kind of read from your distribution business and what you kind of hear from others, just in terms of how full that distribution channel is right now. I know we have been lean in recent years, but I have been hearing when supply was tight in the first and second quarters maybe some distributors were placing multiple orders and now that product is starting to flow. The system is a little fuller? Doyle Simons : Yes. I would say from inventory levels it\u2019s kind of lean to normal, in that range is how I would characterize from a distribution perspective. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then if we look at not only your kind of I-joist and LVL volumes, but the industry numbers, not the APA, they are kind of flattish for the first half of this year, which is a little bit hard to reconcile with that housing start data that is out there. Have you got any thoughts on that? Doyle Simons : You know what I would say is I think from a weather perspective and some other things that there has been challenges in your part of the world and the East if break it down between the East and West as we do, the West has been strong, the East has been a little weak. I think overtime that will rectify itself Mark, but you're right the numbers look a little out of sync, but I think is more of a timing and weather related issues than anything fundamental. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then the last one from me, there is a timber MLP at around Puget Sound that it\u2019s got a large shareholder that's agitating for a sale. I\u2019m just curious, are there any kind of practical or regulatory issues, with you expanding your land position around Puget Sound? Russell Hagen : Mark this is Russell. There is no constraints as far as us being able to expand our ownership in the West. Mark Wilde : And just any thoughts on the attractiveness of kind of the Northwest versus other parts of the U.S. like the South? Russell Hagen : Well I mean the West is very attractive given where current log prices are at and where timber values are, but the South is also very attractive from the long-term investment perspective. So we look at both of those areas very closely. As Doyle mentioned we are in really every wood basket in the United States and we are very familiar with all the transactions that are out there and we look at everything if it makes sense and add shareholder value we will pursue them. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fair enough. Good luck in the second half. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Doyle just one question. How do you think about the cyclicality of the real estate business these days and how these obviously strong, but I\u2019m trying to get a handle on how much of a secular tailwind, do you think you have in that business. Given the reemphasizing you've done over the last couple of years. Russell Hagen : So this is Russell. As far as our real estate business. We do have some tie-in but it\u2019s just a cyclical nature of the housing market as we see some of our properties go into more - sold to developers, but a lot of our real estate activity is driven by higher and better uses of recreational uses, conservation uses, alternatives to commercial type timber operations. So while we do see a little bit of that. I think the overall trend really sits with the availability of discretionary spending from the buy side, we are seeing strong markets in the South and in the West for the for our real estate program. Mark Connelly : So Russell do you think that\u2019s going to be a continue source of growth or sort of steady performance. Russell Hagen : You know our target is for $250 million of EBITDA from the real estate, energy and natural resources business and we have really positioned this business to run it for the long term. And so as we mentioned, we have gone through our ABO process, which is really our methodology of identifying that subset of bakers that have a higher value than commercial Timberland operations, and we position our portfolio really to sell through over the next 10 to 15 years. So Mark I think that's going to be a steady-state business with some upside as we see continued pricing appreciation. Mark Connelly : Sure. Superb. Thank you. Operator : Your next question from the line Mark Weintraub with Buckingham Research. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Wanted just to focus a little bit, you have kind be grouping with lumber together and some of the comments in terms of expecting stabilization, et cetera. But I see that maybe there are some different dynamics in the markets as well and wanted to get your feel on it. In particular there has been a lot of that peak capacity that has started up in the first part of the year. And curious as to whether or not you think that production is now being felt in the market and whether or not the likelihood of their being potentially divergent behavior between OSB and lumbar at least over the short to medium-term given me maybe some different dynamic on the capacity side, even if the demand drivers tend to be the same. Doyle Simons : Mark good question and I think short-term, not medium-term or long-term, but short-term, there is a possibility for divergence for the reasons you outlined, there has been additional capacity that\u2019s come online, it\u2019s been slower to come online than anybody expect it, but it seems to now be happening. So I think in the in the very short term, you could see as we have said all along when it comes on it tends to be lumpy and you could see one of those lumps happening in the short-term. But if you look at it longer term essentially demand is growing at about a billion board feet a year, the plant is ramping up at roughly the same rate. Yes you are going to have these times where it gets chunky and you have a big chunk coming on at the same time, but if you just sit back again like I said in lumber and look at the supply and demand equation and the amount of growth and the amount of supply that\u2019s coming online operating rates very high. It feels like we should experience favorable pricing for OSB going forward. Mark Weintraub : Okay thank you. And then obviously lots of talk on trade war in China in particular as you think about potential implications for warehouse or what would you highlight? Doyle Simons : Mark there is a lot of uncertainty as you very well know regarding trade policy and China tariffs. What I would tell you this point is the proposed tariffs on use case do not affect our export logs, thus far we have not seen any impacts to our business. If something does change we will figure out a way to manage through it, the bottom line is China does need to source some percentage of their logs from the United States on go forward basis? Mark Weintraub : Okay that\u2019s helpful. And just lastly, so I know the tax rate seems to be, if I\u2019m doing my math right, it was a fair bit higher in the second quarter and that just caused you more money in the wood product business then you were expecting and then it comes back down in the second half of the year and looks like there is a $0.02 or $0.03 from a higher tax rate in the second quarter than what I would have expected? Russell Hagen : Mark this is Russell. Yes that\u2019s correct. We just generate more income in our taxable REIT subsidiary basically the wood products business, but the full year guidance is still 11% to 13%. Mark Weintraub : Superb. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Hi yes, good morning Doyle, good morning Russell. Doyle Simons : Good morning. Chip Dillon : First question has to do with the strong cash generation in the quarter. I think you mentioned that the second quarter if I heard you right was technically not one of the stronger cash generation, I guess working capital builds up and taking your leverage down to 2.2 times and I guess the question is do you see more of that kind of cash generation in the second half, and secondly, as you think about the buyback situation versus acquisition, are we to kind of read into the 75 million and the fact that you're looking to do more on the buyback front, pretty much saying that it's more attractive to buy timber by buying your stock at current levels versus going out and buying land? Russell Hagen : So this is Russell. Cash generation. We did have a strong quarter and it is our strongest quarter. I would say it's pretty consistent with our prior year trends as far as how that cash flow generation will look going forward; as far as the share repurchase you know as Doyle said, we are committed to the return on the cash flow there, and we will do this either through dividends and share repurchases. So we have an opportunity in July to get into the market and by 75 million worth of shares and this is part of overall capital allocation strategy. So whether it would be dividends or share repurchase or investing in a business they are all tied together. Doyle Simons : And Chip we are confident of weighing the benefit of share repurchase versus potential acquisitions as a constant analysis that we do and we will continue to do because just as Russell said it\u2019s all tied together and we are trying to figure out how to allocate capital to create the most value for shareholders going forward. Chip Dillon : Okay. And then second quick question is I think Russell mentioned in his comments that EBITDA and OSB would be down I think 10% sequentially due to the downtime tied to the press replacement. Did I hear that correctly, was that a way of saying that it would have been 10% lower in this past quarter or you are kind guiding us to $110 million number and if that's the case, how confident are you given the volatility that we typically see in OSB prices. Russell Hagen : So to be very clear on this, what we said was that the impact from the grayling being down for the entire quarter on EBITDA would be $25 million. We also said that volume out of OSB would be 10% less than it was a year ago, based on grayling being down for the quarter. Chip Dillon : Okay. That\u2019s very clear. Thanks for that clarification. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steven Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Chercover : Thanks good morning. I have got couple of questions and I guess the answer is number two was contingent on number one. So first of all, get ready. High level of earnings generated by wood products and maybe real estate too, is it jeopardizing the weak status. I mean, as I recall there used to be some threshold that the TRS could exceed I think it was 15%. Russell Hagen : So Steve this is Russell. So we have plenty of room in our REIT overall retail some income and assets has even with the elevated income generation in the taxable subsidiary, so that's not a concern of ours. Steven Chercover : Okay terrific and even if we would have keep going its kind current levels that would remain the case. Russell Hagen : We really don\u2019t have a concern with that. Steven Chercover : Okay which means let me get to number two. Have you looked into any expanding your Wood Products beyond EWP and perhaps into cross laminated timber or some of the panelized construction that I think WRECO used to actually do? Russell Hagen : Yes this is Russell. As far as the wood products portfolio, we are very happy with the way its configured and set that it has with Timberland. As far as expanding even further downstream onto CLT or some of these other emerging wood products businesses, again we were very focused on what we do well, in each one of our wood products businesses were performing very well. We definitely welcome the emergence of those new products in the industry is CLT will pull on lumber demand, which also improves overall log demand. But it's not an area that we would expand into readily. Steven Chercover : Great. Thanks Russell. Operator : Your next question from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC. Paul Quinn : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning guys. Russell Hagen : Good morning Paul. Paul Quinn : Hey, I just had one question, I just wanted to dive in a little bit on the supply demand on lumber side. Lots of announcements have been made on capacity additions to the market and just what you're feeling is on whether they will all come up and your sense from the equipment side, you know, when you deal with that equipment vendors what their orders files are like and how easy it is to bring on capacity. Doyle Simons : Yes. So Paul, I think they will, all of them are strong work, but I think nearly all of them and I think we probably will see additional announcement as we move forward just because we as an industry are going to need the additional supply to meet the demand. So pretty encouraged by what we see there. And like I said I think nearly all of the ones that have been announced will in fact happen, and we could even have additional announcements as we move forward. With that said, I think to your second point and it\u2019s going to take longer than most people factored in to get those up and fully running. Fortunately our two big projects Dierks and Millport were kind of ahead of the curve. So were able to secure the contractors and as you know we will be starting both of those up fairly shortly and in good shape. But I can tell you, in talking to contractors and just getting filled for order files. They are full, they are very full. So as a result, I think some of our competitors who have announced these mills it\u2019s potentially going to take longer and maybe cost a little more than they originally anticipated. Paul Quinn : Great. Thanks for that. Best of luck. Doyle Simons : Alright, thank you. Doyle Simons : If I understand it that is our last question. I want to thank everybody for joining us on the call and for your interest in Weyerhaeuser and hope everybody has a good day and good weekend. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Weyerhaeuser second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker\u2019s remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s third quarter 2018 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com, Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Doyle Simons, Chief Executive Officer; Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer and Devin Stockfish, Senior Vice President of Timberlands. I will now turn the call over to Doyle Simons. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Beth and welcome everyone. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $255 million or $0.34 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion. Third quarter results include a $41 million tax benefit related to our previously announced U.S. pension plan contribution. Excluding this special item, we earned $214 million or $0.28 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA for the company totaled $505 million. Our third quarter results reflect solid operating performance in the face of challenging headwinds, including severe weather and certain Chinese trade policy and unusually volatile markets for lumber and oriented strand board. Our business is adapting changing conditions throughout the quarter and we remain relentlessly focused on the things we can control, improving our relative performance versus the competition and delivering on our commitment to disciplined capital allocation. During the quarter, we demonstrated our discipline commitment to capital allocation, by increasing our quarterly dividend by 6.3% to $0.34 per share, repurchasing $290 million of common shares and announcing a series of actions to substantially reduce our pension liabilities. In August, we also announced that I have elected to retire in early 2019 and that Devin Stockfish, currently Senior Vice President of Timberlands has been appointed President and Chief Executive Officer, effective January 01. Adrian Blocker, who leads our Wood Products business will succeed Devin as Senior Vice President of Timberland and Keith O'Rear, who leads our Wood Products sales and marketing organization will become Senior Vice President of Wood Products. As Beth mentioned, Devin is here in the room with us this morning. He will be participating in the Q&A and will make some remarks afterwards to close the call. Right now, let me give some more detail on our business results. I'll start with a few comments regarding the housing market. Significant discussion is occurring regarding the trajectory of the U.S. housing market. The market continues to grow. Total start increased nearly 4% year-over-year in September, despite disruption from Hurricane Florence. On a year-to-date basis, single-family and total starts have risen 6%. Repair and remodeling activity, which drives about 40% of lumber demand, is up 7.5% compared with the year ago. However, recently monthly housing statistics have been volatile and in some cases softer than expected. We see no evidence of a change in underlying demand for housing. Employment and wages continues to rise -- employment and wages continue to rise with unemployment at the lowest level since 1969. Consumer confidence began 2018 about previous session highs and has increased sharply as the year has progressed. Builders reports strong demand at entry-level price points and indexes of builder sentiment remained very positive. However, the rate of housing market growth appears to have moderated slightly, indicating a potential mismatch between demand and available supply. However, mortgage rates remain relatively low on a historical basis, continued increases in home prices and interest rates may be causing buyers at higher price points to recalibrate their expectations if they take affordability into account. We expect will resolve as buyers and builders adjust product in response to the changing market backdrop. For 2018, we anticipate total housing starts will be slightly less than 1.3 million and we expect continued market growth in 2019. Let me now turn to our business segments. I will begin the discussion with Timberlands charts four to six. Timberlands contributed a $126 million to third quarter earnings and $206 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberland delivered $121 million of third quarter EBITDA, $31 million lower than the second quarter. Average log sales realizations declined, fee harvest volume decreased 2% and row costs were seasonally higher. Unit logging and hauling cost also increased as we do more high elevation harvesting during the summer months. Compared with a year ago quarter however, Western EBITDA increased $10 million due to higher domestic and export log price realizations. Western domestic log markets were highly tensioned throughout the first half of 2018. As we enter the third quarter, strong lumber pricing and fear of another challenging fire season drove many Western mills to build larger than normal log decks to avoid the risk of downtime. Although the Pacific Northwest fire season arrived early, it was not severe and logging conditions remained very favorable throughout the third quarter. By early August, momentum in the domestic log market had reversed. Strong log supply, declining lumber prices and a pause in Chinese log demand due to the trade dispute put downward pressure on prices and domestic log realizations declined through the remainder of the third quarter. Turning to our export markets, Chinese construction activity remained solid during the third quarter. Log inventories at Chinese ports continued to decline, ending the quarter at approximately 3.7 million cubic meters, 12% below second quarter levels. In early August, the Chinese government announced its intent to impose a tariff on Western logs. Our China export log volumes declined in response to the uncertainty regarding implementation. The tariffs were implemented on September 24 and our Hemlock and Douglas fir log exports to China are assessed at a 5% rate. Average realizations for the third quarter were off slightly compared with the second quarter as we adjusted pricing in response to the tariff. Compared with a year ago China log sales volumes were lower due to the trade dispute, but average realizations were slightly higher. In Japan, demand for our logs remained solid but log sales volumes decline modestly due to timing as typhoon activity delayed ships during the month of September. Average log sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Compared with a year ago quarter, sales volumes to Japan were modestly lower and realizations improved substantially. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands contributed $80 million to third quarter EBITDA, $4 million less than the second quarter. Average realizations southern saw logs increased slightly compared with the second quarter and average pulpwood realizations were flat. Sales volumes declined compared with the second quarter as hurricane Florence felt weather-related downtime for third-party customers as well as our own mills. Our operations along the Atlantic Coast curtailed harvesting for up to a week to ensure employing contractor safety during the slow-moving storm and fee harvest declined 2% compared with the second quarter. Per unit harvest and hauling cost increased as we harvested a greater mix of things in the quarter and also incurred longer hauling distances as we flexed harvest operations to available wet weather ground. Southern log export volumes increased compared with the second quarter, although demand eroded following Chinese implementation of a 25% tariff on Southern panel logs on August 23. Average realizations for southern export logs declined as we adjusted pricing to offset a portion of the tariff. Export logs represent less than 2% of our southern fee harvest volume. Compared with the year ago quarter, Southern Timberland's EBITDA declined due to lower harvest volumes associated with hurricanes and higher fuel cost. Northern Timberlands contributed $4 million to EBITDA a $1 million more than the second quarter and comparable to a year ago. Fee harvest volumes improved seasonally in most areas and average realizations increased modestly due to mix. The Timberlands business continues to make good progress against its 2018 operational excellence initiatives and is on track to achieve its $40 million to $50 million OpEx target for the year. Key focus areas include improving the productivity of harvesting and hauling operations, reducing road cost, optimizing forestry spending and maximizing the revenue from every log we harvest. Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 7 and 8; Real Estate & ENR contributed $36 million to third quarter earnings and $86 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased by $39 million compared with the second quarter and [technical difficulty] compared with a year ago. Real estate sales increased significantly due to typical seasonality. Third quarter also included a large acreage transaction in Montana, which accounted for approximately half of the acres sold in the third quarter. Average price per acre declined due to mix as Timberland prices in Montana are regionally lower. Average land basis on property sold was modestly higher than second quarter and significantly higher than third quarter 2017 due to the greater mix of Montana acres. As a result, the segment's third quarter contribution to earnings increased $14 million compared with the second quarter, but it was $11 million lower than a year ago. The real estate business is solidly on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value for 2018.  Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10; Wood Products contributed $213 million to third quarter earnings compared with $329 million in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $250 million. EBITDA for lumber totaled $118 million, $77 million lower than the second quarter and comparable to a year ago. Lumber prices have experienced record volatility in 2018. The framing lumber composite hit record highs in the first week of June, peaking at $582 before decreasing due to improving logistics and seasonally slower lumber usage. Pricing continue to fall through the third quarter as hurricanes and general market volatility, further dampened demand. From July through September, the composite lumber price drop approximately $140 or 25%, the steepest quarterly decline own record. Our third quarter average sales realizations decreased 9% compared with the second quarter, while the framing lumber composite declined 13% compared with the second quarter average. Lumber sales volumes declined 6% and manufacturing cost increased primarily due to lower operating rates. Although our lumber mills sustained no damage from hurricane Florence, our North Carolina mills lost several dozen ships as we took downtime to ensure the safety of our employees and equipment and regional flooding limited access and operations at some locations. Canadian log costs were higher, especially in Alberta, where an unusually wet weather has increased hauling cost and limited log availability. Third quarter EBITDA includes $6 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber, comparable to the second quarter. Comparing our third quarter results with the year-ago quarter, higher average sales realizations for lumber were largely offset by higher log cost. Manufacturing costs were flat as we offset cost inflation, with operational excellence improvement. OSB contributed $77 million to EBITDA, $52 million less than the second quarter and $25 million less than a year ago. OSB prices began to fall at the beginning of the third quarter and benchmark north-central pricing decreased $110 or 25% from July through the end of September. Compared with the second quarter, our average sales realizations decreased 13%. Sales volumes decreased 11% due to an extended scheduled outage to replace the press [ph] at our Grayling Michigan mill. Including log sales volumes and other project expenses, the outage reduced EBITDA by approximately $25 million. Compared with the second quarter, fiber costs also increased. Comparing our results to the year-ago quarter, average sales realizations for OSB decreased 2% and sales volumes decreased 10% due to the Grayling outage. Excluding the $25 million outage cost, OSB EBITDA would've been comparable to the prior year as OpEx initiatives offset cost inflation. Engineered Wood Products contributed $48 million to EBITDA, $10 million less than the second quarter and comparable to a year ago. Average sales realizations improved approximately 2% compared with the second quarter and 89% compared with one year ago, as we continue to capture the benefit of our early 2018 price increase. Sales volumes decreased as hurricane activity and heavy rains in Texas slowed demand and what are usually strong growth markets. Distribution contributed $3 million to third quarter EBITDA, $9 million lower than the second quarter and $9 million lower than a year ago. Declining commodity pricing throughout the third quarter compressed margins and our Southeast distribution centers, lost multiple shipping days due to hurricane activity. The business also incurred $4 million of expense from wildfire damage at its Redding California facility. Through its continued focus on OpEx, our distribution business made money in the quarter, despite one largest quarterly commodity price declines ever recorded. The business remained highly focused on managing cost and product margins. The wood products business has made good OpEx progress on its 2018 initiatives to improve fiber cost and recovery, reduce certain controllable cost and capture the benefit of focused capital investment. However, efforts to improve mill reliability, which is our largest opportunity area have been hampered by weather as facilities have coped with unusual winter weather, flooding and hurricane this year. Our teams remain highly focused on reducing controllable costs, increasing fiber recovery, improving mill reliability, enhancing product margins and maximizing the benefit of our capital investment. However, there is still significant work to do to achieve the segment's full-year target of $40 million to $60 million. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thank you, Doyle and good morning. The outlook for the fourth quarter is presented in Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberland's business, we expect our fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $15 million to $20 million lower than the third quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we expect fourth quarter average sales realizations for domestic and export logs, to be lower than the third quarter average, while log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher. Larger than normal domestic log decks built in anticipation of a challenging fire season, which did not materialize are expected to come down. We also typically see a seasonal reduction in the supply from nonindustrial landowners in the fourth quarter, due to less favorable weather. We anticipate that overall domestic supply in the West will come back into balance with demand by year-end. Japanese export log sales volumes are expected to be moderately higher in the fourth quarter, for some shipments scheduled for the third quarter were delayed due to typhoon activity. Fourth quarter average sales realizations will be lower. Chinese export volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter, while average sales realizations will be lower. We remain optimistic on Chinese demand for Western logs despite near-term volatility caused by uncertainty with tariffs and trade policy. We expect slightly higher unit logging costs in the West, while road and forestry spend will decline modestly. In the South, we anticipate fourth quarter average sales realizations will be comparable to the third quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher as we return to normal production after third quarter hurricane activity. We own very little timberland in the areas of Florida affected by hurricane Michael and experienced minimal infrastructure and resource damage due to that storm. Civil culture and forestry spending in the South is expected to increase slightly as we deferred activities from the third quarter into the fourth quarter, due to severe weather. In the North, we anticipate higher fourth quarter harvest volumes and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Real estate and energy and natural resources, earnings and adjusted EBITDA for the fourth quarter are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. Markets remain active across our ownership and we continue to see strong interest in higher and better used properties. We now expect EBITDA for our real estate and energy and natural resources segment will be approximately $260 million for the full year 2018. In the third quarter, land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was higher than our full year guidance of 40% to 50% due to the mix of acres sold. We now anticipate that land basis will be approximately 55% for the full year 2018. Wood products market prices for lumber and oriented strand board have continued to decline in the fourth quarter. Logistical challenges improved over the summer, allowing supply to reach the market as seasonal demand moderated. In addition, hurricanes and general market volatility have continued to dampen demand. We expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the third quarter. For fourth quarter to date, our lumber realizations are $80 lower than the third quarter average and current realizations are approximately $100 lower. For oriented strand board our quarter-to-date realizations are $35 lower than the third quarter average and current realizations are approximately $50 lower. As a reminder, every $10 change in lumber realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Every $10 change in oriented strand board realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Western and Canadian log costs are expected to be lower in the third quarter and we anticipate improved unit manufacturing costs for lumber due to less weather-related downtime. Our Dierks sawmill was commissioned in mid-October and will begin ramping up to full capacity throughout 2019. We restarted our Grayling, Michigan-oriented strand board mill on October 21, following the completion of the scheduled press replacement. We will be ramping up to existing capacity through the end of the year. We anticipate higher operating rates and increased sales volume through oriented strand board in the fourth quarter. Sales volumes for engineered wood products are expected to decline seasonally, compared with the third quarter. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Contribution to earnings decreased $4 million in the third quarter, primarily due to an expected increase in our unallocated pension and postretirement benefit cost. The second quarter included a favorable true up to finalize prior yearend estimates for pension plan assets and liabilities. We expect non-operating pension and postretirement expense of $17 million for the fourth quarter. Now I'd like to turn to an update on our key financial items, which are summarized on Chart 12. Capital expenditures total $105 million from the third quarter. We continue to expect total CapEx for the full year 2018 will be approximately $420 million, $300 million wood products and $120 million for Timberlands. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending. Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with approximately $5.9 billion of debt outstanding. We have no remaining maturities in 2018 and we expect fourth quarter interest expense to be comparable to the third quarter. For taxes, we continue to expect our 2018 effective tax rate to be between 11% and 13% based on the forecasted mix of earnings, excluding third quarter special tax benefit. In August, we announced a series of actions intended to reduce the liabilities of our US qualified pension plan, while maintaining its current funded status.  As previously disclosed, we made a $300 million cash contribution to the plan in the third quarter. We also offered certain planned participants the opportunity to elect an immediate lump-sum distribution of their pension benefits. Upon completion of this lump-sum offer in the fourth quarter, we expect to record a one-time non-cash settlement charge. We currently estimate this non-cash charge will be approximately $200 million pretax based on current actuarial assumptions. Cash from operations during the third quarter was $87 million. Excluding the $300 million pension contribution, cash flow from operations would be $387 million. During the quarter, we repurchased approximately 8.6 million shares of common stock for $290 million. We ended the quarter with a cash balance of $348 million. As of the end of the third quarter, we had $210 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Now I'll turn the call back to Doyle and look forward to your question. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Russell. After the Q&A, we'll make a few comments on owned succession to close the call, but at this time, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning and congratulations Doyle and Devin. Congratulations to you and Devin on the transition. I am wondering if you could talk more about the cost inflation that you're seeing in Timberlands. I think your outlook indicates Western log prices will fall sequentially in 4Q, but even with that, it seems like Western prices are still going to be significantly above where they were say at the end of '16, but I think the segment EBITDA guidance is expected to be down maybe 10%, 15% versus where you were at the end of '16. I guess this is cost-driven. So is there a lag in terms of passing through these costs? Is there a reason to think that maybe some of them will roll off in next year? Just kind of any color you could give on cost in Timberland would be helpful? Devin Stockfish : Yes sure and so I guess just at a high level, certainly we are seeing some inflationary headwinds in the Western business. I would say on a year-over-year basis, if you think about the logging side as probably around 3%ish cost inflation year-over-year. On the trucking side and this is more across the business as a whole, it's closer to 7% or 8% and that's largely driven just by contractor and trucking availability and some fuel price inflation as well and I would say, we're doing everything we can to do battle that inflationary headwind with our OpEx and certainly that's a big part of how we are operating really business wide, not just in the West. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. And in terms of a timeline for recovering those costs, would that be first half of next year or any sort of -- any kind of thoughts you can give on the timing? Devin Stockfish : So if you think about passing those through really it ties back to what we're seeing on log prices and generally it's less specific to cost inflation and really just market dynamics with log prices and certainly as Doyle and Russell mentioned, I do think some of the supply-demand dynamics that we've seen in the Western market is going to be coming back into balance as we get into Q4 and I would expect to get back up to more normalized pricing in the West as we get into the back half of Q4 and into 2019. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful and then just kind of a question on whether I think you identified that as an impact in the South for both the Timberlands business and the wood product business. Is it possible to quantify for the two segments how much of a hit weather was in the quarter? Doyle Simons : Sure. And we think weather total impact on the quarter Anthony was approximately $15 million and that includes from the hurricane, the Japan typhoon, the Redding fire at our distribution facility and higher Canadian log costs because of very wet weather. If you take that $15 million and you break it down, about $5 million of it was in Timberlands, half of that from hurricane, half of it from the typhoon and approximately $10 million of it was in wood products. So that's how we would break that down. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thanks everyone. Good morning. Thanks for the details and Doyle, congratulations to you and Devon and Adrian and Keith on the transition and the best of luck to everyone.  I guess my first question on wood products, can you comment at all in terms of how production might run relative to shipments in the fourth quarter? Do you anticipate maybe having to take inventory down a bit further and that being something we need to consider in terms of our models beyond pricing and shipments and broadly where to say inventories are right now within wood products? Doyle Simons : I think generally in wood products across the system, I would say inventories are normal to slightly elevated, but headed in the right direction. What I would tell you George, in the fourth quarter versus the third, I would actually anticipate our volumes would improve. In lumber for example, our operating rates in the third quarter were in the high 80s versus where they were in the second quarter, which was the mid-90s that was a result of all the disruptions we saw from weather and primarily in the South in the third quarter. So as we move into the fourth quarter George, we would anticipate operating rates returning to more normalized levels. So that's how we're currently thinking about it. George Staphos : Okay. So ultimately, doesn\u2019t sound like you have to take any production down time to get the inventories balance, you just think demand will more or less take care of it from what we could see? Doyle Simons : That is correct. We have no current plan for downtime and part of our overall velocities George has been to focus on cost and our current cost position allows us to continue to run our mills when it may not make sense for some others to do so. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it at this point in time. George Staphos : Okay. Thanks for that Doyle. I appreciate the comments on the West in terms of Timberland. Those are very helpful. If it's possible, could you give us a bit more granularity on how Chinese log realizations trended in the quarter versus your expectations? I know you said they are up year-on-year. You said they were down in this quarter. Where do they wind up maybe in absolute levels and where do they wind up relative to your expectations and I had one more question to follow up after that? Doyle Simons : Yes, so just a little bit of context around China. So when you think about the Chinese export program off of the West, really as Doyle mentioned, when the trade dispute really started picking up steam mid to late summer timeframe, what that really did was it put a little bit of a pause into that market, just as people were trying to react and figure out how that was going to be implemented. And so you saw a little bit of slow down into the China market. I would say that, that is beginning to normalize. At this point, if you think about a 5% tariff, that's really not enough to meaningfully impact the volume that we're going to flow into China kind of in the short to mid-term. One thing to remember about China pricing however, is that there is a strong correlation to domestic markets in terms of how we price the China wood and that can really swing one direction or the other depending on what's going on in the domestic market and the Chinese demand. I will say just on the demand side, we're still seeing strong activity in China, the inventory levels at the port are coming down. According to our folks in China, there are still good take away from the ports and so we would certainly expect as we get to the back half of the quarter that we're going to continue to see good demand out of China. George Staphos : So Devin, it would be fair to say that the trend in the quarter was really driven more by domestic market and less in terms of export trends and trade issues, would that be fair for Timberlands? Doyle Simons : It's a little bit of both really. If you think about what happened in the West in the quarter, it was really, it was a perfect storm of events. You think about the fire season that the mills across the West were expecting and really they were putting that in the context of 2017 when we had a really severe fire season in the west and so across Washington and Oregon, everybody was planning for that in 2018, never materialized. Then you saw a lot of volume being built up at the mills and so very heavy large log decks. Additionally, with the high pricing that you saw in the West for the first half of the year that brought a lot of the marginal players bringing wood to the market, so that increased supply and then you overlay that with the trade disputes as some of the logs at least during a portion of the quarter that would have otherwise gone to China stayed into the domestic market. And so really what that did, it caused a little bit of a supply-demand dynamic that, that was a little out of balance and so as all of the things begin to normalize, we head into the winter weather where you're going to see less volume flowing into the market, that will all normalize and I think you get back into balance. George Staphos : Okay. I'll turn it over. Thanks for the time guys and good luck in the quarter. Doyle Simons : Thank you, George. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian McGuire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian McGuire : Hey good morning, everyone and I'll also add my congratulations Doyle on a great run and best of luck to Devin in the new role here. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Brian McGuire : Just following on from George's questions, I think and based on Russell's commentary around the pricing sensitivity, it seems like lumber for you guys will be close to breakeven in 4Q, maybe a little bit positive, but given you guys are one of the lower cost producers at this point, what do you think that kind of signals around current economics for call it marginal producers in the industry, you think more likely to see any capacity curtailments or getting that's just sort of normal fourth quarter seasonality and if we can little bit of rebound in pricing, you would expect nobody to really be thinking about taking an extended downtime? Doyle Simons : I don't want to speculate on what others may do. As you know, as you probably know, there already have been some announcements as to downtime in the quarter. As I said our focus on cost and cost position puts us in a good position to continue to run our mills when maybe it didn\u2019t make sense for some others to. I do think that the pricing scenario we're currently in will correct itself. Our best guess is by the end of the quarter, it will be headed back in the right direction. So we'll have to see how that plays out from a pricing perspective. So that's kind of how we think about it. Brian McGuire : Okay. Just thinking about if prices don't recover, if they actually continue to slide in a worst case scenario, you're just thinking about the cash flow and the CapEx in particular. I know it's been elevated the last couple of years, there just been announcement on some wood products but could you maybe give us a sense of where that CapEx number could go, if we do get into more of an extended downturn here? Doyle Simons : Sure. We have been spending approximately $300 million a year in CapEx in our wood products operation. We would anticipate that type of number in 2019 and then falling off to $250 million or so on a go forward basis. We've always said that maintenance CapEx is probably $150 million to $200 million, not suggesting this at all but you could lower it down to that price or to that level in the event that you made the decision that was the right thing to do. Again I'd go back to I think what we're seeing is a confluence of events that have led to this significant fall in the pricing including as Russell mentioned, a slug of supply coming in from Canada that was built up slower seasonal land hurricanes, a lot of events that we think will level out over time. So we're not predicting a precipitous fall in lumber prices for any extended basis, but in response to your question, we could lower CapEx significantly if we made a determination that we needed to do that. Brian McGuire : Okay. Just trying to stress the model. I know you guys have set the dividend at a level where you think it's supported regardless of environment and do you think that's probably one of those components that would factor in there. Just last one for me, if lumber price is down, just wondering how you think that might impact either it be it prices, I know there is not a direct correlation per se there, but they did sort of compete with each other in some applications. So just wondering what your outlook is for either be bright EWP prices the rest of this year and into 2019? Doyle Simons : Yeah, so EWP prices as we mentioned were actually up a little bit in the quarter that's a result of the price increase that we went -- that we put in earlier this year. So as you said, there is no direct tie between EWP prices. Those are done -- those price increases are set and implement over an annual basis, whereas lumber as we know it's price is determined every day. So at some point if you said there was a significant change in overall demand for lumber and/or EWP that could have an impact on pricing, but right now we anticipate prices will be steady for the balance of this year and into next year for EWP. Brian McGuire : Okay. I'll leave it there. Thanks again Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Hey. Good morning. Doyle Simons : Good morning, Collin. Collin Mings : First question for me just on the share repurchases over half the authorization was used in 3Q, I don't know if you can update us on how much has been purchased here 4Q today and maybe just more broadly update us on the appetite for repurchase activity just given the near-term cash generation isn\u2019t what it was a couple months ago? Doyle Simons : Collin as mentioned, we did repurchase $290 million in the third quarter. As we always do, we will report the amount that we repurchased in the fourth quarter and when we do the fourth quarter earnings call. So we still had $210 million under the current authorization and we of course will be working with our Board as we always do own capital allocation as we move forward. Collin Mings : Okay. And then just going back to roughly your comments as part of the sensitivity, just running some quick math, would it be fair to say if pricing stabilizes at this level that wood products, EBITDA generation would be maybe somewhere around the $100 million number, is there some other moving pieces we should consider in that or just some guidepost, would that be a fair way to think about it? Russell Hagen : Collin I think as you look, clearly the pricing is pretty dynamic right now. As Doyle indicated, we would expect pricing to start improving coming into the latter part of the quarter, but as we stated in the prepared remarks, will be significantly down quarter-over-quarter. Collin Mings : Okay. And then just follow-up, going a little bit back to Anthony's question earlier, just as part -- a bit surprised by the Timberland guidance for 4Q just given that I would be a really multiyear low contribution from that segment, I get in the response some of the questions that you have this optimism as far as pricing recovering on the log front as we kind of move through 4Q, but just in terms of what you're seeing real time if you will, is pricing stabilizing? Is there still been further deterioration? Maybe just talk us through that a little bit both domestically and export. Doyle Simons : Yeah so what I would say is that we still have reasonably high levels of inventory across the mill set in the West and so we're really just at the point now where we're starting to move into the rainy season here in the West and so that's going to take a little time for that to work its way through. I would expect you're going to continue to see the inventories at high level for the next several weeks and then as we get into the back half of Q4, I think you'll start to see that normalize and so I think we're still at a point where that's working its way through the supply demand dynamic getting back into balance, that will improve I think over the back half of the quarter. And that domestic pricing that certainly is correlated to the export pricing as well. So those things typically move more or less in tandem. Collin Mings : Okay. One last one for me and I'll turn it over. Just going back to some of the disruptions on the export market, a lot of has been made up over the last couple years really about the export opportunities out of the U.S., clearly some disruptions near term, recognizing again that the overall contribution from that is pretty de minimis for you guys. But just long term, how do you think about that business and are you actively exporting outside or out of the US out right now? Russell Hagen : Yeah so obviously there's a difference between 5% tariff that we're seeing in the West and a 25% tariff on the South. The 25% tariff is certainly more meaningful to that business. Now as you said just for context, it is a relatively small part of our overall business, both in the South and then certainly Timberlands wide. We're continuing to ship out of the US South to China and India, that has gone down somewhat and certainly we're not ramping that up at the same pace that we had anticipated pre-trade dispute, but if you kind of step back and look at the opportunity over the long term, we're still very optimistic that that's going to be a good business for us. We've been on the ground talking to customers in China. I think Southern Yellow Pine is a market that will ultimately be developed in a much more meaningful way in China. I think the demand is there. Really I think in the short term we're going to have to just work our way through until this trade dispute gets resolved, but I would expect that it will get resolved as they always do and then there will be a very I think a bigger opportunity for us exporting out of the South. Collin Mings : Okay. I appreciate the color and again Doyle congratulations on your retirement and compliments at Weyerhaeuser and congratulations Devin on the new role. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Collin. Operator : Your next question comes from line of Mark Wilde with BMO. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Doyle, Devin, Russ. Doyle Simons : Good morning. Mark Wilde : Doyle, it's been about 25 years of earnings calls, I think you're probably happy to see them come to an end. Doyle Simons : I would absolutely agree with you. Mark Wilde : We've must be in the same boat with you. Three questions I want to ask about; first, there have been a couple of articles in the Wall Street Journal over the last couple weeks about kind of supply issues on Southern Timberland and I wondered if you guys would want to offer any thoughts on the substance of those articles, really had to do a kind of subsidies over the last 30 years for Timberland planting? Devin Stockfish : Yes sure Mark, this is Devin. Really that was getting to the Conservation Reserve Program that's in place -- been in place for a number of years and so really that's nothing new. We've all been aware of that program for long time and really it's just one factor that plays into the overall supply-demand dynamic going on in the south. It has certainly added some additional acreage over the years, but once again I think our optimism over the long-term is really about just the continued capacity coming online, the export opportunities over time, the diminishing supply from the Canadian lumber and the underlying continued improvement in housing. And so it's a piece of the puzzle, certainly not anything that everybody wasn't I think aware of already in terms of how they think about inventory levels across the South. So I guess that's how we would speak to that. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fair enough. Second question I had I think we've all been surprised for the last 10 years about what's going on in the housing market. I think the notion that we're topping out here around 1.3 million starts is a big shock to a lot of us. I'm just curious if we are topping out here, can you talk about sort of the sustainability of the dividend if we don't see further improvement in the housing market? Doyle Simons : Mark, first I would say I am not sure we agree with the premise and then I'll answer your question, go ahead. Mark Wilde : No, I was just to say Doyle, I think a lot of us have kind of been assuming would at least get the 15 or 16, but if you look at the data over the last three or four months, it's not what it's showing us. So I am just saying if we're indeed topping out and I'm not arguing that we are, let's just talk about the dividend on that basis? Doyle Simons : Sure, so let's assume for a minute that we top out the housing currently where we are, I think clearly that's a sensitivity we ran when we were coming over the dividend, we make dividend decisions for the long-term. We all have to remember that just last quarter we had record EBITDA and our wood products operation and in very high levels of EBITDA across the company, and housing starts at one point to something. So clearly, wood product prices have fallen. Again I think that's a confluence of events that just happen to fall in the same part and push prices down in the third quarter into the fourth quarter, but under your assumption of 1.3 million housing starts, I think this company in the way we're positioned and are focused on cost can generate a significant amount of cash flow and would be very comfortable with the dividend level on a go-forward basis. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. That's good. That's what I wanted. Last thing I wanted to ask about it's just Northern Timberlands, we generated $13 million in EBITDA this year around 2.5 million acres. I'm wondering how you think about that piece of portfolio and I'm particularly wondering if this is just a kind of valuation arbitrage between kind of where warehouse or trades on an EBITDA basis and what you might be able to do with that Timberland generating a relatively modest amount of EBITDA? Russell Hagen : So Mark, this is Russell, as we stated when we first completed the merger with Plum Creek that we are going to look at all of the components of the portfolio and that's the Uruguay operations kind of as part of that review and then we continue to look at the portfolio really in all regions and determine, which timberlands makes sense on a long-term basis, which are strategic and where we want to grow and where we might want to divest. Again that's an ongoing process. The one thing I will say about the North is there are very low input costs. So it's very low-cost type operations, but again we'll continue to review the portfolio and if makes economic sense, we'll act on them. Mark Wilde : Okay. Fair enough. Doyle, enjoy your retirement. Doyle Simons : Thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes. Good morning and Doyle congratulations. It's been quite a long time that we've worked together. We certainly enjoyed it. So all the best. Doyle Simons : Thank you, Chip and I've enjoyed working with you and many others on this call as well. It's hard to believe it's been a number of years it has been. So thank you. Chip Dillon : Exactly at least one us and that would be you haven't changed that much, but hey listen, I had a question about when I look at the Timberland, well we both have a few more gray hairs, but looking at Timberland in the segment, you've given us great detail in terms of the sequential expectation and yet when I look year-over-year, it looks down pretty sharply and I didn't know if you just step back from the fourth quarter of this year and how that looks versus the fourth quarter of last year, how would you break up that roughly, I don't know $50 million $60 million decline in EBITDA between what we see in terms of the export market on one hand and what we see in terms of the domestic market? And then I guess the third bucket would be just you mentioned the higher unit costs, which would suggest you're going to harvest a little less, but you still haven't fixed cost of all the folks that are involved with that? Doyle Simons : I think the year-over-year story is primarily around volume. If you think from a pricing perspective, it's not going to be all that much different year-over-year for the quarter, but it's primarily around volume and there's also certainly some cost inflation, which I mentioned earlier a little more on the transportation side, but a little bit on the logging side as well. Chip Dillon : I got you and then I know you probably it's hard to tell, certainly given the fragmentation of the housing construction of marketplace, but as you look into 2019 to the best of your intelligence, are you seeing builders going into next year with less to do or is this pause you think largely seasonal in terms of what we're seeing in the data? And if it is the case of they have left to do, is it because they just can't get the permits or the people to do the work or is it because there's truly perhaps the demand or affordability issue? Doyle Simons : Yeah, so let me share with you kind of our view on housing and given it's a lot of thought and start with the fact that there's just a lot of noise out there. There is weather events. There is increase in interest rate, the political situation, the volatility in the stock market, but if you step back, housing fundamentals are still compelling. Employment and wages continue to rise, consumer confidence is strong and while we've seen growth in housing starts for a number of years, we're still below the $1.3 million, which was -- we're still below $1.3 million which is not enough to replace the housing stock and meet the ongoing household formation and while interest rates are up they're still at relatively low levels. Maybe more important Chip to your question when we talk to our customers, the big homebuilders out there, they're still optimistic about how -- they do have lot constraint, they do have labor constraints and I think that's the big thing holding them back. So what we believe we're seeing right now is kind of a short-term slowdown in the growth rate on housing rather than something structural. Again, when we look at it, when we talk to folks about it, we see continued strength in growth in demand in housing on a go-forward basis. The other thing I would mention is we're also encouraged by what we're seeing in the repair and remodeling market, which as you know is a key driver of lumber demand and that's up 7.5% or so this year and we anticipate that kind of growth in 2019 as well in that market. So that's kind of how we think about it. Chip Dillon : That's very helpful. Thanks again, guys. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from the line of Steven Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Chercover : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Just a couple of nitty-gritty questions on the Wood Product segment. So first of all on the Distribution segment, I was wondering if there was any kind of inventory write-down in addition to the fires and everything else that's contributed to the decline? Doyle Simons : The decline in distribution was driven by a couple of things. Number one, as we mentioned, we did have the fire at our Reading facility that was $4 million as result of some damage to inventory and equipment there. So that was $4 million of the impact. Secondly, our Southeast distribution centers were down for a period of time because of the hurricane and then third is just when you have falling commodity prices throughout a quarter, that's going to have an impact on distribution. So those would be the three key drivers for the delta quarter over quarter. Steven Chercover : Okay. Thanks for that Doyle and then next one is can Engineered Wood Products sustain the pricing momentum or even sustain current pricing when lumber has fallen so dramatically? Doyle Simons : Engineered Wood Product pricing is going to be based on what happens on the demand side of the equation. Again we think housing is going to continue to improve, which will drive demand. We did see a falloff in demand in the third quarter. As we mentioned that was driven by weather. There was extremely wet weather and what are historically very strong markets for EWP especially in Texas, which had and continues to have a lot of rain. So the key driver for EWP is going to be what happens on the housing front and as demand continues to grow in housing, we think that demand will be in place, which will support current prices and could even potentially projecting it could potentially lead to further price increases as we move into 2019. Steven Chercover : Okay. Thanks and final question on lumber. If lumber prices were to stay in the current price range, would that put pressure on log prices? I'm wondering from a chicken and egg perspective, due to nonintegrated producers bid logs, so they are going to earn a margin on their lumber or the types of the lumber is a function of the incoming log price? Doyle Simons : Well as we've seen historically there has been a direct tie between lumber and log prices, but as we've seen in the South, that's no longer necessarily the case. So we'll see how it plays out, but I guess most importantly we're pretty optimistic about lumber pricing headed back in the right direction, because if you really step back from a lumber perspective, is we think as you move forward assuming housing continues to improve, you're going to be in a mode where you're going to have growth and demand of somewhere in the 2 billion board feet range a year and you're going have growth in supply, net growth in supply. So there is some coming out of Canada increases in the South of 1 billion board feet and that's going to be a pretty good dynamic on a go-forward basis. Steven Chercover : Okay. Thanks Doyle and all the best to you. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thank you, Doyle. Certainly want to add my congratulations. You've done impressive things at Weyerhaeuser. Two questions, with valuations in other wood-related businesses coming down, how do you think about the relative size of the TRS? Is this an opportunity maybe to scale up the TRS and also how do you think about Timberland assets in the market now in terms of relative value? Doyle Simons : So in terms of the size of the TRS, we really don't have any significant constraints on the ability to growth at this point. As always n valuation is what will matter in terms of -- in terms of any potential acquisitions. We've said, we think our biggest opportunities would be on the Timberland side, but we would look for bolt-on acquisitions in wood products especially if they tied into our timber base. So that has not changed, but we will be very disciplined on acquisitions as we move forward. In terms of timberlands, valuations are still at pretty high levels, but we will continue to look for opportunities to grow our timberland where we think we can create value for shareholders. Mark Connelly : Very helpful. Thank you, Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you. Operator : Today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn : Thanks. Just skidded under the wire here. Maybe just a question on whether you've noticed anything in the Timberland marking themselves in terms of valuations, whether they've come down at all due to the market drop in lumber and OSB prices over the year? Russell Hagen : Paul, this is Russell. We really haven't seen a change in the overall market dynamics. It's actually been pretty busy second half of the year. As far as valuations, we're still seeing as Doyle mentioned strong valuations and high-quality timberlands are in demand and we're seeing those trade at good prices. So the short-term dynamic that we're experiencing in the second half of the year, we haven't seen it impact Timberland values. Paul Quinn : All right. That's all I had. Congrats Doyle. Doyle Simons : Thank you very much. Doyle Simons : So as I understand, that was our final question. As I mentioned earlier, as we close the call this morning, we want to make a few comments on succession and I wanted to personally thank all of you for your support over the last five years and as we mentioned, for many of you it's been 20 or 25 years. I will say, it's been an absolute honor to lead Weyerhaeuser for the past five years. When I accepted the job, I told our Board that I would stay for five years and every day I would be relentlessly focused on five things; portfolio, performance, capital allocation, culture and people development. I'm very proud of the progress we've made to position Weyerhaeuser to drive value for shareholders and I couldn't be any more excited about the energy and vision Devon, Adrian and Keith will bring to their new roles as they continue to drive improved operational and financial performance. Those of you who know Devin, he is extremely smart, driven and dedicated. He shares my passion for developing people and getting results and he is also an outstanding role model for our core values. And with that, I'd like to turn it over the floor to Devin for a few closing remarks. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, thanks Doyle. Well, first I want to take a moment just to thank Doyle for his tremendous leadership and contributions to Weyerhaeuser. During his time leading this company, we focused and enhanced our portfolio of assets, improved our operating performance and delivered on a commitment to disciplined capital allocation. It's been a real privilege to work with Doyle over the last five years and I certainly wish him all the best in his retirement. I am personally truly honored to be assuming the leadership of this great company. Our assets are world-class. Our employees are incredibly talented. Our strategy is sound and I'm privileged to be working with a terrific senior leadership team. In the coming months and years, we're going to build on this strong foundation to make Weyerhaeuser the world's premier timberland and forest products company. I am very excited about the opportunities in front of us as we continue working together to drive value for shareholders through a relentless focus on industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation. I've had the chance to meet many of you in person already and it certainly look forward to getting to know the rest of you better as I assume the role. So for now, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. And with that, I think we'll close the call. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Weyerhaeuser third quarter 2018 earnings results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Good morning. My name is Dennis, and I will be your conference operator today. At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Fourth Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any background noise. After the speaker's remarks there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2018 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our Web site. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our Web site. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : All right, thanks, Beth. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As most of you know, this is my first earnings call as Weyerhaeuser CEO. I'm surely honored to be taking on the leadership of this great company. I'm going to open this morning with a discussion of our financial results, then Russell will talk about outlook, and I will wrap up with a few comments on the vision and strategy going forward, and my focus area is for 2019. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported full-year net earnings of $748 million or $0.99 per diluted share on net sales of $7.5 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $891 million or a $1.18 per share, an improvement of 2% compared with 2017. Adjusted EBITDA was similar to last year at slightly over $2 billion. For fourth quarter, we reported a GAAP loss of $93 million, or $0.12 per diluted share. This loss was driven by a previously-announced non-cash charge following completion of a lump sum offer that reduced our U.S. pension liabilities by over $660 million. Excluding special items, we earned $70 million or $0.10 per diluted share for the quarter. I'm proud of the fourth quarter and full-year performance as our teams delivered strong results through a full range of market conditions, capitalizing on the upside and effectively managing the downside. In 2018, we generated over $2 billion of EBITDA, including $1 billion of Wood Products EBITDA for the second year in a row. We grew EBITDA from our real estate, energy, and natural resources business by nearly 10%. We captured over $40 million of OpEx improvements in our Timberlands business. We delivered a 65% premium to timber value from real estate sales, significantly exceeding our 30% target. We return nearly $1.4 billion at cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases, and we initiated a series of actions that reduced our pension liabilities by over $2 billion. This includes the annuity purchase transaction that we announced earlier this week. In a moment I will dive into our business results, but first, let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. Much has been written about the slowdown or pause in U.S. housing during the second-half of 2018, and what it make signal for the year ahead. As interest rates and home prices continue to increase in the back-half of the year, it became apparent that many potential buyers were staying on the sidelines due to concerns about affordability. This dynamic persisted through the fourth quarter, exacerbated by increased volatility in financial markets, the threat of a government shutdown, and extremely wet weather that limited construction activity in parts of the U.S. south. However, notwithstanding a slower back-half of the year, we again experienced year-over-year growth in the U.S. housing market in 2018. Through November, single-family and total starts were up 4% to 5% compared with 2017. Expenditures for repair and remodeling, which comprises about 40% of lumber demand are up over 7%. Looking forward to 2019, fundamental economic data remains very supportive for U.S. housing. Real wages are increasing, employment continues to rise with unemployment at the lowest level since 1969, and job growth in key housing markets continues to be strong. These trends plus favorable demographics are driving the highest levels of household formation in 15 years. For 2018, household formations are expected to total approximately 1.5 million. On balance, housing remains affordable by historical standards. Mortgage rates have decreased approximately 50 basis points since early November, and builders are actively adjusting amenities and floor plans to target a more affordable price point. Additionally, are current inventory of homes for sales is low. All of this, points to continued growth in U.S. housing. For 2019, we anticipate total starts of approximately 1.3 million, with the improvement driven primarily by increased single-family activity. Turning now to our fourth quarter business results, I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts five through seven. Timberlands contributed $107 million in the fourth quarter earnings and $188 to adjusted EBITDA. This is lower than the previous quarter and the fourth quarter of 2017, primarily due to lower realization for Western logs. Western Timberlands EBITDA declined $27 million compared with the third quarter, as seasonal increase in our fee harvest volumes was more than offset by a 10% decrease in average logs sales realizations. Road cost increased slightly as we took advantage of favorable weather to complete road building activities deferred earlier in 2018. In the Western domestic market, average realizations declined as lumber mills entered the fourth quarter with high log inventories and a number of mills took extended holiday downtime or temporarily curtailed operations in response to low lumber prices. As the quarter progressed, log supplies across the system declined seasonally, and supply has come back into balance with demand. In our export markets, Chinese construction and infrastructure activity remains strong. Log inventories at Chinese ports declined by over 20% during the quarter, and ended the year below normal at 209 million cubic meters. Our export log volumes increased as customer demand normalized after China implemented a 5% tariff on our Hemlock and Douglas fir export logs in the third quarter. Average realizations declined slightly. In Japan, post-and-beam housing starts ended 2018 essentially flat with the year ago, and demand for our customer's products and our logs remains solid. Our export log sales volumes to Japan increased compared with the third quarter due to timing of shipments, and average log sales realizations declined moderately. Overall, our fourth quarter export revenue was comparable to last year, with slightly higher sales volumes in both Japan and China, offset by slightly lower average realizations. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands EBITDA increased $9 million compared with the third quarter. Fourth quarter weather was very wet across our southern ownership. This limited log supplies resulting in lean mill inventories and slightly improved log pricing. Our average southern log realizations decreased slightly compared with the third quarter due to mix as we harvested a smaller average fee size during the quarter. Fee harvest volume increased due to additional stumpage sales. Although stumpage is a small portion of our sales volume, we look to capitalize on opportunities when we can capture a premium over delivered log margins. Forestry expense was also slightly lower as we deferred some activity due to wet weather. On the export side, southern log export volumes decreased due to a full quarter of China export tariffs. Average realizations for southern export logs were roughly flat. Demand has been stable since the tariffs were imposed in late August and our southern pine logs continue to be assessed at a 25% rate. On a full-year basis, our southern export log volumes increased nearly 50% compared with 2017, despite a partial year of tariffs. Although the tariff significantly reduced the amount of volume coming out of our southern export business, we look forward to growth there as trade tension ease eventually. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year-ago quarter, EBITDA declined due to lower harvest volumes and slightly higher harvest in whole cost. In 2018, we harvested a smaller portion of our volume during the fourth quarter. Northern Timberlands EBITDA was $2 million more than the third quarter and $3 million less than the same period a year ago. Fee harvest volumes increased seasonally in most areas. Average realizations decreased modestly due to mix as we harvested a smaller proportion of hardwood grade logs in West Virginia due to extremely wet weather. Real estate, Energy, and Natural Resources, charts eight and nine. Real estate and ENR contributed $44 million to the fourth quarter earnings and $90 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA was $4 million higher than the third quarter and $3 million higher than a year ago. For the full-year, the segment generated $264 million of EBITDA, up $23 million from 2017. The number of acres sold in the fourth quarter decreased significantly compared to the third quarter that was comparable to a year ago. Average price breaker was much higher than the third quarter, and also higher than a year ago, due to the geographic mix of property sold. Approximately 85% of the acres sold in the fourth quarter were located in the West and the South, whereas in the third quarter, over half of the acres sold were in Montana, where timberland prices are regionally lower. Average land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was lower than third quarter, but higher than fourth quarter 2017. As a result, the segment's fourth quarter contribution to earnings was $8 million more than the third quarter, but $6 million lower than a year ago. Wood Products, charts 10 and 11; Wood Products contributed $26 million in the fourth quarter earnings and $66 million to adjusted EBITDA. Earnings and EBITDA were significantly lower than third quarter in the same period last year due to lower realization for lumber and OSB. EBITDA for lumber decreases $112 million compared with third quarter. This was almost entirely attributable to lower average realizations. Lumber prices declined through the month of October, stabilized in November, and remained largely flat through year-end, as the pause in housing activity and early winter weather in the East reinforced the normal seasonal reduction in lumber demand. The framing lumber composite averaged 26% lower in the fourth quarter compared with the third, and our average realizations decreased $103 per 1000 board fee or 21%. Our lumber sales volumes decreased 7% compared with the third quarter as we took some downtime for completion of capital projects and operated at a reduced shift posture at certain mills around the holidays. Although our cash cost for Western and Canadian logs declined during the fourth quarter, there was a minimal benefit from these lower log costs in fourth quarter financial results due to cost accounting. Much of the lumber we sold in the fourth quarter was manufactured using logs purchased in the third quarter and early fourth quarter when log prices were higher. As a result, our cost of sales mostly reflects these higher log costs. We expect to realize most of the benefits from lower fourth quarter log costs in our first quarter results. Fourth quarter EBITDA includes $4 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. Comparing our fourth quarter results with the year-ago quarter, average sales realizations for lumber was significantly lower. Log costs were higher, and manufacturing costs increased slightly. OSB EBITDA decreased $46 million compared with the third quarter due to lower average realizations. Fourth quarter OSB pricing generally mirrored that of lumber, and our average realization declined $69 per 1,000 square feet or 21%. Fourth quarter sales volumes were comparable to our lower-than-normal third quarter as our third quarter sales volumes were limited by a scheduled outage to replace the press at our Grayling Michigan mill. The outage extended for mid-July through late-October, and the mill returned to full production by year-end. Comparing our fourth quarter results to the year-ago quarter, average sales realizations for OSB decreased 25% and sales volumes decreased 5%. Fiber costs were slightly higher, and manufacturing costs increased slightly due to additional outage days. Engineered wood product's EBITDA decreased $22 million compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes for both solid section and I joist decreased seasonally as construction activity softened and dealers and builders start to minimize year-end inventories. Unit manufacturing costs increased due to lower operating rates. Average sales realizations for I joist increased by 2%, as we captured the final portion of our 2018 price increase. Average realizations for solid section products decreased by 3% due to mix, as we sold a greater proportion of industrial products. Compared with the year-ago quarter, higher average realizations were more than offset by lower sales volumes and slightly higher manufacturing costs. Distribution EBITDA decreased $1 million compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes declined seasonally. This was mostly offset by slightly lower warehouse and delivery costs and a small insurance reimbursement related to the previous wild wire damage at our Redding, California facility. Compared with the year-ago, EBITDA decreased slightly due to lower sales volumes. I would like to now turn to operational excellence. Collectively, our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses achieved $44 million of operational excellence improvements in 2018. This brings us to over $540 million of total improvement since we began this program five years ago. Timberlands achieved its $40 million to $50 million target capturing $42 million of improvements in 2018, for a cumulative total of $214 million. In 2018, the majority of OpEx improvements in timberlands were attributable to initiatives to reduce logging and hauling costs, and improved log merchandizing and marketing to maximize the revenue from every log we harvest. In Wood Products, we had some challenges with OpEx this year. Although the business has captured $329 million of cumulative improvements, it delivered only $2 million of OpEx in 2018. On our third quarter call, we noted that the business had a lot of work to do to get to its 2018 OpEx target. And unfortunately we were not able to make up ground in the fourth quarter. The business did made good progress on improving fiber recovery, but we were not able to capture as much benefit as we had hoped from our other three focus areas. Our initiatives to increase mill reliability were hampered by an unusual amount of downtime for severe weather through the year. We did not capture enough cost reduction opportunities in light of the inflationary headwinds during the year, and we weren't able to realize the benefits from capital projects completed later in the year as ramped up several of those projects more slowly than planned. Obviously, we are disappointed by these results. We need to execute against our OpEx initiatives regardless of markets or weather conditions. So, no excuses. The good news is that we know the improvement opportunities are out there. We have a strong track record of achieving OpEx improvements in this business, and we have solid plans in place to capture these opportunities next year. In 2019, we are targeting $80 million to $100 million of additional OpEx improvements. This includes $40 million to $50 million from Timberlands, and $40 million to $50 million in Wood Products. I'm confident that we have the focus, tools, and expertise to achieve these targets, and I know there are significant opportunities beyond that to continue improving our relative performance in each of our business. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning. The outlook for the first quarter and the full-year 2019 are presented in charts 14 and 15 of the earnings slides. In Timberlands business, we expect our first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately 10% lower than the fourth quarter. This reflects normal seasonal variations in harvest volumes as well as the effect of the decline in Western log prices that occurred in the fourth quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we expect first quarter average sales realizations for domestic and export logs will be moderately below the fourth quarter average and harvest volumes will be lower. This will be mostly offset by a significant reduction in road and forestry spending and seasonally lower log and haul costs. As we move to lower elevations in the winter months. Domestic log supply has come into balance with demand in the West. The log deck inventories are at more normal levels. Japanese export log sales volumes are expected to decline due to the timing of shipments, we're seeing continue to strength in the Japanese housing market, particularly in the higher end post-and-beam construction and favorable demand for logs from our Japanese customers. Average sales realizations for Chinese export logs are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter and volumes to be lower on seasonally softer demand due to the Lunar New Year. In the South, we anticipate seasonally lower fee harvest volumes. Average sales realizations in the first quarter are expected to be similar to the fourth quarter. In the North, we anticipate average sales realizations for the first quarter will be higher while harvest volumes will be seasonally lower. Turning to the full-year 2019, we expect total company harvest volumes will be comparable to 2018 at approximately 38 million tons. We expect first quarter earnings and adjusted for our real-estate and energy and natural Resources segment will be approximately 10 million higher than the fourth quarter driven by our real-estate operations. Our buyer traffic typically slows during the winter months we saw a very strong real-estate activity in the fourth quarter, which allowed us to pursue a handful of additional transactions that we will close in the first quarter. Combined with continued strong interest in the west and the south, we're anticipating first quarter earnings that will be stronger than we would normally see for this time of year. We speak land basis as a percentage of real-estate sales will be approximately 50% for the first quarter. In our energy and natural resources operations, we anticipate that royalties will be seasonally lower in the first quarter. For the full-year 2019, we expect approximately $260 million of adjusted for real-estate Energy and Natural Resources segment, land basis as a percentage of real-estate sales to be between 40% and 55% for the full-year 2019. Wood Products, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. Market prices for lumbers stabilized late in the fourth quarter and it began to rise. Sale orders are improving as we entered the spring building season. Current and first quarter to-date average sales realizations are $10 lower than the fourth quarter average. However, prices are approving and market dynamics are favorable. Our builder customers are expressing optimism about the spring selling season. As a reminder, every $10 change in lumber realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. As Devin mentioned earlier, we anticipate a substantial improvement in western and Canadian log cost in the first quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to improve with higher production volumes as we move into the spring building season. Our newly expanded dirt sawmill was commissioned in mid-October. The mill's capacity is 80 million board feet larger and will continue ramping up for full production throughout 2019. For oriented strand board market price is stabilized late in the fourth quarter and current first quarter to-date realizations are approximately $30 lower than the fourth quarter average. As a reminder, every $10 change in OSB realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. We will have full quarter of production at our grayling Michigan mill after completing our plan, press replacement and start. In the first quarter, we anticipate seasonally higher sales volumes and operating rates for oriented strand board. Sales volumes for engineered Wood Products are also expected to increase in the first quarter. We anticipate unit manufacturing costs will be lower than the fourth quarter. Chart 12, outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Excluding special items, net contribution to earnings improved by $35 million. This was primarily due to a non-cash benefit from elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO resulting from reduced log inventories. Year-end adjustments for lower employee benefits expense and foreign exchange gains were also favorable compared to the third quarter. Fourth quarter pretax special items include the $200 million non-cash pension settlement charge and a $13 million gain on the sale of a non-strategic asset. For our pension and postretirement plans, the year-end 2018 funded status improved by $1 billion compared to 2017 driven primarily by a higher discount rates and a $300 million voluntary cash contribution in the third quarter. Discount rates increased approximately 70 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 20 basis points for the Canadian plants. Cash paid for pension and postretirement plans in 2018 was $381 million, which includes the $300 million voluntary contribution to our U.S. qualified plan. In 2019, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $50 million including the fourth quarter settlement charge our non-cash, non-operating pension and postretirement expense was $72 million in 2018. We expect to record approximately $60 million of expense in 2019. As we announced earlier this week, we purchased a group annuity contract to transfer approximately $1.5 billion of Weyerhaeuser's U.S. pension assets and liabilities to an insurance carrier. The purchase was funded with assets from our U.S. pension plan. In connection with this transaction, we expect to recognize non-cash, pre-tax pension settlement charge of approximately $450 million in the first quarter of 2019. Now I like to update you on our key financial items, which are summarized on chart 13, we ended the year with the cash balance at $334 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter is $292 million. For the full-year 2018, cash from operations was $1.1 billion. As we think about funds available for distribution. It's important to consider that in 2018 cash from operations included the $300 million voluntary cash pension contribution and approximately $100 million net spend for product remediation. Capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled a $144 million and the full-year total for 2018 was $427 million. We expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $400 million, $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of forestry reforestation costs and $270 million for Wood Products and $10 billion for plan corporate IT system investments. Turning to financing activities, we repurchased 11 million shares of common stock in 2018, including 2.8 million shares or $75 million in the fourth quarter. At year-end, we had $135 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. We'll use this on an opportunistic basis in conjunction with our overall capital allocation strategy, we will report on our progress each quarter. Moving on to debt, we have one scheduled maturity in October 2019 for $500 million of 7 and 3-8s notes, which we plan to refinance. In the fourth quarter, we paid $209 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in the early 2000s. We will receive $253 million cash in the first quarter when the related financial investment matures. We did the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion of debt outstanding. This includes a balance on our line of credit, the portion of which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflows associated with the variable interest entity, debt maturity. During 2018, we've reduced our cash balance as part of an intentional transition to move to a more efficient cash management strategy. Going forward, we expect to use a revolving credit facility to support temporary working capital needs. In the fourth quarter, interest expense was $97 million. We expect interest expense will be approximately $360 million for the full-year 2019. Moving on to taxes in the first quarter and full-year 2019, we expect the tax rate will be between 14% and 16%, excluding special items. Now, I'll turn the call back to Devin. I look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : All right, thanks, Russell. Over the past few months, the main question I've had as I've talked with our employees, our customers, and our investors is what can we expect under your leadership? For those of you that know me, you know that I worked closely with Doyle for a number of years. I believe strongly in the fundamental strategy we have in place and that framework will remain the same. We will continue to drive value for shareholders by focusing on portfolio, performance, and disciplined capital allocation. We do need to continue to evolve how we implement that strategy to ensure that Weyerhaeuser maintains a competitive advantage and delivers superior returns for investors. We remain focused on improving our operational performance, our financial performance, and our ability to attract and retain talent. So, as we think about near-term priorities, my 2019 focus areas will be as follows : first, driving OpEx, with a particular focus on reliability and cost. As I mentioned we're targeting $80 million to $100 million of improvements across the company this year. In Timberlands, we're continuing to focus on reducing cost and driving efficiencies across our entire harvesting, hauling and road building, operations, and maximizing the value of every log that we harvest and sell. In Wood Products, we're bringing all of our manufacturing expertise together in a unified effort to take our reliability to the next level, which is the single biggest opportunity across our manufacturing portfolio. And in both businesses, and across the organization, we're driving a focus on our customers to serve them better and identify further OpEx opportunities in the supply chain. My second priority is around culture. We've made incredible progress on our journey to create a culture of urgency, accountability, courage, simplicity, and innovation, but driving lasting culture change is an ongoing effort, and we can't let up. So I'll be focused on continuing to reinforce and improve on the cultural progress that we've made. In particular, we'll be placing some additional emphasis on discipline focused innovation, which I strongly believe is a key to Weyerhaeuser's long-term success. My third area of focus is people development. People are our most important asset, and we need to accelerate our efforts on development and building bench strength across all levels of the company. I strongly believe that this will be a competitive advantage for our company in the years to come. And my final area of focus is disciplined capital allocation, which remains critical to driving value for our shareholders. Our priorities for capital allocation have not changed. First, is returning cash to shareholders, this will occur primarily through a dividend that is sustainable and grows over time as well as through opportunistic share repurchases as appropriate. Second, we will continue to invest in our businesses. In Timberlands, that means primarily civil culture and roads. And in Wood Products, it's high return projects that drive down cost and improve reliability. We'll continue to evaluate growth opportunities primarily in Timberlands, but we'll be very disciplined as we evaluate options in this regard. As you know given our significant land base, we're not compelled to grow and we will only pursue opportunities that clearly drive value for our shareholders. And our third capital allocation priority is maintaining an appropriate capital structure including a strong balance sheet and an investment grade credit rating. As you can see Weyerhaeuser's priorities and positioning are not significantly changing. My near-term focus remains on executing on our strategy in building on Weyerhaeuser's strong foundation. This is an incredibly exciting time to be assuming the leadership of Weyerhaeuser. It's a strong company with outstanding people and terrific assets. Our fundamental strategy is in place, and we will continue to improve the company by focusing on our portfolio, our performance, and disciplined capital allocation. I'm really excited about the opportunities that we have to take this company to the next level and deliver long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I'd like to open the floor to questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Hi, everyone, good morning. Devin, congratulations and welcome to the call, thanks for taking my question and for all the details. First question I had is on Wood Products, and I recognize it's real hard, especially, in an environment like the current one and the one we've been in the last few months to put a finer point on significantly increased EBIT or EBITDA for this segment, and 1Q versus 4Q, but if you could give us some parameters on it, it would be great. If you can't, could you tell us what's already sort of baked in to the sequential improvement from things that are under your control or should be there from you know, lower log costs, any inefficiency that hits you from Grayling being out of the mix, those sorts of things as we think about 1Q versus 4Q? Devin Stockfish : Yes, George, and as you know it's really hard to quantify overall EBITDA at this point just because of the volatility that we've seen in pricing primarily on lumber and OSB. So hard to quantify there, but as we think about rolling into Q1, there are a few things that I think are really going to be tailwinds for us. So first of all, when you think about what happened in Q4 on the lumber side, you know, we saw lumber prices come down a lot faster than log prices. And so for the majority of the quarter, we were really working through higher cost inventory from logs that we purchased in Q3 and early Q4 and so it takes time for you to work those through the system. So heading into Q1, we'll be operating off of a lower log cost. So that's one thing. Second thing is just around operating rates. You know, those did come down a bit in Q4 and so we would expect those to be better in Q1. We'll have the full Grayling for full Q1. So that will be a benefit as well. And so overall -- and we do think we have some good tailwinds just on those things that are within our control. Additionally, although it's hard to quantify on the pricing side as you're probably aware, we have seen a pickup in lumber prices here just over the last several weeks and so feel like we're getting some momentum on that front as well. George Staphos : Okay. But on the things that are tailwinds, is there any way to size the effect of the inventory benefit from logs or the Grayling startup in terms of 1Q just to have some sort of building block, and if you can't that's fine but I figured I'd try one more time. Devin Stockfish : , : George Staphos : Okay. Thank you for that. Second question I had is, you know, there was some ticking down in EWP pricing, and you went through the reasons there. It's not like most of that was a mix in terms of industrial and solid section. We had heard in the trade that there was some private-label business that maybe shifted away from you. Was any of that in your mix or pricing effect, or is that -- if you buy the premise of that comment, was that sort of immaterial? And then my last question, I'll turn it over. In the South, there's a fair amount of storm wood, obviously from the third quarter storms, a lot of that is in Florida, does that have any kind of effect on when you expect Southern prices to lift or is it immaterial at this juncture? Thank you, and good luck on the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes, thanks George. So with respect to the EWP question, you have customers move around from time to time in the overall mix, that's not really material for Q4 for us. We have a strong customer base so not terribly impactful for us. With respect to the storm damaged wood, I think when you talk about the local geographies where you had some of the damage, there may be some downward pressure here over the spring time period as they salvage some that wood. Those are geographies that we don't have a significant amount of ownership in those areas, so I don't think it'll impact us terribly. But you will see some increase in volume coming into those local markets as they salvage that damaged wood. George Staphos : Okay, thank you very much. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Devin, congratulations on taking over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Mark, morning. Mark Wilde : Good morning. I wondered, just to start off, from your own distribution operations, what is your sense for kind of building products inventory in the channel right now? Devin Stockfish : Yes, when you look across the system, our view is that inventories are pretty light. You know, you'll have pockets where it might be a little over in certain geographies, but on balance, really across the system, we think that the inventory channels are lower than normal. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then on the OpEx, you called out Timberland, you called out Wood Products, you didn't call out kind of real estate or the distribution business, I wondered if you can give us any color there? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark, so a couple of things, on the real estate business, really, we measure OpEx slightly differently there. And so for us OpEx in real estate is really about generating value over and above the timber value at the acre. And so our target is generally around 30%. In 2018, we delivered well in excess of that. So that's how we measure OpEx in the real estate business. And for distribution, We Put That in with Wood Products, so that's included in all commentary around Wood Products OpEx. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. And then, is it possible going forward, that we could maybe get a little more color on where the real estate land sales take place and sort of value that you achieve there? It just seems like it's an important piece of the puzzle, right now. And just in terms of helping us understand what's going on in the markets, I think a little more granularity would be helpful. Russell Hagen : Hey, Mark, this is Russell. I think as you're well aware there's not a lot of real estate sales happening up in the north right now, and so those markets tend to be very quiet until things thawed out and we really get into the late spring and summer season. So as you noted in the third quarter we had a large transaction coming out of Montana, and that's usually when we see transactions coming out of those northern properties in that third and fourth quarter. Coming into the first quarter, we're going to see more transactions out of the South, and then the west. And those markets are actually still -- you know, have been pretty active. They were really strong coming out of the fourth quarter, and we'll pick up some additional transactions in the first quarter. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right, very good. I'll turn it over, thank you. Russell Hagen : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just following up on George's question about the sequential earnings improvement from 4Q to 1Q in Wood Products you know, understanding your OpEx performance in this segment was below expectations last year, is there any reason to think that that $40 million to $50 million in OpEx in Wood Products might be a little front-end loaded or is that just kind of redistributed throughout the course of the year. And then just switching gears a little bit, a lot of your public competitors were taking pretty significant market downtime in 4Q, just wondering if you could talk generally about operating rates in the quarter, and if you took sort of similar moves or slowbacks? Devin Stockfish : Yes, with respect to OpEx, I wouldn't say that that's going to be frontloaded to the first-half of the year. Really, we look at that 40 to 50 over the course of the full-year and are very optimistic that that's achievable, and we'll get that value. With respect to downtime, you know, as you know our primary strategy in Wood Products is to have low-cost operations. And that positions us to run when it may not make sense for others. And if you think about Q4 in particular, when you see the lumber prices coming down much faster than log prices, that does create some noise while you're working through some of that higher cost inventory, but I think as we have got that log price down to a more normalized level coming out at Q4, I think, we're well-positioned. We did take a little bit of downtime primarily just for capital projects in Q4 and adjusted shift postures in a few locations around the holiday time. But generally speaking, we were running in Q4. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just on Timberlands, I was wondering if you could talk about what you're seeing in terms of transactions, both in terms of just kind of land available, demand, evaluations. It seemed like last year, we saw one kind of big transaction in the South it came in a little bit of a lower dollar per acre, maybe skewed kind of the average prices a little bit lower. Have you seen any kind of meaningful changes in terms of valuations of Southern Timberlands and again, availability and demand? Russell Hagen : Yes, so, this is Russell. First, I'll talk about kind of the transactions, then I'll talk about the valuations. As far as the transactions, you know, 2018, we saw about $4.5 billion of transactions, and there were two large transactions, the southern transaction you talked about, that's Cato [ph] transaction, then we had the PotlatchDeltic deal. And so if you removed those we had about $2 billion of transactions kind of coming through the system. And that's probably kind of an average year anywhere from $2 billion to 3 billion, and then once in a while you get a larger transaction to skew that a little bit. So the overall transaction flow is still pretty strong. As far as valuations are concerned, again, it's difficult to do a comparable analysis, unless you really understand kind of what are some of the constraints on the lands you know, fiber supply agreements can cause some constraints and then also stocking levels, location to markets, et cetera. And so, looking at the values, it really is important to understand what are those impediments to value relative to what we'd consider a prime plantation or a strong industrial Timberland value. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Very helpful, I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Thank you. Just two things, you mentioned that builders are making adjustments. The one thing that we didn't see a lot of in the last big housing downturn was big changes in square footage to affect price points. Do you see any indication that builders are doing any of that or changes that might affect the -- even the engineered lumber component in a house? Devin Stockfish : Yes, you know, I think it's a little earlier for us to have a definitive view on that, it's really just anecdotal. I think it's logical to assume that you may see some small reduction in square footage as people go after those lower affordability price points. But I think on balance from an overall wood usage perspective, it's much better to have more building to hit those affordability price points, so that you can get housing starts up to where the demand level sets. Mark Connelly : Make sense. Okay, and just one more question we've all been sort of watching the sawmill capacity in the U.S. South. Do you see that getting pushed back now that things are a little more uncertain? Devin Stockfish : I really don't and when you look at the available wood baskets across North America, the South is really the low-cost wood basket and so I think as we continue to see some challenges up in BC around fiber supply, I think we're going to continue to see that capital get put into the U.S. South because that will continue to be the low-cost wood basket for the foreseeable future. Mark Connelly : That's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes. Good morning, and welcome to the call Devin. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Good morning. Chip Dillon : Yes. First question is, as you think about the, OpEx improvements beyond '19 and normalized capital spending. I know that as part of the culture change, you've seen the headquarters shift in the last five years, you've completed the transformation of getting the business where you want, and importantly, you all were doing quite a bit of work to get to zero, I guess breakeven at the bottom and a lot of that's already been done, so my question is, as we go out beyond '19. And we look at '20 and '21. I know it's early days. What are your thoughts about what you normally can get, is it 80 to 100 in an OpEx improvement, and does CapEx need to stay at that $400 million level to get there? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so let me have -- I'll answer the capital question first as we've said, our plan has been, we've been spinning $300 million a year, the last several years, we're dropping that down to $270 million this year in Wood Products, it'll probably be comfortable next year. And as we work our way down to a more normalized call it $250 million level, so that sort of what we think is kind of a long-term run rate for capital spend in the Wood Products business. With respect to OpEx, we're certainly going to go after the 80 to 100 this year. It's a little early for me to try to quantify the exact amount beyond that but I am very confident that we'll get through 2019, we will get these OpEx numbers and there's still plenty to get as we continue to focus on cost and reliability throughout the system. So I wouldn't want anyone to take the belief that after 2019, we're done with OpEx. It's really become cultural on the organization. So I would anticipate us continuing to drive OpEx improvement well into the future. Chip Dillon : Okay, that's helpful. And you gave us some numbers before about how log inventory specific -- particularly in China, I think you said they felt 20% in the fourth quarter and are below normalized levels. Do you see any signs that they are coming back to market I know just about everything they buy, they just stopped buying it in October and they're certainly find that they're running out of things hoping one example where local market prices have moved up a little bit? I just didn't know if you'd seen any return to the market from China? Devin Stockfish : Yes, it's hard to say at this particular time of year just because as you head into the Lunar New Year, the demand dynamics change just a little bit in terms of takeaway. I'll tell you our expectation, just given what we hear on the ground is that, coming out of the Lunar New Year, we're going to see continued strong demand. And so, we would expect starting from the lower inventories, you're going to see a good demand pole as we get into the spring season. Chip Dillon : Okay, that's helpful. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Thanks. Good morning, Devin. Good morning Russell. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Collin Mings : First question from me, just on the $500 million of debt maturing this year just can you update us on how you're thinking about the term and potential pricing as it relates to the refinancing? Devin Stockfish : Yes, as I mentioned, that matures in October, that's 738 debt, so it's a little higher coupon rate, I would say we're pleased with kind of where interest rates are at and we'll be looking at all kind of options as we take that and  go to the market to refinance that but I think we'll have a clearly a more favorable coupon rate than what we are retiring. Collin Mings : Okay. And then, just moving on to the guidance as far as the 1Q guidance for the Timberland, on a year-over-year basis, I mean, is the expected drop in adjusted EBITDA, just driven primarily by the decline in western market prices, or is there some other factors just when trying to compare that against the I think the 268 that you posted in 1Q '18? Devin Stockfish : Yes, it's primarily log prices. Collin Mings : Okay. And then, just sticking kind of with Timberland on that front, on the west coast, it sounds like on balance, you believe kind of log pricing in the region is bottoming, Is that fair? And then, just specifically related to the Japan market in the prepared remarks, you referenced just kind of the decline on pricing for those logs? Does that just reflect less favorable supply demand dynamics in the region overall, or is there something else in particular as it relates to the Japan market you're seeing? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So with respect to your first question, yes, I think that is fair, we've seen that bottom out, would expect to see some upward momentum as we get into the spring building season. With respect to Japan, that trades at some premium to domestic prices. And so, those two are correlated and, not necessarily always one-to-one, but there is a correlation. So when you see domestic pricing come down in the West, you'll typically see that the realizations for the Japan logs comedown as well. So it's really just more tied to the domestic market pricing than it is to demand in Japan. Collin Mings : Okay, very helpful. One last one here from me, just any update on insurance recoveries related to the Flak Jacket product issue? Russell Hagen : Yes, this is Russell, we completed the remediation of that last year and we're very confident, we'll get recoveries under the insurance and we're working with our insurance carriers. Collin Mings : Okay. Thanks, guys. I'll turn it over. Russell Hagen : Thanks. Beth Baum : Do we have another question? Operator : Yes, sir. Next question comes from a line of Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please go ahead. Kurt Yinger : Yes. Good morning, and thanks for taking my questions. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Yinger : I wanted to jump back to the Timberland's guidance. You know, obviously you have a tough comp there from a log pricing standpoint in the West. And it should be tough again in the second quarter. It looks like but I mean, how do those sort of dynamics play out on a full-year basis? Do you think just given the big year-on-year decline in the first quarter? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so again, it's hard to fully predict what log prices are going to do over the course of the year. What I would say is when you think about the Western System, it's a very tension wood basket. And so, as we see prices rising in the spring with lumber and we see the building season pickup, our expectation is that you're going to see log prices follow. And so, we would anticipate if we have another good year in U.S. housing, which we fully expect and you're going to see log pricing continue to trend up over the course of the year, but again, hard to quantify. Kurt Yinger : Okay. And then, my second question was, you reference some of the regional cost differences for sawmills, could you maybe talk a bit about your own margin differential for mills in the South versus, maybe the U.S. Western Canada? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so I don't know that we necessarily quantify that in specifics, but I can just tell you directionally, clearly with the South, the log costs are lower than they are in the Western Canada. And so, the margins in the Southern business are going to be better than they are in the Western in the Canadian lumber business. Kurt Yinger : All right, thanks. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. One, I was just trying to flush out a little bit more. So it sounds like west coast log pricing is largely going to be a function you're thinking of what happens to U.S. housing or how important our developments in Asia do you think to what transpires to the West coast log pricing? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so obviously in the west, the export business is a much bigger portion of our overall sales than it is in the south. And so, it's really multiple things it's what happens with U.S. housing and how does that impact lumber but also the demand out of Japan and China and to a smaller extent Korea. So, all of those things go into the overall demand signal in the West. And it's, a as I said, a very tension wood basket. So when you get increased demand in any of those, it can pull pricing up across the system. Mark Weintraub : And if I understood correctly, Japan really hasn't been an issue on the demand side. China, it sounds there seems to have been -- what you believed there was that draw down of inventory. But I think you referenced that you thought that Chinese construction and infrastructure activity was still strong which I thought was interesting because there certainly been other commentary maybe not quite as bullish on that. So lot similar color there. But that sort of made it seem that it was the U.S. housing market that had been the biggest delta of life, but correct me if I am wrong. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So couple of things, so on the Japan side, the demand has been solid. We are still seeing solid demand from the Japanese market for a higher quality Japan logs. The pricing and that was the comment earlier -- the pricing came down just a little bit. But that was really more driven by there is a correlation to domestic pricing. In China, what I would say is that we are seeing solid construction activity and good demand pull. When you think about over the last half of 2018, we did see a bit of a dip when the tariffs were originally put in place. That had largely normalized at least from a demand and volume perspective off of the West Coast for us as we got into the fourth quarter. And so, we are still expecting the overall volume to China to be comparable to prior quarters in that business at this tariff level still seems to be solid. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And then shifting gears, looking at your timberland operation, it's notable that the northern timberlands don't contribute a whole lot of EBITDA especially relative to if one were to look at comp valuations et cetera kind of the implied valuation of the business would have been. And so kind of the question is, is that a good fit for a publicly-traded timber REIT where it's not generating a whole lot of cash flow at least relevant to what would based on comp be potential valuations? Devin Stockfish : Yes. What I would say that is we are always looking for ways to optimize and improve our timberland portfolio. That's true really across all regions and all geographies. And so to the extent that we can find opportunities to improve the overall value of our timberland assets and drive better returns that's something that we are always looking at. And so that's work that has been going on, and work that will continue to go on into the future really just around -- trying to optimize and improve the overall timberland's portfolio. Mark Weintraub : Okay, thank you. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : And today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Qinn : Yes, thanks very much. Morning, Devin. Morning, Russell. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Paul Qinn : Hey, I was a little surprised over the drop in Wood Products EBITDA, especially on the lumbar side down $112 million especially given that you've got over 55% of your capacity in the U.S. South and prices there it didn't drop as much as other places. Maybe you can give us some color as what you saw on the West specifically with Doug fir and Whitewood? And then what are you seeing in the recovery because I have definitely seen in Canada, but it seems to be more muted elsewhere over the last couple of weeks? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think if you look at the lumbar business, a helpful comp is Q4 2017 because we had overall similar volumes. And really when you look year-over-year, the vast majority of the drop in EBITDA is related to price. So remember for every $10 per MBS that's about a $11 million of EBITDA. And when you think about particularly in the West as you saw lumbar prices come down pretty quickly, log prices come down at a much slower rate. And so, what that creates is a bit of a noise in the system as the log prices catch up to lumbar prices and you have to chew through some of that higher cost inventory. And so, that's really a big driver of what you saw happened in Q4 2018. If you normalize and you kind of go back to that Q4 log cost of Q4 2017, the profitability would have been similar. Paul Qinn : Okay, then we have seen a pick-up in lumbar prices, what's holding back OSB? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I mean as you know the lumbar market and the OSB from a supply-demand dynamic are just a little different. You'll see lumber come on a come off a little bit more quickly in response to demand signals. OSB is a little bit more lumpy. What we would expect is that over the course of the year, you're seeing some additional OSB capacity coming online and we believe that over the course of 2019 the demand will catch up to that, and will be more or less on balance, but probably come up a little bit more slowly than you're seeing lumber prices come up. Paul Qinn : All right, that's all I have. Thanks a lot, guys. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. Devin Stockfish : All right. I believe that was the last question. So, thank you everyone for joining the call today, and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Weyerhaeuser fourth quarter 2018 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagan, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported a first quarter GAAP loss of $289 million or $0.39 per diluted share on net sales of $1.6 billion. This loss was driven by a previously announced $0.47 noncash special charge related to the transfer of pension assets and liabilities through the purchase of a group annuity contract. Excluding special items, we earned $80 million in the quarter or $0.11 per diluted share, an improvement of 14% compared with the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $365 million, $19 million more than the fourth quarter. I'm proud of our first quarter results as each of our businesses delivered strong operating performance and increased EBITDA despite the slower-than-expected pace of U.S. housing starts in the first quarter. We also continued to demonstrate our commitment to disciplined capital allocation as we repurchased $60 million of our common shares, reduced our pension liabilities by $1.5 billion through the annuity purchase transaction and refinanced our 2019 debt maturity at a very favorable rate. In a moment, I'll dive into our business results. But first, let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity has rebounded slowly from low fourth quarter levels as the spring selling and building seasons have been slow to gain momentum. First quarter housing starts averaged approximately 1.2 million on a seasonally adjusted basis. This is an improvement of 1% compared with the fourth quarter but lower than the first quarter of 2018. Several factors appear to have contributed to the softer first quarter activity. An unusual and lengthy stretch of severe rain, snow and cold across much of North America, particularly in February, deterred prospective buyers at the start of the spring selling season and curtailed construction activity in many regions. Higher inventories of new homes for sale entering 2019 delayed the demand for housing starts as builders sold through completed inventory. And buyers were slow to reenter the housing market following the fourth quarter's financial market volatility. Activity has picked up as the year has progressed. Builders report that buyer traffic and new home sales are improving monthly, and we are seeing signs of momentum as winter weather clears and we move deeper into spring. First quarter new home sales were 15% above fourth quarter levels, and March sales were the highest in nearly 18 months. Western housing starts increased 30% in March compared with February as rain and snow receded. And we are hearing of increased demand for cement and rebar in a number of areas, signs that foundations are being poured. Our customers also tell us that builders continue to adjust product offerings to increase the proportion of affordable product in response to market demand. Near- and long-term economic fundamentals remain supportive of increased building activity. Mortgage rates are approximately 75 basis points below their November peak, and mortgage purchase applications are near 10-year highs. Permit activity remains solid, averaging approximately 1.3 million through the first quarter, and overall economic fundamentals remain positive with increasing real wages, unemployment at 50-year lows and strong job growth in key housing markets. Repair and remodel spending, which comprises about 40% of lumber demand, also remains strong and is forecasted to rise 6% to 7% this year. These favorable signs are balanced however by continued constraints around labor and lot availability. The supply of construction labor remains tight. Although construction activity has some capacity to catch up for delayed first quarter starts, it will be challenging to recover all of that activity this year. As a result, we have tempered our 2019 housing start expectations to be slightly below 1.3 million starts. We continue to expect year-over-year growth in housing, with that growth primarily attributable to increased single-family activity. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 through 6. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings and $193 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased $5 million compared with the fourth quarter as results improved in each of our geographic regions. Western Timberlands EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the fourth quarter. Lower average realizations were more than offset by lower costs, primarily for forestry and roads. We typically do less forestry activity and roadbuilding during the cold winter months. We also deferred some silviculture activity due to unusually severe winter weather. In the Western domestic market, log demand remained moderate through most of the first quarter due to continued low lumber prices. Log availability was adequate early in the quarter but decreased in February and March due to strong storms, which brought several feet of snow and heavy winds to many parts of the Pacific Northwest. Our teams did an excellent job of flexing harvest plans so that we could maintain production and capitalize on pricing, which improved throughout the quarter. I will note that the weather in Southern Oregon was particularly severe, and we lost several days of harvest activity and incurred some storm damage on our property in that area. We don't expect this to have a material impact on us, but we will see some modestly higher logging costs in the second half of this year as we bring the affected wood to market. Moving to the export markets. In China, sales volumes and realizations for our logs declined modestly compared with the fourth quarter in connection with the typical slowdown in construction activity during the Lunar New Year. Log inventories at Chinese ports increased significantly during the Lunar New Year period and remained elevated through the first quarter as demand was slow to pick up coming out of the holiday. Over the last several weeks, however, we have seen log takeaway increase and return to more normalized levels. In Japan, post-and-beam housing starts have increased 3% year-to-date through February and demand for our logs remains steady. Our export log sales volumes to Japan were comparable to the fourth quarter. This was a higher sales volume than we had initially expected and was attributable to the timing of vessels during the quarter. Average sales realizations for our Japanese export logs declined moderately. Overall, first quarter export revenues were lower than the year ago quarter due to lower realizations for our Japan and China logs. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $1 million compared with the fourth quarter. Average realizations for our Southern logs increased approximately 3% as extremely wet weather limited log supply and drove improved realizations for sawlogs and pulpwood across most of the South. Fee harvest volume decreased 5% as higher log sales volumes were offset by seasonally lower stumpage sales. On the export side, Southern log export volumes decreased slightly and average realizations were roughly flat. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA declined due to lower harvest volumes and slightly higher harvest and haul costs. In 2018, we harvested a greater proportion of our annual volume during the first quarter. Northern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $1 million compared with the fourth quarter. Fee harvest volume was comparable and average realizations improved modestly due to mix as we harvested a greater proportion of hardwood-grade logs. Compared with the year ago, EBITDA from Northern Timberlands increased by $1 million due to the timing of harvest volume. Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Charts 7 and 8. Real Estate and ENR contributed $55 million to first quarter earnings and $106 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA was $16 million higher than the fourth quarter and $65 million higher than a year ago. As we indicated during our fourth quarter earnings call, although buyer traffic is typically slower during the winter months, strong real estate activity in the fourth quarter of 2018 allowed us to pursue additional transactions that closed in the first quarter. The number of acres sold in the first quarter increased over 20% compared with the fourth quarter and was up over 75% compared with the year ago. Average price per acre was comparable to the fourth quarter on a generally similar geographic mix. First quarter Real Estate sales included a slightly higher portion of Southern acres and fewer Western and Northern acres. Compared with the year ago quarter, average price per acre increased significantly due to a much smaller proportion of sales for Montana where Timberland prices are regionally lower. Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $69 million to first quarter earnings and $115 million to adjusted EBITDA. Compared with the fourth quarter, earnings and EBITDA increased significantly despite flat to lower pricing for our commodity products. EBITDA for lumber increased $41 million compared with the fourth quarter. This was almost entirely attributable to lower log and manufacturing costs. Lumber prices were flat through most of January and improved moderately in February in anticipation of the spring building season. With building activities slower to materialize, prices stabilized and then eroded slightly toward the end of the quarter. The framing lumber composite price averaged 2% higher for the first quarter compared with the fourth and our average realizations increased 1%. Lumber sales volumes increased 3% in the first quarter. Our log costs decreased substantially in the first quarter as Western and Canadian log costs declined and the benefit of lower fourth quarter log costs was also included in our financial results. Unit manufacturing costs also decreased significantly compared with the fourth quarter as our lumber system achieved the lowest first quarter controllable manufacturing cost per unit that we have ever reported. This comes despite several days of downtime at one of our Oregon lumber mills due to severe snow and wind. First quarter EBITDA includes $3 million of charges for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. Comparing our first quarter results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA decreased significantly due to lower average realizations, partially offset by lower log and manufacturing costs. OSB EBITDA decreased $12 million compared with the fourth quarter due to lower average realizations. OSB pricing entered the first quarter below the fourth quarter average and remained flat at that level. First quarter benchmark North-Central pricing averaged 13% below the fourth quarter, and our average realizations declined $29 per 1,000 square feet or 12%. Sales volumes increased 8% compared with the fourth quarter, and operating rates and manufacturing costs improved as our Grayling mill returned to full production following a press replacement that was completed in late October. Comparing our first quarter results to the year ago quarter, EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 29% decrease in average sales realizations. Engineered wood products EBITDA increased by $21 million compared with the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section products increased 4%, and average realizations for I-joists increased by 1%. Sales volumes for solid section and I-joists products decreased due to sluggish first quarter construction activity, particularly in the West as well as continued efforts by dealers and builders to maintain lower product inventories. Fiber costs declined due to lower cost for logs and oriented strand board web stock, and unit manufacturing costs improved due to higher operating rates. Compared with the year ago quarter, higher average realizations and lower cost for logs and oriented strand board were largely offset by lower sales volumes. Distribution EBITDA increased by $2 million compared with the fourth quarter due to improved product margins and was lower than a year ago due to lower sales volumes. I'd like to now turn to operational excellence. Our businesses are making good progress against our collective 2019 operational excellence target of $80 million to $100 million. During the first quarter, our biggest OpEx benefits in Timberlands came from initiatives related to logging and hauling efficiencies in our Southern operations as well as our continued marketing and bucking for value improvement efforts. In Wood Products, our greatest benefits came from our ongoing initiatives to reduce controllable manufacturing costs for lumber and OSB. Our Real Estate business is also on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning. Key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million to $30 million lower than the first quarter. About half of that is due to seasonality around our forestry and road spending, and the other half relates to the timing of our export shipments. At our Western Timberland operations, we expect second quarter harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. Domestic log inventories are at normal levels, with supply and demand largely balanced as supply returned to the market following first quarter's severe storms. We anticipate our second quarter average domestic sales realizations will be modestly higher than the first quarter average. Forestry and road spending will also increase as we enter the spring and summer months. In Japan, housing starts are expected to remain healthy, driven by strength in the high-end post-and-beam construction market that we serve. We continue to see strong demand for our Japanese export logs and expect average log sales realizations in the second quarter to be similar to the first quarter. Average sales realizations for our Chinese export logs are expected to be lower than the first quarter. Although inventories at Chinese ports are relatively high, we expect them to trend downward over the next couple of months as construction activity and log takeaway have ramped up to more normal levels following the Lunar New Year holiday. We expect our Western export log sales volumes, both Japan and China, will be lower in the second quarter due to the timing of shipments at the end of the first quarter. In the South, we expect second quarter average sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter. Fee harvest volumes should be slightly higher and we expect a greater portion of pulpwood as we shift to more thinning activities in the second quarter. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase, which is typical coming into the spring. In the North, we anticipate second quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly lower than the first quarter as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the first quarter but approximately 30% higher than the second quarter of 2018, driven by favorable Real Estate activity. We expect second quarter land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales to be approximately 60%. Markets remain active and we continue to see strong interest in Real Estate from high-net-worth individuals, recreation and conservation buyers. As a result, the cadence of our Real Estate sales would be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year compared with the usual seasonal pattern. In our Energy and Natural Resources operations, we anticipate that second quarter royalties will be comparable to the first quarter. For the full year 2019, we now expect approximately $270 million of adjusted EBITDA for our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate that land bases as a percentage of Real Estate sales will be between 45% and 55% for the full year 2019. For Wood Products, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the first quarter due to seasonally higher sales volumes and improved operating rates across all product lines. This is before any benefit from improving prices. For lumber, second quarter to date average sales realizations are approximately $15 higher than the first quarter average, and current realizations are approximately $10 higher than the first quarter average. Many of our builder customers who were delayed by adverse weather conditions in the first quarter are eager to resume a normal construction schedule. In areas of the country where wet and wintry weather conditions have receded, we're seeing improved demand. As a reminder, every $10 change in lumber realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. In late March, we started up our newly expanded sawmill in Millport, Alabama. And when ramp-up phase is completed over the next 12 to 18 months, our capacity will increase by 250 million board feet. For oriented strand board, second quarter to date realizations are comparable to the first quarter average, and current realizations are approximately $10 below the first quarter average. As a reminder, every $10 change in OSB realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $51 million compared with the fourth quarter 2018. In the first quarter, we had noncash charges from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO, foreign exchange and share-based compensation. Fourth quarter included income from these items. First quarter pretax special items include a $455 million noncash pension settlement charge and a $20 million legal charge. Excluding the pension settlement charge, our first quarter noncash nonoperating pension benefit cost was lower than the fourth quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $60 million of expense for the full year 2019. Now I'd like to update you on our key financial items, which are summarized on Chart 12. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $259 million. Cash used in operations during the first quarter was $14 million. The first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow due to inventory and other working capital build as well as higher quarterly interest payments. Capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $59 million. We continue to expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $400 million, $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs and $270 million for Wood Products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments. As discussed on our last conference call, during the first quarter, we received $250 million of cash proceeds from the maturity of a note held by a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in early 2000s. Turning to financing activities. We repurchased 2.3 million shares of common stock in the first quarter for a total of $60 million. At the end of the first quarter, we had $440 million remaining on our share repurchase authorization. Moving on to debt, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion of total debt outstanding. And during the quarter, we issued $750 million of 4% notes due in 2029. Subsequently redeemed, the $500 million 7 3/8% notes that were due in October 2019 and incurred a $12 million pretax charge due to the early redemption. This charge for early extinguishment of debt is included in our results as a special item. Excluding that special item, first quarter interest expense was $95 million. We now expect full year 2019 interest expense will be between $370 million and $380 million, excluding special items. Moving on to taxes. For the second quarter and full year 2019, we now expect the effective tax rate will be between 7% and 10%, excluding special items. We expect minimum cash taxes in 2019 due to a $90 million federal income tax refund associated with the $300 million pension contribution that we made in the third quarter of 2018. We expect to receive that refund later this year. Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thank you, Russell. Looking forward, we anticipate modest year-over-year U.S. housing growth and expect that building activity will accelerate as we move into spring and summer with improved weather and continued macroeconomic stability. We remain focused on delivering operational excellence and industry-leading performance to fully capitalize on a wide range of market conditions and drive superior value for our shareholders. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from the line of Mark Wilde with the Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Really nice quarter, much better than we expected. I wondered, Russ, if you could just help us peel the onion a little bit on the quarter-to-quarter gains and in performance in both lumber and EWP. I know you mentioned kind of log costs, but those costs must have been down even more than we would have anticipated. And you also mentioned in EWP, part of it is always big. But if you could just put a little more color on that, that would be helpful. Russell Hagen : Sure. So for lumber, as you mentioned, we did have lower log costs coming out of the fourth quarter so that was very much beneficial coming in the first quarter. And we also had improved operating performance coming into the first quarter. And similarly to EWP, we had a lower cost structure, they ran very well coming into the first quarter, and that really contributed to their overall improved performance. Mark Wilde : And then I wondered, Devin, can you give us any perspective on what you guys see in terms of inventory sitting in the distribution channels right now? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure, Mark. Well, so it's -- I'd say for lumber and OSB, the inventories through the channel are probably a little on the full side. And so I think as we saw the building activity be -- start off the year a little slower than we had expected, you did see inventory levels build up a little bit. Our view is that as we see the construction activity really start picking up, that's going to flush through probably a little bit quicker on the lumber side than the OSB side just because we did see a little bit more supply coming online at the end of 2018 and 2019. On the EWP side, I'd say probably inventory levels are at reasonable levels. And some of the customers may be even keeping a little bit lower inventories than normal. But I'd say on balance in EWP, it's probably about normal for this time of the year. Mark Wilde : Okay. Last thing for me. Just any sense from your perspective on sort of where mills in both the Northwest and up in Canada are sitting relative to cash costs right now, because it looks to me like pretty much everybody must be under water. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So Mark, I can't really comment on what our competitor is doing other than just to note, obviously, we've seen the announcements, as you have, on some of the curtailments and closures in those regions. For us, the way we've been really approaching our business in general is that we're really focused on OpEx and getting our cost structure in place so that we can be cash flow positive or breakeven even under these types of pricing environments. And so that's generally where we sit at this point. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : I guess my first question, Devin, if you could comment -- what's your current estimate of operating rates this year, if you could provide one, for -- across your Wood Products businesses? And also, do you think that, switching gears to the OSB market, it can be in balance this year with your current estimate of housing? And if not, what do you think needs to happen there? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. So on your first question, in lumber, we're -- our operating rates for Q1 were in the low 90s. In OSB, they're in the mid-90s and EOP, they were in the kind of low 80s for operating rates. With respect to OSB, my sense is that it's going to take a little time for us to have the demand catch up with the supply with the new mills coming online and really getting up full. There's probably going to be a little bit more inventory in the system this year until we catch up from a demand perspective. Now that being said, I do think if we see the continued housing construction activity build into the spring and summer season and demand gets back up to where we think it ultimately will be, that should come back into balance over the course of the year and into 2020. George Staphos : Okay. And coming back to EWP again, Mark hit on this as well. I mean we were very impressed with your performance there. I took from your comments, there was nothing one-off in nature. Obviously, had a little bit better pricing realization too. But is there anything in the first quarter performance in EWP that's not repeatable in the second quarter over the course of the year? Devin Stockfish : I think the answer to that is really no. Obviously, we got some benefit across all of Wood Products, including EWP, from lower log and fiber costs. And so we would expect that to continue really into Q2 on some extent. And then the other piece is just improved unit manufacturing costs, and we are hyper-focused on that with our OpEx initiatives. And so not only do we think that, that will carry over, we would expect that to even improve over the course of the year as we continue to focus on operating costs across the system. George Staphos : Okay. My last question and I'll turn it over. Kind of one is more of a confirmation point. I took from your guidance on Timberlands again that you're not seeing anything other than normal seasonal increases in harvest costs and that's part of what is driving the sequential decline 2Q versus 1Q, but I want a confirmation on that. And then there was a legal charge of $20 million in the quarter, if I saw that correctly. Could you remind us what that was around? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Maybe I'll take the first one and then Russell can take the second one. Just in terms of the quarter-over-quarter, really, on the Timberlands segment basis, it's really a couple of things. It's about half of that relates to the ordinary cost increases that you see in Q2. So we build more roads, we have higher forestry expenses, we did defer a little bit of silviculture in Q1 that's going to get pushed to Q2. So that's about half of it. The other half is really just around timing of vessel shipments. And so we had a couple of ships that ordinarily, we are -- going into the quarter, we thought would ship out in Q2. They moved up a little bit into Q1. So that's the other piece. And then the last piece, which is a smaller piece of the puzzle is just, as you know, in the northern business, we go through spring breakup and so you see the volumes come down. And so that's really the driver of Q2 versus Q1. Russell Hagen : And George, on the $15 million after-tax legal charge, that's just for potential settlement of various legal matters. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Devin, on the homebuilding front, you talked about builders adjusting their offerings to bring some more affordable product to market. And I'm just wondering, should we interpret that as a move from larger formats to smaller formats or single family to multifamily? And I guess as you kind of lower your estimates for full year starts a little bit, is there also potentially kind of a change in mix that could impact kind of aggregate demand for wood products? Devin Stockfish : Yes. And so really, when we're talking about the more affordable price points, that's really in the single-family space, so it's not a comment on mix from single to multis. I think it's really -- it's a host -- a whole host of things, Anthony. It's maybe smaller footprints in some geographies, it's different amenity packages, all the things that they can do to really meet that lower price point where a lot of the demand is. And so we are seeing some of that. You saw some of that, I think, on our earnings calls for various homebuilders. And certainly, that's what we're hearing out in the market. In terms of overall wood demand, my view is it's much better for us to the extent that the builders can make more houses, even if they're a little bit smaller. On aggregate, that's better for wood demand. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then earlier this month, WTO issued a ruling on U.S.-Canada lumber dispute that was maybe a little mixed for U.S. producers. I was wondering if you could just give your take on it. And then just today the trade issue, we're kind of hearing rumblings of maybe potentially a resolution to the U.S.-China trade dispute. Is that something that your customers are anticipating or potentially buying -- impacting buying behavior or any kind of thoughts on U.S.-China trade as well? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure. With respect to the WTO decision, I think from a U.S. perspective, it was moderately positive. But again, just kind of stepping back, our view now is really that this is something that's going to play through the various channels of appeals through WTO and NAFTA over a course of several years. I think we're still early in that process. But at some point, I assume that we will come to some sort of agreement, which we believe should be quota-based. But I think we're still a ways off from that. In terms of the China agreement, obviously, there's a delegation going over to China early in May. We're optimistic that they're going to make continued progress there. I think on balance, the feeling with our customers is probably more optimistic and positive than it was a few months ago. But it's really hard to tell exactly how those talks are coming along. We're optimistic that it will get resolved at some point. And I think importantly, we're really well positioned if and when those tariffs do come off to reaccelerate the growth out of our Southern business. And I think in the West, it's really not had a big impact on us out of our Western export business, which is the 5% tariff. But that being said, we certainly would like to see that go away so we can get back to a completely normalized environment. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Brian Maguire : Thanks for all the comments on the 2Q outlook. I know you guys don't give guidance, but just putting it all together, does it sort of seem like in the ballpark of sort of being in line with the 1Q number, sort of flat quarter-over-quarter, assuming current Wood Product prices? Russell Hagen : I mean you're right. We don't give specific guidance, but I think if you kind of add it up, absent change in pricing, we give you some relative parameters around what the pricing impact would be looking quarter-over-quarter. You can probably piece it all together and then factor in the pricing. Devin Stockfish : Yes. And I would just add to that. From a Q2 perspective -- and you're talking about Wood Products specifically, Brian? Brian Maguire : No. I was hoping the company as a whole. Devin Stockfish : Well, so just a couple of additional comments there. On a Q2 versus Q1 basis, we do think that Wood Products is going to be higher EBITDA. And that's -- even putting pricing aside, it's largely a reflection on continued improved operating rates and continued focus on costs. And so that in and of itself, we think, is going to be the driver. Pricing will just be an upside to that. And then again, the other piece just on Timberlands, as we said, that's going to be down versus Q1, but that's primarily just a reflection on timing and some seasonal cost. Brian Maguire : Okay. Got it. And then it was good to see the Southern log price realizations tick up a little bit in the quarter, and I guess the outlook for 2Q implies that we stay at similar levels. Just wondering if you could parse out how much of that is maybe due to weather impacts or mix versus the long-awaited sort of tightness in that market that we've been predicting for many years? Devin Stockfish : Yes. And so we absolutely saw a healthy increase in pricing. And I'll tell you, I think the majority of that is due to weather. We had a really, really wet Q1 and that kept inventory levels low. It kept supply levels moderated, and so that was really reflected in the pricing that you saw. That being said, I do think we are starting to see some of those pockets that we've been talking about for years really start the tension where we have the new capacity coming online and running full. And certainly, we've seen that in areas of Central Mississippi, some areas in Arkansas, a few geographies in Alabama and most recently in Northern Louisiana. And so as we said, when that new mill capacity comes online and gets up and running full in that geography, that micro region, we are seeing some pricing tension. So on balance, I think the price increase was largely driven by weather, but we are starting to see the early signs of some tensioning in some of those micro markets. Brian Maguire : Okay. Last one for me. Just thoughts on cash flow this year? I know you give some components like CapEx there, and I think that some of that is maybe discretionary over the long term. But how do you think about this year's free cash flow, ability to fund the dividend, continued share repurchases? Because it does seem like obviously, we're at sort of challenged levels of profitability and for sure, the Wood Products business, if not, Timberlands a little bit. How -- and it does seem like you've got a couple of onetimers in the cash flow this year that may not recur in future years. But how should we kind of be thinking about the dividend and the ability to fund that at these levels? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So let me just start off with a few comments on cash flow and then I'll move to the dividend. As you think about our FAD for 2019, a few things to keep in mind. So first, as Russell alluded to earlier, Q1 is typically our lowest quarter from an operating cash flow perspective, largely because of inventory build, et cetera. That generally will work itself out over the course of the year as it typically does. And so I don't think you should look at Q1 cash flow really and annualize that. That wouldn't be a typical way to do it. The second point that I would make is we are expecting minimal cash taxes this year because of, as Russell mentioned, just the pension transactions that will substantially reduce the cash taxes this year. But the other thing I would say is we're still optimistic that you're going to see some upward pricing pressure on commodity prices. As you see that construction activity really start to take hold, as we get into the spring, I think we're seeing early signs of that now. We do think you're going to see some upward pricing pressure as well. So we're still optimistic at this point in the year that we're going to have a healthy cash flow for the full year. Now that all being said, with respect to the dividend, as we said repeatedly, one of our core priorities around capital allocation is the sustainable dividend that grows over time. And so when we set the dividend at 85% of FAD, we really look at that over a cycle. And so we understand in commodity businesses, in cyclical businesses, sometimes, you're going to be a little bit above that, sometimes you're going to be a little below. And in those instances where we're over 100%, we don't look at that as a cause for panic. We've got levers that we can pull. There are some opportunities around CapEx. As we said, our sustaining maintenance CapEx in Wood Products is around $150 million to $200 million, and so there's some flexibility around that. There's still some things we can do around cost. As you know, we're very focused on OpEx and continuing to take costs out of the system. And then ultimately, we have a lot of liquidity. We have a strong balance sheet and so that gives us some flexibility. And so just with respect to the dividend and cash flow for the year, I think we are going to see some upward pressure on pricing, which will give us a little bit more flexibility there. But we have plenty of tools and levers that we can pull ultimately to make sure that we're continuing to meet our core capital allocation priorities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : First, just following up on the comment about Wood Products maintenance capital can be kind of in the $150 million, $200 million range. How much of the $400 million that you're guiding for this year is in the Wood Products business? Devin Stockfish : $270 million. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And then a second thing that sort of caught my attention was you has mentioned that you had run in the low 90s in Lumber and the mid-90s and OSB during the first quarter, which are pretty good operating rates. And then in the guidance, it says you're expecting to have higher operating rates across all product lines. And I guess in particular, what's striking is you're already in the mid-90s in OSB. And if prices are now $10 lower than they were on average during the first quarter, you're presumably not making much money in OSB at all, and yet you're running potentially higher than in the mid-90s in that business. And so kind of just what's the kind of the philosophy of running in OSB and Lumber relative to market environments? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. So I would just comment, with respect to OSB, we did say that we're expecting to be higher in Q2. That's really a pretty small percentage relative to Q1. We were operating well in OSB, in the mid-90s already in OSB, so not a lot of uptick. The bigger uptick really is around EWP and a little bit Lumber as well. And I guess just with respect to your question around philosophy, a big part of how we look at our strategy is making sure that we have a really low cost structure so that we can continue to make money and drive cash flow regardless of pricing. And so it may make sense for us to run where it may not make sense for others to run. But again, it's a big part of our OpEx program being black at the bottom and are focused on having the right cost structure. Mark Weintraub : And so I guess as a part of that, when you say it makes sense for you to run whereas -- what would be the thought process behind making sense for you whereas for others, it might not? Is that because of your lower cost position or your smaller market position? Devin Stockfish : Having a lower cost structure so that we can continue to run profitably even at lower product pricing. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then one last one, if I could. On EWP, great performance in the first quarter, considering the environment. What -- are there any price initiatives out there in the market? And I guess it was notable that prices were up in an environment where pricing for most of the other commodities were low. Or any more color on how that tends to play out would be much appreciated. Devin Stockfish : Yes. And what I would say on the pricing is a big piece of that was -- well, that was primarily mix. Just in context of pricing generally, there is a little bit of pricing headwind out in the market right now. But as we look forward, we're anticipating holding onto the price increases that we put into place and captured last year. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : First one just on OSB pricing. Can you maybe just expand on your comments in response to George's question? Do you think we are finding a bottom now in terms of OSB pricing? Or just given some of the recent deterioration, could there be some further downside from your vantage point? Devin Stockfish : I'd be hard-pressed to really try to call a bottom. What I would say is that as we see the construction activity pick up, we would anticipate that would start to drive some of the inventories down. And as we get further into the year, as long as you see that construction activity hold up, align -- along the lines of what we think is going to happen, we do think ultimately, you'll start seeing some upward pricing pressure on OSB. That's just a little bit tougher to call because that supply comes on and off in a more lumpy fashion maybe than Lumber does. And so we think directionally, ultimately, it's going to go up, but the timing is always a challenge. Collin Mings : Okay. All right. Fair enough. Appreciate the color there. And then just picking back up on the outlook for cash flow. Just recognizing -- you did already push your Real Estate EBITDA guidance marginally higher this quarter. Just how are you thinking about potentially ratcheting up land sales further in the current environment? And again, in the prepared remarks, pretty upbeat about kind of the demand you're seeing out there. Does it in particular make sense to maybe generate some additional cash for share repurchases just given where the stock trades relative to NAV? Russell Hagen : So Collin, this is Russell. Again, as far as our Real Estate outlook, we increased it from $260 million to $270 million for the Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We did come out of a strong first quarter, which is going to benefit again the second quarter. But we think the $270 million number is the right number to really capture the premium to timber value which is the key focus for that business. So I wouldn't anticipate we would increase that above our guidance to affect any other capital allocation priorities. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Mark Connelly : How are you thinking about freight if -- and I know it's not easy to separate from weather right now. But do you think freight costs for your system are going to moderate later this year? Devin Stockfish : Yes. What I would say is we've seen freight costs generally moderate in Q1 relative to last year. And part of that obviously is fuel prices. But I don't think, at this point, we're really anticipating a meaningful increase in freight nor are we expecting a meaningful decrease. And so it would more or less on par with kind of how we've been tracking in Q1 is how we're currently seeing it. Mark Connelly : Okay, that's helpful. And if we could just go back to Japan for a second. If I look at Japan revenues over time, they have been slipping for a few years. But do you think we're reaching a bottom there or is there a structural reason why that may continue to slip? And certainly, as a percentage of your total, it slipped but that's really high-value stuff. So I'm just curious, do you think we're bottoming out? Devin Stockfish : What I would say about Japan is from a demand perspective, we have seen that remain pretty consistent over time, and the demand for our high-quality Japan logs remains solid now. I think what you're alluding to really is maybe a little bit more about realizations. And so as we think about Japan log pricing, there are really a couple of things to look at. So there is the correlation to the domestic market here in the West. And so you'll typically see that trade in a correlated fashion to what domestic pricing looks like in the Pacific Northwest. And then the other piece is just related to the dynamic in the Japan market. And so there is a competing product coming over from Europe that the Doug fir product has to compete against. And so those things all play together to come up ultimately with what Japan pricing looks like, and there's a foreign exchange piece to that as well. But again, just going back to the original comment, the demand has remained solid and we would anticipate that to continue. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Clyde Dillon : First question, just to make sure I heard you say -- heard you right. Did you say the industry OSB operating rate was mid-80s? Did I hear you say that or did I misunderstand you? Devin Stockfish : No. No. We just commented on our operating rate, which was in the mid-90s. Clyde Dillon : Mid-90s. So low 80s was lumped -- was EWP, is that right? Devin Stockfish : That was EWP, correct. Clyde Dillon : And you didn't give us like a guide on the Real Estate segment. Did you -- specifically like you mentioned in timber harvest, it would be down $25 million to $30 million from the first quarter. Did you give a similar guide for the Real Estate segment? Russell Hagen : No, we gave a guide for the total Real Estate and ENR segment at $270 million for the year. Clyde Dillon : Okay. For the full year. Okay. That's helpful. And let me ask you this. One area of obviously of weakness in the Timberland segment has been in the export log area just in general, and I think the delta there is largely China. Any signs that their absence or relatively low levels of activity have started to turn around yet? Or is it just too early to know? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Here would be how I would phrase that. The Chinese demand that we've seen over the last 12 months really hasn't gone down that much. And I'm talking about specifically from the West Coast. Obviously, the South with the tariffs, the southern yellow pine demand has changed a little bit. But from the West Coast, we haven't seen the demand really fall off. Now maybe what you're referring to is during the Lunar New Year period, we do see a reduction in construction activity. And so you'll see a little bit weaker demand during that period and you'll see the inventory levels at the Chinese ports tick up a bit, and that certainly happened. But in terms of the China demand, we haven't seen a meaningful dropoff. And in fact, I do believe that construction activity in China recently has started to pick back up. That's what we're hearing from our folks on the ground. And so we would expect, as we get deeper into the spring and summer in China, you're going to see the continued activity and mostly continued good demand for our China logs. Clyde Dillon : Got you. And then the Southern log prices seem to be -- hold up pretty well, even though we're under the impression that, from the hurricane activity, it might have created a lot of salvage competition. Has that kind of worked its course? Or did it work itself out earlier than, I guess, the first quarter? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think one of the things that may be mitigated to some of that during Q1 was just because it was so rainy across the system. Anybody that could move wood have the opportunity. And so I just -- I think the overall weather dynamics probably mitigated some of that impact. But even now across the system in the South, I would say inventory levels are moderate to low. And so from a pricing perspective, we would expect pricing to be comparable to Q1 as we think about Q2. With respect to the salvage, we don't have a whole out of ownership in that area so really didn't impact us meaningfully anyhow nor do we expect it to. But I think the fact that just because the mill inventories are low, that probably mitigated some of the downward pricing pressure in those areas. Clyde Dillon : Got you. And then last question just in terms of the operating philosophy. Certainly, in a fragmented market like lumber, it makes all the sense in the world what you guys do. But when you look at the last numbers I saw in OSB, you have basically a market construct that's similar, for lack of a better comparison, to the U.S. containerboard market where, without telling us anything, we can tell those producers are deciding not to hand inventory to their customers with which to resist future price rises until they work those inventories down. I mean could you argue that maybe in OSB, given the consolidated structure, that maybe it makes more sense to maybe operate similarly as opposed to shipping a lot at these very low prices, which again if I were a builder, that's great. That just means that when -- it's just going to take longer for markets to tighten up and longer for you guys to make money. I didn't know if you had any thoughts about that. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I really can't comment on what other folks in the industry are doing in terms of production. The way we look at it really is just we produce what we can sell at a profit. And so really, our focus is just on running our mills at a level that we think we can remain profitable and move our inventory. And so the other producers obviously will make their decisions, I think, similarly, but we really can't. We don't have visibility into that. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Steven Chercover : So my first question was kind of a different spin on the whole freight issue. In 2017 and '18, I think some of the difficulties on the railroads contributed to the strength of lumber, at least the sense of scarcity. And I'm wondering this year, with lumber being weak, is that partly a function of improved efficiency on the rail network? Devin Stockfish : No. I don't think so. I mean I think without question, in 2018, that was the case. The challenges with rail particularly out of Canada created a little bit of an imbalance, particularly in the first half of the year. And when that unwound, that was part of the driver for while you saw lumber prices slide so dramatically. There were some challenges this year from a rail perspective. And so it's not as though everything went perfectly smoothly this year. But I do think the pricing environment kept people from building inventories to the same levels that perhaps they did last year. And so I don't think you're going to see the rail and transportation issues have near the effect this year that they did last year. Steven Chercover : Okay. And then two other short ones. Were there any start-up costs associated with the ramp of your new sawmill in the South? Russell Hagen : No, we don't have any specific start-up costs. I mean, we're clearly going to build that ramp-up over the next 18 months but, no specific charges related to that. Steven Chercover : Okay. So I guess it'll -- the cost structure will come down. And the third one... Russell Hagen : That's correct. Steven Chercover : And the third one is with respect to just the commentary on running the mills for profitability. Is there any view that maybe the proper metric should be earning the cost of capital as opposed to generating a cash contribution or a modest profit? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Of course, over time, I mean, we're in business to earn in excess of our cost of capital. Now we don't look at that necessarily on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We look at that over a longer period. But without question, that's certainly our intent is to make sure that we're operating to earn returns in excess of our cost to capital, no question about that. Operator : And today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Very strong results and I think your offering rates in Wood Products are going to be the envy of the industry. But I thought I'd try to get some color on just the major CapEx projects that you're doing in 2019, that $400 million spend. Where are you spending it in Wood Products and Timber? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So remember, $120 million of that is on the Timberlands side and that's primarily reforestation. And so just in terms of the Wood Products side, that's about $270 million. And I'd say you still have some of that, that's coming on finishing up the Millport. And then beyond that, it's really just -- it's a mix of various projects across the system. So it could be CDKs, could be optimization in mills going after bottlenecks. So there's nothing that I could specifically point you to that's of the magnitude of Millport or a Dierks or Grayling. It's really a lot of projects across the system really going after improving our reliability and lowering our cost of manufacturing. Paul Quinn : Okay. So no major projects in '19. Do you have any major projects in '20? Devin Stockfish : We're still working through that frankly, so I don't know that we're necessarily ready to comment on specifics. But as we get into the back half of the year, early part of next year, we'll provide more guidance on that. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just lastly, you mentioned a potential agreement with -- between the U.S. and China. Just wondering how material that would be to Weyerhaeuser? Devin Stockfish : I think it's directionally positive for us. But what I would say is if you think about our China business generally in the West, which is the much bigger piece from an earnings perspective, we haven't really seen a material impact other than some initial noise once the tariffs were put in place back last summer. So I think it would have a moderately positive impact to the West, maybe a few million. I think the bigger opportunity over time, although it's not a big earnings impact now, is the opportunity to grow the Southern export business. And so that business is not a meaningful percentage of our harvest in the South right now, but we had some good momentum going last year on building that program before the tariffs came into place. We've continued to have conversations with our customers in China, and we think there's a good opportunity for us there. But that's something that would grow over time, not meaningful probably in the very near term. It's more of a midterm opportunity from a magnitude perspective. All right. Terrific. Well, I think that was our last question. So thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser Company. Have a good day.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] I will now turn the call over to Ms. Beth Baum, Senior Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Dennis. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. And our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser has reported second-quarter net earnings of $128 million or $0.17 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a small benefit from special items, we earned $123 million or $0.16 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $343 million. I'm extremely proud of our team as each of our businesses delivered strong operating performance despite various market and weather related challenges throughout the quarter. In a moment I'll dive into our business results, but first let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. Outside of the Pacific Northwest, the second quarter was extremely wet. Record setting precipitation constrained building activity in key areas across the country. Housing starts in most regions, increased modestly quarter-over-quarter, despite the unusual weather and second quarter, housing starts totaled $126 million on a seasonally adjusted basis compared with $1.2 million in the first quarter. However, housing starts in the south, which account for roughly half of U.S. homebuilding activity, declined on a seasonally adjusted basis as build our struggle to navigate flooding in near historic levels of rainfall. In addition to the weather related challenges during the first half of 2019, the industry continues to face many of the same supply side constraints that have been headwinds for housing over the last several years, namely affordability, regulatory burdens and labor and lot availability. While these constraints continue to affect the housing market, we believe the fundamentals support modest growth for 2019. In particular, mortgage applications for purchase are up over 6% in the first half of 2019 versus the same period in 2018. New home sales are up 2% year-to-date, builder sentiment remains strong, economic data remains positive with increasing real wages, unemployment below 4% and consumer confidence near 15 year highs. And affordability has improved as mortgage rates have declined. Our builder customers are optimistic that they will be able to return to a more normal pace of building activity in the third quarter and they continue to hope for catch up activity in the fourth quarter, weather permitting. We also expect builders will continue to adjust product offerings as they seek to meet solid and growing underlying demand for affordable housing. Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, Charts 4 through 6. Timberlands contributed $102 million the second-quarter earnings and $175 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $8 million compared with the first quarter due to additional forestry and road building activity, which typically increases during the drier months. Demand for Western domestic logs softened slightly at some lumber mills reduced hours in response to continued low lumber prices. Logging conditions improved significantly, compared with the first quarter, resulting in good log availability across the Northwest markets. Although pricing trended modestly lower as the quarter progressed, our second quarter domestic log pricing was comparable to the first quarter average. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, post and beam housing starts are up almost 2% year-to-date and demand for our logs remained steady. Average sales realizations for our Japanese export logs were comparable to the first quarter. Second quarter log sales volumes to Japan were stronger than we had originally expected and were down only slightly compared with the prior quarter. In China, overall log inventories at Chinese ports decreased 11% during the second quarter to 4.1 million cubic meters. However, the inventory trend varied by species. Inventories of North American hemlock and Douglas fir logs decreased by 44% but inventories of Radiata pine continue to build in the quarter. At the end of June, Radiata radio represented approximately 73% of the ports inventory volumes compared with 60% at the end of March. The oversupply of Radiata pine has had only a modest effect on demand and pricing for our logs as the Douglas fir and hemlock that we export generally serve different end-markets than Radiata. Second quarter realizations for our China export logs were slightly lower than the first quarter. Log sales volumes decreased, but this was primarily due to the timing of vessel sailings. Overall, second quarter log export revenues were lower than the year ago quarter, due to lower realizations for our Japan and China logs and lower sales volumes to China due to timing of shipments. For Western Timberlands as a whole, EBITDA is significantly lower than a year ago due to the lower prices for domestic and export logs. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the first quarter due to lower fee harvest volumes. Extremely wet weather created challenging logging conditions during the second quarter our fee harvest volume decreased only slightly, as our scale operability and supply chain infrastructure enabled us to largely maintained our planned harvest volume through the record rainfall. Log availability was tight across Southern markets particularly in the Mid-South resulting in low mill inventories and continued solid pricing. Average realizations for our Southern saw logs were flat with the first quarter and realization for our fiber logs increased slightly. On the export side, Southern log export volumes and realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA increased slightly due to higher average log sales realizations, partially offset by lower harvest volumes and slightly higher harvest in whole cost due to the wet weather. Northern Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $6 million compared with the first quarter. Fee harvest volumes declined seasonally as spring breakup limited activity across most of our Northern operations and average realizations improved as our harvest mix shifted seasonally to a higher proportion of hardwood sawlogs. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA from Northern Timberlands decreased slightly due to lower harvest volumes. Real estate, energy and natural resources, Chart 7 and 8. Real estate and ENR contributed $35 million to second quarter earnings and $71 million to adjusted EBITDA. So second quarter EBITDA was $35 million lower than the first quarter by $24 million higher than a year ago. As we previously indicated, due to strong activity at the end of 2018, our 2019 real estate activity is heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Interest from recreational and high net worth buyers remained solid in the second quarter. We also closed a large acreage transaction in Montana, which accounted for approximately half of the acres sold. As a result, the number of acres sold in the second quarter increased 21% compared with the first quarter and there was nearly three times higher than a year ago. Average price per acre decreased significantly compared with the first quarter and the year-ago quarter, due to the large proportion of acres sold in Montana, where Timberland prices are regionally lower. In energy and natural resources, EBITDA increased slightly compared with the first quarter due to a small seasonal increase in construction materials volumes. Compared with the year ago quarter, ENR EBITDA increased due to higher volumes and pricing for construction materials and hard minerals. Wood Products, Charts 9 and 10. Wood Products contributed $81 million to second quarter earnings and $128 million to adjusted EBITDA. Compared with the first quarter, earnings and EBITDA increased despite lower average pricing for our commodity products. EBITDA for lumber decreased $3 million, as slightly lower lumber realizations and higher log costs were mostly offset by a seasonal increase in sales volumes. Lumber pricing trended unevenly throughout the quarter, holding flat through April, declining in May as continued wet weather and limited customer purchasing and improving in June with the announcement of curtailments in mill closures in British Columbia. On average, the framing lumber composite price decreased 3% in the second quarter compared with the first and our average realizations decreased by 1%. Lumber sales volumes increased 12% compared with the first quarter while production was up 4%. Our mills had another excellent quarter operationally. Unit manufacturing costs decreased slightly compared with the first quarter and our lumber system achieve the lowest controllable manufacturing cost per unit it is ever recorded. This is a strong indication that our OpEx efforts are yielding meaningful results. Our Timberlands and Wood Products teams also worked exceptionally well together to keep our mill supplied with logs in very challenging harvest conditions. Despite record levels of precipitation across the U.S. South and Alberta, we experienced only minor out of log downtime at one mill in our system. Comparing second quarter results with the year ago quarter, lumber EBITDA decreased significantly due to lower average sales realizations, partially offset by lower log and manufacturing cost. EBITDA for the second quarter of 2019 includes a charge of $5 million for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. OSB EBITDA decreased $11 million compared with the first quarter. This is almost entirely attributable to lower average realizations. The second quarter pricing trajectory for OSB mirror that of lumber. Benchmark North Central pricing averaged 12% below the first quarter and our average realizations declined 4%. Our sales and production volumes were comparable to the first quarter, slightly lower than a year ago as we took a bit more downtime than originally forecasted. Comparing our second quarter results to the year ago quarter, EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 42% decrease in average sales realizations and slightly lower sales volumes. Engineered Wood Products EBITDA increased by $17 million compared with the first quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section products were flat and average realizations for I-Joists decreased by 3%, primarily due to seasonal mix. Sales volumes increased by 17% for solid section products and 27% for I-Joists due to seasonally higher building activity. Production volumes for solid section and I-Joists products increased only modestly as we began the customary draw down of our first quarter inventory build. Fiber cost declined due to lower cost for logs in oriented strand board web stock and unit manufacturing costs for MDF improved due to higher operating rates. Compared with the year ago quarter, lower costs for logs in oriented strand board were partially offset by lower sales volumes. Distribution EBITDA increased by $7 compared with the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. EBITDA was slightly lower than a year ago as sales continue to lag last year's levels. I'd like to now turn to operational excellence. Our businesses are making good progress against our collective 2019 operational excellence target of $80 million to $100 million. Year-to-date, our biggest OpEx benefits in Timberlands continue to come from improved logging in hauling efficiencies in our Southern operations and marketing and merchandising improvements across the West and South. In Wood Products, our greatest benefits have come from our ongoing initiatives to reduce controllable manufacturing costs for lumber and OSB and improve log recovery and engineered wood products. Our real estate business is also on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks Devin, and good morning. Key outlook guidance for the third quarter are presented on Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, as is customary, third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be seasonally about we expect a seasonal decrease, similar to what we saw in the third quarter of 2018 when earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately $35 million compared with the second quarter. In our Western Timberland operations, we expect our third quarter harvest volumes will be lower than the second quarter. As is typical for this time of year, our road spending will be slightly higher. Operating conditions in the West had been favorable for the past several months. Domestic log inventories are at healthy levels ahead of fire season. Our domestic log sales realizations trended down late in the second quarter and we anticipate our average realizations for the third quarter will be moderately below in the second quarter average, absent significant fire-related disruptions or restrictions. In Japan, post and beam housing starts are expected to remain steady and we continue to experience solid demand for our export logs. In the third quarter, we expect Japanese export sales volumes will be comparable with the second quarter and average log sales realizations will be slightly lower. Chinese export log sales volumes are expected to increase in the third quarter due to the timing of vessel selling's. We anticipate average sales realizations will decline modestly compared to the second quarter. Although demand remains fairly steady, we do anticipate the recent sharp drop in Radiata pine pricing will create some downward pressure on our prices for a Chinese export logs. In the South, forestry spending will increase as we entered the drier summer months and complete activities that were deferred by wet conditions in the first half of the year. We anticipate higher fee harvest volumes in the third quarter and average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the second quarter. In the North, third quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher in the second quarter as we move past the spring breakup season. Turning to our real estate energy and natural resources segment, as previously discussed the cadence of our real estate sales will be more heavily weighted to the first half of the year in 2019. We continue to see strong interest in higher and better use lands from high net worth individuals and recreational buyers. Markets in the South and the West are particularly strong. We anticipate third quarter adjusted EBITDA for the real estate energy natural resources segment will be approximately $15 million lower than in the second quarter. Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be slightly higher than the second quarter at approximately 60%. We expect third quarter earnings will be $10 million lower than the second quarter. We continue to expect adjusted EBITDA of approximately $270 for the full year of 2019. And we now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 50% and 55% for the full year. For Wood Products we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the second quarter before the benefit from the improvement in sales realizations. We anticipate comparable sales volumes and slightly lower fiber costs offset by slightly higher unit in manufacturing costs, engineered wood products due to scheduled downtime. We expect third quarter realizations for lumber and OSB will be higher than the second quarter average. For both lumber and OSB third quarter to date average sales realizations are comparable with the second quarter average, and current realizations are $5 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis; Chart 11 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The $13 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with the first quarter is primarily attributable to lower variable compensation expense. Second quarter also included a small non-cash foreign exchange gain as compared with a non-cash charge in the first quarter. Each year in the second quarter, we finalized prior year-end estimates for pension plan assets and liabilities. As a result, our second quarter pretax special items include a $6 million benefit from finalization of the non-cash settlement charge related to the transfer of pension assets and liabilities to the purchase of a group annuity contract, which we completed in the first quarter. Excluding pension settlement items, our second quarter non-cash, non-operating pension and post-retirement benefit costs were comparable to the first quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $60 million of expense for the full year 2019. Turning to our key financial items, which are summarized on Chart 12, we ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $212 million. Cash from operations during the second quarter was $396 million, an increase of $410 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $84 million. We expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $380 million. $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs, $250 million for wood products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system upgrades. Moving on to financing we ended the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion of total debt outstanding. We have no debt maturities until 2021. We expect full-year 2019 interest expense will be approximately $375 million excluding special items. I'll wrap up with taxes. In the second quarter, we recorded an income tax benefit as we recalibrated our annual effective tax rate to account for lower than expected wood products pricing. We currently expect our full-year effective tax rate will reflect the benefit of approximately 20% before special items. We expect to pay minimum cash taxes in 2019. Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Great, thank you, Russell. Looking forward, we continue to believe there is a modest growth trajectory for US housing. As the market addresses supply-side constraints it narrows the gap to fundamental demand, but we also remain positioned and prepared to fully capitalize on a range of market conditions. Most importantly, we will continue to focus on what we can control. Optimizing our operations and portfolio, capturing efficiencies, capitalizing on our diversification and scale and delivering operational excellence every single day. We will remain focused on these things so that we will drive industry-leading operational and financial performance and deliver superior value to our shareholders. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Russell, I just wanted to clarify the comments you made on the 3Q outlook for wood products. I think you noted in the release you expect it to be flat sequentially assuming that price realizations are flat, but then I think in the prepared remarks, you also talked about assuming higher lumber and OSB prices. So I just wanted to reconcile those. And then when you talk about prices being flat are you talking about versus the 2Q average or where you ended 2Q, or kind of where we are today? Russell Hagen : Yes, I think really what we're looking at is : one, we're operating very well in our manufacturing operations. The cost structure is clearly as Devin mentioned, really well positioned. So as we look at quarter-over-quarter, and the activity pricing has been pretty flat, but we would expect as we come into later in the summer, as activity increases, that we'll see improving pricing. So that's kind of how we're looking at it. We're really in just really a good position to benefit from that improvement in pricing. Devin Stockfish : Just to follow-up on that, I think directionally, we're expecting a pricing uplift. As we see construction activity continue to pick up in the back half of the year, obviously, there have been a lot of curtailments and mill closure announcements. I think those are still working their way through the system. So directionally, we're expecting an uplift. I think, for us, the challenge is quantifying the timing and the magnitude. Brian Maguire : And just to be clear, if that uplift developed, that would be upside to the flat sort of outlook on earnings? Russell Hagen : Correct. Yes, correct. Brian Maguire : Okay. Just wanted to be clear on that. And then you commented on some of the curtailments that have been announced. Just wondering how long you think it will take for some of that to create some tension on the market? And I guess tied into that question; how would you assess the inventories in the channel and sort of your own inventories? Because obviously there have been a lot of curtailments. So far, it hasn't really moved the needle a lot on pricing. But I'm guessing there's still a little bit of excess inventory in the channels. Devin Stockfish : Yes, so let me speak to channel inventory first and then I'll get back to your second question. I'd say, as a general statement across the industry, I would say that inventory levels are in the normal range. Now there may be a few geographies where it's a little high or a little low. But on balance, I think they're in a normal range. I do think one of the dynamics that you're seeing at present is that buyers are generally not building inventories. They feel pretty confident that they can get supply on an 'as needed' basis to meet their needs. And so I wouldn't say that inventories are in an extreme level by any means. The one I guess caveat to that is on SPF as you alluded to with some of the mill closures and curtailments, some of that volume from those mills that are closing down seems to be finding its way into the market. And I think that's been a little bit of a headwind on SPF here just recently. That being said, there have been a lot of capacity that's coming out of the system for the announced mill closures. There is a little noise in the system as that volume flows through, as you think about mills that are closing down. They're going to have to move their inventories out into the market and sometimes that will put a little pressure on things. But after that it sort of works its way through the system. We would expect that to normalize over time, whether that's two weeks, four weeks, what have you, hard to predict. But certainly, directionally, that's what we would expect to happen. Brian Maguire : And just last one from me. The log costs in Western Canada been elevated I think the pine beetle impact that you guys have been talking about for a number of years. Maybe it's finally starting to work its way from the initial stages of creating an oversupply of logs that maybe now restricting supply a bit. I was wondering if you could talk about that market and how in general that's impacting you? I know you have a little bit of lumber capacity in that area. But net-net, I would think the pressure that it creates on some of the imports to the U.S. would be a benefit for you. But I just wanted to get some perspective from you on that. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So there are really two things going on in British Columbia. One, as you mentioned, is the impact of the pine beetle and forest fire, which has reduced the overall supply of timber. Now, I would say that it's differential by region. And so when you're talking about certain areas in sort of the mid-B.C. range, it's a little bit more heavily impacted. Where we own a mill is a little bit further south. The wood basket that we operate in, hasn't been impacted in a meaningful way by the pine beetle or forest fire. So our fiber supply at our mill is actually in reasonably good shape. The other piece that you've been hearing about from a log cost perspective is the way that they do stumpage rates in British Columbia. And that reset on July 1st. It went up. You've probably heard that talk to you from a number of our competitors that are bigger in that region. And so that's the other impact on log cost, it's just the method that they used to calculate stumpage rates. For us, given the wood basket that we operate in, where fiber is a little bit more available, we have a mill that's a low-cost mill, top quartile cost structure in that region. And so even with the increased stumpage rates, I think we're feeling pretty good about the operations that we have in British Columbia. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : I wondered, Devin, if you could just give us any color on the lumber trade dispute. Is the pain that we're seeing in lumber markets right now, is this sparking anymore interest in discussions or is it still a back burner issue? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I'd say there hasn't been a whole lot of movement on that front. Really, the activity is primarily in the litigation channels with the WTO and NAFTA. And so that process is going to take several years to work its way through. Ultimately, we would hope to come do a resolution that both sides can live with. From our perspective, that would be quota-based. But there hasn't been a whole lot of movement on that front recently. Mark Wilde : And then just to come back to this kind of Canadian log issue, can we get a general sense of what you think at current SPF pricing levels, - many of the mills up there actually cash positive, would you guess? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark, it's really hard for us to speculate on the cost structure for our competitors. Really, what we can speak to is our mill in British Columbia, as I mentioned; we think that's a top quartile mill and we can make money even at these levels. And so you can do the math. If we think we're a top quartile cost structure, that means others aren't, at least not everyone. And so you can probably run your own math. It's hard for us to speculate specifically on their cost structure though. Mark Wilde : Last one from me is just maybe you can provide a little bit of color on what you're seeing in U.S. Timberland markets, both in terms of the volume of properties that are in the market and then what you're seeing in terms of Timberland valuations. Russell Hagen : 2019 has actually been a pretty slow start. We've seen a little more activity as we come in the summer months. But I think. in general, our expectation is that 2019 will be a pretty light year from a timber transaction kind of from the broader market timber transaction base. Typically, we expect around $2 billion to trade. And then every year you see maybe one large transaction sit on top of that. And so the average over the last number of years has been $2 billion to $4 billion. But I would speculate that we'd be hard-pressed to hit $2 billion in 2019, given the amount of transactions that we've seen close and the amount of acres that are on market or we would expect to see come to the market. One thing I'd say is, I think it's just a timing of transactions. I don't think it points to any fundamental change in the timber market. We're still seeing strong values. We're still seeing quality properties trade. good prices, and we're still seeing capital coming into the market seeking out the investments. So I think we're just going to see a slow year this year. Mark Wilde : If can slip one more; is it possible, Devin, for you to just to update people on your thinking around the dividend? I think there has been some concern that you won't cover the dividend this year and I think it would be good to just hear how you hand the board. Our thinking about that, clearly there's a lot of volatility in your cash flows, just because of what's been going on in the wood markets? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure, Mark. Obviously, the first half of the year has been a little soft on pricing across a number of our products. And that impacts cash flow. I would say, just as a starting point, we're expecting prices to pick up over the back half of the year, as I mentioned earlier. But putting that aside, I think we've been clear, returning cash to shareholders through our sustainable dividend is a core capital allocation priority, as is reinvesting in the business and maintaining an appropriate capital structure. And so to the extent that we continue to see a soft pricing environment. we've got leverage, we can pull. There is a little bit we can do around CapEx and further cost control. We're obviously always working on OpEx. But over and above that, we have two key levers to pull. First, as we continue to look to optimize our portfolio, we have opportunities to monetize non-core assets. You've seen us do that in the past with our Uruguay divestiture with what we did on the Twin Creeks transaction. And so that's a lever that we have to pull. Additionally, we have a strong balance sheet and lots of liquidity. And we're prepared to tap some of that liquidity to bridge as needed. I do think it's important to point out, we value our investment grade credit rating and so we'll obviously balance that in consideration of the other levers that we have to pull. But again, we do think you're going to see some uptick in pricing, but we've got levers that we can pull to continue to execute on our capital allocation priorities in the meantime. Operator : Your next question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : I had three questions, one on homebuilding and housing, one on cost and operations and then one on timber pricing. First, some of the research and some of the commentary that we've heard and seen suggest that one of the issues that's been impacting homebuilding is a lot of issues that you had mentioned in terms of land availability, labor availability and so on. But one of the things that's hurting affordability is permitting costs and those are somewhat intractable and being driven by fiscal issues and other issues that kind of feedback and community. So to the extent, that your customers have a view on this, and whether that comes down. That's become a very meaningful price for a new homeowner to get over to build that new home. What are you hearing in the marketplace, and I'll come in with my follow-ons? Devin Stockfish : Yes, there is no question that is one of the things that's driving the affordability issue. We've heard estimates as high as 25% of the costs of some homes being built are due to some of the regulatory burdens that are put on the builders. And so that's a challenge. Now the issue there is that something, typically that you have to battle out at the local level. The one thing that does give me some optimism around that, however, is there is a growing appreciation I think in the public policy space that affordable housing is a real issue that must be resolved. You've heard the governor of California talk about building 2.5 million to 3 million units to just get back up to base level demand. Here in Seattle, where the markets tight. It's a topic of conversation regularly. And I think you're seeing that play out. Now, the challenge in moving local governments is going to be differential depending on where you are in the country. But I do think that has really found its way into the public debate and that gives me some level of optimism that perhaps it's an issue that we can figure out to help with the affordability issue. George Staphos : All right, thanks for thoughts on that Devin we'll keep coming back to that. In terms of costs, I mean you pointed to it from our vantage point you did really, really well this quarter. How did you keep SG&A really well aligned I think it was flat year-on-year, flat in the quarter, especially within wood products? And what is repeatable in terms of your manufacturing cost \u2013 leverage in wood products, looking at in the next couple of quarter. Was there anything aberrational in your ability to keep cost as low as they were in the quarter? Devin Stockfish : No, absolutely not. And you know both from an SG&A perspective and an operating cost within the businesses, whether it's wood products or elsewhere. The reason that we've been on the positive trajectory there is, because we focus on it. We talk about it all the time we're always focused on it. OpEx has become part of the D&A of this organization that's true in the business, it's true with the corporate level. And so I wouldn't say there's anything aberrational in Q2. My expectation is, as we mentioned we're targeting another $80 million to $100 million of improvement in 2019. And we're confident that we're going to get it. George Staphos : And Devin, just the SG&A, we should be able to see or you should be able to maintain that leverage going forward? Devin Stockfish : That's certainly the goal. George Staphos : And the last I didn't hear you, Russell talk about, you just mentioned there was a downtick in Western realizations and logs. If you could comment in terms of what was driving that end of quarter, pressure that would be helpful? Thank you, guys and good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes, let me just comment on the Western system generally, because that's a little context for what's going on with the pricing. I'd say over Q2, the demand was steady in the Western system, but as it's typically the case as the weather improves as you get into the drier months. You see additional volume coming into the market from the non-industrial former wood. And so that's an incremental volume that we see every year. I think the two additional factors at play this year are number one. While, our demand has been steady to China, I do think you've seen a little bit of a drop off within the Western region on shipments to China so some of that volume has stayed domestic. And then the third piece is, there were some ice storms in Southern Oregon over the winter time and you're seeing a lot of the landowners, moving some of that salvage volume to market, which is impacting the dynamic in Southern Oregon and is bleeding up a little bit to mid Oregon as well. And so those three things together, I think have put a little bit of a softness in pricing in the West. That's not a typical of what you typically see this time of year, as you see the former wood come to market. But that's sort of where we are. And I would say that's likely going to continue here until we get into \u2013 the more wet months here in the Pacific Northwest. So as we said, we would anticipate Q3 pricing in the West to be down moderately compared to Q2. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Going back to Mark's question earlier around the dividend and capital allocation, it does not look like you repurchased any shares during the quarter. Can you maybe just update us on how share repurchases fit into your capital allocation priorities? Russell Hagen : Yes, sure Collin, this is Russell. As you know, our first priority is \u2013 returning cash to the shareholders through the sustainable dividend. And then we'll do share repurchases on an opportunistic basis. In the first quarter, we repurchased around $60 million worth of shares and we did not have any repurchase in the second quarter. But it's something that we look at on an ongoing basis as part of our overall capital allocation program, and we'll update you next quarter as to our activity. Collin Mings : Switching gears just as far as China and really appreciate all the detail around log inventories in China across the different species you broke out earlier. But can you maybe just expand on why you think there is such a divergence there and maybe expand on how you think that's going to impact that market going forward? Devin Stockfish : Yes and so the overall rationale for why the radiata pine inventory built up, is a little bit hard for us to project. We obviously don't have Timberlands in New Zealand. What I will say is on an ongoing basis, I do think you've seen a bit of a price correction on radiata pine ordinarily, that would impact the volumes going in, in going into the fall. The other piece I would just say in terms of the overall dynamic in China, typically July and August are warmer months in the Southern China region. And so you ordinarily would see a little bit of a slowdown in take away. And I think in certain end markets, you're also seeing a little bit of lessened economic activity impacting the takeaway at the ports. And so, I think both on the supply and demand side. That's why it has gotten a little bit out of balance and why you've seen some of that price correction. I will say, as we mentioned earlier, though for our business for Hemlock and Douglas fir. We're still seeing good steady demand from our customers. Pricing soften a little bit, but we haven't seen the same kind of price correction that we've seen in some of the other species. Collin Mings : Appreciate all the detail there, and then just shifting to the U.S. South. I mean clearly wet weather has helped support log pricing throughout the first half of the year in the South. Maybe just as we've kind of moved into the summer and starting to roll into 3Q, have you seen any shifts across different wood baskets in terms of log pricing here? Just maybe it maybe the wet weather hasn't been as pronounced in some areas? Devin Stockfish : Yes and I think you're absolutely right. The first half of the year, very wet that really kept log inventories at the mills down kept pricing tension in the market. And so, part of the uplift that you saw was attributable to weather. I will say, as we continue to see the manufacturing capacity come into the region and get up and running in those wood baskets. I think that's another piece that added to the uplift on pricing. Our view is that will be something that will continue on. Now that's local to those specific wood baskets, but I do think where we've seen that that's putting an upward pricing pressure. With respect to going into Q3, I think on balance we're expecting comparable quarter-over-quarter pricing. You're going to see maybe a little bit more pricing pressure in some of those regions that have just recently seen a whole bunch of rain, maybe a little less so in regions that have been dryer. But on balance across the south, we're looking at comparable quarter-over-quarter. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Thanks for all the details much appreciated yeah. Just to get a handle on the second half cash flow I know that you're unwinding. And I think this is going to be largely done by next year the timberland transactions from 15 years ago with the SPEs. Is it fair to say that you're going to probably need to make it what a $300 million payment in the second half and you get that back next year? And therefore should we, unless there's a dramatic recovery and pricing expect that net debt number which I get to about 6.1, you mentioned gross debt 6.3, should rise a little bit into year-end and then hopefully drop off next year? Russell Hagen : Chip. Yes, I think you actually described that pretty well. We entered into a couple of timber transactions back in 2002 and 2004, and set up the financial instruments to monetize those. And the first set of those transactions or vehicles were completed last year. And then we have the second step or a second set coming due this year. In the third quarter, we'll make a payment of $302 million. And then in the first quarter of 2020, we'll receive $362 million. So I would expect at year-end, you're going to see a little bit elevation on that. We'll probably tap a revolver to cover that. But it will be repaid back right in the first quarter. So it'll be very temporary. Chip Dillon : And then just to clarify, on the Timberlands expectation for the third quarter, I think you said down $35 million EBITDA from a year ago, which I think would mean just a very small like $5 million drop from the second quarter, is that the right zip code? Russell Hagen : Chip, it's $35 million quarter-over-quarter. Chip Dillon : So it's from second to third? Russell Hagen : Correct. Similar though to the drop that we had in 2018, second and third quarters. So it's really impact - it's a seasonal effect really around harvest levels and pricing. And then also drill cost\u2026 Chip Dillon : And then last question is, in the OSB business, I know, and I'll be the first to admit, I was a little skeptical about you guys running so hard. But you clearly have made the right choice because of - we see folks falling by the wayside, so to speak. And you're making money, and that's totally up on the up and up. But you did miss and you took some downtime in OSB. And I'm just curious, was that because you have a different approach there or is it because you were approaching cash cost at a couple of facilities? I'm just curious why you chose to take downtime in OSB? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Chip. And that really was just some maintenance downtime that extended a little bit longer than we had anticipated. At a high level, we're obviously always trying to match our supply with profitable demand, generate appropriate returns over time. I think with our products mix, and remember, we're predominantly a value-added OSB product. So we are not as heavy into the commodity sheeting business. And when we combine that with all the work that we've done on our cost structure, it allows us to be cash flow positive where others perhaps may not. And so in Q2, every one of our OSB mills was cash flow positive in every month, unless they had scheduled maintenance downtime. And I'd say, obviously the ultimate goal is not to just to be cash flow positive. The goal is to exceed earnings in excess of your cost-to-capital over time and that's certainly our expectation. But we're continuing to watch that and monitor it closely. Chip Dillon : So said differently, if you needed an extra coat of paint this year or next year, why not extend it a few days when the prices are low and do it this year? Because maybe next year it will be a much better market. Devin Stockfish : Well said. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : A couple of follow-ups. First, you had mentioned that in some of the southern geographies where new lumber capacity has been coming on, you felt a little bit more tension in pricing. Roughly what percentage of your Southern harvest would you say is in those baskets where there is lumber capacity coming on such that it can add some tension to those geographies? Devin Stockfish : Yes, well, rather than give you a specific percentage, I can talk about sort of geographically. When you think about some of the capacity that's been coming into the Arkansas, Oklahoma region, that's an area where we've seen price tensioning. And, in fact, really some of our highest delivered log prices in Q2 were coming out of that region, sort of the Mississippi area where the [Beaver] mill came in, that's an area that's been tensioned. We obviously have a significant land holdings in Mississippi. There are spots throughout the rest of the south, where some of the mill capacity is impacting our harvest. North Carolina is another strong operating region. We've got a mill that's coming up to speed in that region. And so I think, regionally, there are spots where it's helpful. Obviously, there is new mill capacity coming in Alabama. We have some holdings there. That's not a state where we have a significant amount of a holdings. But it's having a little bit of a knock-on effect in some of those regions as well. Mark Weintraub : And are there certain locations where you have land where there is going to be capacity coming on shortly which wasn't covered in the list you gave where hopefully we're going to see that tension pick up? Devin Stockfish : Well, I think those are the regions primarily that we're looking to see the new capacity. If you're asking if there is anything in the rumor mill that's coming on other than what's been publicly announced, I don't think we have anything to add there. Mark Weintraub : And just also a follow-up on the question of the levers that you have to pull. You had mentioned optimizing the portfolio and looking at non-core assets. Is there any color you can provide to us as to what some of the non-core assets might include? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I don't know. They were prepared to really list out specific non-core assets other than just to say. Obviously, as we look across our acreage in our businesses, we're looking to generate good, strong return on our assets. And that's really part and parcel to how we look to optimize our portfolio and to the extent that we have assets that we don't feel are generating the right return profile, that would be something that we would look at. And so I guess just directionally, we believe there are probably some non-core assets within the portfolio that we could monetize if and when we need to. Mark Weintraub : And then lastly, trying to make sure I understand. So on the tax rate, so for the full year, as I understand it, you expect that to be a 20% benefit; is that correct? And I also believe that you said that from a cash perspective, it basically would - maybe if you could just restate what you would expect, if anything on the cash side? Russell Hagen : So that's correct. We expect a 20% benefit for the full year. And that's really just re-calibrating our tax provision to factor in the lower wood products pricing. So, as far as cash taxes, we'll pay minimal cash taxes. We have some refunds associated with the pension work that we did last year. And so we would expect to see minimal cash taxes in 2019. Mark Weintraub : So on a net basis, minimal cash taxes paid or were the refunds supplemental to that, so that on a net basis you have cash coming in from taxes? Russell Hagen : Yes. No, on a net basis, it's minimal cash taxes. And then we do have, as we announced, I think in the prior quarter, we do have an outstanding refund that we've put in with the IRS. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Russell, you spoke earlier about the slow timber transaction market. Has your view of the attractiveness of values in that market changed much, or is there just not enough out there to make you want to be more involved? Russell Hagen : Mark, we really don't have a changed view. The transactions that we are seeing close, are strong values. We're just seeing a slow market right now. And I really don't have an answer as to why we don't see more volume on the market. Just in context, there's about 120 million acres of investable timberlands in the United States. And so as we've seen in the past, those acres are going to trade hands over time, and we would expect that continue into the future. So I just think we're in a slow, slow part of time as it relates to timber transactions, but we really haven't seen any change in value. They remain strong. Mark Connelly : And then just one quick question. Devin, on the South; how much is the wet weather and the wet soil in the South, affecting your current harvesting? And when do you think we get back to normal, if there's any such thing as normal weather anymore? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, in the second quarter, there is no question, it was difficult logging conditions. And we did lose some volume. It was only slight for us. And so, down just a few million dollars in terms of the actual dollar impact to us. But there is no question, logging conditions are very difficult when you have that amount of rain. What I would say is, you know it doesn't typically take all that long for the woods to dry out this time of year. And so we did see a good rain storm coming through in Arkansas, we saw a little bit in Louisiana. Most of the other regions have dried out for the most part. So, I think by and large, you're probably seeing relatively normal logging \u2013 activity across the south at this point. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead. Steven Chercover : So just to begin with respect to your black at the bottom initiative within wood products, is this what black at the bottom, looks like. And of your 100 sorry, 80 million to 100 million OpEx targets how much more might trickle into the wood products bucket? Devin Stockfish : Yes, with respect to the OpEx piece. So of the 80 to 100 or 40 to 50 of that is in our wood products business. And what I would say is, by the end of this year will be essentially there on back at the bottom, outside of maybe one or two mills. But I think certainly we're \u2013 by all intents and purposes, we're going to be there by the end of the year. In terms of what black at the bottom, looks like it certainly is not a great pricing environment. I wouldn't call this what I would see as the bottom. And so, we're certainly planning the black at the bottom initiative for pricing south of this. Steven Chercover : And so with respect to your fleet, then it's effectively about as modern as you can get until there is a new generation of technology that you could invest in and deploy across the asset base? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I actually wouldn't say that at all. I mean it's a range we have certain mills in our systems Dierks and millport, which are clearly best-in-class technology. But we have plenty of other mills in our system that are a bit more aged and we're slowly building up that technology and that's part of our capital expenditure plan in our program we have roadmaps at each mill. So I wouldn't say that we're anywhere near having best-in-class technology across our entire wood product portfolio. Steven Chercover : And then switching gears a bit, and keeping in mind the statement, the timber values remain strong. Would it be fair to say that in this environment, you have more sellers than buyers and would you have the financial flexibility to transact if an attractive asset came to market? Russell Hagen : Yes, Steve, this is Russell. Yeah, we're obviously in the market we have timber operations in every major wood basket in the United States. So, we see everything that comes to the market. I would say that if there is an opportunity to acquire Timberlands that created shareholder value and fit within our portfolio. And we could demonstrate that we could capture the synergies from that that's clearly something that we would look at. I mean, our long-term view is to build the most valuable timber portfolio. So that would add to that overall strategy. As far as how we're looking this on the buyer sell side. As Devin mentioned, we're constantly looking at our portfolio to optimize it to make sure that we are the rightful owner of every asset in every market. And in doing so we may identify areas or properties that don't fit on the long-term basis, but again that's just an ongoing process that we work through every day. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn : I just had a couple of easy questions on the wood product side, one surprise to me was EWP and the outperformance there and it doesn't seem to be price related at all. I guess there is a little bit of tailwind on cost but real big volume pick up. And noting that business is really into new home construction just trying to understand, we didn't see a lot of big pickup in new home construction in the first half. So why was that segment so strong? Devin Stockfish : Yes well, that's a great point I'd just say I'm incredibly proud of the work that our EWP team is doing. Really there are a couple of things there it's first and foremost, our manufacturing team is doing a great job managing costs, running our mills efficiently, and that's a great starting point. We've got terrific products in our EWP business and our sales and marketing team does an excellent job of servicing customers and that's a good recipe for success regardless of market conditions. And so, we were able to move profitable volume across our portfolio of products in the quarter and I think that's really what drove the results. Paul Quinn : And then, just you did a good job at outlining sort of BC log cost, you know you\u2019ve got a couple mills in Alberta what are you seeing there, log cost wise and any type of inflation you're seeing as well? Devin Stockfish : Not really any sort of meaningful appreciation of log costs in Alberta those remaining reasonable. Again, it's all wood basket dependent in one respect and we have good fiber availability near the mills that we're running in Alberta. And so they don't have the same stumpage model in Alberta as they do in BC so didn't seem that that same uptick in July that you saw in the British Columbia region. So log costs are pretty much comparable. Operator : And today's final question will come from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : You've spoken about very wet weather depressing homebuilder demand throughout the first half of the year. I guess when you look at July, are you seeing or can you quantify any kind of demand-pull or reacceleration of job site activity? And then just generally when you have this kind of prolonged poor weather do these projects just get pushed later into the season or is there some portion that's just sort of loss for the year? Devin Stockfish : Yes with respect to July from what we're seeing with our customers. There seems to be steady demand and steady pull-through. And so we still anticipate the construction activity will continue to build momentum and we haven't seen anything that would lead us to a different conclusion in July. With respect to the projects that were delayed in the first half due to weather. I think there is a general optimism among our customers and the homebuilders that they're going to make some of that up now. Realistically, there is a limit on how much of that they're going to be able to make up this year, primarily because of labor availability. I think if people can get the folks to actually go out and do the building, they're going to make up a pretty fair amount, but I think has been much discussed that remains a challenge throughout the industry. So they will make up some, I doubt they will make up all but we would anticipate as I said, a pickup in activity to see when we get to the end of the year some moderate level of growth year-over-year. Anthony Pettinari : And then just a quick question on Southern log obviously, there is still a 25% tariff in China and you discussed the weakness in radiata pine and some of the underlying weakness in China. With all that said, are you still shipping Southern Yellow Pine to China, if you can quantify that? And then just while you're at India obviously a smaller market, but one that had been growing pretty quickly, just wondering if there's anything you kind of add-on, on India as well? Devin Stockfish : With respect to China Southern Yellow Pine at a 25% tariff that's a pretty steep headwind. And so we're still shipping to China at a relatively low level really the amount that we need just to keep the supply chain open. We've got a few really good customers in China for Southern Yellow Pine and they're using that still. And so we're still getting a bit of a takeaway on the Southern Yellow Pine but certainly at a much-reduced rate than we had been on a trajectory even a year ago. With respect to India, we have been shipping into that market sort of off and on over the last 18 months. One of the things that we saw when they put the tariffs on Southern Yellow Pine that caused some market disruptions. Some of the volume that was headed for China ended up in India. And so it was a little choppy, but I think that's normalized a bit and so I think that will be an interesting market for us, still very small, but an opportunity to grow over time. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : All right terrific. All right well, I think that was our final question, so thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining the Weyerhaeuser second quarter 2019 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participant lines are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. I would now like to hand the conference over to Ms. Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Beth Baum : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statement in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call, this morning, are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter net earnings of $99 million or $0.13 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a net benefit to $40 million from special items, we earned $59 million or $0.08 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $308 million. Our businesses continued to deliver strong operating performance despite challenging market conditions. And in a moment, I'll dive into our business results. But, first, let me set the stage with some brief comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued to improve in the third quarter, led by stronger activity in the important single-family segment. Single-family permits and starts have now increased for five months in succession. Additionally, seasonally adjusted single-family starts exceeded 900,000 units in back-to-back months in August and September, which we haven't seen since 2007. Total U.S. housing starts have also strengthened totaling 1.28 million in the third quarter compared with 1.26 million in the second quarter and 1.21 million in the first. As we look forward, many indicators point to continued improvement in housing activity. Wage growth remained solid and the unemployment rate is at a 50-year low. Mortgage rates are hovering near 3.5% significantly lower than late 2018. Consumer confidence surveys indicate a positive view of current and future conditions. Homebuilder sentiment has increased for four straight months and sits at the highest level since February 2018. And builders continue to ship more product to serve the significant demand for affordable housing. That said, several supply side headwinds for housing remain. Builders continue to face a series of challenges including labor and lot availability and regulatory burdens as they seek to bring affordable housing to market. Additionally there is a degree of uncertainty regarding the outlook for U.S. economic growth that could impact buyer sentiment. While these challenges will continue to affect the housing market, we believe that the supported fundamentals outweigh the headwinds. Entering the fourth quarter, our builder customers tell us their demand continues to improve and they intend to maintain strong building activity until winter weather no longer permits. Going into next year, we continue to anticipate increasing momentum in the single-family housing market and a modest growth trajectory for U.S. housing. Turning now to our third quarter business results, I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands charts 4 through 6. Timberlands contributed $72 million to third quarter earnings and $154 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $30 million compared with the second quarter due to seasonally lower harvest volumes and lower average realizations for domestic and export logs. Western fee harvest volumes decreased 11% compared with the second quarter and 5% compared with year ago, as we intentionally brought less wood to market during the seasonal peak in supply. Log and haul costs also increased as we typically shift to higher elevation logging during the summer months. In the Western domestic market, mills entered the third quarter with full inventories in preparation for summer fire season. However, as summer weather in the Pacific Northwest, was wetter than normal there was no notable fire activity and logging conditions remained favorable. Log supply increased seasonally as private nonindustrial landowners brought their logs to market and mill log decks remained at comfortable levels through July and August. Domestic log prices trended modestly lower through the summer months, but started to firm up at the end of August, as demand and pricing for Douglas fir lumber began to improve. Log supply tightened in September with the early arrival of the fall rainy season and log pricing increased in the quarter. Moving to the export markets, in Japan, post-and-beam housing starts were up 1% year-to-date. Demand for our customers' Douglas fir lumber products remained solid. And our third quarter log sales volumes to Japan were comparable to the second quarter. Average sales realizations were modestly lower, due to pressure from unfavourable foreign exchange rates and U.S. domestic pricing trends. In China, overall log inventories decreased by 15% during the third quarter, and totaled 3.5 million cubic meters at the end of September. Chinese demand for our Douglas fir and hemlock logs, remained generally steady compared with the second quarter. Our third quarter log sales volumes to Japan -- to China increased, but this was primarily due to timing of vessel sailings. Average realizations for our China export logs, decreased modestly compared with the second quarter, due to mix and competition from lower priced species, which pressure pricing for our hemlock and Douglas fir. Overall, third quarter log export revenues were lower than the year ago quarter, due to lower realizations for our Japan and China logs. And moderately lower sales volumes to China. For Western Timberlands as a whole, EBITDA is significantly lower than a year ago, due to lower prices for domestic and export logs. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $5 million compared with the second quarter, as higher fee harvest volumes were partially offset by seasonally higher forestry spending. Third quarter weather was generally drier than second quarter this resulted in good operability, and strong log production across our southern regions. Our fee harvest volume increased 7% as we benefited from the improved weather, and also caught up on thinning activity postponed during the unusually wet conditions earlier this year. Average realizations for our Southern logs decreased 1% compared with the second quarter, due to mix as the increasing thinning activity resulted in a higher proportion of fiber logs. Average realizations for our Southern sawlogs increased due to improved pricing in the mid-South, where markets remained relatively strong due to wetter conditions. Realizations for our fiber logs were comparable to the second quarter. On the export side, we have been operating our Southern export business at minimal volume since Chinese tariffs were applied to the Southern yellow pine logs in 2018. Less than 0.5% of 1% of our Southern fee harvest volumes are, sold to expert customers. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands results with the year ago quarter EBITDA increased by $11 million, due to higher average log sales realizations, and higher fee harvest volumes. Northern Timberlands EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter, and was comparable to a year ago. Compared with the second quarter, fee harvest volumes increased seasonally, as the northern operations emerged from spring break-up. Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources charts seven and eight. Real estate and ENR contributed $32 million to third quarter earnings, and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter EBITDA was $11 million lower than the second quarter, and $26 million lower than a year ago. As expected, the number of acres sold decreased significantly compared with the second quarter, and the year ago quarter. As we previously indicated, our 2019 real estate sales are heavily weighted toward the first half of the year, whereas in 2018, most of our sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters. Average price per acre was roughly two times that of the second quarter, and the year ago quarter due to geographic mix. Approximately 85% of our third quarter acres sold were in the South and West. In contrast, over half the acres sold in the second quarter of 2019, and third quarter of 2018, were located in Montana, where Timberland prices are regionally lower. Wood Products charts nine and 10. Wood Products contributed $75 million to third quarter earnings before special items, and $123 million to adjusted EBITDA. Earnings and EBITDA were nearly comparable to the second quarter, on flat average realizations for our commodity products. EBITDA for lumber increased $5 million due to lower Western and Southern log costs. Lumber pricing declined at the outset of the third quarter, then reversed course in mid-August as improved housing activity drove incremental demand, and previously announced mill curtailments began to reduce supply. On average, the framing lumber composite price increased 3% in the third quarter compared with the second. Our average log -- lumber realizations were comparable to the second quarter as our mix of production is weighted more heavily to Southern Yellow Pine. Third quarter sales volumes were flat with the second quarter. Our lumber mills ran very well again this quarter even with some modest hurricane-related downtime in our Southern operations. Unit manufacturing costs for lumber increased slightly due to that downtime as well as hurricane preparation activities. Comparing third quarter results with the year ago quarter, lumber EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 21% decrease in average sales realizations, partially offset by lower log and manufacturing costs. EBITDA for the third quarter of 2019 includes charges of $4 million for countervailing and antidumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. In OSB, EBITDA increased by $5 million compared with the second quarter due to lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs. As with lumber, third quarter OSB pricing vary by region. Although pricing in the benchmark north central region increased significantly during the third quarter, pricing in several other regions trended materially lower. The OSB composite price which includes all producing regions was flat in the third quarter compared with the second. Our third quarter realizations trended in line with the OSB composite price which is a better proxy for our geographic mix. Our OSB sales and production volumes were comparable to the second quarter. Comparing our third quarter results to the year ago quarter, EBITDA was significantly lower due to a 33% decrease in average sales realizations, partially offset by higher sales volumes as our Grayling Michigan mill was down for a scheduled press replacement in the third quarter of 2018. Engineered Wood Products EBITDA decreased by $9 million compared with the second quarter. Average sales realizations for I-Joists products were flat with the second quarter and average realizations for solid section decreased by 1% due to product and geographic mix. Sales volumes for I-Joists increased 4% and production volumes were comparable to the second quarter. Sales volumes for solid section products increased 3%. Solid section production declined 12% as we completed scheduled annual maintenance shutdowns at two mills and continue to draw down our first quarter inventory build. Unit manufacturing costs increased due to lower operating rates and higher maintenance expense resulting from these scheduled shutdowns. Fiber costs declined due to lower cost per logs in oriented strand board web stock. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products increased due to lower cost per logs and oriented strand board. Distribution EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter and significantly higher than year ago due to improved margins. Third quarter results for Wood Products include one special item a pretax benefit of $68 million from insurance recoveries related to our Flak Jacket product remediation. To-date we have received $93 million of insurance proceeds and we continue to expect a significant portion of the remediation cost will be covered by insurance. I'd like to now turn to operational excellence. Our businesses continue to make good progress on operational excellence and we are on track to achieve our 2019 target of $80 million to $100 million. Year-to-date our operational excellence initiatives in timberlands have been focused on log marketing and merchandising, optimizing silviculture spend, reducing growth costs, and improving log and hauling efficiencies across all geographies. In Wood Products, our OpEx initiatives are focused on reducing our controllable manufacturing costs, increasing our high-value product mix, and improving log recovery across our operations. Our real estate business is also on track to meet or exceed its targeted 30% premium to timber value. I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks Devin. Good morning. Key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Chart 13 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect our fourth quarter earnings will be comparable to the third quarter and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower. In our Western Timberland operations, we expect domestic log sales volumes will decline modestly in the fourth quarter. Wet operating conditions reduced log supply late in the third quarter and inventories tightened. We anticipate domestic log sales realizations will improve modestly in the fourth quarter as a result of steady domestic demand and the continued seasonal reduction in supply from non-industrial landowners. As is typical for this time of the year, we expect our Western road and unit logging costs will be lower compared to the third quarter. Demand for our Japanese export logs remains solid and we expect fourth quarter sales realizations to be flat with the third quarter. Fourth quarter sales volumes are expected to decline due to the timing of shipping schedules. Chinese export log sales volumes are expected to be comparable with the third quarter and we anticipate average sales realizations will decline modestly in the fourth quarter. We're taking advantage of our ability to allocate volumes between the domestic and China markets to capture the highest margin opportunity. In the South, operating conditions have been favorable for the past several months and log inventories have returned to healthy levels. We expect fourth quarter average log sales realizations will be slightly lower than the third quarter and fee harvest volumes will decline. In the North, we expect fourth quarter EBITDA to decline due to the seasonally lower fee harvest volumes and a partial quarter of Michigan results. In September, we announced an agreement to sell our 555,000 acres of Michigan Timberlands for $300 million. This transaction is expected to close in the fourth quarter and these assets are now listed on our balance sheet as held-for-sale. Turning to our Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources segment, as previously discussed the pace of our real estate sales is more heavily weighted to the first half of the year in 2019. Market conditions remain positive and high net worth individuals, recreational and conservation buyers are all active. We expect fourth quarter earnings for Real Estate Energy and Natural Resources segment will be approximately $10 million lower than the third quarter. We continue to expect full year 2019 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $270 million and anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 50% and 55% for both the fourth quarter and the full year. For Wood Products, we expect lower sales volumes across most product lines, as building activity typically declines in the fourth quarter as we move into the winter months. Our channel inventories have tightened, buyers continue to limit purchases to immediate needs. We anticipate higher Western log cost, partially offset by modestly improved operating cost as we continue to capture operational excellence improvements. Fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products segment are expected to be approximately $25 million lower than the third quarter before any benefit from improvement in sales realizations. For lumber, fourth quarter to-date average sales realizations are $5 higher than the third quarter average. Current realizations are comparable with the third quarter average. Oriented strand board fourth quarter to-date average sales realizations and current realizations are both $5 below third quarter average. As a reminder for lumber every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Chart 11 outlines the major components of our third quarter unallocated items. The contribution to earnings before special items improved $3 million due to a non-cash benefit from elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO compared with the second quarter. Third quarter special items include a $15 million pre-tax legal charge stemming from the judgment in a suit related to Flak Jacket. We're appealing this ruling. Our third quarter non-cash, non-operating pension and post-retirement benefit cost was comparable to the second quarter. We continue to expect to record approximately $60 million of expense for the full year 2019. Turning to our key financial items, which are summarized on chart 12, we ended the third quarter with a cash balance of $153 million. Cash from operations during the third quarter was $292 million. Turning to cash from investing. Our capital expenditures in the third quarter totaled $98 million. We continue to expect total CapEx for 2019 will be approximately $380 million nearly $120 million for Timberlands, $250 million for Wood Products and approximately $10 million from planned corporate IT system upgrades. As a reminder, the fourth quarter is historically the highest quarter of capital spending. We also expect to receive $300 million of cash in the fourth quarter as we close on the sale of our Michigan Timberlands. Moving on to financing. In the third quarter, we paid $302 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of the timber installment sale in the early 2000s. This is the last of these entities and we'll receive $362 million of cash in the first quarter of 2020 when the related financial investment matures. We ended the quarter with approximately $6.6 billion of total debt outstanding this includes a $440 million balance on our line of credit, a portion of which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflow associated with the variable interest entity debt maturity. We have no debt maturities until 2021. We expect our fourth quarter interest expense to be comparable to the third quarter bringing the full year 2019 to approximately $370 million, excluding special items. I'll close my comments with taxes. Excluding special items in the third quarter we recorded a $10 million income tax benefit. On a year-to-date basis, our effective tax rate before special items was a benefit of 15%. We expect our full year 2019 effective tax benefit to be similar to the 15% we have booked year-to-date though will be somewhat sensitive to fourth quarter lumber and oriented strand board pricing. Turning to cash taxes. We expect to pay minimum cash taxes in 2019, due to an anticipated fourth quarter refund for prior overpayments. We've also filed a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution that claim is still in process and so we're unlikely to receive that cash in 2019. Now, I'll turn the call back over to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thank you, Russell. In closing, I am extremely proud of the work that our people are doing all across the company. Our teams are delivering strong operational performance in each of our businesses despite challenging market conditions. In every area that we can control, our employees are driving solid execution each and everyday. We remain intently focused on serving our customers and delivering operational excellence in every aspect of our business. Looking forward, we continue to expect that U.S. housing will follow a modest growth trajectory, which should ultimately support improved pricing across our commodity products. And with our businesses running well, we're well positioned to capture the full benefits of an improved housing environment. But as we continue to improve our operating performance and optimize our portfolio, we will also position the company to deliver superior value to our shareholders across the range of market conditions. And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And your first question is from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please go ahead. George Staphos : Thank you. Good morning, Russell. Good morning, Devin. How are you? Hi, Beth. Thanks for all the details. A couple of questions here and then we'll turn it over. First of all and this comes up periodically on the conference calls, why do you think at this juncture we haven't seen that expected uptick in Southern Timberlands pricing or timber pricing? Obviously, you're seeing a pick up in demand your outlook for next year is moderately positive in terms of housing. Canada has been having difficulty supplying logs into the U.S. Why are we seeing that uptick in your view? Any updated thoughts on Southern timber pricing here? And what we can expect looking out into 2020? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. Sure, George. And I think I would note that we have seen an uptick in the first half of the year that really sort of translated all the way into Q3 on Southern sawlog prices. So we have seen a bit of an uptick this year. Now, candidly some of that had to do with the rain that we had in the first part of the year, the tension in some of the wood baskets, but I think we have seen some improvement year-over-year. But ultimately, what it comes down to is supply and demand within the region, and this has been a long story in terms of getting the Southern sawlog prices up. But ultimately what gives us confidence that ultimately we are going to see the improvement is the improved capacity that we're seeing coming into the U.S. South 5.5 billion board feet of incremental capacity coming in. When we look at the wood baskets where the new mills have come in we have seen tensioning within those wood baskets. And as that capacity continues to come in and get online you see that tensioning effect. Additionally, on the pulp side, we've seen a number of pellet mills come in. In fact, Enviva just broke ground on a new pellet mill in Mississippi. And so it takes time for each of those mills to come in, get up to speed and start taking logs. But again, as we've seen these mills come in, in the specific wood baskets where we've seen incremental capacity you see a tensioning effect. And over time that brings up the demand across the system. The other thing I would just note is, over time we also think there is an opportunity for an export program to really develop out of the U.S. South. Pre-tariffs, we were really working to build up that program and making some good headway in terms of exporting logs out of the U.S. South. I think ultimately when the tariff dispute ultimately comes to resolution we're going to see that opportunity open back up. And so it takes time, it's been slower than we would have expected or like, but I think we're on the right trajectory over time. George Staphos : Okay. Devin, I mean, relatedly and you're correct there has been a little bit of a bump this year, but certainly timber prices are nowhere where anyone would have expected a few years ago at least I don't think in the South or also where they are right now. The capacity that's gone in at 5.5 billion square feet few years ago, it was 3 billion square feet and 4 billion square feet. So you've seen more converting capacity go in. We haven't seen the price really lift. At this juncture, they just -- housing has been a little bit slower to come back and that is the reason why you haven't seen that tensioning. And then relatedly -- and again, thanks for all the detail that you put in the slide deck, you have one of the best in the industry. It's kind of interesting how we've seen the Western Timberland EBITDA decline almost in half relative to where it was to begin 2018. From your vantage point, where are the big buckets? And what changes that trajectory over the next couple of periods and years? Is it really just trade getting back to normal, or is there something else in your view that would be helpful there. Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I think a couple of things on the Western market. Ultimately, the Western system is a very tensioned market. And so I think the biggest driver that you see in terms of Western log prices is what's going on with the Western lumber prices. And so when you have mills that see lumber prices reduce dramatically, there's a limit to how much they can pay for logs and keep those cash flow positive. So I'd say that's been the biggest driver. There have been a couple of other things around the margins the trade dispute with China. We continue to ship logs to our customers in China, but I do think a number of other landowners in the Pacific Northwest have kept some of that supply in the domestic market. A little bit around the margins, there were some wind damage in South Oregon. And so there's been a little bit to salvage activity there that's been a little bit of headwind down in that market, but overall the big driver has really just been Western lumber prices. And so as we look forward sitting where we are today, we're moving into the rainy season here in the Pacific Northwest. In fact, last few weeks it has been pretty rainy up here, and that typically will take the non-industrial landowners out of the system. It will reduce log flow. And so provided that we can keep Western lumber prices at these levels or even get some uptick, I think that bodes well for improved log prices in the west. George Staphos : Okay. Last quick one for me. Just timberland transactions have been again a little bit slow this year at least from our vantage point. What do you think if you grew the premise? And maybe you disagree, what do you think has been driving that? Thanks and good luck in the quarter. Russell Hagen : Yeah, George, this is Russell. I'll take that question. I don't think much has changed since the last time we talked last quarter in the timberland's market. We're a little closer to be year-end. I think we've seeing about $750 million worth of transactions closed. As we look in the pipeline, there's probably another $750 million that will close. So the full year we'll expect to see in the U.S. about $1.5 billion worth of transactions. That's definitely lower than kind of what we would expect on a run rate of $2 billion to $2.5 billion. That doesn't include any large transactions like the PotlatchDeltic transaction last year. So definitely, we're a little lighter this year than I think we would have expected given what we've seen in prior years, but I really don't think that's a reflection on the market per se. I think it's just a timing issue. There is still a lot of demand for quality timberlands, the transactions that are coming out get a lot of attention. And so I would expect to see us return to a more kind of normal run rate basis going forward. George Staphos : All right. Thank you very much guys. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Please go ahead. Brian Maguire : Hi. Good morning guys. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Brian. Brian Maguire : Just a follow-up on those comments Russell and the prior comments just on the lower Western log price realizations. Why do you think that we haven't seen some of the Western land transaction prices come down some timber or the lower log price realization? Is it just not as tether to like current EBITDA and cash flows as a lot of other asset classes? Or do you think we're just seeing maybe lower interest rates and cap rates kind of offset the lower kind of EBITDA that you're getting of that land these days? Russell Hagen : Brian, there's kind of two points. The first is, timberland values typically don't trade kind of correlated to log pricing. When you're going into acquire timberland asset you're thinking over a longer-term period of time than just the immediate log price dynamics. And so I think that's factored into the overall investment and valuations. The second is in the West. As Devin mentioned, that's a very tensioned market. And part of that is the ownership structure is very different than say in the South. There's fewer private owners in the West, there's more federal and state ownership. And so, you really just don't have the same kind of number of available transactions in the market that you see in the South plus. The West is really an excellent timber base. The trees are high valued Doug fir, primarily grown for a sawlog-type product. And so, they really are of a high value. And I think, again, as you see any Western timberlands come to market you're going to see a lot of demand, particularly of their high-quality timberlands. Brian Maguire : Okay. I appreciate that. Just to switch over to wood products, just wondered if you could provide some comments and your thoughts on where inventory sits in the channel? And in light of some of the recent capacity closure announcement in both lumber and OSB now, any thoughts on if there's enough tension in the market, especially if the kind of recent starts activity continues? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, starting off with the question on inventories in the channel, it's really been the story of the year. We've seen customers carrying relatively low inventories. I would say that's the case now, generally speaking, across the system, really in lumber, OSB and EWP, fairly lean inventories across the system. And I think that's just a reflection of the fact that for the majority of the year, the supply has been adequate. So people can buy on an as-needed basis and that really has enforced people to carry material inventories. And so, that's currently the case. What I would say from a broader perspective, I think, there is reason to believe that you're going to see some upward pricing pressure. We've seen a fair amount of curtailment activity over the course of this year, even some more announced just recently. And importantly, we've seen the continued improvement in housing and importantly the single-family segment. And so, to us, to the extent that you see this building activity continue in the strong level that we've seen here of late and we can keep that going for a while longer before the winter weather sets in, combined with the capacity curtailments that have been announced, I think that really bodes well for pricing as we head into the end of the year. But certainly, I would say, even and over and above that as we think about the 2020 building season, which is a little ways out, but it's always worth thinking about, I think we're setting up really well to have a materially different view next year on what pricing looks like and what 2019 look like. Brian Maguire : Okay. Thanks very much. I'll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please go ahead. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Just following up on Brian's question and maybe just zooming in on OSB, you do have a number of competitors that are taking curtailments. I think your production has kind of moved up over the course of the year. I'm wondering if you can talk about where your operating rates are in OSB? Where do you think you may be on the cost curve? And just generally, how you're positioned in the OSB market, given there're some pretty significant regional differences I think that you talked about earlier? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure. From an operating perspective, we're sort of in that mid to upper-90s percent range, which is more or less where we were in Q2 as well. And I think, at a high level it's important to remember when you're thinking about our OSB business. Number one, we typically are a little bit more heavily weighted to the higher value products and so a little less of a participant in the commodity sheathing portion of the business. And I think importantly, we've been very, very focused on our cost structure and that's true across all of our manufacturing assets. Certainly, that's the case in our OSB business as well. And so, to the extent that you've got higher-value products and you've got a lower cost structure, I think that's really what gives you the ability to continue to run and generate cash where that may not be the case for some others. And that was certainly the case for us in OSB in Q3. We were cash flow positive in all of our mills in each of the months, except for one mill that had some scheduled maintenance downtime. And so, we're thoughtful about our operating posture, we're always looking to match our supply with profitable demand and generate appropriate returns over time. But, I think, as I mentioned, just the product mix and the cost structure give us a little bit more flexibility in that respect. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's really helpful. And then, you announced the Michigan sale during the quarter, I am wondering if there is any detail you can give us on that property in terms of species, age class earnings contribution relative to kind of the northern region timberlands that you have? And then, do you see further opportunities that are comparable, whether it's in the North or in other regions? Russell Hagen : Yeah. Anthony, this is Russell. So we did announce the 555,000 acres sale to Lyme timber for $300 million at $540 an acre. And that represents our total Michigan ownership. We have a mix of hardwood logs and pulpwood, so we service both some saw milling and then also pulp activities up there and then there is also a softwood component. We're on target to close in the fourth quarter and so we're very pleased with the overall transaction and the outcome. As far as other Northern Timberlands, I won't comment on specifics, but as we demonstrated, we continue to look at the portfolio. Our goal is to optimize the portfolio over time and the Michigan sale was part of that ongoing effort. So it's a key strategic driver of ours to make sure that we have the right mix of acres that will drive the highest return to the shareholders over time. So we're constantly looking at all of our regions and it's something we're always evaluating, both on the buy side and on the sell side. So as part of that process, we're going to identify certain timberlands that may not be strategic for us and we'll act on those appropriately. And on the buy side, we can be very patient. We have 12 million acres. We're in every operating region in the United States. And so we can be patient and make sure that anything that we contemplate creates shareholder value over time. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Wilde with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Devin, good morning, Russ. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Mark. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : I'd like to just come back on that Michigan land. So Russell, can you just -- can help us at all thinking about the earnings impact from that sale? My own work would suggest it's about 20% to 25% of your land base, but as I understand, it's probably a bigger portion of the earnings in that segment? Russell Hagen : Yeah, Mark, we don't break out the specific earnings in a segment. But you're right, it's about 25% of the total acres in the North. I think for context, last year we generated $19 million to $20 million of EBITDA out of the Northern Timberland operation. So that can kind of give you an idea of generally what the contribution was. Mark Wilde : So you're saying the contribution last year would have only been about let's say $4 million? Russell Hagen : Probably a little higher than that. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. And just again to kind of come back on the issue of how Northern Timberland is identified, if we look at the South and the West, you're really a plantation forestry company and much of what you got kind of across the North is just kind of natural regeneration. So does that make the North different for you from kind of a strategy standpoint? Russell Hagen : Mark as we've said in the past, our focus has definitely been kind of in the West and in the South. When you think of the North, it's -- the West it's pretty consistent I guess growing areas primarily Doug fir, primarily the sawlog outcome; in the South, it's Southern Yellow Pine, pine plantation. When you look in the North, we really have four distinct kind of areas. We have Montana and Michigan, Maine and then West Virginia and each one of them have distinct products, distinct customers, distinct strategies. And so, I would say that you do need to look at it on an individual kind of region basis in the North or in the North it's not as comparable clearly to the West or the South. Mark Wilde : Okay. And the last one on the Northern Timberland, just we have a lot of carnage right now in the hardwood lumber business and I'm understanding some really underperforming properties on the timberland side in hardwood. What effect is that having on you? And also does that create any potential opportunities? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. This is Devin. No question, the China trade dispute has had a negative impact on the hardwood sawtimber market and I think you're seeing that really across the board. I think certainly as we think about going forward to the extent that the trade dispute can get resolved, I think that will be alleviated, but it's going to be some tough sledding in that market until that ultimately does happen. In terms of specific opportunities, I don't know that there is anything that we would highlight right now. We're watching the market across the board that's true both in the hardwood business and really the rest of our ownerships, so nothing specific to highlight on that right now. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then Devin just last one for me. Just over on the Wood Products side of your portfolio, we've been hearing for several months more positive commentary and results from the homebuilders but it really hasn't to this point kind of flowed through to the suppliers to the homebuilders. How do you interpret that? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. I think part of this earlier in the summer, when we really started to see a little bit of pickup in the activity was there was a bit of destocking. I think there was probably a bit more spec home inventory in the system that had to be worked through. And so not all of that pickup in activity really translated into actual Wood Products demand pull through. I think you're starting to see that get more into balance. And as we see the starts activity and the new home sales activity continue to improve that should have more pull through. The other thing I think that's been really hard in terms of dialing in the supply-demand dynamic is with all of the curtailment activity that we've seen that introduces noise into the system. And so when you see some of these mills take indefinite or permanent shutdowns, there is an inventory flushing that typically occurs in the system. And I think that's part of what we saw in Q3 as some of these mills closed down and we're really eliminating the inventory. You probably saw a little bit more of that flushing through that had a bit of a dampening effect on pricing. But ultimately there is no question as we continue to see housing improve and if this trend continues which we think it will that ultimately will result in more Wood Products demand. And you combine that with the curtailment activity, put the noise aside that will be I think a positive for commodity pricing across the board. Mark Wilde : Yes. It definitely looks like it when we look at these SPF prices the last couple of weeks Devin. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Yes, thanks, Mark. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please go ahead. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. One or two follow ups. First just on the Michigan sale, so you've got $250 million on assets for sale you're selling it for $300 million. So can we conclude it's a $50 million gain on that sale? And I assume that's not included in any of your guidance, so I assume you're going to take that out as a non-recurring item when you report for the fourth quarter? Russell Hagen : Yes Mark. That's correct. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then there has been some chatter about opening federal forests to logging. Any perspectives on the likelihood of that happening and/or potential impact if it were to? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. Honestly, I don't think we're overly concerned about that. There are a lot of impediments to rapidly increasing logging of federal land, the litigation environment, frankly the capacity in the system to do that. So it's not something that we're particularly concerned about. I think even if we do see a little bit of an uptick it's not going to have a material impact on any of our businesses. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then lastly, obviously, this year the tax rate has been pretty unusual. Kind of on a go-forward basis is there a formula or way that we should be thinking about? Does it go back to the way it used to be or is there kind of a different way to be thinking about the tax rate for 2020 as well? Russell Hagen : Mark, the provision for income tax is this year has been primarily driven by the performance in the TRS and primarily Wood Products performance. As you're aware, we calculate the estimated annual tax rate on a consolidated basis, so combining the REIT and tax for REIT subsidiary, because we don't pay taxes on the REIT income. We get a lot of volatility in the effective tax rate, particularly when the other proportion of earnings between the REIT and the TRS changes, which is really what you're seeing this year. So, as we've said, the fourth quarter rate is going to be highly dependent on Wood Products pricing just as a function of that proportion. I think as we come into 2020, we should start seeing that tax rate normalize as we have improved performance, particularly in the Wood Products operations. Mark Weintraub : So is it fair to basically use zero on the timber earnings and 20%-or-so for whatever we estimate the TRS might be which will be largely the Wood Products business? Russell Hagen : Yes. I mean, we don't pay tax coming out of the REIT. So on the TRS, probably more of an all-in rate of around 25%. Again we'll provide guidance in February when we update our guidance for 2020 for you. Mark Weintraub : Okay, super. Thank you. Russell Hagen : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Collin Mings : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Collin Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Collin. Collin Mings : First question for me. Just, Devin, going back to your prepared remarks on the Japan market, can you just maybe expand on the demand trends you're seeing there? It looks like wooden construction starts actually fell there year-over-year in August? And then with the consumption tax increase, it would just be helpful if we could get your latest read on that market and maybe how you expect that to evolve? Devin Stockfish : Yeah, sure. Yeah, I think the important thing for us when we think about the Japan housing market is the post and beam market. And so that really is where our product feeds into the construction activity and that's been up 1% year-to-date. And so that has remained a pretty strong market for us. Our customers in Japan have had steady demand and we continue to see that. I think as you think over time the one piece that is always a little bit of a variable is just with currency. That market is served by European supply and U.S. supply. But our customers are doing well. They have had strong demand, good activity there. And so we're seeing good solid activity into that market and anticipate that continuing. Collin Mings : Okay, thank you. And then switching to real estate, Russell just given some of the recent headlines in both Florida and Maine as it relates to warehouse or in zoning, can you maybe just update us on your thoughts on how important pursuing entitlement is in select markets to your strategy of creating value and extracting a premium to core timberland? Russell Hagen : Sure. So specific to the Florida headline that's a relatively small development area. It's been about 1,700 acres. We've been pursuing entitlement over a number of years. As you're aware, the entitlement process can be a bit of a bumpy road. And so I think that's really what you're saying, but that really is not a significant contributor to our overall performance on the overall real estate program. As far as Maine, we completed that entitlement back in 2012. Since that time, we really haven't seen that market materialize for development. And so we're opting to seek to convert that back into timberlands and manage it on a sustainable basis like we manage all of our timberlands. Again that really isn't a significant contributor to the overall real estate performance going forward. As far as the entitlement, I mean it's a relatively low cost way of taking properties up the value curve. And so we're seeing opportunity to entitle a property and then divest it to a developer or another party, we're going to pursue that and we think through every one of our opportunities pretty clear understanding that it just takes time, but ultimately we're trying to seek the highest value for those lands that we've identified for development outcomes and then also for HBU sales. Collin Mings : Got it. So it sounds like again it will be basically a selective process of what you actually decide to pursue as far as the entitlement front. But I guess to your point, it's relatively low cost way of maybe adding some value in some select markets, is that fair? Russell Hagen : Yeah that's fair. Again it is very -- it\u2019s a relatively small subset of our overall AVO portfolio. And again it's a low cost way of taking that property up the value curve. Collin Mings : Okay. Thank you, Russell. Russell Hagen : You bet. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Please go ahead. Mark Connelly : Just a couple of things. How much of the additional saw milling capacity that's still to come in the south is in places where it's going to have a direct impact on you? My recollection is that we've already seen a pretty good portion of what's going to hit you directly, is that right? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I think as you think about the 5.5 billion board feet that are coming in, I would say we're good way down the path on that starting up operations, and it's differential as you mentioned by region. I think there are still a few mills that are coming in that will have an impact on us others less so. But generally speaking, we have operations in all major wood baskets. And so we may be a little bit more heavily weighted to some states versus the other, but there will be some impact really across the board in each of those new mills coming into place. Mark Connelly : Okay. That's helpful. And just one last thing. Russell, you mentioned that buyers are still limiting inventory and we're clearly seeing that. Last quarter you characterized the inventory level as fairly normal. Would you still say it's relatively normal or is it starting to get lower? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. Just to clarify, are you talking about within the Wood Products channel? Mark Connelly : Yeah, yeah. Sorry, sorry. Yeah. Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I would say that they are still relatively lean across the system and that's true for lumber OSB and EWP. Mark Connelly : Super. Thank you. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research Partners. Please go ahead. Chip Dillon : Yes, good morning Devin, Russell and Beth. Thanks for all the details. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Chip Dillon : First question is -- I will say that our base case is that the Wood Products business will certainly not be as good as it was last year, but better than this year, next year and that should allow you to pretty much cover your dividend just with cash flow. But I am encouraged and just want to make sure I'm on the right path. It's about $1 billion a year at the current rate, and it looks like if I'm doing my numbers right that you are probably three quarters of the way there not that this is how we should look at it, but with the Michigan sale, the last tranche of the variable entity payment next year that gives us $302 million. You mentioned $90 million I think you're looking for from 2018 in terms of a tax refund. So I add that up, and I'm in the $700 million range. My question is what is the refund that you're looking to get for the overpayment this year? Russell Hagen : For this overpayment, it's about $40 million to $45 million. Chip Dillon : Okay. And I take it, the path, I just went down is the right way to look at things that. You're looking at north of $700 million of inflows from all these activities? Russell Hagen : Yes. It's correct. Chip Dillon : Okay, all right. That's helpful. And then just shifting gears, I noticed two of the businesses that six, seven years ago that seem to really be struggling had -- basically were the bright spots of the quarter from one I can tell, and that of course would be the distribution business and especially engineered wood products. And I didn't know if there is anything unusual in this quarter or if we should sort of hang our hat on how well these businesses are performing? I note that both can receive certain cost benefits from the timing of raw material changes. So, I didn't know, for example, the low OSB prices were boosting EWP unusually and maybe the same in distribution if you had inventory gains? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I would say there is always a minor benefit when OSB prices go down to our EWP business, because the web stock is one of the products that goes into the end-use. But I would say at a higher level, this is the case really across all of our manufacturing businesses. We have been doing a lot of work to improve our operating performance and to improve our cost structure, and that's true in EWP. It's true in our distribution business. And although we've seen product pricing a bit challenging this year, I would say that's equally true for lumber and OSB. These businesses are operating as well as they ever have, and that has been a really important focus for us in our overall business strategy. And so, you're seeing that now. I think as we alluded to earlier, when the businesses are operating well and we're continuing to prove -- improve every day. When we do see an uptick in the housing activity and the commodity prices, we're really well positioned to generate a lot of value from these assets. Chip Dillon : Great. Thank you very much. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question is from the line of Steve Chercover with Davidson. Please go ahead. Steve Chercover : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Steve Chercover : Just a quick one on OSB. I mean I have a sense that your system is low cost, and I'm just wondering is that due to your fiber baskets in which you operate, the equipment or maybe the proximity to markets? And I understand that you are making some premium products. Devin Stockfish : Yeah. What I would really attribute that to you is all of the work that we've done to improve efficiencies, improve recovery, the operating performance, the continued focus on cost generally. I mean amongst our various manufacturing assets, some are maybe a little bit better located relative to fiber than others. I wouldn't say that in and of itself is the key driver, it's really just been the continued focus on improving our operations and keeping a very tight control on cost. And that ultimately has been the big driver for us. Steven Chercover : Okay. And then in honor of the World Series, I've got a curveball for you. And it does kind of center on control. So in Oregon you have an office manager who stole $4.5 million from you over 15 years. And I assume it's an isolated incident. But are you putting in safeguards to ensure that this can't happen again? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. Well as you can imagine, this case is currently under criminal investigation by the U.S. Attorney. So there is a limited amount we can really comment on. But what I would say is, it's very disappointing. The employee obviously no longer works for us. We've instituted appropriate controls to ensure that this doesn't happen again. And so, that's really what we can say there, very disappointing situation. Steven Chercover : Okay, thanks a lot. Devin Stockfish : Yeah. Thank you. Operator : Today's final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Paul Quinn : Yeah thanks and good morning guys. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Paul Quinn : Just a question on U.S. South log pricing, and Devin you mentioned that the 5.5 billion board feet of lumber capacity adds. When I take a look at WWPA data on South production, over the last 5.5 years, it's kind of up 3.5 billion board feet. So, just wondering where that disconnect? Is that two billion, expected to come over the next couple of years? And what's your -- Weyerhaeuser has done a number of upgrades. What I'm hearing from other companies is that, it's taking longer in the sawmill ramp ups to get to the design capacity. Have you experienced the same thing? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. You know I think the important thing to remember on that, 5.5 billion is that announced capacity. And so that's just been coming in tranches over the last several years. And we still have a little bit left to go. And to your point, once you actually commission a sawmill to the point where it's running full, and you start adding the second shift that's a process that can take six to 12 months frankly. And so, we've seen certain of our competitors that have put in mills. And it can take a little longer at times. I will say for our two mills in particular Millport and Dierks, we've actually done a really nice job in getting those mills up the start-up curve. Ultimately that will add around 300 million board feet of incremental capacity to those two mills. And so, it's a complex process to get mills up and running, after you get them started. And really get them fully operational. And that does take some time. But we're confident that all of that, 5.5 billion is ultimately going to come in. This is one of the best wood baskets to manufacture lumber certainly in North America, if not the world. And so, we think that's going to continue to happen here in the near-term. Paul Quinn : All right, best of luck. Thanks. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. Devin Stockfish : All right, well I think that was the last question. So I'll just say thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. And thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. And have a great day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the Weyerhaeuser Third Quarter 2019 Earnings Conference Call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded. [Operator Instructions] I would now like to hand the conference over to Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations and Enterprise Planning. Thank you. Please go ahead. Beth Baum : Thank you, Regina. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2019 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on this website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides, concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call, this morning, are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported a full-year net loss of $76 million or $0.10 per diluted share driven by a previously reported $0.47 non-cash pension settlement charge. Excluding special items, our full-year 2019 earnings totaled $285 million or $0.39 per share. For the fourth quarter, we reported a GAAP loss of $14 million or $0.02 per diluted share. Excluding net charges of $37 million for special items, we earned $23 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the quarter. Throughout 2019, all of our businesses executed well despite significant headwinds from sluggish housing activity in the first half of the year, persistently challenged commodity prices and continued global trade uncertainty. I\u2019m extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2019, which included achieving record low controllable manufacturing cost in our lumber and oriented strand board operations, capturing over $100 million of operational excellence improvements, delivering the highest EBITDA ever from our real estate energy and natural resources business, delivering a 61% premium to timber value from real estate sales, strategically optimizing portions of our Northern timberlands portfolio, for total proceeds of nearly $450 million, reducing our pension obligations by $1.5 billion, and returning over $1 billion of cash to shareholders. Before I dive into our fourth quarter business results, let me set the stage with some brief remarks on the housing market. The improved pace of U.S. housing activity that emerged during the third quarter continued steadily through year end. Building activity in December was particularly strong. For the year, U.S. housing starts totaled 1.29 million, a 3% improvement, compared with the year ago. Looking forward, economic fundamental support continued growth in U.S. housing activity. Real wages and household incomes are increasing. The unemployment rate is at a 50-year low, household formations are at levels well above the historical average, mortgage rates remain extremely favorable at 3.6%, Homebuilder sentiment is at the highest level since 1999. The inventory of new and existing homes for sale is low and builders continue to shift more products to serve the significant demand for affordable housing. However, notwithstanding these positive demand fundamentals, we do expect the upside on housing will continue to be governed by many of the same supply-side challenges that we faced for a number of years. These include labor availability, lot availability, and regulatory burdens that make it more difficult to bring affordable housing to market. As we enter 2020, unadjusted housing starts have exceeded 1.3 million on a run rate basis for eight of the last nine months, a sign that supply-side infrastructure can support this level of increased activity. Our outlook is for continued modest growth in U.S. housing. For 2020, we anticipate just over 1.3 million starts with the improvement driven primarily by additional single-family activity. Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, charts five through seven. Timberlands contributed $85 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items and $158 million to adjusted EBITDA. Western Timberlands EBITDA increased $14 million, compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations for domestic and Japanese export logs increased and road and forestry expenses were seasonally lower. In the West, fourth quarter weather was milder than normal and log supply remained above average due to favorable logging conditions. Domestic demand remained steady through the quarter as Western lumber pricing improved and mills took limited holiday downtime. In our export markets, our average log sales realizations to Japan increased slightly, compared with the third quarter, while log sales volumes were slightly lower. Although Japanese housing starts have moderated somewhat following the recent increase in the consumption tax, the effect on our key post and beam end-market has been minimal. Post and beam starts were down only 1.5% year-to-date through November and demand for our logs remained solid. In addition, a reduction in Canadian log exports to Japan is driving some Japanese saw millers to seek additional U.S. log supply. In China, the market for U.S. logs weakened in the fourth quarter as abundant competition from salvaged European spruce logs continued to pressure pricing downward. Total log inventories at Chinese ports increased 6% during the quarter and ended the year at a relatively balanced 3.7 million cubic meters. However, the share of European spruce has continued to grow. Through November, European logs comprised about 17% of China's year-to-date softwood log imports, compared with only 3% in 2018. Our fourth quarter China export realizations decreased, compared with the third quarter and sales volumes declined. Although demand for our China export logs continues to hold up fairly well, we're choosing to flex volume to the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities. Compared with the year ago quarter, our total Western log export revenue decreased significantly due to lower sales realizations and volumes in China and Japan. Moving to the south, Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased $6 million, compared with the third quarter. Southern log supplies tighten briefly in October, due to wet weather, but normalized quickly thereafter with more favorable operating conditions. Mill inventories remained well supplied through the fourth quarter and our average log realizations decreased 1%. Fee harvest volumes declined 3%, compared with the third quarter. Although we had hoped to fully catch up on thinning activity postponed during the unusually wet conditions in early 2019, we were unable to complete all of the activity during the fourth quarter. On the export side, we continued to operate our Southern log export business at minimal volumes, due to the ongoing 25% Chinese tariff on Southern yellow pine logs. Comparing overall Southern Timberlands fourth quarter results with the year ago quarter, EBITDA decreased by $4 million, due to lower fee harvest volumes and higher road costs. This was partially offset by higher average Southern saw log realizations. Northern Timberlands EBITDA decreased $1 million, compared with third quarter and $3 million, compared with the fourth quarter of 2018. The harvest volumes decreased due to the sale of our Michigan timberlands, which closed in November. Average realizations decreased slightly. Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources, charts eight and nine. Real Estate and ENR contributed $22 million to fourth quarter earnings and $37 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full-year, the segment generated $274 million of EBITDA, an increase of $10 million from 2018. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $23 million lower than the third quarter and $53 million lower than a year ago periods, due to the timing of real estate sales. Construction materials and energy royalties also decreased slightly. As expected, the number of acres sold in the fourth quarter decreased significantly, compared with the third quarter and the fourth quarter of 2018. During 2019, our Real Estate sales activity was heavily weighted towards the first half of the year, whereas in 2018, most of our sales occurred in the third and fourth quarters. Average price per acre was comparable to the third quarter and the year ago quarter and average land basis, as a percentage of Real Estate sales, was lower due to the transaction mix. Wood Products, charts 10 and 11. Wood Products contributed $60 million to fourth quarter earnings and $110 million to adjusted EBITDA. I am very pleased with our fourth quarter Wood Products performance as our teams continue to display an unwavering focus on achieving operational excellence and an industry-leading cost structure. Our results include meaningful operating performance records in each of our four Wood Products businesses. For both the fourth quarter and full-year 2019, our Lumber and OSB businesses delivered the lowest controllable unit manufacturing costs in our history. Engineered Wood Products reduced controllable spending by over $11 million on a full-year basis and Distribution delivered its highest fourth quarter EBITDA ever. Compared to fourth quarter 2018, Wood Products EBITDA increased $44 million or over 65%, despite flat lumber realizations and significantly lower pricing for OSB. Compared with the third quarter, EBITDA decreased $13 million as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by record fourth quarter cost performance in Lumber and Oriented Strand Board. EBITDA for Lumber decreased $6 million, compared with the third quarter. Seasonally lower sales volumes and slightly higher cost for Western and Canadian logs were partially offset by lower controllable manufacturing costs. Although lumber prices continued to trade in a narrow range during the fourth quarter, pricing for many products did recover slightly as stronger housing activity generated incremental demand and channel inventories remains generally low. On average, the framing lumber composite increased 3% in the fourth quarter, compared with the third. Our average lumber realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Our production mix is more heavily weighted to wide width Southern yellow pine, which saw a 9% decrease in published pricing. Our Lumber sales volumes decreased 4%, compared with the third quarter and our production volume decreased slightly as we took some additional downtime for maintenance and capital projects. Fourth quarter EBITDA includes $4 million of charges for countervailing and anti-dumping duties on Canadian softwood lumber. Compared with the year ago quarter, Lumber EBITDA improved by $37 million, due to lower unit manufacturing costs, lower Western log cost and modestly higher sales volumes. OSB EBITDA improved $6 million, compared with the third quarter. Slightly improved realizations and slightly lower unit manufacturing cost and fiber cost more than offset a 2% decrease in sales volumes. Fourth quarter OSB pricing generally mirrored that of Lumber. The benchmark OSB composite price increased 6%, compared with the third quarter. Our average realizations increased 1% as the length of our order files creates a lag between published and realized pricing. Comparing our fourth quarter results to the year ago quarter, OSB EBITDA decreased by $12 million. Average sales realizations for OSB decreased by 14%, but this was significantly offset by lower unit manufacturing costs, higher sales volumes and slightly lower fiber costs.  Engineered Wood Products EBITDA decreased $14 million compared with the third quarter. Sales volumes for both solid section and I-Joists decreased seasonally and dealers and builders sought to minimize the year-end inventories. Although our overall operating rate decreased, unit manufacturing cost improved slightly. Average sales realizations for I-Joists increased by 1%. Average realizations for solid section products decreased by 1% due to seasonal mix. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA improved by $15 million, due primarily to lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs. Distribution EBITDA totaled $8 million for the fourth quarter. This is $2 million lower than the third quarter as seasonally lower sales volumes were partially offset by lower warehouse and delivery costs. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA increased by $6 million due to higher sales volumes. This improvement is partially attributable to an operational excellence initiative to upgrade the business' product mix. I\u2019d like to turn now to operational excellence. As a company, we achieved over $100 million of operational excellence improvements in 2019. I am very proud of the hard work, creativity, and cross business collaboration that drilled these results. Timberlands did a remarkable job in capturing $48 million of improvements, primarily from initiatives to further optimize silviculture, forestry and road activities, reduced costs, and improve log merchandising and marketing to maximize the revenue from every log we harvest. Wood Products captured $52 million of improvements and has now achieved black at the bottom as we defined it six years ago. Our 2019 improvements in Wood Products came from initiatives in three primary areas; reducing unit manufacturing cost for Lumber and Oriented Strand Board, improving product mix in Lumber and distribution and increasing log recovery across our mill system. Beyond each business\u2019 individual efforts, we also captured value through initiatives to generate cross business OpEx. Historically, our OpEx focus has been on improved performance within a business segment, but we've also begun to identify opportunities to drive integrated OpEx by increasing collaboration between our Timberlands and Wood Products operations. The most obvious is further optimizing deliveries of our own logs to our own mills. This year through cross business collaboration, we delivered $7 million of OpEx that improved the margin of both segments. Our operational excellence program has delivered well over $0.5 billion of company-wide margin improvement since 2014. This is an incredible achievement, but over time, this level of success also means that traditional margin improvement opportunities of this magnitude become harder to capture, so we're taking a fresh look at OpEx and what it means for our company. As we enter 2020, we are evolving how we define and measure operational excellence at Weyerhaeuser. Operational excellence has been and will continue to be focused on discipline cost management and margin improvements, but we are also expanding OpEx to include activities that drive future value and improve efficiencies across businesses and functions. Our OpEx 2.0, as we're calling it, will include four main components to drive continued improvements across our company. First is margin improvement. These are the familiar OpEx initiatives focused on improving margin by capturing valuable at both the top and bottom line. Second is future value. These initiatives recognize activities that drive improved value in the future. A good example is working to execute on our targeted thinning reforestation and fertilization programs at the highest levels of quality and completeness. We know this improves the value of our timberlands over time. Third is cost avoidance. This category is aimed at avoiding future costs or cost increases. Examples might include reducing employee turnover and optimized procurement initiatives. And fourth is efficiency. These initiatives will focus on improvements that enable higher value use of our resources. Examples would include things such as automating manual work or simplifying business processes. Together, these four categories expand the breadth of OpEx to include every business and function across our company. I'm really excited about the opportunities that OpEx 2.0 creates and the potential it has to further drive our working together culture. In 2020, we\u2019re targeting $50 million to $70 million of additional OpEx improvements from these areas and I look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives as the year progresses. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning. Key outlook items of the first quarter and the full-year 2020 are presented on charts 14 and 15 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter, and our Western Timberlands operations demand remains stable throughout the fourth quarter, and mills took advantage of steady product takeaway into January. Log supply is adequate and log inventories remain at reasonable levels. We expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be higher than the fourth quarter. The seasonally improved demand, we expect average sales realizations will be modestly higher. Western road costs will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our road work activity slows as we progress through the winter months. We expect our first quarter Japanese export log sales volumes will increase, compared to the fourth quarter and average log sales realizations will be comparable. Demand for our logs remains solid with additional support from continued disruption of the supply competing with logs coming out of Western Canada. Our Chinese export log sales volumes will declined in the first quarter and average log sales realizations are expected to be modestly lower in the fourth quarter on softer demand, due to the Lunar New Year and continued competition from the salvage Europeans spruce logs. In the South, we anticipate our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be seasonally lower and average log sales realizations are expected to be similar to fourth quarter levels. In the North, first quarter harvest volumes will be lower following the November close of the sale of our Michigan timberlands. Fourth quarter special items include a $48 million pre-tax gain related to that transaction. In December, we announced an agreement to sell our Montana timberlands for $145 million and recorded an $80 million pre-tax non-cash impairment charge in connection with the agreement, which is also included as a special item in our fourth quarter results. The Montana transaction is expected to close in the second quarter and those assets are now listed on our balance sheet as held for sale. Turning to the full-year 2020, we expect total company harvest volume to be slightly over 36 million tons. We expect our Southern harvest volumes will be comparable 2019 and our harvest volume in the West will be down slightly. In the North, our harvest volumes will approximately be 40% lower than 2019, due to the divestitures of our Michigan and Montana timberlands. Collectively, our Michigan and Montana properties do not generate a meaningful EBITDA contribution to our overall Timberland segment. In our Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources segment, we continue to see strong interest in real estate across our markets and the Pacific Northwest is particularly active. For the full-year 2020, we expected adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. This guidance incorporates the effects of fewer available real estate acres following the divestitures of Montana and Michigan. We expect the cadence of our 2020 real estate activity will be similar to 2019. We anticipate land basis, as a percentage of real estate sales, will be between 55% and 65% for the year. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for the segment will be nearly comparable to the year ago quarter, while earnings will be approximately $15 million lower. We expect first quarter land basis, as a percentage real estate sales, will be near the high-end of the full-year guidance range. Across our Wood Products business, our customers expect optimism for the year ahead. Buyers continue to purchase for specific needs and channel inventories are moderate. We anticipate sales volumes for Lumber and Oriented Strand Board will be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect seasonally improved operating rates and lower per unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter. We expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products segment will be slightly higher than fourth quarter before any benefit from improvement in average sales realizations. For Lumber, first quarter to-date average sales realizations are $20 higher than the fourth quarter average and current realizations are $25 above the fourth quarter average. Oriented Strand Board first quarter to-date and current average sales realizations are comparable with the fourth quarter average. As a reminder, for Lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximate $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. Chart 12 outlines the major components of our fourth quarter unallocated. Unallocated corporate function and variable compensation expense increased, compared to third quarter due to seasonally higher spending and a year-to-date adjustment for incentive compensation. Fourth quarter results also include a small non-cash expense from elimination of profit and inventory and LIFO, compared with an income from this item in the third quarter. Special items in the fourth quarter consist of $6 million non-cash settlement charge related to transfers of Canadian pension assets and liabilities. In our pension and post retirement plans in 2019, we made significant progress against the series of actions we announced in 2018 to reduce the liabilities associated with those plans, while maintaining benefit security for our plan participants. In the last 18 months, we\u2019ve reduced our future obligations by over $2 billion. The year-end 2019 funded status for our pension and post retirement plans decreased by approximately $200 million, compared to 2018 as a result of a reduction in discount rates. Discount rates declined by approximately a 100 basis points for the U.S. plans and 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. In 2019, we did not make any cash contributions to the U.S. qualified pension plan and we're not required to make any cash contributions in 2020. Cash paid for all of the pension and postretirement plans in 2019 was $45 million. Our required cash payments for these plans will be approximately $30 million for 2020. Excluding pension settlement charges, our non-cash non-operating pension and postretirement expense was $61 million in 2019. We expect to report approximately $40 million of expense in 2020. The decrease is a reduction \u2013 is a result of the reduction at discount rates. Turning to our key financial items, which is summarized on chart 13, we ended 2019 with a cash balance of $139 million. Cash from operations during the fourth quarter was $292 million. For the full-year 2019, cash from operations was $966 million. Our capital expenditures for the fourth quarter totaled $143 million and for the full-year 2019, were $384 million. Looking ahead into 2020, we anticipate total CapEx will be approximately $360 million, a $120 million for Timberlands inclusive of reforestation costs, $235 million for Wood Products, and approximately $5 million for corporate IT system upgrades. Investing cash flows for the fourth quarter also included $297 million of net proceeds from the sale of our Michigan timberlands. You\u2019ll also recall that in the third quarter 2019, we paid $302 million to extinguish the debt of a variable interest entity that was established as part of a timber installment sale in the early 2000s. Earlier this month, we received $362 million of cash from the maturity of the related financial instrument. This was the last of these variable interest entities. Moving onto financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.4 billion of total debt outstanding. This included $230 million balance on our line of credit, which was used to bridge the temporary cash outflow associated with the variable interest entity debt maturity. We have no debt maturities until 2021. As you may seen in the 8-K that we filed earlier this week, we refinanced our $1.5 billion revolving line of credit to capture more attractive pricing. The new credit facility has a five-year term that will expire in 2025. In the fourth quarter, interest expense was $89 million bringing our full-year expense to $366 million, excluding special items. We expect interest expense will be $345 million for the full-year 2020. I\u2019ll close my comments with taxes. Excluding special items, in the fourth quarter, we reported $2 million of income tax expense. For the full-year 2019, our effective tax rate, before special items, was a benefit of 13%. For first quarter and full-year 2020, we expect a tax expense of 10% to 15% based on the forecasted mix of earnings for our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. Turning to cash taxes, we received $2 million in net tax refund for the full-year 2019 inclusive of a $43 million federal tax refund in the fourth quarter. As previously discussed, we have filed a claim for $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution and that claim remains in process. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks Russell. One year ago, in my first earnings call as CEO, I talked about four near-term priorities to drive value for shareholders. I'm pleased with our execution to-date and our focus on generating superior and sustainable value will continue in 2020 and beyond. The first priority I highlighted was driving OpEx with a focus on cost and reliability. I'm incredibly proud of our work in OpEx in 2019 and I'm excited about what lies ahead in OpEx 2.0. Second was continuing to drive lasting culture change. We remained focused on the key behaviors that drive success, including accountability and urgency and increasing our focus on innovation across the company. Third was people development. In 2019, we continued our intense focus on people development and worked to increasingly build our bench of future leaders and key personnel across the organization. And fourth was disciplined capital allocation. We\u2019re committed to our balanced capital allocation philosophy of returning cash to shareholders, investing in our businesses, and maintaining an appropriate capital structure. In 2019, we continued to deliver on each of these capital allocation priorities. We returned over a billion dollars of cash to shareholders. We invested over $380 million in disciplined capital expenditures to sustain and further improve our businesses, and we took steps to maintain an appropriate capital structure and support our investment-grade credit ratings by reducing our future pension liabilities. Entering 2020, I'm encouraged that the U.S. housing market continues to show signs of stronger activity. Although pricing for many of our commodity products remain soft, we\u2019re optimistic that we will see continued improvement as we head into the 2020 building season. Going forward, I'm excited about the opportunities in front of us and we remain focused on driving superior long-term value for shareholders by improving performance through operational excellence, fostering a winning and innovative culture that positions us to capitalize on a range of market conditions and demonstrating disciplined capital allocation. And with that, I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning. This is [indiscernible] sitting here for Brian. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks for taking my questions. Yes, if we could just go back for a second, Devin, to the comments that you have mentioned around Lumber and OSB, I think you had mentioned a little bit of a lag coming throughout some of the OSB pricing, can we expect that, you know, even holding everything equal to accelerate a little bit as we go through the first quarter just based on some of the gains that we saw exiting 4Q? Devin Stockfish : Yes, you know, we saw pricing come up a little bit in 4Q. There is little bit of the dip, now it started to come back up. So, as Russell mentioned, quarter-to-date, our OSB realizations are flat relative to the fourth quarter. That being said, you know, certainly I think the market sentiment is that the housing activity is going to continue to improve. We\u2019re seeing a lot of optimism out there. And so, you know, we would anticipate that as we get closer to the 2020 building season and that gets in full swing, we\u2019re going to see some uplift on OSB pricing as we get into the quarter. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then, just on the Lumber side, Russell, like you called out is going to be about $20 higher on average. I think current price is about $25 above the fourth quarter average, which is actually a little bit better than I would've expected just looking at the composite. Is that a function of a little bit of a lag as well coming through the income statement? Or is that more just a function of, you know, some of the mix shift, you know, within the product grades that you guys produce? Russell Hagen : Yes, that would be more attributable to the mix shift of what we produce in our Lumber operations. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Devin. Good morning, Russell. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Mark. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : Devin, I wondered \u2013 is it possible to get some sense for where you see the land sales per year over the next three to five years if we exclude kind of Northern Timberlands? Russell Hagen : Sure, Mark. This is Russell. So, as we noted, we\u2019re going to bring down the real estate EBITDA a little bit from this year, from 2019. It\u2019s really two things that are happening in there. The first is on the Energy & Natural Resource side. We had a couple of one-time type transactions. We had a small asset sale, and then, we had some recoveries on a royalty audit. And then, we\u2019re also factoring in less HBU sales coming out of that Montana and Michigan properties.  You know, the Michigan properties are sold. Montana, we\u2019re expecting to close in the second quarter of this year. And so, you know, with that \u2013 that gives us that $255 million number for 2020. Kind of on a run rate basis, I think that $250 million to $255 million is a reasonable number for the run rate for that business. You know as we\u2019ve stated in the past, our goal is to structure that total AVO program in the pipeline so that we have a sustainable business over time so. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then, just as a follow-on, I\u2019d like to just kind of step back and think about sort of leveraging your franchise. You know with the global will focus on sustainability and carbon capture only going up, any thoughts on ways to kind of both leverage your expertise, but also the strong kind of social and environmental reputation that Weyerhaeuser has? Russell Hagen : Yes, absolutely Mark. I would say tell you that's top of mind for us. As you know, there has been a lot of momentum around, you know, wood-based building for one, but also, you know, as we see more and more companies talking about, you know, becoming carbon neutral or carbon negative. Our view is, you know, practically speaking that's going to be very hard to do without looking to the forest and our ability to sequester carbon. And so, you know, I think that is getting a lot of discussion, a lot of talk in the industry. It\u2019s something that we\u2019re very focused on. You know, candidly it\u2019s in the early stages of figuring out what the mechanics for that market are going to look like. You know there's a private market piece to that. There\u2019s a regulatory piece to that, but we\u2019re staying very focused on it. You know clearly I feel pretty comfortable in saying no organization in the history of America has planted more trees than Weyerhaeuser company. So, that is an area where we have deep expertise and I think there may be a role for us to play. So, we\u2019re keeping a very close watch on that and we\u2019ll look for an opportunity to participate in a profitable way as that develops. Mark Wilde : Would that include kind of structures beyond just outright ownership of timberland? Devin Stockfish : You know, I think we\u2019re at a state right now, Mark, where we\u2019re really looking our all different kinds of opportunities. So, I think at this juncture, I wouldn't foreclose any of those options. Mark Wilde : Okay. Very good. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Collin Mings with Raymond James. Collin Mings : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Collin. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Collin Mings : First for me, just can you elaborate on your full-year outlook for the export markets and harvest plans in the West, how much of the downtick in harvest this year represents just a continued normalization of volume versus the response to some of the headwinds that you alluded to in the prepared remarks about the European sourced wood and other things impacting the Asia markets? Devin Stockfish : Yes, let me start with the Western harvest levels. Now, really to understand what's going on in the West, you have to go back to our Longview Timber acquisition, and you\u2019ll recall that when we did that deal, one of the benefits of that transaction was that they had a significant amount of over matured timber in their portfolio. And so, for several years after that acquisition, we were intentionally bringing that harvest level or harvest age down, which increased our harvest levels in the West. Over the last couple of years, we\u2019ve really been on the tail-end of that. And so, as we roll into 2020, you know, that volume that we\u2019re anticipating in the West, which is, you know, down around 3% versus 2019, you know, that's what I would expect all else being equal to be the harvest levels for the next several years before it starts coming up again. And so, that's really the answer on the harvest. Now, you know, frankly you can flex up or flex down a little bit depending on market conditions, and we do that from time-to-time, but, you know, the 2020 harvest schedule really is kind of that normalized harvest level in the West for the next several years. You know, speaking to the export markets, and I\u2019ll start with China, you know, really last year, for most of the year, even though, you know, there was more European salvage wood coming into the market, I would say, for the first three quarters it wasn't having a material impact on our export volumes to that China market out of the Northwest. We really did see in the fourth quarter that European salvage wood started to have an impact in the China market, and we really started to see that impact, you know, our pricing certainly as we got deeper into the fourth quarter. You know, as we think about the magnitude of that European salvage wood going into the market and you combine that with what is traditionally a pretty slow time of the year with the Lunar New Year holiday in that market, and you also have the dynamic of the coronavirus and so, you know, I would expect the China market for us out of the Pacific Northwest is going to be choppy for a little while. The Japan market, you know, frankly, remains solid for us. You\u2019ve seen housing starts dip down just a little bit, but the key market for us, as I mentioned earlier, is that post and beam market, and that's held up pretty well and you combine that with some of the challenges from the Canadian log exports, we\u2019re still seeing good volume and sales activity into the Japan market this year. Collin Mings : Thank you for all the detail there, Devin. Just switching gears to kind of OpEx 2.0, can you maybe just elaborate a little bit on where you are targeting the $50 million to $70 million just across the four different buckets you outlined? Specifically, how much would maybe fall into that margin bucket and that efficiency bucket? Devin Stockfish : Yes, you know, I think we\u2019re still in the early stages of rolling this out to the organization, but what I would say is, you know, going into the year, I would still anticipate the majority of that is going to come from that margin bucket, the future value, efficiency and cost avoidance are new pieces of that program. And so, we do think that that will pick up steam as we roll it out to the organization, but I would say sitting here right now, most of that $50 million to $70 million for year-one is going to come out of the margin bucket. Collin Mings : Okay. And then, switching to Russell, can you just may be touch a little bit more on the AVO process and where that stands, again, recognizing that is fluid, but there was also a number of large sales in 2019? Are there any other large transactions that you are going to be pursuing in kind of the foreseeable future? Or you feel like a lot of the heavy lifting as far as the non-core asset sales is complete for at least for now? Russell Hagen : So, I\u2019ll talk to the AVO and then I\u2019ll talk to kind of your second question on large transactions. You know, the AVO process, as you\u2019re aware, that\u2019s a \u2013 really an evergreen process. So, we\u2019re constantly evaluating our timberlands to determine, you know, for the best owner of that particular tract or if we can capture a higher value by selling it through our AVO process. So, as we\u2019ve noted, we have about \u2013 you know, at the beginning of the year, we had 1.6 million acres identified in the AVO process that we would take to market over the next 10 to 15 years. You know as I stated earlier, our goal is to have a sustainable business over time. So, as far as large transactions, you know, I\u2019m not going to comment on our \u2013 on kind of our future expectations related to large transactions, but you know, I'll reiterate, you know, even on the AVO process, we still look even on a broader basis across the portfolio and make sure that the timberlands that we own are returning the highest value and we get a good return on assets. And so, as we\u2019ve demonstrated in the past, we have sold out of markets that are not strategic to us for the long-term, but I think as we look at our portfolio today, we have no immediate plans. Collin Mings : Thank you both. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line Mark Weintraub with Seaport. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Two follow ups really. The first, thank you for that information on the Western harvest, by the way, that\u2019s completely consistent with the presentation you did back in December 2016, where you show exactly as you laid out. That same presentation, it shows that the Southern harvest would likely be increasing during the [2017 through 2026 time horizon] and I realized maybe there are some sales of acreage, etcetera perhaps, but what\u2019s the outlook for the Southern harvest relative to the levels we saw in 2019 and what you seem to be suggesting for 2020? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark, you know, and those are always fluid, you know, through the real estate programs. You get puts and takes here and there. You know, we're not in a position right now I think to give public guidance on the long-term other than to say, you know, in 2020 for the South, we\u2019re looking at comparable. You know, we do have a little bit heavier mix to fiber for 2020, but I \u2013 you know it's going to be pretty consistent within the range that we have in 2020. Mark Weintraub : And maybe it\u2019s not a fair question on a spot moment, but is the typo \u2013 is there any reason why the general direction you would have been expecting a couple years ago wouldn't still be applicable today? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think, you know, over time certainly as we have new generations of seedlings come ready for harvest, you\u2019d expect the volumes to go up over time. So, you know, directionally I don't think anything has changed. You know the timing of it, you have a little bit of up and down on any particular year to basis, but directionally over time, I don't think anything's changed. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And on the European spruce salvage wood, any intelligence at this point as to how long this issue is likely to be with us? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, you know, I\u2019ll tell you what I do know and then what I don't know and I'll start with what we think we know, which is, you know, unlike what we saw with the mountain pine beetle in British Columbia, the spruce beetle in Europe seems to leave that wood salvageable for a much lower period and I think the general consensus that\u2019s building is, you know, one to three years on the stump is really as long as it's viable after you see that damage. The question that's harder to answer frankly is, you know, when is the infestation going to abate. And so, I don't know that we have a definitive view or if anyone has a definitive view on when that damage spruce beetle wood is going to stop growing across Europe. And so, you know, I do think our view is we've seen the geographies where you have that impacted wood acting speedily to try to get out in front of it and salvage as much of that timber as they can, but as a practical matter, there are limits on how much you can do that. So, you know, it's hard to say how long it's going to last when you really start seeing the spruce beetle die off. I think it will be a limited time period after that when you should see the volume start to slow down. Mark Weintraub : And so, is it fair to surmise recognizing lots of uncertainty here that it\u2019s probably going to be with us for a couple of years, but then at some point in time, you end up having less wood coming from Europe than even prior to the infestation beginning, is that how to think about it? Devin Stockfish : That\u2019s correct. And that\u2019s how we\u2019re viewing it. You know we\u2019re going to \u2013 I think this is going to be with us for, you know, a year or two, but, you know, as you say, it's important to remember when that volume goes away, it\u2019s going to have to be filled in from somewhere else. And so, when you have that significant amount of wood that goes out of the system, it is going to change kind of the global supply chains for log supply. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Devin Stockfish : Yes, thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thanks, good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Steve Chercover : So, first question, on your website, Montana is included in the Western US acreage, but the volume is evidently coming out of the Northern fee harvest, so is that because the log prices in Montana are closer to Northeast values? Russell Hagen : You know, Steve, when we actually put together the regions, at time of the merger, we had put that Montana property in that Northern region. And so, we\u2019ve always reported that Montana property in the Northern region and then Washington and Oregon in the Western region. It is a different, you know, product, a little different pricing, so that\u2019s just how we set it up at the time of the merger. Steve Chercover : Okay. So, from a financial standpoint both of \u2013 all that land is Northern. So, I wanted to get a sense on the impact then of \u2013 the financial impact on the sales, would it be fair to say that given the aggregate sales price of $445 million, the EBITDA was around $20 million. Is that [indiscernible]? Russell Hagen : No. I think in the last call what we had mentioned is full-year 2018 was about $19 million and you\u2019ll see full-year 2019 at about $15 million, so we would expect that Montana and Michigan to be about half of that number. Steve Chercover : Okay, thanks for that. And just one other quick one, can you elaborate what you mean by innovation? Is it new product development in wood products? Or is it along the lines of log optimizations by end-market? Devin Stockfish : Yes. You know, I\u2019d say the majority of that is operational innovation. So, that's things like leveraging technology within the mills or out in the woods to drive down log and haul cost, to optimize how we build roads, to, you know, mechanized things in the mills. That\u2019s the majority of it at this point. You know we do \u2013 in our Wood Products business, we do product innovation as well, but when we talk about the majority of the innovation work that we've done here over the last year or two has really been more around operational innovation. Steve Chercover : Got it. Okay, thank you both. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Russell Hagen : You\u2019re welcome. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning guys. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Paul Quinn : Hey, just have a question around CapEx and thanks for the detailed break down into the buckets, but that $235 million you\u2019re spending on Wood Products maybe if you could highlight some of the bigger project? And is there any volume gains that you expect to get over time on some of these projects going forward? Devin Stockfish : Yes. You know with the $235 million, which is down about $15 million from 2019 and partially that's just a reflection of the fact that as we finish up on the Dierks and Millport, capital projects were \u2013 which were much larger in scale, we just have a larger number of smaller activity in the CapEx bucket across Wood Products. And so, I don't have anything, you know, significant to highlight of the, you know, Millport or Dierks magnitude. It\u2019s really just a lot of all are CapEx projects that are really focused on, you know, driving down cost, improving reliability, and really driving efficiencies in the mill set. You\u2019ll get some incremental around the margins volume pick up with some of those, but, you know, the volume increase really isn\u2019t the primary focus of our capital programs at present. Paul Quinn : Okay, thanks for that. And then, just maybe I \u2013 just \u2013 trying to understand what\u2019s going on in Timberlands transactions, haven't seen that many transactions. We\u2019ve had, you know, interest rates go up in 2018 and then come down 2019 and 2020. I suspect that\u2019s had some kind of effect on valuations, maybe you could just help me understand what\u2019s going on in the market? Russell Hagen : Sure. This is Russell. You know on 2019, based on kind of our listing of all the transactions, we\u2019re expecting to hit about $1.8 billion and we really didn't see any big deals like we saw in 2018. We saw probably four deals in 2019 over $100 million, and then, remainder were small and medium deals. So about 3 million acres looks like it's going to trade in 2019, so that's about 2%, 2.5% of the investable market. That seems kind of on par with what we've seen over the last few years. I think as we look into 2020, I would expect we would break that $2 billion transaction value number. And when you take the Poke deal, and then, the recent announcement we made on the Montana deal, you add about $800 million, and so, it's pretty strong start of the year given we\u2019re in January.  As far as timber values, I would say they remained strong even with the soft product pricing in 2019. We really didn\u2019t see big value swings in the timberland values and I think that reflects more of the longer term nature that the investors have in this space and companies have in this space. So, you know, we\u2019re still seeing a strong flow of capital to good deals and the right deals and quality timberlands remain in high demand. Yes, and as we\u2019ve said in the past, we\u2019re in a pretty advantage position. We have timberlands in every major wood basket in the United States and we have the opportunity to see every transaction and so. You know we\u2019re active, but we\u2019re also very disciplined in our acquisition strategy. Paul Quinn : Thanks for the help. Good luck. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Russell Hagen : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes in the line of Chip Dillon with Vertical Research. Chip Dillon : Hi, good morning. Thanks for all the details. You know, as you look at the long-term future, Japan's population obviously is shrinking and obviously there are other parts of Asia where demand could certainly get better for your timber. How do you think about those long-term trends? I mean have you done some work on where you think five, 10 years from now you'll see both of, you know, Japan and other Asian markets, especially as it really has a big impact on your Western Timberland profitability? Devin Stockfish : Yes, absolutely. We do spend a lot of time doing analytics around that and, you know, with respect to Japan, you're absolutely right. The demographics are such that the population is declining and that is clearly going to have an impact on housing over time. You know, I think a couple things that may mitigate the impact on us however or again, you know, our focus is primarily that post and beam market and I think that is going to hold share and pick up share of overall housing starts in Japan over time. And so, I think the impact in us will be less than on kind of the stick frame. The second thing I would say is, you know, just like in the United States and Europe, Japan is looking for opportunities to do more commercial and multi-story buildings out of wood. And so, I think there's an opportunity to pick up share on that front as well to mitigate some of the impacts from population decline on housing. But you're right, in a broader sense, you know, Japan's population is not growing. There are other economies across Asia where we do see growing populations. And so whether you're thinking China or India or some of the other Southeast Asian markets that are experiencing growth, we\u2019ve spent a lifetime on the ground in all of those markets. We have, you know, in China in particular a pretty strong customer base. And so, you know, one of our focus areas is to continue to grow market in China and ultimately other markets for some of those higher end Douglas fir products, and, you know, we think over time, we\u2019ll make good progress on that. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens Inc. Mark Connelly : Thank you. If we assume that the labor issues in construction persists, do you think we\u2019re going to start seeing builders more aggressively embrace either prefab components or some other labor reduction? Or is there enough other issues like lot availability that they just don't have enough incentive to change the way they operate yet? Devin Stockfish : Well, I do you think that you're starting to see some of the builders, particularly the larger builders, embrace panelization, off-site construction activities and I do think that trend will continue. There are limits on how high that can go, but I do think we've reached a point where, you know, the labor constraints have caused many of the builders to really start to look for other options to mitigate that challenge. So, I do you think you're going to see that grow. The labor availability I think still remains one of the biggest challenges for the builders in both, you know, just meeting the construction needs, but also with the affordability pace. And so, I do think that they're going to continue to look for ways to mitigate those labor challenges. Mark Connelly : So, is there an opportunity for Weyerhaeuser in that to get involved in more of that process? Devin Stockfish : You know, I think in the near term, you know, the biggest opportunity for us is to stay close to those in-customers and the builders and various folks throughout the channel that are doing that work. I think our biggest opportunity short-term is just to be a key supplier making sure we understand, you know, what the needs are in those panelized construction activities and be a good solid partner for them. I don't anticipate us getting into panelized manufacturing here in the near term. You know longer term, obviously, we\u2019ll continue to watch the market and if our view changes on the ability to create value in that space, you know, we wouldn\u2019t necessarily rule that out, but I don't think that's a short-term priority for us. Mark Connelly : Okay, that makes a lot of sense. Just one other question, with all the supply distortions and issues we had in the South last year, do you think private landowners are caught up on the land they wanted to sell? Or is there still a backlog there [indiscernible]? Russell Hagen : Yes, this is Russell. Pardon me. Mark Connelly : Sorry, I said land. I meant stumpage. Russell Hagen : On the stumpage side. You know I would say that probably the markets were a little slower last year as far as getting contractors and broker dealers out onto those non-industrial private lands. I think that's what you're referring to. Mark Connelly : Yes. Russell Hagen : So, we don't have a real clean gauge on what those volumes are, but I would expect that, you know, that will still be an area of focus for the non-industrial privates probably coming into this year and maybe the following years. Mark Connelly : Okay, very helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our last question will come from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. John Babcock : Hi, good morning. It is actually John Babcock on the line for George. Just wanted to thank you for taking my questions. Just starting out, I was wondering if you could talk about which products are likely to see the incremental benefit from kind of this new OpEx set up. And also, you know, if you could kind of give some weighting as to, you know, which product lines that might be helpful too. Devin Stockfish : Yes, you know I think just at a high level, you know, we would anticipate it\u2019s kind of going to be evenly split between Wood Products and Timberlands. you know I think one of the differences that we\u2019re looking at from OpEx 2.0 is we\u2019re really looking to expand it and how we measure it beyond just the businesses defined opportunities even at a functional level, increase the level of cross business OpEx that we\u2019re trying to drive. You know, so that may -- you know that may change how the buckets are allocated a little bit around the margins, but going in, we would anticipate that would be kind of half-and-half Wood Products and Timberlands. John Babcock : Thank you. And then, can you review the key point as to, you know, why the Montana timberland sales made sense from both the strategic and valuation standpoint? Russell Hagen : Sure. This is Russell. There's two things I guess I would point out on that transaction. You know the first is, you know, over the last number years, we've been very active in capturing value on those lands. We\u2019ve done conservation sales, higher and better use sales. You know, we\u2019ve also done some timber transactions. So, we really have a lot of opportunities to understand the market and kind of with the future value that land would be to us. So, the second is, when we go through our evaluation process, it\u2019s very detailed and robust. So, we look at a number of things when coming to evaluation on a particular property and we look at the markets, we look at stocking levels, age class, growing cycles, PC mix, you know, cost inputs. Those are all taken into consideration when we assess the value, but also when we assessed fit for our broader portfolio strategy. So, you know, based on our experience in these markets and in our expectations and what we\u2019ve achieved as far as capturing value on the portfolio today, we are very comfortable with how that sale fits into our broader strategy and we\u2019re very pleased with the price we\u2019re receiving for the timberlands. John Babcock : Yes, thank you. That\u2019s all I have. Devin Stockfish : Alright. Well, I believe that was the final question. So, thank you to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser Company. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

I would now like to hand the conference over to Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations and Enterprise Planning. Thank you. Please go ahead. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Jason. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2020 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call.  We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is well and staying safe. I want to begin this morning by sending my heartfelt thanks to our Weyerhaeuser employees. We have remarkable people working for this company, and I'm extremely proud of their unwavering commitment to safety, operational excellence and serving our customers as we manage through this uncertain and challenging environment.  This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter results and announced further actions to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility in light of the global COVID-19 pandemic. Because our markets have evolved rapidly since the end of the first quarter, I will highlight our first quarter results and then turn my focus to current business conditions and our actions in response to COVID-19.  Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $150 million or $0.20 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Excluding a $12 million benefit from special items, we generated earnings of $138 million or $0.18 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $413 million in the first quarter, an improvement of nearly 60% compared with the fourth quarter and 13% higher than a year ago.  I'll begin the discussion of our results with some high-level comments on our first quarter business conditions. U.S. housing activity started the year very strong. Total starts averaged 1.6 million in January and February, supported by low unemployment, favorable mortgage rates and increased builder focus on bringing affordable product to market. By mid-March, however, our customers began to express some concern about the effects of social distancing mandates and stay-at-home orders, and housing activity started to weaken in certain markets. Although housing starts declined to 1.2 million for the month, our sales volumes remained steady through late March. Against this backdrop, each of our businesses delivered strong first quarter operating results despite the rapidly changing upstream market conditions.  Turning to Timberlands on Pages 6 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $105 million to first quarter earnings and $173 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased $15 million compared with the fourth quarter. In Western Timberlands, EBITDA increased $20 million compared with the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations and volumes for Japan export logs increased and average domestic sales realizations improved modestly.  In the western domestic market, improving demand and pricing for Douglas fir lumber drove solid demand for logs through late March and pricing for domestic logs strengthened. Logging conditions were favorable and mill inventories were adequate. Our fee harvest volumes increased slightly and costs improved seasonally due to reduced road and forestry costs as well as lower per unit logging and hauling costs.  Turning to our export markets. Log sales volumes to Japan increased substantially in the first quarter, and average sales realizations improved modestly. While Japanese housing starts were down approximately 10% year-to-date following the implementation of the consumption tax in the fourth quarter, demand from our customers who serve the post-and-beam market increased due to limited availability of Canadian export logs and reduced imports of competing European laminated beams.  As expected, our China export sales volumes declined significantly in the first quarter as we flexed our volumes to the domestic market to capture higher-margin opportunities. Softwood log inventory to Chinese ports nearly doubled in the first quarter to 7.1 million cubic meters. Takeaway was weak as sawmills and construction sites closed for the Lunar New Year holiday and did not begin to reopen until COVID-related restrictions eased in mid-March. Log supply from New Zealand and Europe remained abundant for most of the first quarter, and our sales realizations decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter. Relative to the year ago quarter, our total western log export revenue declined due to significantly lower sales volumes to China, partially offset by higher volumes to Japan.  Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased $7 million compared with the fourth quarter. Demand remained steady through late March as unseasonably wet weather reduced grade log availability across many southern markets. Our fee harvest volume declined 7% compared with the fourth quarter, primarily due to seasonally lower stumpage sales. Average sales realizations declined slightly due to mix.  Comparing our overall Southern Timberlands first quarter results with the year ago period, EBITDA declined by $12 million due to lower fee harvest volumes and modestly lower average sales realizations.  In Northern Timberlands, EBITDA was comparable with the fourth quarter and $4 million lower than the first quarter a year ago. Fee harvest volumes declined due to the sale of our Michigan Timberlands, and average sales realizations improved primarily due to mix. Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $36 million to first quarter earnings and $101 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $64 million higher than the fourth quarter and $5 million lower than the year ago period. Compared with the fourth quarter, real estate sales were significantly higher due to an increase in the number of acres sold. We experienced strong interest in real estate across our markets throughout much of the first quarter. In Energy and Natural Resources, construction materials volumes were seasonally lower. Average price per acre declined, and average land basis as a percentage of real estate sales, was higher due to the mix of properties sold. First quarter real estate sales included some low productivity acreage in Southern Oregon that we acquired with the Plum Creek merger.  Wood Products, Pages 11 and 12. Wood Products contributed $134 million to first quarter earnings and $184 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased $74 million or almost 70% compared with the fourth quarter and was 60% higher than the first quarter a year ago on improved commodity realizations and higher sales volumes across all product lines.  Our first quarter Wood Products performance was outstanding. Our relentless focus on safety and efforts to drive reliability and cost structure improvements continues to yield positive results and has never been more important than it is today. I'm extremely proud of the progress that our teams continue to make on the operational excellence front.  EBITDA for lumber increased $36 million compared with the fourth quarter. Strong housing activity drove improved demand and benchmark pricing trended higher through much of the first quarter. Our sales volumes improved modestly and average lumber realizations improved 7% over the fourth quarter.  In the first quarter, our lumber operations delivered the lowest quarterly controllable manufacturing cost on record and also set a new monthly record in March. Compared with the first quarter a year ago, lumber EBITDA improved by $32 million due to improved realizations, higher sales volumes and lower per unit manufacturing costs.  In OSB, EBITDA improved $26 million compared with the fourth quarter. Realizations improved significantly, and sales volumes were moderately higher. Our OSB business delivered the lowest quarterly controllable unit manufacturing cost in our history. On average, the benchmark OSB composite price increased 22% compared with the fourth quarter.  Our average realizations increased 14% as the length of our order files creates a lag between published and realized pricing. Compared with the year ago quarter, OSB EBITDA increased $26 million. Average sales realizations increased 10%. Fiber costs declined, and sales volumes were higher. Engineered Wood Products EBITDA improved by $10 million compared with the fourth quarter. Sales volumes for solid section and I-joists were moderately higher due to strong construction activity. Per unit manufacturing cost improved relative to the fourth quarter with seasonally higher operating rates. Average sales realizations for both solid section products and I-joists decreased by 1% due to mix. Compared with the first quarter a year ago, EBITDA improved $4 million due to higher sales volumes and lower fiber and unit manufacturing costs. Distribution EBITDA increased by $4 million due to higher sales volumes and improved product margins compared with the fourth quarter. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA increased by $8 million due to higher sales volumes, partially offset by higher delivery and warehouse costs.  Turning now to operational excellence. In the first quarter, each of our businesses made good progress against our $50 million to $70 million OpEx target for 2020, and we remain focused on delivering industry-leading performance across a wide range of market conditions. This commitment to operational excellence and having the right cost structure has never been more essential, and our focus is unwavering.  Let me turn now to the recent deterioration of industry-wide business conditions in the second quarter and the actions that we've taken to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility and maintain our capital structure in light of the COVID-19 pandemic. Then I'll turn it over to Russell to discuss our financial position and second quarter outlook. At the end of March, the rapid deterioration in macroeconomic conditions began to translate into weaker demand across our value chain. In April, as stay-at-home orders were enacted across the nation and unemployment began to rise, our homebuilder customers started to report steep declines in buyer traffic and increasing cancellation rates. Likewise, many of our building products dealer customers communicated that they were experiencing sharply lower order files.  While residential construction was designated an essential industry in most jurisdictions, allowing for continued construction activity, the impacts of stay-at-home orders and general economic uncertainty on potential homebuyers translated into significant slowing of housing activity in late March and throughout April. And obviously, the impacts in regions where state and local restrictions prohibited construction were even more pronounced. Although takeaway from our home improvement warehouse customers has remained solid, the pandemic-related reductions in construction activity have resulted in a significant drop-off in overall demand for wood products. Across our Timberlands segment, demand for fiber logs has held up well. But many domestic sawlog customers have curtailed production in response to weaker wood products demand. In total, we have noted curtailments at over 100 customer destinations, reducing sawlog demand by approximately 25% in April versus March.  For our Real Estate and ENR segment, social distancing and other measures have curtailed real estate broker activity and increased the time required to finance, close and record transactions.  So in summary, we have seen a steady decline across all of our markets over the last month. Importantly, however, our businesses were well prepared to rapidly respond to the changing market dynamics. In Wood Products, we've reduced operating capacity by 15% to 35% across our manufacturing businesses to align our production with customer demand, and we quickly pulled back on discretionary capital expenditures and other operating costs.  We have continued to safely deliver on our value proposition of quality, reliability and logistics expertise despite the broad social and economic disruptions. This has further enhanced our position as a preferred supplier for our customers. In Timberlands, we opportunistically flexed volume into the China market in April to capitalize on improved demand and pricing. We also leveraged our vertical integration, reoptimizing log procurement across our Wood Products segment to facilitate increased fee harvest consumption by our internal mills. These actions offset all of our demand reduction in the U.S. West for the month of April. However, they mitigated only a portion of the reduction we're seeing in the southern demand.  In light of these market conditions, we are reducing our planned 2020 southern harvest volume by approximately 10% to match our supply with the lower demand. We will continue to closely monitor market conditions and take the necessary steps to align our operations and production levels to evolving customer demand. In general, current economic data and forecast lead us to believe that our near-term business conditions will remain challenged for some period of time. Key indicators that we are monitoring include unprecedented levels of weekly unemployment claims, rapidly rising mortgage forbearance requests, record declines in consumer sentiment and builder confidence, mortgage purchase applications substantially below year ago levels, tighter mortgage credit availability, and estimates for a continued near-term contraction in U.S. GDP.  Further, there continues to be a high level of uncertainty regarding the duration and magnitude of the societal and economic impacts of this COVID-19 pandemic. The time line for effective medical treatments and vaccines is unclear. Recent steps toward economic reopening are positive, but we expect the trajectory of the economic recovery will be bumpy and gradual. This drives significant uncertainty regarding the medium-term outlook for U.S. housing activity. We anticipate that pricing and demand will remain choppy across our markets for much of 2020. Once stay-at-home orders are lifted, our customers tell us they anticipate a near-term pickup in activity as builders complete in-process homes and work through pre-pandemic order backlogs. However, following that immediate surge, most are anticipating lower sales and construction activity until employment and consumer confidence materially improve.  In light of these expectations, we're taking actions to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility and maintain our capital structure during this unprecedented time. First, we're cutting 2020 capital expenditures by $90 million. Second, we're reducing nonessential expenses by $55 million. This includes G&A and operating expense reductions across our businesses and corporate functions. Third, we will defer $25 million of federal payroll tax payments until 2021. Fourth, our senior management team and Board of Directors have elected to reduce their compensation for the remainder of 2020. I will reduce my base salary by 30%. Our Board will reduce its fees by 20% and the remainder of our senior management team will reduce their base salaries by 10%. And finally, our Board of Directors is temporarily suspending the quarterly dividend. The dividend suspension is an extremely difficult decision but one that we believe is prudent given deteriorating end market conditions and a highly uncertain economic environment.  I want to be clear that returning cash to shareholders through a sustainable dividend is a core part of our balanced capital allocation philosophy. The Board will regularly evaluate opportunities to reinitiate an appropriate quarterly cash dividend as soon as practicable. This evaluation will take into account a number of variables, including the broader macroeconomic environment, our market conditions and customer demand as well as the company's cash flow, liquidity and leverage. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss financial items and our second quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning. While we're expecting challenging market conditions until the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic recede, we are confident that the actions we have taken will enable us to maintain a strong financial position through this unprecedented time. We have a solid balance sheet, a competitive cost structure, and our 11 million acres of Timberlands provide strong asset coverage. We hold investment-grade credit ratings and remained well in compliance with our debt covenants. Moreover, our trees will continue to grow and generate value now and into the future, regardless of the economic conditions.  In the first quarter, we took several steps to enhance our financial flexibility. First, we refinanced our $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to capture more favorable pricing and extend its maturity to 2025. Second, we increased our cash on hand through a precautionary $550 million draw on our revolver. Today, this facility still has $950 million of available capacity remaining. Third, we issued $750 million of 4% notes through a public bond offering with the net proceeds to be used to repay our 2021 debt maturities. And fourth, we completed the sale of our Montana Timberlands for $145 million in cash. We originally anticipated this transaction would close in the second quarter.  These activities are reflected on Page 14, which summarizes our key financial items for the quarter. We ended the first quarter with a cash balance of $1.4 billion, excluding the cash earmarked for repayment of the 2021 maturities and the $550 million draw on our revolver, which we will repay when appropriate. We had approximately $170 million of cash on hand at the end of the first quarter. This is in line with our typical cash balance.  Our gross debt outstanding increased during the quarter due to the bond offering and the revolver raw. Subsequent to the end of the first quarter, we submitted notice that this month, we will be redeeming our $569 million notes due in March 2021. Following this repayment, we have a total debt of approximately $6.8 billion. We intend to repay $150 million debt note in 2021 at maturity. After these repayments, we have no additional debt maturities until 2023. These actions are consistent with our strategy to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility in this uncertain environment.  Turning to cash flow. Cash from operations during the first quarter was $86 million. First quarter cash flow is typically lower due to seasonal working capital increases and higher quarterly interest payments. Cash from investing totaled $441 million. This includes $362 million of cash from the maturity of our last variable interest entity and $145 million from our Montana Timberlands sale.  Our capital expenditures for the first quarter totaled $68 million. As Devin mentioned, we are reducing our 2020 CapEx by $90 million to help preserve liquidity, $75 million of reductions will come from wood products, where we are eliminating discretionary capital projects and cutting back to the low end of the maintenance capital range, $10 million will come from Timberlands and $5 million from corporate. Our revised guidance for total 2020 CapEx is approximately $270 million. This includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs [Technical Difficulty]. Can you still hear us? So I assume we can be heard. We'll keep going. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Let's continue. Russell Hagen : All right. looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter and the full year are presented on Pages 15 and 16. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the first quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, domestic mill log inventories were above target in early April as lumber mills reduced production in response to the uncertain market environment. By month end, log inventories came into balance as customers limited log purchases to align with planned production.  As Devin mentioned, our Western Timberlands team was able to leverage our scale, customer diversity and collaboration with our mills to offset all of the demand reductions we experienced in April. As a result, even with current market conditions, we expect our second quarter domestic log sales volumes will be comparable with the first quarter.  Average log sales realizations are expected to be lower than first quarter levels, and forestry and road spending will increase as we enter the spring and summer months. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, a significant amount of residential construction activity has been curtailed due to COVID-19 outbreak. Demand for logs remained steady in April but is expected to soften as the quarter progresses. We expect our second quarter Japanese export log sales volumes and realizations will be lower than the first quarter. We expect our Chinese export log sales volumes and realizations to increase in the second quarter.  In early March, Chinese log importers began to apply for and were granted exemptions from tariffs imposed on U.S. softwood logs. As COVID-19-related restrictions eased in China, construction activity has resumed and log takeaways returned to more normal levels. Disruptions to the supply of competing logs out of New Zealand and Europe, coupled with additional takeaway, has driven improved demand and pricing for our western export logs.  We anticipate minimal effect on second quarter market conditions from the recent easing of restrictions of the New Zealand forestry operations. In the south, manufacturing shift reductions and curtailments reduced demand for our grade logs by over 30% in the month of April. Demand for fiber logs remained stable as increased production of hygiene products offsets weaker demand for printing and writing papers. We expect our second quarter fee harvest volumes will decline approximately 5% to 10% compared with the first quarter. Average log sales realizations will be slightly lower than the first quarter, primarily due to mix as we expect a greater proportion of fiber log sales as we continue to shift to more thinning activities.  We are seeing increased interest in exports of our southern yellow pine logs to China as waivers are granted for the ongoing 25% tariff. In the North, second quarter fee harvest volumes will be lower than the first quarter due to the spring breakup season. As Devin indicated, we expect to reduce our southern fee harvest by approximately 10% this year to align with our production with reduced sawlog demand. As a result, we are updating our total fee harvest guidance to between 33 million and 34 million tons for the full year 2020. We do not anticipate material changes to our western fee harvest volumes.  Clearly, second quarter activity is highly uncertain. Assuming current market conditions persist, we anticipate earnings and adjusted EBITDA for our Timberlands business will be approximately $50 million to $60 million lower than the first quarter. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA for this segment will be approximately $20 million lower than the second quarter of 2019 due to fewer real estate acres sold. We expect second quarter land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be moderately higher than the first quarter 2020.  In real estate, we continue to experience demand and interest in our properties with social distancing and other measures have curtailed broker activity and lengthened the time required to finance, close and record transactions. Demand for smaller HBU transactions remain steady. The volume of larger transactions requiring financing is slowing due to challenging credit availability. In Energy and Natural Resources, second quarter activity has been stable, but we anticipate adjusted EBITDA will decrease as the year progresses due to lower demand for construction materials and reduced interest in new oil and gas leasing activity. As a result, we are lowering our full year adjusted EBITDA guidance for Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources to $200 million. This is a $55 million reduction from our prior guidance.  We continue to anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 55% and 65% for the year. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the first quarter 2020 and the second quarter of 2019. We anticipate significantly lower sales volumes across all product lines in the second quarter. The market demand has deteriorated across our Wood Products businesses due to the economic impacts of COVID-19 and the related reduction in residential construction and large repair and remodel activity.  To align our production with the market demand, in April, we reduced our operating capacity by 20% for lumber and 15% for oriented strand board, and we expect to extend these reductions at similar levels in May. Across our various engineered wood products, we reduced capacity by 15% to 25% in April, and plan to reduce engineered wood products capacity by an additional 10% for the month of May. We will continue to dynamically adjust our production to align with profitable demand. Benchmark pricing for frame and lumber composite and OSB composite have declined approximately $75 and $100, respectively, since early March. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are $25 lower, and current realizations are $20 lower than the first quarter average, respectively.  For oriented strand board, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are $5 higher, and our current sales realizations are $20 lower than the first quarter average, respectively. It is important to note that due to the length of our order files, there is a lag between the cash benchmark price and our realizations. As a reminder, at typical operating rates for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB at typical operating rates, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.  For engineered wood products, we expect second quarter average sales realizations will be generally comparable to the first quarter. Page 13 outlines the major components of our first quarter unallocated items. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment was comparable to the fourth quarter 2019. Special items for the first quarter consists of a $12 million benefit from the legal settlement of a legacy insurance coverage matter.  Our noncash, nonoperating pension and postretirement expense was $9 million in the first quarter, and we continue to expect approximately $40 million of expense for the full year 2020. We also continue to expect approximately $30 million of required cash payments related to our pension and postretirement plans. We do not expect to make any contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan. As a reminder, we have reduced our future pension obligations by over $2 billion since 2018, and we have significantly reduced the plan's exposure to market and interest rate volatility by transitioning to a liability-driven investment strategy.  First quarter interest expense was $85 million. We now expect interest expense will be approximately $360 million for the full year 2020 before special items. This incorporates the previously discussed debt transactions and assumes a higher revolver balance as part of the actions to increase cash on hand.  In the second quarter, we expect to record a net pretax charge of $11 million, which will be reported as a special item as part of the early redemption of our $569 million note. I'll close my comments with taxes. For the second quarter and the full year 2020, we now expect a modest tax benefit due to our current outlook for the remainder of the year. The tax rate will be sensitive to the level and the mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary for the year.  As previously discussed, the $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution remains in process. We anticipate receiving this refund in early 2021. Now I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thank you, Russell. Although we expect near-term market conditions will be very challenging, I'm highly confident that Weyerhaeuser is well positioned to successfully navigate these unprecedented times. Our strong safety culture and high level of employee engagement enabled us to rapidly implement rigorous safety measures to protect the health and well-being of our employees for the duration of this COVID-19 outbreak.  Our businesses have industry-leading scale, cost structures and supply chain expertise and an unmatched diversity of customers, products and geographic locations. Our teams are agile, innovative and committed to effectively serving our customers. We have an unrivaled portfolio of valuable timberland assets and a wood products business with a proven ability to generate cash through adverse market conditions. And we have acted prudently and decisively to preserve Weyerhaeuser's financial flexibility, maintain our capital structure and ensure we have sufficient liquidity to weather this period.  Looking forward, our confidence in the underlying thesis for the U.S. housing remains strong. In contrast to the period following the Great Recession, U.S. housing is now severely underbuilt, and evolving societal preferences as we emerge from this pandemic are likely to support strong demand for single family homes. We are confident that U.S. housing growth will resume as economic fundamentals stabilize and consumer confidence rebounds, and we are well positioned to capitalize on that trend.  We remain focused on driving long-term value for our shareholders through industry-leading operating performance and disciplined, prudent capital allocation. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Your first question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub from Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Two questions. The first, if you could just walk us through the thought process on choosing to suspend the dividend as opposed to resetting it to a lower level? And maybe as we think about as it gets reinstated, is that likely to be a gradual increasing process? Or do you wait until you're at a point to restore it to what you think's an appropriate ongoing level for the cycle? And then real quickly, too, if there's any help you can give us in modeling or thinking through absorption of fixed cost issues as you are taking significant volume out, particularly in the Wood Products business? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure, Mark. Well, I'll take the first two questions, and then I'll pass it over to Russell on the fixed cost question. Really, we look at this through the context of the macro environment and our market conditions. And really, as I mentioned, just an unprecedented situation in terms of what's going on with the pandemic, broad swaths of the economy being locked down. We're seeing historic levels of unemployment, GDP contraction in Q1, expectations that it's going to be much more dramatic in Q2, consumer confidence dropping, and really no clear path on the trajectory of recovery. And so really, we're expecting a significant erosion in housing and residential construction as well as, to some extent, larger remodel activity here in the near term. I think we're in the early stages of understanding what that's going to look like. It may get worse for a while. And so we're expecting that that's going to result in a very challenged and choppy pricing and demand environment for our products for much of 2020.  And our view is that the full impacts from the housing slowdown won't be seen for a while longer, just given the builders and contractors are working through existing backlogs. They're finishing up projects that are under construction. So there's likely to be a bit of a lag before we see the full impacts of the reduced wood products demand. So just a lot of uncertainty around how this is going to play out over the next few quarters. Again, we're expecting a challenging environment for most of 2020.  And so in light of that, we elected to suspend the dividend as a temporary measure to help preserve our liquidity and financial flexibility. It was obviously an extremely difficult decision. Returning cash to shareholders through a sustainable dividend remains a core part of our balanced capital allocation philosophy. However, under the circumstances, we believe this is the right action, a prudent action to take at this time, just given current business conditions, our expectations regarding a very challenged environment over the next several quarters and a high degree of uncertainty.  And so we're taking what we believe to be an appropriate and proactive set of actions to preserve liquidity and financial flexibility, and also to ensure that we maintain an appropriate level of leverage. And so that was the thought process.  In terms of the time line, just given the uncertainty, I think it's difficult right now to determine just how this is going to impact our markets over the next several quarters. So we're monitoring that closely. The Board is going to really look to see firm evidence of stabilization and recovery in our business conditions and cash flow. More specifically, we're going to be looking at a number of factors, including market conditions, customer demand, broader economic environment as well as the read-through on our cash flow, liquidity position and leverage ratios.  But I want to make this point really clear, we are committed to reinitiating a quarterly cash dividend as soon as practicable, and the Board is going to continue to evaluate that on a regular basis.  In terms of the level, we're going to look to reinitiate it at a level that is appropriate and sustainable in the context of our cash flow and our business conditions. And so I think we would be open to doing that in stages. We would expect to reinitiate the dividend at a level that it can be sustainably increased over time as markets improve. So Russell, do you want to touch on the fixed cost question? Russell Hagen : Sure, Mark. So when you look across the business, our fixed cost structure is about 15% kind of in total. For wood products, wood fiber's the largest input cost. Lumber, it's about 2/3 of the cash costs. OSB is about half the cash cost and the other half is resin and wax. And then engineered wood products is a little less. Again, wood fiber costs and then resin and waxes.  Beyond fiber, labor is the next largest variable cost. And so then you get down to fixed overhead in our manufacturing operations, it's relatively small. Typically a mill manager, utilities, taxes, et cetera, so it's a pretty low overhead, a pretty low fixed cost structure. Timberlands, we have very low input and maintenance costs. So you really aren't incurring any costs until you cut the timber. And then in real estate, our fixed costs are really minimal, closer to like 10%, which is mostly labor because we outsource really a majority of our broker network. Mark Weintraub : Super. Just one clarification. I'm sorry, that 15%, was that for wood products? Or was that for the overall company, the first allusion to 15%? Russell Hagen : That's the overall company. Wood products is probably more like 18%. And then timberlands is probably right about 15%. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. John Babcock : This is actually John Babcock on the line for George. I just wanted to start out. I was wondering if you can kind of remind us what is kind of different about the southern markets versus the west, such that you are cutting harvest by 10% in the south, but with no changes in the west. I assume the export markets may have something to do with that. But then kind of the next level to the question is also if you could kind of dig a little bit more into the reduction in operating expenses and what makes that up. And also, provide a little bit more color on where you're reducing capital spending, that would be helpful. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure. Well, you're right. It's a different market dynamic in the west than it is in the south. The west is fundamentally a more tensioned wood basket, and we have a diverse set of markets that we can flex volume to. And as I mentioned earlier, really, we have the domestic third party market. We have our internal mills, and then we have the export markets out of the west. And so as we saw the third-party domestic demand drop, we were able to flex additional volume to that export market. And so we anticipate that we'll be able to continue to move our volumes in the west at good margins. And so we don't anticipate a harvest reduction there.  South, a little bit different story. You don't have that same market outlet to the export markets. I will say just as an aside, we have seen the China export market start up again in the south as those tariffs have fallen off, but it's a really small percentage of our overall harvest volume. So really, when you see that domestic third-party mill consumption in the south go down dramatically, that's really what's driving the reduction.  And we come to that conclusion really by doing a wood basket-by-wood basket analysis of demand, and that 10% is really just a roll-up of that work. In terms of -- what was it -- remind me what the next question was there, John? John Babcock : Yes. Just if you could provide detail on the operating expenses that you're planning to reduce as well as the CapEx reductions. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure. In terms of the operating expenses, it really just cuts across the entirety of the company. It covers things from the obvious like reduced travel and entertainment to deferred IT projects, controlling other nondiscretionary spend really all across the entirety of the company. In terms of the CapEx, the majority of that CapEx came out of the wood products CapEx budget. And the rationale there was we're just going to defer the discretionary capital projects and really take that down, as Russell mentioned, to the bottom end of the range of our sustaining and maintenance capital range. And so those projects that we're deferring are good projects, high-return projects. We'll get to those in the future, but I felt that, that was the prudent action to take just given the current environment. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Brian Maguire from Goldman Sachs. Derrick Laton : It's Derrick Laton on for Brian. Just a follow-up on the comments on the southern log market and the 10% reduction in the harvest for this year. I think you said maybe the demand was down about 30% in April, if that was right. And then if that's the case, then what gives you the confidence that 10% is the right cut here for 2020? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think a couple of things. First of all, if you think about the market in total, we have the fiber market and the grade market. In the fiber market, that has held up fairly well. You think about paper towel, toilet paper, the hygiene market. Demand in that segment has remained relatively strong. So the fiber market has held up fairly well. So really, what we're looking at is in the grade market. And I think one of the advantages to our system and the vertical integration that we have is we do have a little bit more flexibility when we see that third-party domestic demand fall off. We have the ability to flex additional volume into our own internal mills. And so that really gave us the flexibility to take the harvest levels down less than the overall demand reduction. Derrick Laton : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just going back to wood products. I appreciate you saying that it's a pretty low fixed cost business. And you guys give the sensitivity to EBITDA quarterly on the price changes for lumber and OSB. But would it be safe to assume that if those are at sort of typical operating rates and where you're sort of looking at operations in the second quarter, that those sensitivity numbers might be a little bit north of what the typical ones you would provide? Russell Hagen : No. The sensitivity numbers that we gave were on what we'd consider our typical operating rates. And so I would expect that as volume comes down, you're going to have to adjust for that. Devin Stockfish : Adjust down. Russell Hagen : Yes, adjust down for that. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde from Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Russell or Devin, I'm just -- I'm curious, are there other liquidity levers that you could pull that you'd be willing to talk about? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, Mark, really, at a high level, the 2 additional places that you can go are either nonstrategic Timberland sales or adding additional leverage to the balance sheet. Speaking to the Timberland sales, obviously, we've generated a significant amount of cash over the last few years through the transactions in Michigan and Montana. We're always looking at ways to optimize the Timberland holdings in the overall value of our portfolio. We're continuing to do that. But we're only going to do transactions that make sense, that create value, looking for the right deal, and we're going to continue to be very disciplined in terms of how we do that. I would note, just as an aside, in terms of those larger transaction, the runway is probably a little bit longer right now just on the ground. Due diligence is a little bit more complicated with the social distancing, title work, et cetera. Some of these things are extending that runway out a little bit.  And then the other avenue is just adding additional leverage. And so as we've said, we think it's important to maintain an investment-grade credit rating. It's part of our overall balanced capital allocation philosophy. I think we saw the benefit of that in our recent bond offering. And so we're really focused on maintaining an appropriate level of leverage in this environment.  Our leverage ratio has been in excess of the 3.5x target as we maintain the dividend through an extended period of low lumber and OSB prices in late '18 and 2019. So we just didn't feel that it's prudent at this point to add additional leverage to the balance sheet in this environment. So those are the 2 primary levers in addition to the CapEx, operating cost and other changes that we announced today. Mark Wilde : Okay. Just two other ones. I wondered first, Devin, if you can talk about how you're handling the production cutbacks, whether you're just trying to roll this across your system or whether you're shutting down or idling like particular mills. And then the other thing I'm curious about is just what you're seeing from your distribution business in terms of what the channel looks like. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, with respect to the operating posture decisions that we're making, it's really based on a few things. One is the cost structure of the individual mill. And so clearly, we're going to prioritize mills with a lower cost structure or a worse cost structure rather than our lowest cost mills as we make those decisions. We're also on a weekly and, frankly, daily basis looking at sell-through and inventory levels at the mills to make those decisions dynamically depending on what's going on in the market. With respect to the distribution business, obviously, they're very close to the ground in terms of gauging market conditions. Generally speaking, and I think this is really true across all of the products, inventory levels are fairly low, as you would expect. I think people are cautious about building inventories in a very uncertain environment. And so there's just been a lot of purchasing kind of to cover immediate needs. Frankly, we think that's one of the things that we saw that kind of stabilized lumber prices over the last couple of weeks after we saw that initial significant drop, where people were trying to gauge what was going on in the market. People paused buying. I think there was a fair amount of destocking. And what we've seen over the last couple of weeks is people just took their inventory levels down pretty low and had to go out and cover. But I would say on balance, inventory levels are still pretty low across the system. Operator : The next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly from Stephens. Mark Connelly : Two things. You've said for quite a while that you run real estate to generate steady cash but not growing cash. Given your comments, Russell, should we assume that, that sort of $250 million normal target is also subject to review alongside the dividends? Russell Hagen : Yes, Mark, you're correct. I mean, we've kind of set that business at about a $250 million plus run rate. And we still believe that over the long term, once we get through this COVID disruption that, that business will return to that type of a cash flow profile. Mark Connelly : Okay. And the second question is just about small land owners to the south. We were seeing small private owners of land working pretty hard to get their trees cut in the first quarter despite the weather, which leads me to think that they were already looking to raise cash. Do you -- are you expecting that side of the business to curtail as quickly as you do or more than you do? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think with respect to the small landowners, I would expect that they're going to likely be some of the first to turn off their production They don't necessarily have the same delivered model that a lot of the bigger players do. They rely more on stumpage. And so as the mills dial back their consumption, oftentimes that stumpage is one of the first to go. So yes, we would expect that, that would be a segment that would get turned off earlier. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Steve Chercover from D.A. Davidson. Steven Chercover : I wanted to take a little bit different spin on Mark Weintraub's question. We were off to a great start in wood products with better housing late last year, good housing start applications and spiking prices until the end of February. So if we had never heard of COVID, do you think you would have taken any action on your dividend at all? Devin Stockfish : As we think about the way the year started with 1.6 million housing starts in each of those months, that kind of 1.5 million housing start level is really where we had expected this market to be even years ago. And so in that environment, as we showed with our first quarter results, we generate a lot of cash flow out of our businesses. And so certainly, as we think about the ability to generate significant EBITDA across our businesses in that environment, and our commitment to return significant amount of that cash flow back to shareholders, certainly, in that environment, I don't believe we would be taking the actions we announced today by any means. Steven Chercover : Okay. And just wondering why did you mention the fact that Weyerhaeuser will remain in compliance with REIT taxable income, the doctrine? Because presumably, you will be reinstating the dividend in due course and possibly at a lower rate. So why was that necessary to even mention? Russell Hagen : Yes. Steve, this is Russell. I think through the suspension of the dividend, I guess, the question arises, can we meet that 90% minimum distribution required in the REIT income. And so we have no -- we have complete confidence we can manage the distribution requirement and in no way put the REIT status in jeopardy. We did make the dividend payment in the first quarter of $254 million. And then we have net operating losses that we can carry forward to offset any other REIT income in absence of the dividend. Devin Stockfish : I mean, the real answer is we just -- we didn't want there to be any confusion about that fact. So that's why we put it in there. Steven Chercover : You remain a REIT. Got it. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Steven Chercover : Okay. One other question on a different tangent. To the extent that you have sawmills in close proximity to tissue and board mills, which are running flat out, are you seeing a spike in chip or residual prices? And can you take advantage of that by maybe being a little less precise on your cuts? Devin Stockfish : Well, we would -- I don't think it would necessarily be less precise on our cuts. But I -- but certainly, to the extent that the pulp mills are in proximity to sawlog or sawmills that have reduced production and are thereby producing fewer chips, the market for that is stronger. And so we'll certainly take advantage of that. But honestly, in the grand scheme of things, that's really around the margins. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Collin Mings from Raymond James. Collin Mings : Apologize if I missed this when we cut out, but I just wanted to go back to some of the discussions on capital allocation over the near to intermediate term. Just to clarify, will the only focus be on preserving liquidity? Or is there any appetite for share repurchases just given where the stock price is? It sounds like, again, in response to an earlier question, roughly, you kind of highlighted the goal of keeping leverage at a manageable level. But just kind of curious as you think about the alternatives out there where share buybacks might fit in. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, as we've said before, share repurchase can be a good tool for returning cash to shareholders under the right circumstances. And certainly, we believe the underlying value of the company is not fully reflected in the current stock price. But we would balance share repurchase against other capital allocation priorities. And I think as conditions improve, we're likely to prioritize reinitiating the cash dividend over share repurchase. Collin Mings : Got it. Just going to the ENR guidance as well. Can you maybe just elaborate a little bit more on the reduction you outlined in the prepared remarks? Russell, I know you particularly highlighted that a lot seems tied to the challenges associated with closing deals in the current environment. But just to clarify, are you seeing any shift in demand or prices buyers are willing to pay? Or is it just really just kind of that timing lag? And then on a related note, is the lower contribution from energy and natural resources, kind of that component of the business, can you quantify that at all? Russell Hagen : Sure. So I would say on the real estate, we continue to see demand for the HBU properties, and the values are remaining strong. We have a really large program. I think as we look at the components of the program, we need to kind of break it into two pieces. We have small-sized HBU properties, and those are typically under around $500,000. That's really a majority of the deals that we close, and that's pretty sustained activity. Those are typically cash buyers. They're not as complex to complete. We are seeing some delays just because of the social distancing, et cetera. The larger HBU deals, and this is -- this is really what we're looking for adjusting kind of our guidance on this is the deals that are over $500,000 or the larger ones, especially the ones that require financing. We're experiencing some slowdown in those, and that's really due to the challenges of getting the credit in place. So that's primarily the driver on the adjustment for the HBU sales.  But the fundamentals of the HBU market really haven't changed. One thing that we're seeing and we're hearing, we're definitely getting a lot more traffic kind of on our websites. I think that's because people have more time to spend on the Internet. But we are seeing more interest in people seeking out some space. It's very profitable to provide that opportunities so they can meet that future demand.  As far as the ENR EBITDA, that's really driven by lower construction material volumes. One second, guys. We're going to fix this. [Technical Difficulty]. Okay. Sorry, we had a little feedback on our side. So for the ENR, that's really lower construction materials volumes. The primary driver is just a slowdown of activity because of COVID and then we have less lease activity. I would say if you look at 2019, 20% reduction in the real estate kind of EBITDA and then a 20% reduction applied to the ENR EBITDA kind of gets you to where that adjustment is. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari. Randy Toth : This is actually Randy Toth sitting in for Anthony. Just quickly on the U.S. south export business. Have conversations begun with Chinese log importers regarding the purchase of timberland out of the U.S. south? And could that business come back quickly? Or does the waiver nature of the tariff relief limit demand? Any color there would be helpful. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So a couple of things on the China export market, and this is true really across the west and the south, and then I'll get specifically to the south. As we got into the late March and April period, we did see a reduction in the amount of log flow from New Zealand and Europe hitting that market, and that created an opportunity for U.S. logs to hit that market. At the same time, our importers from China applied for and received exemptions from the retaliatory tariffs. And so in the west, that was 5%; in the south, that's 25%. In the south, taking that 25% tariff off really opened that market back up. And so we've been ramping up our production for the export market out of the south. And I think as long as that tariff stays off, there will continue to be a good opportunity for us to grow that business. Randy Toth : Okay. Understood. And then just maybe switching gears to the OpEx opportunities for the year. I was surprised with CapEx being cut by 30% or so. OpEx expectations remain unchanged. Can you maybe touch on what is driving that and the projects being pursued this year? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. A few things. And clearly, the capital that we've put back into the business, particularly on the wood products side, has really facilitated a lot of the cost reductions and other operating improvements that we've seen. But what gives us, I think, confidence at this point is against that $50 million to $70 million target, we got off to a really good start in Q1. And as we think about the OpEx opportunities, not all of those are specifically capital related. They are continuing to focus on getting better recovery, better reliability, better -- higher-margin product production out of our mills. Those things we can continue to do even with the reduction in CapEx. Similarly on the timberland side, the things that we're doing about mechanized logging and improving the haul and logging efficiency. We're going to continue to work those. Yes, it does get a little bit more challenging in this environment, but OpEx has become such an important part of the culture at Weyerhaeuser. I'm confident that our colleagues and the businesses will continue to drive that even in this challenged environment. Operator : Our last question comes from the line of Paul Quinn of RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Just two questions. One, in reference to Steve's question on the dividend. Devin, you made a comment that at 1.5 million housing starts, Weyerhaeuser throws off a lot of cash. Does that kind of imply that if we get back to U.S. starts at 1.5 million, you're able to reinstate the dividend at sort of $1 billion a year level? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Again, so our view is that we're going to reinitiate it as soon as practicable. I think it's really going to be dependent on what the cash flow and operating environment look like. Certainly, as housing eventually improves back to a level that we had expected, that gives us a lot more flexibility to continue to increase the dividend. But for us, that doesn't necessarily require that level of housing starts for us to reinitiate. We would look to do that as soon as we can and then adjust that as market conditions improve. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then you made an interesting comment about moving more Weyerhaeuser logs to Weyerhaeuser processing facilities. So I'm just wondering what your self-sufficiency was before that initiative in the west and the south and what it is after, i.e., with the incremental differences? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So typically, about 50% of the logs coming into our mills come from our fee ownership. And obviously, that varies depending on region, but that's the average across the system. That's gone up a bit in this environment, probably 10%, 15% across the system. And again, I think just that vertical integration gives us the flexibility to move those logs to our internal mills when that makes sense and when market conditions require it. Paul Quinn : Okay. And just maybe as a follow-up, how does that 50% differ regionally? Is that higher in the U.S. south than the west? Devin Stockfish : It's pretty similar across the west and the south. We do have Timberlands on the Atlantic Coast where we don't have mills. So obviously, we don't have fee logs going into our internal mills in the Atlantic Coast. But pretty much everywhere else, we have pretty good alignment between our fee ownership and our mill manufacturing.  All right. That was our final question. Thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser company. Operator : That concludes today's conference call. Thank you, everybody, for joining.

This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is staying safe and is well.  This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $72 million or $0.10 per diluted share, our net sales of $1.6 billion. Excluding next charges of $5 million for special items, we generated earnings of $77 million or $0.11 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA of total $386 million in the second quarter, this is approximately 7% lower than the first quarter, but 13% higher than a year ago. Our teams delivered strong operational and safety results, despite the disruptions from COVID-19 and the unprecedented volatility caused by the pandemic. In a moment, I'll dive into our business results. But first let me set the stage with some comments on the housing market. New residential construction activity declined sharply in March and April as the COVID-19 pandemic triggered stay-at-home orders and rising unemployment across the nation. April housing starts where the lowest and over five years and over 25% lower than April, 2019. The rapid decline in new residential construction activity quickly translated to weaker order files for building products and significant production curtailments by wood products manufacturers. Over the last few months, demand for housing and wood products have shown unexpected resiliency in the face of broad economic disruption in late may States began to reopen their economies and us housing activity, rebounded sharply, despite the continued, extreme weakness and broader macro economic conditions. Housing starts improved sequentially and June starts we're only 4% lower than a year ago. Repair and remodel activity has also shown remarkable strength driven by robust do-it-yourself demand. Collectively, these factors drove a sharp uptick in wood products pricing and demand as the quarter progressed. As we look to the back half of the year, we're cautiously optimistic regarding a continued improvement in U.S. housing. Mortgage rates are at historic lows demand for housing exceeds the available supply and societal preferences are shifting in favor of larger single family homes in less urban areas. The pace of home sales is improving. In June, new home sales were 7% above year ago levels. At the same time, the trajectory of the broader U.S. economy remains uncertain in light of rising COVID infection rates and the pullback or pause of many economic reopening plans. Key indicators that we are monitoring have generally plateaued at recessionary levels. Unemployment stands at 11%, with initial claims well in excess of a million per week. Mortgage forbearance rates are near 8%, mortgage availability remains tight. Consumer sentiment is comparable to levels measured in April and May and U.S. GDP has contracted in an unprecedented manner. Further, the specifics regarding additional federal economic relief packages are also unclear at this point. Our customers are expecting strong demand through Labor Day, but remain cautious of COVID-related economic and operating disruptions. We'll be watching all of these factors closely to see how they influence our markets as we move out of the summertime and into the fall. Turning now to our second quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages six through eight of our earnings slides, Timberland's contributed $75 million to second quarter earnings and $140 million to adjusted EBITDA. In Western Timberlands, EBITDA decreased $20 million compared with the first quarter. Log sales volumes and average realizations were comparable to the first quarter. As we flexed significant volume out of the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities in China, fee harvest volumes decreased 3%, forestry and road building costs increased seasonally and export costs were modestly higher. In the Western domestic market log demand and pricing dropped sharply in April as mills curtail production. In response, many landowners reduced harvest operations or redirected volume to stronger export markets. When demand and pricing for Douglas fir lumber rebounded, mills resumed production and actively sought to replenish log decks. Log supply was slow to respond to the increased demand and pricing trended higher exiting the quarter. On average, our second quarter domestic log pricing was moderately lower than the first quarter. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, housing starts are down approximately 11% year-to-date as housing demand slowed following the fourth quarter, 2019 consumption tax increase. Demand for our logs has generally held up well enhanced by our strong customer relationships and limited availability of Canadian export logs. However, our second quarter log sales volumes to Japan declined. And average realizations decreased slightly as we've began to see incremental effects from the COVID-19 outbreak on Japanese construction activity. In China, demand for our logs rebounded sharply in the second quarter, as construction and saw milling activity resumed following the COVID-19 outbreak. And saw mills returned to near normal operating rates. Softwood log inventories at Chinese ports decreased nearly 40% during the quarter and into June at 4.4 million cubic meters. Takeaway was strong in April, as mills restocked inventories, and then eased as the quarter progressed. Supplies of New Zealand radiata and European spruce logs were also below normal due to COVID-19 disruptions. Reflect significant volume into the China market to take advantage of this opportunity. And average realizations for our China export logs increased modestly, compared with the first quarter. Compared with a year ago quarter, log export revenues increased by $18 million due to higher sales volumes. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands EBITDA decreased $8 million, compared with the first quarter. As in the West, demand for Southern saw logs remained weak through April and into May, as mills curtailed production and minimize log inventories. As lumber demand and pricing rebounded, capacity came back online, although log takeaway for June was trending towards normal, some customers remained cautious and log decks were generally below average levels. Demand for our fiber logs remained steady through the quarter supported by downstream demand for hygiene products. Realizations for our saw logs and fiber logs were generally unchanged from the first quarter. Average log realizations declined 2% due to mix as we harvested an increased proportion fiber logs in the quarter. The harvest volumes declined 4% compared with the first quarter and 7% compared with the second quarter of 2019 as we began to implement the previously announced 10% reduction in full year southern harvest volumes. Comparing our overall Southern Timberlands second quarter results with the year ago period, EBITDA declined by $16 million due to lower fee harvest volumes and lower average sales realizations. In Northern Timberlands, EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared with the first quarter. The harvest volumes declined seasonally at spring breakup limited activity across most of our northern operations. Real estate, energy and natural resources pages nine and ten, real estate and ENR contributed $19 million to second quarter earnings and $57 million to adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter EBITDA was $44 million lower than the first quarter and $14 million lower than the year ago period. As expected, real estate sales were significantly lower than the first quarter. We experienced continued steady interest in rural properties, but transactions were slower to close due to delays in title work financing, approvals and recording deeds. Average price per acre decreased, and average land basis as a percentage of real estate sales was higher due to the mix of property sold. As in the first quarter, second quarter real estate sales included low productivity acreage in Southern Oregon that we acquired with the Plum Creek merger.  Results from energy and natural resources were comparable to the first quarter. Demand for construction materials has remained steady, as infrastructure projects have generally benefited from essential industry designations during the pandemic. Wood products, pages 11 and 12. Wood products delivered its strongest performance since the third quarter of 2018, contributing $159 million to second quarter earnings and $198 million to adjusted EBITDA. EBITDA increased $14 million compared with the first quarter as higher average lumber realizations and improved manufacturing costs were partially offset by lower sales volumes for most products. In April, we reduced production across our manufacturing facilities to align with customer demand. As demand improved, we increased operating rates and most businesses exited the quarter at pre-COVID operating levels. Manufacturing costs improved across our operations, despite the production volumes, the lower production volumes. Our lumber business delivered standout performance for the quarter. EBITDA was $24 million higher than the first quarter and $59 million above a year ago levels due to improved realizations and lower manufacturing costs. Lumber pricing began to stabilize early in the second quarter as mills curtail production in response to lower demand. With inventories extremely lean across the channel, pricing strengthened steadily as demand improved. This was particularly notable in the southern markets. Benchmark lumber pricing improved by approximately $135 per 1,000 board feet, nearly 40% during the months of May and June. On average, the framing lumber composite price increased 2% in the second quarter, compared with the first. Our average lumber realizations increased by 5% as our mix of production is weighted more heavily to southern yellow pine. Unit manufacturing cost decreased by 2% compared with the first quarter. Our lumber mills delivered outstanding operating performance, achieving the lowest quarterly and monthly controllable manufacturing costs on record, despite weekly fluctuations and operating posture. I want to thank our entire lumber business for the commitment to operational excellence that's driving these industry leading results. In OSB, EBITDA decreased $4 million compared with the first quarter due to slightly lower sales volumes and average realizations. Supply demand dynamics generally mirror those of lumber, but with a more modest uptick in pricing. Our sales volumes decrease 3% compared with the first quarter. Average realizations decrease 2% in line with the change in benchmark OSB composite. Manufacturing cost improved compared with the first quarter due to the slightly lower resin costs and focused cost control across the business. Compared with the year ago quarter, OSB EBITDA increased $33 million due to higher average sales realizations, and lower manufacturing costs. Engineered wood products EBITDA decreased by $9 million compared with the first quarter due to lower sales volumes. Average sales realizations for solid section products were flat with the first quarter. And average I-joists realizations decreased by 1%.  Sales volumes decreased 12% for solid section products and 11% for I-joists in the second quarter. Because over 90% of these volumes are used in new residential construction, these product lines benefited minimally from the strong second quarter repair and remodel activity. Controllable manufacturing costs decreased compared with the first quarter, but this was offset by higher input costs due to the increased cost of oriented strand board. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products decreased by $22 million due to significantly lower sales volumes, higher input costs and slightly lower average realizations. Distribution EBITDA increased by $1 million, compared with the first quarter as we continue to focus on improving product margin and controlling costs. The business also set a new record for June monthly EBITDA. Compared with the year ago quarter, EBITDA increased by $2 million due to higher product margins and lower delivery and warehouse costs. Turning now to operational excellence. Each of our businesses has remained focused on delivering on its OpEx initiatives, despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic. And that commitment is evident in our second quarter results. Halfway through the year we've made good progress against our $50 million to $70 million full year OpEx goal, and I am confident we will achieve this target by year end. I'm extremely proud of the dedication and focus of our teams as they have safely adopted business practices, rapidly and efficiently pivoted operating postures and capitalized on operational excellence opportunities, while navigating unprecedented fluctuations in market demand. Staying on track to achieve our OpEx goal is a real accomplishment given the rapidly changing environment in which we've been operating. Now, I'll turn a turn to a few comments regarding capital allocation. The Board continues to regularly review opportunities to reinitiate an appropriate quarterly dividend. As we said last quarter, this review takes into account a number of variables, including our market conditions as well as the broader macroeconomic environment. All else equal the Board's preference is to reinitiate a dividend sooner rather than later, while we have been seeing improved business conditions over the last couple of months, we need to get comfortable that those improvements will be sustainable even as the pandemic and other macro headwinds continue. I want to be clear that we remain committed to returning a significant amount of our free cash flow back to shareholders as part of our capital allocation philosophy. Our Board also recognizes the need to deliver on that commitment through a sustainable dividend policy that will drive long-term shareholder value. Some of our businesses generate relatively stable cash flows. Other of our businesses are more cyclical in nature. Our overarching goal is to ensure a sustainable capital allocation framework that will enable us to return a meaningful and appropriate level of cash to shareholders across market cycles. Our other capital allocation priorities include investing in our business and maintaining an appropriate capital structure. We've deferred discretionary capital for 2020, but we continue to invest in the maintenance expenditures required to sustain and further improve our strong operating performance. And we will continue to consider incremental opportunities to optimize and enhance our assets and operations. Russell will provide more details in a few minutes, but the actions we have taken to enhance our financial flexibility in addition to the better than expected pricing and demand environment have allowed us to maintain our financial strength during this volatile period. With respect to our capital structure, we are working to bring down our leverage over time. We have repaid our revolver balance, redeemed the majority of our 2021 debt maturities and earmarked cash for the remainder of our 2021 notes. Going forward we will continue to review opportunities to efficiently reduce our gross debt balance. I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss financial items and our third quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning. At the beginning of the second quarter, we anticipated challenging market conditions throughout the quarter and potentially through the remainder of the year as the effects of COVID-19 pandemic were largely unknown. As a result of this uncertainty, we took several steps to enhance our financial flexibility. These actions coupled with our continued focused on safety and operational excellence enabled us to strengthen our balance and generate solid cash flow during the second quarter. Today, our financial position is solid and improving. We are well positioned to fully capitalize on strengthening markets and successfully navigate the continued economic uncertainty related to COVID-19. Starting with our key outlook items for the third quarter on Page 15 of the earnings slides. In our Timberlands business, third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to decrease by approximately $20 million to $25 million compared to the second quarter, which is a similar reduction to what we saw in the third quarter of 2019. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our third quarter domestic log sales volumes and domestic average sales realizations to be higher than the second quarter. Demand in the West has been favorable for the past several months and log inventories at domestic mills ended the second quarter on the low end of normal levels. However, as July has progressed, mills have begun to rebuild log inventories to moderate level in response to increased demand for finished product, and as a precautionary measure ahead of fire season. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, residential construction activity continues to soften due to the ongoing effects of last year's consumption tax increase and the COVID-19 outbreak. Demand for logs slowed through the second quarter and is expected to decrease as the third quarter progresses. As a result, we expect our third quarter Japanese export log sales volumes to decline with a moderate decrease in every sales realization compared with the second quarter. Chinese export logs sales volumes are expected to decline in the third quarter, as we flex supply to take advantage of improving domestic markets. Additionally, we anticipate slightly lower average sales realizations on Chinese export logs due to seasonally lower demand and increased log supply from the competing New Zealand radiata pine and European spruce logs. Shipments to China from these markets have increased as COVID-19 related disruptions at East. Additionally in the West, our road, forestry, and per unit logging and hauling spend will seasonally be higher. As is typical during the drier, warmer summer months, we harvest on higher elevation tracks. The favorable weather conditions also allow us to complete many of our silviculture and road activities. In the South, we expect seasonally higher forestry expenditures in the third quarter, which is typical as most of the activity generally is completed during the drier summer months. We anticipate slightly lower average sales realizations in the third quarter due to a higher percentage of fiber mix, as we shift to seasonally hire thinning activities. Additionally, we expect lower fee harvest volumes in the third quarter, compared to the second quarter, as we continue to implement the previously announced 10% reduction in our 2020 Southern harvest volumes. And in North, third quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the second quarter, as we move past the spring breakup season. Turning to our real estate, energy and natural resources segment. We anticipate third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable with the second quarter. Although many transactions have experienced longer than usual timelines to finance, close and record property deeds due to COVID-19 related social distancing and other safety measures. We continue to experience solid demand and interest in our real estate properties. Demand for smaller HBU transactions is strong and although the volume of larger transactions requiring financing has slowed, we've continued to make progress on these transactions throughout the second and third quarters. In particular, we continue to further optimize the Southern Oregon holdings acquired with the Plum Creek merger. As a result, we now expect full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $235 million, which is a $35 million increase from our guidance last quarter. Additionally, we now anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be between 65% and 75% for the full year. And our wood products segment, we have continued to experience a strong repair and remodel market and have seen a favorable rebound in residential construction for the end of the second quarter and into the third. We're experiencing strong demand across all product lines. Looking into the third quarter, we expect earnings and adjusted EBITDA for wood products will be significantly higher than the second quarter, primarily due to stronger average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, as well as increased sales volumes across most product lines. Entering the third quarter, benchmark pricing for lumber and OSB has continued to increase with lumber reaching record highest lumber. For Lumbar, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $110 higher, and current realizations are approximately $130 higher than the second quarter average. For oriented strand board, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations at $35 higher and current sales realizations are $50 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, a typical operating rates for lumber every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For OSB, at typical operating rates, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For engineered wood products, we expect third quarter average sales realizations will be generally comparable with the second quarter. Page 13 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. The $37 million favorable variance in earnings before special items compared with the first quarter is primarily the result of an $18 million non-cash benefit from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory in LIFO in the second quarter compared to a $13 million charge in the first quarter. The benefit recorded in the second quarter was primarily driven by reduced log and lumber inventories across our businesses. Second quarter also saw benefit related to foreign exchange rates resulting in an $11 million non-cash increase over the first quarter. These favorable fluctuations were partially offset by $14 million non-cash fluctuation in the valuation of our liability classified share-based compensation. This increase reflects the improvement in our stock price from first quarter to second quarter. Our second quarter non-cash non-operating pension and post retirement benefit costs remain comparable to the first quarter. We continue to expect approximately $40 million of expense for the full year 2020. Turning to our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 14. We ended the second quarter with a cash balance of $643 million. Cash from operations during the second quarter was $391 million. It increased at $305 million over the first quarter, which is typically the lowest cash flow quarter of the year. Capital expenditures for the second quarter totaled $66 million. We continue to expect total CapEx for 2020 will be approximately $270 million. Moving on to financing, we ended the quarter with approximately $6.3 billion of debt outstanding. During the quarter we redeemed our $569 million, 4.7% notes that were due March, 2021 and incurred an $11 million pretax charged due to the early redemption. This charge for early extinguishment of debt is included in our results as a special item. Additionally, during the second quarter, we repaid the $550 million precautionary revolver draw taking at the end of the first quarter. Currently we had the full $1.5 billion capacity available on our revolver. As indicated last quarter, we intend to repay $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. And we will continue to review opportunities to reduce our gross step balance. As part of this, we begun evaluating our 2023 debt maturities and are assessing options and timing to efficiently refinance and repay this debt, including our $11 million special item related to the early extinguishment of debt. Second quarter interest expense was $103 million. We continue to fully expect full year 2020 interest expense will be approximately $360 million excluding special items. I\u2019ll wrap up at taxes. In the second quarter, we've recorded an income tax expense compared with an income tax benefit in the first quarter, as we recalibrated our annual effective tax rate to account for better than anticipated wood products pricing and sales volumes. We continue to expect our full year effective tax rate reflect and expansive approximately 20% before special items. Wherever the tax rate will be sensitive to the level of mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. With respect to cash taxes we now expect our full year cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. I'll turn the call over to Devin. I look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Russell. Before we open the line for questions I do want to touch briefly on sustainability. Weyerhaeuser has just recently launched our new sustainability strategy and it builds on our solid foundation of environmental stewardship, social responsibility and strong governance. A core part of this new strategy is what we're calling 3/30 and it's intended to drive increased focus in three key areas where we as a company can make a unique and meaningful contribution over the next decade. These include contributing to climate change solutions, meeting the need for affordable and sustainable housing and helping rural communities thrive. For over 100 years we've been committed to managing this company sustainably and for the long-term, and that focus remains today as we navigate these unprecedented times. In closing, we believe our company is well positioned with unrivaled assets, industry-leading operations, a strong safety culture, and a solid financial position. The underlying thesis for U.S. housing remains strong and evolving societal preferences are further bolstering demand for single family homes and wood-based construction. Looking forward we remain focused on operating safely and efficiently, effectively capitalizing on opportunities across the full range of market conditions and driving long-term value for our shareholders through industry leading performance and disciplined prudent capital allocation. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Devin. Good morning, Russell. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : Devin, I was thinking you must feel like a personal injury lawyer dealing with whiplash right now. Given what's happened in the last three months. Devin Stockfish : It's been an interesting dynamic that's for sure. Mark Wilde : Yes. I've never seen anything like this. I wondered if you or Russell could help people in just thinking about how these higher lumber and OSB prices that we see in the trade publications, how that flows through to your results, because I'm sure this is going to be a big topic over the next couple of months? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure. And so, I think as we've mentioned before, we do have a little bit of a lag between what you see in the print and when that hits realization, just because of the length of our order files. And for \u2013 I think this particular period, the order files are extending out a bit as you've probably heard from some other companies, with the strong market dynamic and low inventories we have extended our order files out a bit. So it'll flow through, but when you look at our realizations, it takes a few weeks for that to actually hit our realizations. Mark Wilde : Okay. Are there any other kind of qualifiers that we should think about? So it's easy to think about the good news, but there may be other things that we're overlooking as we try to model out the third quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, I guess just \u2013 how I'd respond to that is more in terms of the broader environment and what the key demand drivers are. And so when we think about what's really driving the strong demand for wood products right now, it's really a couple of things. Obviously, we\u2019ve seen housing improve and in our customers, the builders, you've probably heard this on various earnings calls. The demand for housing is really picked up a lot faster than we had anticipated. You saw that in the June new home sales numbers. And so I think generally the, the overall view on housing over the next several months is pretty positive. And so that's obviously a key driver for us. I mean, it is important to remember though; you look at the June starts numbers that was still not overwhelming relative to what we were seeing earlier in the year. But I do think that the momentum is building around that. So that seems like a positive, at least for the next several months. But I'd say the other thing that's really been driving the wood products demand has been the repair and remodel market. And in particular, the home improvement do it yourself segment. And that has just been remarkably strong and, I think as we, we think about that in retrospect with everyone being stuck at home, folks not traveling, no sports, nothing else to do, everybody's doing home remodeling projects. And so that's just been a really key part of what's been driving this overwhelming demand of late. So I think as you're modeling out the third quarter, we have pretty good visibility through August, I think with the order files and what we're hearing for customers, I think August should be pretty strong. I think the big question really is as we get through Labor Day and head into the fall, what does that repair and remodel market going to look like? And so, to us that's really the big open question. What happens to that segment of the demand signal as we progress through fall? Ordinarily as the weather starts to cool, you'd see a little bit of slow down there, but again, this year has been a little different than most years and so we'll see how that plays out. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then just as a follow-on Devin. I wondered if we can get some thoughts from you on where you see kind of inventories in the distribution channel, because it feels like part of what we've got right now is just a bit of a short squeeze because so many people liquidated inventory early in the second quarter and then demand has come back much, much more sharply than, than people anticipated? Devin Stockfish : Yes, there's no question. The inventory channels are lean and that's almost universally true. And like you say, Mark, what really happened is when you saw so much production come out and demand picked up more quickly, nobody had inventory in the channel and it's just been a scramble ever since. So I think that's \u2013 that's been part of the driver, people have, they have customers that have needs that are projects that are being built and they're just out scrambling for product, trying to find that, and you know, the, the production and the capacities come back online for the most part. I would say around the margins, do think particularly in the South, you're probably seeing a little bit of production that's being lost to producers, struggling to keep up with covert related downtime. For us we haven't had a meaningful amount of downtime related to COVID. But if you think about where a lot of the production capacity is for the Southern yellow pine in particular, they're in regions where the COVID rates are really spiking up. So I suspect there's probably a little bit of production being lost to that dynamic. And so we just, as an industry haven't been able to keep up with demand and that's really what's driving the pricing dynamic. Mark Wilde : Okay. I'll turn it over. Good luck in the second half of the year. Devin Stockfish : Thanks Mark. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of George Staphos from Bank of America. John Babcock : Good morning. This is actually John Babcock on for George. First and actually just, somewhat follows suit with what Mark Wilde was asking, but I just want to get a sense, I mean, as you know, we've clearly seen a sharp rise in prices here. And so I wanted to kind of get your sense. I mean, you talked a little bit about potentially repair and remodel demand slowing as we get into the fall. And obviously maybe as we get beyond this, jump in COVID cases, you know, maybe that has an impact on supply, but one of the, kind of get your read on how you expect the market to move you know, from here particularly kind of given these factors. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So what I would say at the outset is predicting commodity prices is extremely difficult under any circumstances. And I would say given what's going on in the market today, that's even more so. Again, I think we have a pretty good line of sight on August. So, I do think that the August timeframe should be pretty strong with each week that we continue to see strong pricing and strong demand that probably moves incrementally into September. Honestly, beyond that, it's very difficult to tell. I do think that the housing market will continue to grow the slope of that curve, I think is very hard to say, particularly given the offset that you may see ultimately with high unemployment, that hasn't seemed to really impact housing demand of late historically that's been a pretty strong correlation between unemployment and housing demand. So as we get deeper into the fall, I think that's an open question, but sitting here today, it certainly seems based on what we're hearing from our customers, that the demand for new homes is really strong and building. And so again, it's difficult to predict how all of those different puts and takes are going to play out over the course of the fall. But certainly we are in a lot better space now than we had anticipated three or four months ago. So, it's positive from that respect. John Babcock : Thank you. And then with regards to fee harvest volumes, what are the primary drivers for your expectation for lower volumes in the South? I mean, I \u2013 I know you talked about for the year decreasing fee harvest volumes and that's consistent with what you said last quarter, but particularly with the strength in wood product markets, why are those fee harvest volumes expected to go lower? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So again, I think it's just the \u2013 it's the dynamic across the Southern markets. And so we talk about the South as though it's a market, it's really a combination of sub-markets and notwithstanding the fact that that wood products pricing and demand has been reasonably strong. I think on balance across the South, you're probably still not up to full running capacity from a manufacturing and saw milling perspective partially because of COVID, I suspect, partially because there's still a little bit of caution around bringing back shifts. If you've taken a full shift out before you hire people back, you want to have some certainty that this run is going to last. So I don't know that productions fully come back. And then the other piece in the South is \u2013 as we've talked about, there's just a lot of log supply in the South. And so, we made a decision to reduce the harvest volumes in the South by 10%, just based on our projection of what that overall log demand is going to look like the supply demand dynamic. And as we think about that going forward, that's obviously something that can change depending on what market conditions are doing, but bringing back volume and pushing it into a market where pricing is a little soft or the market just doesn't need it. You got to be really thoughtful about that. So at this point, we're still contemplating that 10% reduction, which will largely be taken in the back half of 2020. John Babcock : Okay. And then just last question before I turn it over. Just with regards to China and the volumes you're seeing there. How did radiata and spruce logs or price volumes trend during the quarter? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So really you saw a pretty dramatic drop-off in the log flow into China from New Zealand and the European salvage logs related to the COVID-19 disruptions there. And it was basically a full shutdown in New Zealand for a period of time. There were some supply chain disruptions coming out of Europe. And so Q2 really, you saw that volume drop off pretty dramatically, that started to come back and, I think the demand signal in China's holding up pretty well. Takeaway is pretty good, but the supply going into that system has increased with the radiata and the European salvage logs coming in. So there's still demand. I suspect as we mentioned, we're probably going to swing more of our Western volume back into the domestic market. Pricing's better, margin opportunities are better, and that's really one of the advantages of our system in the West. In that we have three key customers between the third-party domestic, our own internal mills and the export market that we can really swing volume across those customer bases to really go after whatever the highest margin opportunity is. So, I think China will obviously continue to be a good market for us, but at present we have better pricing opportunities in the domestic market. So you'll see our volumes to China and Q3 go down a bit. John Babcock : Alright, thanks for all the color. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. First, on the gross debt balance you indicated you want to bring that down over time. Can you get the census to where you'd like to bring it to? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I'm not going to give you a specific gross debt number. What I would say is, we've been elevated relative to our 3.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA target. And so we're bringing that down over time. As Russell mentioned, we've got a fair amount of debt coming due in 2023 and Russell and treasury team are looking at opportunities around that. We also have some term debt. We have some opportunity there maybe even more so in the near-term. So it's something directionally Mark that we're \u2013 we're looking to take down so that we're more in line with that 3.5 times target over the course of the cycle. I think what you saw really in 2019 was, when we are on the bottom end to that cycle it starts pressing up pretty hard against the upper ranges of where we're comfortable going. So directionally we're bringing it down. I don't know that we're prepared to give a specific number. Anything to add to that Russell? Russell Hagen : No. As Devin mentioned, we are elevated in the first quarter obviously because we had issued that $750 million bond in the first quarter. And then we paid down the 5.69. So we're at about 6.3 right now, and our ratios have improved a little bit. We're at about 4.1 times on our net debt-to-EBITDA and our net enterprise value has improved obviously with the increase in the share price. So we have opportunities to start looking at that 2023 tower and we'll figure out the best way to refinance or repay that. Mark Weintraub : Okay. In the past Weyerhaeuser has talked about paying out 85% of its average cycle free cash flow in the form of dividends. Is that still a good starting base to think about or has that evolved? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So I think that's in the process of evolving, Mark. And what that 85% target was really a reflection of is a commitment by the company to return a significant amount of our free cash flow back to shareholders. And that broader commitment remains intact. I think as we consider reinitiating the dividend going forward, we're looking at a number of factors, and I think as the Board considers that opportunity, we want to make sure that the dividend sustainable and appropriate for our portfolio of businesses or business conditions, the free cash flow that we can generate from our businesses over a cycle. And as I mentioned, some of our businesses have generally relatively stable cash flows, others have more cyclical cash flows. And so as we think about that, our capital allocation approach, I think has to account for that variability. And so ultimately the overarching goal is to ensure a sustainable capital allocation framework that enables us to return significant, but appropriate levels of cash back to shareholders over a cycle. So, it's evolving, it\u2019s part of the conversation that we continue to have as a Board. Mark Weintraub : And so if I were to hypothesize that that means given that there is some cyclicality, maybe that percent potentially evolving to a lower level, but then be more opportunistic with a certain portion as well. a) Is that an appropriate way to think about at least the directional conversation and any color as to what that the use, if that is indeed the case, what would be contemplated as the use of that more opportunistic cash flow? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So what I would say is, that's obviously part of the conversation, it's a decision the Board will ultimately make and discussion that we continue to have. So I can't give you a specific answer on that. As I said, it's part of the dialogue. With respect to the uses of additional cash, I think, it would flow through the same framework, right. So, obviously we are intent on returning a good percentage of that back in terms of a quarterly cash dividend. Over and above that we have opportunities, I think, to return cash to shareholders and create value through share repurchase. And so, I think, that basic framework would remain intact. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And then just lastly, if I could following up on some of the prior questions, I believe you said that the OSB price, your current OSB price is about $50 higher than what you registered in the second quarter. And you've indicated \u2013 there was a lag and so that must be capturing. But it's very, very substantial if you look at the random lens OSB prints. I mean they are north of $200 higher than where the second quarter average was. So not wanting to \u2013 I recognize predicting commodity prices is dangerous at best. But if we were to assume that the commodity price has stayed where they are for the next period of time, for the third quarter as a whole, can you tell us how much higher as the flow-through and the lag impacts effect where the OSB price and possibly the lumber price, where you might expect them to end up relative to the second quarter? So again, not trying to have you predict, but if we were to just keep the price where it is today, how that flow through would end up? Russell Hagen : Yes. So without giving you a specific number, Mark, I think just the way to look at that is when we see the composite go up by that amount, our order files are out, particularly in OSB, a fair amount. So it typically takes \u2013 it can take up to three to four weeks for that really to flow through, to realization. So, it's slower on the upside for that to hit the realizations. We eventually get it, of course. But then on the same token it's also slower on the downside. So, I think, as you think about our realizations relative to what you are seeing in terms of the jump in print, it's just \u2013 it's going to be a lag of several weeks. There's also a lag in lumber, but that's going to be shorter just because the order files in lumber are typically shorter than OSB. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thanks much. Operator : Your next question will come from the line of Brian Maguire with Goldman Sachs. Derrick Laton : Hey, good morning, it\u2019s Derrick Laton on for Brian. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Derrick Laton : Good morning. Thanks for all the details so far. Maybe just to build on a couple of the earlier questions on wood products, certainly with lumber prices at all time highs, even mills at the high end of the cost curve are profitable there. If I could just get your sense for your expectations for the supply response in lumber and even in OSB, we've seen a lot of curtailments over the last six, twelve months. Are you expecting some of those to come flying back into the market now or maybe stay maybe stay on the sidelines for a bit? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I mean, obviously that's hard for us to say because each individual company has a better view on their individual cost structure. What I would say just generally, and I'll speak from our standpoint, when you think about bringing lumber capacity back on, that's usually a much easier decision because you can bring that on incrementally. And you can sort of layer it in depending on what's going on in the market, adding shifts, taking a few shifts out. That decision with respect to OSB is a bigger decision. Once you've decided that you're going to curtail a mill, from our standpoint, I think, the way we would look at it is you are going to have to have more visibility on the sustainability of this improvement when you make that decision. But obviously, each individual company will make their respective decision. But I think certainly on the lumber side, most of the capacity has come back on to take advantage of this good environment for lumber pricing. Derrick Laton : Yes, understood, okay thanks. And then switching back to the western logs, appreciate your ability to be able to flex into the domestic market and take advantage of some better pricing there. I guess, looking at the outlook for the third quarter, I guess my expectation would have been that you're expecting the realizations to be higher just given flexing into the better domestic market. But I think it was expected to be down a little bit. Maybe you could just help me kind of square that and any other dynamics I might not be thinking about there. Devin Stockfish : Yes, and that's really just, it's a mixed question. So the domestic log prices in the west, we are expecting to go up in Q3. But just given that the Japan market has softened a little bit because their home sales has really declined a bit this year. So that's just creating a little bit softer market, so we won't be shipping as much to Japan. Similar statement with China, with the New Zealand and European salvage wood going in there that's putting some pricing pressure there. So, we will see better realizations for the domestic logs, but it's just the overall western business as a whole, you'll see realizations go slightly down just because we'll have less export volume in the quarter. Derrick Laton : Okay, makes sense. All right. Thanks a lot guys. And good luck. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Hi, good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : You talked about the very strong demand in wood products and obviously curtailments coming off, I'm just wondering in lumber, OSB and engineered products, if it was possible to say kind of where your operating rates are currently? And to the extent that you have places where you're maxed out, are there opportunities for debottlenecking, or maybe even more kind of extensive capital projects that might show up this year? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so in terms of operating rates coming out of Q2, we were in kind of the mid-to-upper 80s, somewhere in that range, may be even low 90s. OSB generally in the upper 90s, EWP, low to mid-70s. I'd say as we head into Q3, kind of going business by business, on the lumber side, there's a little bit that we can do here in the near term a few percentages to take advantage of the good markets and we're looking to do that. In terms of the longer time horizon and bottlenecking, I mean, that's certainly part of every mill's roadmap is finding what bottlenecks you have in the mill and trying to eliminate that. So, every year we do pick up a little bit of volume just through those efficiency and debottlenecking efforts. On the OSB side, again, when you are operating in the high 90s, there's really not a whole lot left there, maybe, low single digits in terms of opportunity in the near term. You don't have as many debottlenecking opportunities in an OSB mill. Oftentimes it's the press or something right around the press, that's the bottleneck and that's a pretty large capital investment to really do that. So not a whole lot more upside on the OSB side. EWP, I do think that there's opportunity for a little bit more pickup there. And so we're looking at that, but again that's really going to be dependent on what market conditions look like. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's, very helpful. And then just switching to the sustainability initiatives that you've outlined, understanding it's a very long term undertaking, could you just talk broadly about maybe the potential kind of financial opportunity for Weyerhaeuser, if we actually had kind of a functioning carbon market and just maybe more broadly the importance of ESG for Weyerhaeuser? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so this is really exciting for us, we've had a lot of internal work going on around putting out this new strategy. I think it really reflects a commitment on behalf of the company to really double down on our sustainability efforts. And so I'm really excited about this. I think there are opportunities really across the board with this new sustainability strategy, in terms of how we deal with our employees, our workforce, our communities. And so there's a lot more there than just the economic side. But on the economics and business side, certainly, I think, as we look forward, there are a couple of opportunities I would highlight. The first of which is mass timber, CLT. That's a market that does seem to be picking up momentum. You've seen a number of projects come out. It's moving quicker than I had anticipated even 12, 18 months ago. And so that's a market, I think, that will benefit the industry as a whole more wood demand is obviously good. And I think there's a growing appreciation for the value of wood-based construction relative to other materials and building materials from an environmental standpoint.  But specifically to the carbon market, I do think that this is an opportunity. You just have to look around the corporate landscape. And most big companies have announced some initiative or another to be carbon neutral, or even some trying to be carbon negative. There really aren't any technologies out there that are better suited to take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere than trees and forests. And so I think there is an opportunity over time. But the one thing I would caution is we're in the early stages of this. We need to figure out the mechanics for developing these markets, either private or public. It needs to be something that's beneficial to everyone involved in the process. And so, we're looking at that, it's something that we're actively assessing to determine how are we going to create these markets. So I think we're in the early stages, but over the long-term, I absolutely do believe this is an opportunity for us. And I think Weyerhaeuser has a role to play in something that we can really develop a nice business around. Anthony Pettinari : Great. I'll turn it over. Thanks. Operator : Your next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Mark Connelly : Thank you. You had some big changes obviously in market conditions this quarter. And I'm curious if the speed of those changes led you to find anything that you want to approach differently in operational excellence, or new opportunities or shortcomings in IT, that sort of thing, whether there's opportunities to get more nimble or more efficient? Devin Stockfish : Well, I think, in terms of how we've dealt with what is really an unprecedented level of volatility in our markets, I would say I'm just extremely pleased with how nimble the organization has been. Certainly, I think, the investments that we've made over the last five to 10 years in information technology has made this whole transition to more remote working and changing business practices doable. I think if this had happened 10 years ago, this would have been a very much different and more challenging environment. So I think the organization is\u2026 Mark Connelly : And that spend wasn't very popular when you made it. Devin Stockfish : Well, IT spending never is, but I think for most people that have ever a business you know that if you don't have that infrastructure it's very hard to be successful in a lot of different areas. So it's necessary, it's important. I think we're seeing the benefits of it as we speak and we'll continue to, as we go forward. In terms of OpEx specifically, to my mind, the silver lining here is we have really, I think, demonstrated the importance of OpEx. I think the strategy is being further appreciated across the workforce just the ability to continue to operate well, the cost structure, it gives you so much more flexibility when you have these market disruption. So, my sense is that there is an even greater appreciation for all of the OpEx work that we've been doing and the importance when you're going through some of these markets swings. Mark Connelly : That's super. And just a broader question, in the past year we saw home builders struggling to find enough labor. Now you've got big markets like Houston with COVID issues. Are you seeing any of that sort of issue start to creep up? Is that part of the caution that you're thinking about? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I mean the labor issue hasn't gone away for certain. I think obviously the demand side has picked up over the last several months. And so I think the builders are trying to build as many homes as they can. But the labor issue that we've been dealing with for many years didn't disappear. It's still out there. I haven't heard the builders really talk much to us about COVID specific labor concerns. I would imagine there must be some around the margins. It's not something that we've heard a lot about. But I think that is something that will continue to be a struggle is just finding enough labor to put up houses as quickly as the builders want to build them. Mark Connelly : Very helpful, thank you. Operator : Our final question will come from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning Devin. Good morning Russell. Devin Stockfish : Good morning Paul. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Paul Quinn : Maybe just starting on Timberlands. Just wondering a couple of years ago, U.S. log exports out of the south to China, were really picking up where is that market sitting? And then flipping over to the west, when do you expect that Japanese market and China I guess now to rebound? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so out of the south, we had been growing that market. I mean, it was a really small piece of our overall business, but we had seen pretty strong growth on Southern Exports of Southern Yellow Pine into China. When the trade war broke out and the 25% tariff came into place that really put a pretty hefty headwind in there. And so we had kept that market open, just really at levels low enough that we could keep, or \u2013 levels that we could keep the supply chain open. When the tariffs came off and when you saw radiata and the European salvage wood back off and Q2, we did ramp that back up again. Those logs do compete with radiata pine, they compete with the salvage wood to some extent. And so, I think, for the next few quarters, as we see those volumes kind of spike up again we'll probably take our foot off the gas a little bit, but we're still shipping wood into that market, we anticipate continuing to do that. We're shipping into India again in small volumes. But those are markets, I think, in the near term might be a little stressed from a southern export standpoint just because of the European salvage wood. But over the long-term, those markets are going to be good for us. I think there's a home for southern yellow pine. We continue to develop a customer base. So good long-term market for us. Out of the west, I think, that Japan market, the softness that we're seeing, it's really three things. It's the demographics, the population is shrinking in Japan. And so, over the long-term, that's not ideal for housing. But it's been a slow decline and our customers have held market share. So that in and of itself, I think, we managed through. This year, it's just had the extra stresses of the increase in the consumption tax and obviously COVID-19 related disruptions. So, I think it's going to be a tough year from a housing standpoint in Japan. I'm hopeful you'll see that start to come back similar to other economies as we move past the COVID pandemic. But again, it's still a good market for us. We're still going to ship logs there. It's just a little bit softer as all. Mark Connelly : Okay and a question on wood products. I mean, you guys signaled that you exited Q2 back at pre-COVID levels of production. What do you think the volume pickup will be in lumber OSB from Q2 to Q3? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I'd say in lumber and OSB, it's probably low single digits. As the quarter progressed, we brought that production back. And I think importantly the mills ran remarkably well. The reliability that \u2013 reliability work that they have been doing over the last year or so is starting to yield real benefits. And so we were getting a lot of good production for every hour that we were operating. So I think it's, low single digits. We'll try to take advantage where we can. But there's not a whole lot left there. I think on EWP, it's probably slightly more than that. But again, that will depend on what market conditions look like over the back half of the year. Mark Connelly : Alright. That's all I have. Best of luck. Thanks. Devin Stockfish : Alright, thank you. Operator : And our last question will come from the line of Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Steve Chercover : Thank you. I got booted off the call, so I was also out of the queue. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Russell Hagen : Good morning. Steve Chercover : Glad to be here. So you did do a remarkable job on the cost side manufacturing. So the first question is do you think you can hold that progress stable in Q3? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean the whole essence of our operating strategy and it's Wood Products, but it's also Timberland, it's the company as a whole, is we are working on OpEx in every nook and cranny of the entire company. And so it's become cultural, it's become the expectation. People throughout the company, whether you're in a leadership role, or whether you're operating equipment in the mill, are looking for opportunities to improve. So I have every expectation that we will hold and continue to improve our cost structure going forward. Steve Chercover : Terrific, that's what I was hoping to hear. So with that in mind, and with the expectation of lower log costs and record high lumber and OSB that are, you know, pretty much booked through the end of the quarter, I think. Do you think you can approach, meet or exceed the results you did in Q2 2018, which is the best of the modern era? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so, I think, it's a little early for us to offer that specific of guidance. I agree with you. We have pretty good visibility through August. I think September, we'll see we're hopeful, but I think we're watching what happens post, Labor Day pretty closely. So ultimately, I think, we are going to have a good quarter. We're running the business well, the pricing and demand environment on wood products is strong. So, I think, that bodes well for Q3, for sure. Steve Chercover : Yes. Well, even the longest home run ball eventually comes back to earth. Okay. And then when we last chatted we were discussing the risk of an air pocket and Q3, which is obviously not going to materialize. So I'm just wondering, do you think that fear gets pushed into Q4 or does the net benefit of pent-up demand and low housing inventory, low rates and recovering economy outweigh unemployment and produce net-net optimism? Devin Stockfish : Yes, so, I think, the air pocket that we were concerned with never materialized. I think just the really, really strong repair and remodel demand followed by a quicker than expected recovery and housing dealt with that air pocket. I think as you get into the back half of the year, the question is, one what's going to happen with repair and remodel demand. How is that going to hold up? Is it going to hold up reasonably strong? It's going to fall off? That's something that we're watching closely. And then, I think, as we think about housing into the fall and really even into next year, at some point is the high unemployment level going to start impacting home, new home sales demand. And so, that's an open question. Certainly what we're hearing from the builders is there's a lot of demand there. So we're watching that closely as we're watching the macro conditions. But I think frankly it's a little uncertain as to how that's going play out later this year and into next year. Steve Chercover : Sure. Okay, well thank you and stay safe. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. Devin Stockfish : Alright well, I think, that was our final question. Thanks everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Please stay safe and healthy everyone. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that will conclude today's call. Thank you all for joining and you may now disconnect.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations and Enterprise Planning. Thank you, Ms. Baum. You may begin. Beth Baum : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2020 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. I hope everyone is well and staying healthy. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter results, reinitiated a quarterly cash dividend, and announced a new dividend framework consisting of a base dividend plus a variable supplemental dividend. I will begin by highlighting our third quarter results and then turn my focus to the dividend reinitiation. Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $283 million, or $0.38 per diluted share, a net sales of $2.1 billion. Excluding net charges of $103 million for special items, we generated earnings of $386 million, or $0.52 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $745 million in the third quarter. This is 93% higher than the second quarter and over 140% higher than a year ago. Each of our businesses delivered outstanding operational and financial results, despite disruptions caused by severe storms in the U.S. South, extreme fires in the Pacific Northwest and the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This strong operational and financial performance enabled us to deliver the highest operational cash flow since 2006 and take additional steps to meaningfully strengthen our financial position. I'll begin the discussion of our results with a few brief comments on the continued improvement in the housing market. U.S. housing activity rebounded sharply in the third quarter, supported by a growing preference for larger single-family homes in less urban areas. Total housing starts averaged over 1.4 million for the third quarter, an improvement of 33% over the second quarter. Single-family housing starts accelerated even more sharply, averaging over 1 million units for the quarter and reaching the highest level since 2007. On a seasonally adjusted basis, third quarter single-family starts improved by over 35% compared with the second quarter and over 15% compared with the third quarter of 2019. We are seeing similar levels of improvement in key leading indicators, single-family permits and new home sales increased nearly 40% compared with the second quarter and were up approximately 20% and 40% year-over-year, respectively. Single-family permits in September reached the highest rate since 2007 and builder confidence has reached all-time highs for two consecutive months. Repair and remodel activity has also remained robust, supported by do-it-yourself and professional activity and the remodeling industry's confidence has continued to increase. Several other fundamental factors also support our continued strong outlook for residential construction, including historically low mortgage rates, demographic tailwinds and an aging housing stock. Clearly, there remains room for caution, especially as it pertains to U.S. unemployment, the outlook for additional government stimulus, and the risk of further COVID-19-related disruptions as we approach the winter months. However, we are increasingly confident that the recent strength in U.S. housing and the repair and remodel segment will continue, notwithstanding ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. Turning now to our third quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 8 of our earnings slide. Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $10 million compared with the second quarter and earnings decreased by $86 million due to an $80 million non-cash timber casualty loss for Oregon fire damage. The 2020 fire season in the Pacific Northwest was one of the most extreme that we have experienced in many years. In early September, highly unusual weather conditions transformed fire activity in the State of Oregon for minimal to highly destructive in a few short days. Our thoughts are with everyone affected by this disaster, and I want to acknowledge all of the fire fighters, first responders, government and industry partners, as well as our Weyerhaeuser employees for their extraordinary work to save lives, protect property and contain the fires. As we previously disclosed, these wildfires spread on to our Oregon Timberlands, affecting approximately 125,000 acres to some extent. The magnitude of the damage to timber varies based on topography, age of the timber and many other factors. We have commenced salvage operations to maximize the value of the damaged timber, and Russell will discuss that more in a few minutes. The non-cash charge we recorded in the quarter represents the estimated book value of the timber and related assets that cannot be salvaged based on information available at this time. Moving on to our third quarter operating performance. Western Timberlands EBITDA decreased by $1 million compared with the second quarter. In the Western domestic market, demand was strong and pricing improved throughout the quarter, as mills sought to take full advantage of record lumber prices. Log supply tightened abruptly in the second half of the quarter, particularly in Oregon where wildfire shut down harvest operations in most of the state for several weeks. Our fee harvest volume decreased 15% compared with the second quarter as we lost 10 harvest days in Oregon and four days in Washington due to fire restrictions. As harvest operations resumed, our teams did a phenomenal job of managing the operational complexity of coordinating multiple firefighting efforts, while at the same time, rescheduling harvest operations and safely optimizing the deployment of dozens of logging and trucking crews to continue serving our customers. This includes our own mills, where we were able to leverage our integrated model and operational agility to ensure our Western mills did not lose a single shift due to out of log downtime. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs were soft early in the quarter due to continued slow housing activity and incremental effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Demand improved as the quarter progressed as Japan housing activity improved modestly and U.S. log availability was reduced by strong domestic lumber markets in Western fire activity. In China, average realizations were flat with the second quarter, and demand was solid. However, our sales volumes to China decreased significantly as we flexed volume to more profitable domestic opportunities. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA decreased $8 million compared with the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes declined by 5% compared with the second quarter as we continued to implement the previously announced 10% reduction in full-year Southern harvest volumes. Although, the U.S. South experienced multiple hurricanes and tropical storms during the quarter, we incurred very minimal damage and lost almost no production days as we redeployed harvest crews to alternative parcels. Average log sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. The Southern sawlog market experienced downward pressure in the quarter as favorable summertime logging conditions resulted in abundant wood supply. However, our average sawlog realizations improved slightly due to marketing and merchandising efforts associated with our operational excellence initiatives. This improvement, however, was offset by lower fiber log realizations in the quarter. In Northern Timberlands, adjusted EBITDA improved by $1 million compared with the second quarter due to seasonally higher harvest volumes as we exited spring breakup. Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared with the second quarter but earnings decreased slightly due to a higher average land basis on the mix of properties sold. Real Estate sales increased slightly from the second quarter as an increase in the number of acres sold was largely offset by lower average price per acre due to mix. Third quarter again included some sale of low productivity acreage in Southern Oregon that we acquired with the Plum Creek merger. Results from Energy and Natural Resources were slightly higher than the second quarter due to seasonally higher production of construction materials. Wood Products, Pages 11 and 12. Wood Products delivered its strongest quarterly performance ever, contributing $566 million to third quarter earnings and $615 million to adjusted EBITDA. This exceeds the previous record EBITDA attained in 2018 by almost 60%. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses all delivered the highest quarterly results on record and engineered wood products achieved record third quarter results. Although these results were enabled by historic increases in commodity prices, they would not have happened without continued strong operational performance across the business. Through hurricanes and tropical storms in the South, extreme fire activity in the West and the ongoing impacts of the global pandemic, our teams have continued to deliver outstanding operating results and maintain record low controllable costs across multiple product lines. In the third quarter, demand vastly outstripped supply in virtually all of our product lines, driven by strong new residential construction and repair and remodel activity. With inventories lean across the channel, benchmark pricing for lumber and oriented strand board escalated rapidly until mid-September. Customers began to purchase more deliberately late in the quarter, particularly for lumber, as repair and remodel activity began to show some signs of the seasonal slowdown. However, order files remained extended for most products as the quarter closed, especially OSB and engineered wood products. In lumber, adjusted EBITDA was $260 million higher than the second quarter, as a 54% increase in average sales realizations was slightly offset by higher Western log costs. We incurred a small amount of weather-related downtime in the quarter due to wildfire smoke in the West and hurricanes in the South. In OSB, adjusted EBITDA increased by $119 million due to a 65% increase in average sales realizations and slightly lower manufacturing costs. Adjusted EBITDA for engineered wood products increased by $16 million. Sales volumes for solid section and I-joist products increased by 21% and unit manufacturing cost improved slightly. These improvements were partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board web stock. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA was $24 million higher than the second quarter. This is attributable to improved sales volumes and higher margins, including operational excellence initiatives. Turning briefly to operational excellence. Through three quarters, we've made excellent progress against our $50 million to $70 million full-year OpEx goal, and I'm confident we will achieve this target by year-end. I'm extremely proud of our teams for their continued focus and dedication to achieving our OpEx goal despite the disruptions caused by the pandemic in recent natural disasters. Let me now turn to capital allocation and the reinitiation of our quarterly dividend, Pages 14 to 16. We remain firmly committed to returning cash to shareholders as part of our balanced capital allocation philosophy. Early in the pandemic, we made the difficult decision to suspend our quarterly dividend to preserve financial flexibility. Since May, the Board has regularly reviewed opportunities to reinitiate an appropriate quarterly dividend. This review has taken into account a number of considerations, including our market conditions, the broader macroeconomic environment, the desire for dividend framework that will drive long-term shareholder value across market cycles. Over the past several months, demand for housing and Wood Products has proven resilient, even as macroeconomic headwinds continue. Our businesses have delivered strong operating and financial results through an unprecedented range of market conditions. And our outlook on the near-term business climate has improved markedly since late spring. Additionally, as Russell will discuss in more detail, we have taken a number of actions to significantly reduce leverage and strengthen our balance sheet. Accordingly, we are reinitiating a quarterly cash dividend. We are also adjusting our dividend framework to ensure that the dividend and our overall approach for returning cash to shareholders are both sustainable and appropriate for the Company's portfolio and the cash flow that we generate from our businesses across market cycles. In this framework, we are targeting an annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted funds available for distribution. This is comparable to the targets communicated as part of our prior dividend frameworks and underscores our commitment to returning a significant portion of our free cash flow back to shareholders. Going forward, however, our new dividend framework will include two components : we will pay a sustainable quarterly base cash dividend, and each year we will supplement that base dividend with an additional return of cash, as needed, to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. We believe this new dividend framework will enhance our ability to return meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash to our shareholders across a variety of market conditions, while positioning Weyerhaeuser to deliver superior long-term value creation. The sustainable base dividend remains our core mechanism for returning cash. We are reinitiating this quarterly cash dividend at $0.17 per share. This base dividend payment, which totals approximately $127 million per quarter is supported by the cash flow from our Timberlands, Real Estate and ENR segments. We intend to grow this payment sustainably over time as segment cash flows increase. The second component of our dividend framework is a variable supplemental dividend. This will generally be an annual payment declared and paid in the first quarter based on cash flow generated during the prior fiscal year. We will apply this new supplemental dividend framework to our 2021 results and accordingly, we currently expect the first supplemental dividend will be paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on full-year 2021 adjusted FAD. We expect the supplemental dividend will be our primary tool for returning cash above and beyond the base dividend to achieve our targeted annual payout. However, we may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase to return cash under certain circumstances. Page 16 shows our adjusted FAD and adjusted EBITDA back to 2017, when our current portfolio was established. Timberlands, Real Estate and ENR results have been relatively stable over time, while earnings for our Wood Products business have fluctuated with lumber and oriented strand board pricing. The two-part base plus variable supplemental dividend framework will enable our shareholders to more fully benefit from the mix of cash flow profiles generated by our businesses. Shareholders will receive a stable income stream that is fully supported even in adverse market conditions and they will also benefit from significant upside and strong commodity markets through the variable dividend component. The remainder of our cash generation, that is the cash in excess of our base and supplemental dividends, will be deployed consistent with our stated priorities for opportunistic allocation. These priorities include value enhancing growth opportunities, liability management and opportunistic share repurchase. We are committed to allocating this excess cash in a disciplined manner to grow our base dividend and drive superior long-term shareholder value. I will now turn it over to Russell to discuss financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 17. Cash from operations during the third quarter was $608 million, our highest operating cash flow since the fourth quarter of 2006. We used a significant portion of this cash to strengthen our balance sheet by redeeming some of our 2023 debt maturities. We ended the quarter with approximately $6 billion of total debt outstanding and strong liquidity, including the cash balance of $787 million and the full $1.5 billion capacity available on our revolver. Page 18 highlights actions we have taken to reduce our gross debt balance. During the third quarter, we redeemed $325 million, 3.25% notes that were due March 2023. We incurred a $23 million charge on the early extinguishment, which is included in our results as a special item. Earlier this week, we submitted notice that we will be redeeming in mid-December, our $500 million, 4.625% notes due September 2023. Following this repayment, our gross debt will be approximately $5.5 billion. We will have reduced our total debt by nearly $900 million since 2019 year-end. We have also significantly reduced our net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, improving it by approximately 2 turns from the high of 4.9 times at the end of 2019 to 2.9 times at the end of the third quarter. Our leverage ratio now sits comfortably below our target of 3.5 times net debt-to-adjusted EBITDA over the cycle. As previously indicated, we have cash earmarked to repay our $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. Today, we are operating from a strong financial position. And with the progress we have made on our debt reductions, particularly the 2023 maturities, we have reduced leverage to a level that we believe is appropriate and sustainable for the Company over the cycle and supports our solid investment-grade profile. Turning now to key outlook items for the fourth quarter, which are summarized on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA is expected to increase by approximately $20 million, compared to the third quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our fourth quarter domestic log sales volumes and domestic average sales realizations to be moderately higher than the third quarter. Log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets and log inventories at domestic mills ended the third quarter on the lower end of the normal levels as log supply was restricted due to the extreme wildfire activity in September. This has resulted in improved pricing during the month of October. We expect market tension to moderate during the quarter as log supply improves and mills replenish inventories. We anticipate fourth quarter fee harvest volumes will be higher than the third quarter as we resume harvest operations following the third quarter fire restrictions, and begin to prioritize our salvage activity on affected Timberlands in Oregon. We are experiencing little downgrade in the quality of the salvage logs delivered to our customers and we do not expect pricing for the salvage logs to negatively affect our fourth quarter realizations. Unit log and haul costs will increase modestly compared to the third quarter. The salvage activity will result in lower productivity and increased hauling distance to market. We currently expect to complete a majority of our salvage operations over the next 12 months to 18 months and we'll recover a significant portion of the merchantable timber value. Although additional work is needed to determine the impact on our operations going forward, our preliminary expectation is that, our 2021 Western harvest volume will be roughly comparable to 2020, as we redeploy our current logging capacity into salvage activity. We'll provide you an update on our year-end earnings call. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, housing starts improved modestly in the third quarter. Demand for our logs has strengthened slightly. We expect fourth quarter sales volumes and realizations will increase compared to the third quarter. Chinese export log realizations are expected to be comparable in the fourth quarter. Log sales volumes will increase due to the timing of shipments. Demand for our logs remains solid, supported by improving economy and government infrastructure spending. In the South, we expect higher forestry expenditures in the fourth quarter as we complete work that was deferred during the third quarter hurricane -- due to the third quarter hurricane activity. Average log sales realizations will be slightly lower than the third quarter due to mix. We anticipate a higher proportion of fiber log sales as we complete additional plant thinning activity. Fee harvest volumes should be comparable to the third quarter. In the North, average log sales realizations should increased slightly with continued favorable demand for hardwood and softwood lumber. I'll now turn to the recently announced transactions to enhance our Oregon Timberlands holdings. In September, we entered into an agreement to sell 149,000 acres of Southern Oregon Timberlands for $385 million and a separate agreement to purchase 85,000 acres of mid-coastal Oregon Timberlands for $426 million. The net cost is approximately $40 million and we expect significant and sustained cash flow accretion from these transactions. We continue to expect these transactions will close in the fourth quarter and the Southern Oregon Timberlands are now shown on the balance sheet as held for sale. We expect to record a gain on the sale with no accompanying tax liability. The gain will be reported as a special item in our Timberlands business. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Interest in our real estate properties remained strong, the shifting societal preferences are driving increased demand for rural HBU properties. However, transactions remain slower to close due to extended timelines for financing and other key activities. We expect fourth quarter earnings for Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment will be approximately $10 million lower than the third quarter and we continue to expect full-year 2020 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $235 million. We anticipate land basis as a percentage of real estate sales will be approximately 50% for the fourth quarter and approximately 70% for the full-year. For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity remains strong and our builder and dealer customers are optimistic moving into the winter months. In repair and remodel markets, we have seen some seasonal slowdown in demand for our products, but takeaway remains above historical averages for this time of year. Channel inventories remained generally lean with buyers limiting purchases to immediate needs. Looking to the fourth quarter, we expect earnings and adjusted EBITDA for Wood Products will be lower than our record performance in the third quarter but above previous record set in the second quarter 2018. Excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations, we expect fourth quarter results will be significantly lower than the third quarter. We expect a modest seasonal reduction in sales volume, as well as higher Western and Canadian log costs and higher raw material costs for engineered wood products. We also expect lower operating rates for some product lines as we complete maintenance outages that were deferred early in the pandemic. The framing lumber composite has retreated from its late September peak but remains above the record levels of 2018. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $15 higher and current realizations are approximately $50 lower than the third quarter average. Entering the fourth quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board remains at record levels and our current quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $140 higher than the third quarter average. As a reminder, for every -- for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For engineered wood products, average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products will be slightly higher, as we begin to capture the benefit of announced price increases. These increases generally range from 4% to 8% and will be captured over the next several quarters. We expect realizations for other engineered wood products will be lower than the third quarter average. Page 13 outlines the major components of our unallocated items. Third quarter included a $9 million non-cash charge from elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO in the third quarter, compared to an $18 million benefit in the second quarter. The charge recorded in the third quarter was primarily driven by higher unit costs for log and lumber inventories across our businesses. Third quarter expense also included a year-to-date adjustment for performance-based incentive compensation. I'll wrap up with a few additional outlook items highlighted on Page 20. Including our $23 million special item related to the early extinguishment of debt, third quarter interest expense was $111 million. We now expect full-year 2020 interest expense will be approximately $350 million, excluding special items. This is $10 million lower than our prior guidance due to the reduction in our gross debt balance. Turning to taxes, we expect our full-year 2020 effective tax rate will be between 20% and 22% before special items, based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. We expect our full-year cash taxes will be lower than the overall tax expense, as we defer some payments into early 2021. And last, we now expect total CapEx for 2020 will be approximately $280 million. This is $10 million more than our prior guidance reflecting a few additional high-return capital projects in Wood Products, slightly lower Timberlands CapEx due to the third quarter fires and severe weather. Now, I'll turn the call back to Devin, and I look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Russell. With our unrivaled portfolio of assets, strong operational performance, our financial strength and focused safety culture, we believe we're well positioned to capitalize on strong and growing fundamental demand for U.S. housing. We are committed to returning a meaningful portion of our resultant cash flow back to shareholders, and our new dividend framework positions us to deliver on our commitment in a way that is sustainable and appropriate across market cycles. Looking forward, we remained focused on industry-leading performance and discipline, prudent capital allocation to sustainably grow our base dividend and drive superior long-term value for shareholders. And now, I'd like to open the floor for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : Just a question --. Good morning. Just a question on the supplemental dividend. So you indicated you paid at the beginning of the year based on prior year's free cash flow. And I'm just curious in terms of any flexibility there. If you have a situation where you generated a lot of cash in year one, but heading into year two the outlook has deteriorated based on macro or market trends? Would you make the judgment call to pay out less or should we think of this as just kind of a mechanical payout that we should expect to get paid out regardless of market conditions? Devin Stockfish : Yes. A couple of things on that. First, just with respect to the timing. The general approach under the new framework is to payout the supplemental dividend annually in Q1 based on the prior year's FAD. So, that would mean, Q1 2022. That being said, could there be a situation where we would consider an interim supplemental dividend during the year? Certainly, I think that's conceivable. We wouldn't shut the door on that possibility. But again, the general view is that, that's going to be paid out on an annually -- annual basis. With respect to the 75% to 80%, really that's going to be the target. And I think the benefit of this dividend framework is that, we're going to be in a position to payout 75% to 80% of FAD really across all different market cycles. Certainly, when we're in a down market, we think we have sufficient cash flow from the Real Estate, ENR and Timberlands business to cover that. And then when we see strong commodity markets like we're seeing today, obviously, there is a lot of upside with the supplemental piece. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just, we're finally back to 1.4 million housing starts and you indicated your Southern sawlog prices ticked up in the quarter, I think, commercial and merchandising activities. I'm just wondering if you saw underlying kind of apples to apples price improvement in any regions of the South, especially with these saw mills running full out. And would you anticipate price improvement in 2021, assuming we stay at or above that 1.4 million starts level? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Anthony, we've historically talked about that in terms of housing starts. I think in retrospect, the more applicable look there is what's happening in supply and demand in each individual wood basket. And as you alluded to, some of those regions are more tension than others. And so, clearly, there are regions, say, the Atlantic Coast, North Carolina, some regions that just have a little bit more tensioning and you see a little stronger log pricing there. I do think, as we look out over the longer-term, obviously, we've seen a fair amount of sawmill capacity coming into the South over the last several years, call it, 5.5 billion, 6 billion board feet of new capacity. We've even seen a few new ones announced here just of late. I do think over the longer-term, you are going to continue to see sawmill capacity coming into the U.S. South. It's one of the best places, certainly, in North America, if not, the world to manufacturer lumber. And so, our expectation is that, over time, we'll continue to see more converting capacity come in and with each new mill that comes in, that has a tensioning effect in that particular wood basket. So, we do expect that to improve over time. I would say, obviously, housing repair and remodel activity is an important piece of that, and that it drives that in demand for lumber and other wood products. But ultimately, log prices are going to be based on the supply demand dynamic in that individual wood basket. So, I think we are optimistic that over time that will improve. I think it's just going to be slow going as each new mill comes in, and that will overall improve the supply demand dynamic over time. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking my questions. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, George. George Staphos : How are you doing? Congratulations on the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. George Staphos : My first question, given -- Anthony teed it up, I want to segue from that question and maybe the answer can be more or less the same, but given the supply constraints that you're seeing on the West, given the higher pricing that we're seeing for logs in the West, are you seeing any tangible evidence of maybe some substitution recognizing they're different regions, large distances between the two regions? From Douglas fir to Southern yellow pine and in turn any expectation that that might happen such that we see even more capacity come into the market too, ultimately, hopefully, tension the Southern markets more. Any thoughts on that would be helpful? And I had a couple of follow-on. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, George, you don't really see much in the way of substitution between Southern yellow pine and Doug fir and that's generally just the builders have preferences with an individual species and they generally stick with that. So you don't see a lot of crossover. So the short answer to your question is really -- notwithstanding some of the pricing dynamics, you don't really see a whole lot of crossover between Doug fir and Southern yellow pine. I do think where you see a little bit more substitution is with the SPF and Southern yellow pine. And as we've seen, some of the SPF supply has come down due to the pine beetle up in Canada, I think we are seeing, in certain markets, Southern yellow pine gained market share over SPF and I would expect that would continue to be the case. George Staphos : Okay. That's helpful, Devin, and a good reminder on that. One thing I want to go back to, I think it was Slide 10 you had the realizations on the price per acre that you're seeing within Real Estate and Energy and Natural Resources. And there has been a general trend lower that you show on the chart in terms of the realizations are getting per acre. Any things that we should be taking away from that as we look out to '21 and '22? And it would seem like mix will stay relatively lower, not higher if, in fact, you're seeing more demand for rural land because what's been going on with COVID and the like the last six months. Any thoughts on that? Russell Hagen : Yes. George, this is Russell. George Staphos : Hey, Russell. Russell Hagen : I would say that in '20 --. How are you doing, George? In 2020, we definitely had a higher mix of some properties in our Southern Oregon and these were legacy Plum Creek properties with a high basis. We had stepped those up at the time of the merger. And so, I think as you look forward into 2021 and 2022, you'll see a more kind of normalized pattern of the sales coming through the Real Estate program. So, again, it is definitely skewed in 2020 with those Oregon transactions. George Staphos : Okay. Thanks, Russell. My last question, I'll turn it over. If we look at the transaction that you [announced earlier], essentially this was in your wording, but trading land in Oregon you're effectively getting, I think from what we read better stock land and you're basically getting cash upfront versus cash later. Can you give us a bit more detail in terms of why you're selling one portion and buying another recognizing the deal hasn't closed and we might be limited in terms of what you can share there? Thank you. And good luck in the quarter. Russell Hagen : Yes. George, I'll take that. When you look at what we're selling in our Southern operations, I would say that those were -- they're good timberlands, but they were not as strategic or as strategically located as the timberlands we're acquiring. And so, when you look at the timberlands we're acquiring, they're really well fitted for our current operating region there, and it also supports our export program and then it supports a couple of our mills within that region also. So, again, it's really a good trade for us. It fits our operations really well. They'll be cash-accretive, very strong cash accretion. And I think overall, it definitely improves the overall profile of our Western Oregon Timberlands. George Staphos : Thank you so much. Have a good quarter. Russell Hagen : You bet. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Devin. Good morning, Russell. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Mark. Russell Hagen : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : Devin, I wanted to start off, could you just give us some more thoughts about sort of the -- how you went about setting this initial dividend level, the base dividend? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. So, the level of the base quarterly dividend was really based on the cash flows that we generate across business cycles both at the business level and the Company level. And as we look to set that, we looked at the cash flow generation of each of our businesses across a variety of pricing scenarios, historical cash flows from the businesses, we looked at our Company level FAD over the last several years, and also modeled out FAD under a number of different market and pricing scenarios. And really the idea was to set the base quarterly dividend at a level that is both sustainable and supportable from our cash flow, even in a challenged market condition. And so, we expect that $0.17 per share quarterly dividend largely to be able to -- to be supported largely from the cash that we're generating from the more stable Timberlands, Real Estate and ENR business. And then, obviously, over time, we would expect to grow that base dividend as we grow our Timberlands and ENR cash flow. Mark Wilde : And I'm just recalling, I think, Devin, that back in '18 when you made the last dividend raise that actually the percent of kind of cross-cycle FAD you'd raised up to 85%. It seems like you've pulled that down here a bit. Would you care to comment on that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. And just in terms of the 75% to 80% payout ratio, it's in the general vicinity, over the last several years, it's been anywhere from 75% to 85%. And as we were thinking about reinitiating the dividend and the new framework, that's 75% to 80% is really what we believe to be an appropriate balance of returning a significant amount of cash back to shareholders, while still retaining some amount of cash to support growth in maintaining -- maintain an appropriate capital structure. Mark Wilde : Okay. And would you care to provide people with just some thoughts on kind of share repurchase? I mean, if we think about share repurchase programs in cyclical businesses, they've been devilishly hard to pull off well. Devin Stockfish : Yes. And as we think about the ways in which we're going to be returning cash to shareholders, obviously, as we said, we're going to lean toward the supplemental dividend as the primary vehicle over and above the base. But that being said, share repurchase can be a good way to return cash to shareholders under the right circumstance. So, that's something that we're going to look at on a regular basis. And to the extent that, our shares are trading at a meaningful discount and that's something that we could look at to return cash to shareholders. Mark Wilde : Okay. Well, I think if you can provide clarity to people kind of going forward about how you're going to make those judgments, I think that's helpful. And the last one for me is just thinking about how you would grow the land base over time. Can you share some thoughts with us on that? Because I think this kind of steady selling down of the land base, I think it raises concern among some investors that they're buying a melting ice cube. And I just -- I'd like to get your thoughts on that issue. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, I guess, a couple of comments on that, Mark. Obviously, we do have a Real Estate program where we're trying to capture the value of our HBU profile. We've done some portfolio moves over the last few years as well. But I do think it's important to remember that if you go back to 2013, Weyerhaeuser had about 6 million acres, whereas we have about 11 million acres now. And so, it's something that we're always looking at. It's an opportunity I think for us going forward to continue to deploy some of our excess cash to timberland acquisitions. We're always in the market looking for transactions to both improve and grow our timber base. And so, that's certainly something that we're going to continue to look at. We do want to make sure that we're being disciplined about it, though. Obviously, we want to make sure that we're not just doing acquisitions to grow. We're doing acquisitions that we think that can create real value. But certainly, that's something that is top of mind for us, and it's going to be something in Russell's new role that he will be even more focused on going forward. Mark Wilde : All right. Sounds good. I'll turn it over, Devin. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Wanted to just drill down a little bit more on the average pricing in the Wood Products. You mentioned in lumber, up $15 quarter-to-date and then up $140 for OSB. Roughly how much of the volume that you'd expect to sell in the fourth quarter would be in those categories at this point? Devin Stockfish : I want to make sure -- I'm not sure I understood your question, Mark. So, maybe can you rephrase that? I'm not sure what you're hitting out with that. Mark Weintraub : Sure. So stick with lumber. So quarter-to-date average realizations are $15 higher than the third quarter, is that about a third of the volumes that you'd expect to sell in the quarter that that $15 higher would apply to or is it 40%? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think a good way to think about that is it somewhere in the third category. So, I think, generally speaking, it's going to be similar each month over that Q4 period. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Because, I guess, I'm just trying to understand how order files, etc., come into play in the way we're thinking about this. And then, likewise, when you talk about it being $50 lower currently, is that based off where the random print was two or three weeks ago or is that based on where the random print is today? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So just, I guess, a little context for the lag that you see in realizations and I'll be specific to lumber, although it's a similar dynamic in OSB, but just different supply demand dynamics. So, in lumber, generally, you're going to be pricing one to three weeks prior to shipment, which -- that's the lag effect that you see between the print and the delivered realizations. And generally speaking, the nature of the market is that, order files typically extend in hot markets and they shrink in soft markets. So, when we go back to Q3, as prices were climbing, our order files extended out several weeks and the inventories were pretty lean. As we approach peak pricing, customers start moving to the sidelines and the order files shrank down fairly quickly. And so, that lag effect that you see on the upside oftentimes is a little bit longer than what you see on the downside. And so, when you look at that, the current pricing relative to print, that's going to be based on a shorter order file that's coming down versus what it was when it was going up. Mark Weintraub : And so, order of magnitude that $50 lower, what time reference would be most applicable in saying, okay, that -- if we try to mark-to-market? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, at this point, whereas our order files were three-plus weeks as the prices were going up, they're now down to about one week -- one to two weeks. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Okay. And then you mentioned, I think Russ, that channel inventories are generally lean. More color on that if you could? And where would they be, would you say in the various businesses relative to where they normally would be now? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think you can say generally across the board in all product categories, and I'll comment on each specifically. But generally speaking, the inventories in the channel are pretty lean across the board. And when you think about lumber, really the buying is mostly limited to covering immediate needs. I would say, most folks in the market are still trying to determine what lumber prices are going to shake out at and are cautious about really starting to build inventories when they're not clear on what a more stabilized pricing is going to look like. So, I would say, generally speaking, lumber inventory is pretty lean across the system. OSB also very lean, a little bit different dynamic there. Order files in OSB, at least for us, are still pretty extended out four-ish weeks. And so, there's just not a whole lot of extra inventory in the system. You've seen the OSB pricing hold up a little better. And I think that's largely just a function of order files continue to be pretty extended. EWP, similar story. Long, strong order files in EWP. And I'd say, generally, pretty minimal inventory in the channel in that product. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. One last very quick clarification. On the reference to the debt leverage ratios being where you want them to be. Obviously, EBITDA goes up and down and EBITDA is extremely strong right now. Is the absolute level of debt at the level where you would want it to be? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I'd say, from a gross debt perspective -- and you're right, the ratio is a function of EBITDA as well. But from a gross debt perspective, I think we're in the ballpark of where we want to be with the actions we've taken this year and then the $150 million that we have earmarked for the 2021 maturity, that gets you in the neighborhood of $5.3 billion of gross debt, and I think that gives us adequate flexibility really through all parts of the market cycle to stay right around that 3.5 times net debt-to-EBITDA. Mark Weintraub : Great. Thank you. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Mark Connelly : Thanks. Devin, we've been hearing about labor availability as the homebuilding challenge for several years now and yet housing activity seems to be constrained by other stuff and we haven't really seen a big change in construction approaches, which come slowly anyway. So I'm wondering, with your experience in [trusses] manufacturing and all that, are you seeing any signs that the market is preparing to shift or trying to shift to more prefab or something else to reduce labor content? Devin Stockfish : Yes. There's certainly lots of talk about that and I think there are certain homebuilders that are investing in that. Frankly, some of the dealer network partners are also looking at opportunities to really help with some of the off-site manufacturing to deal with the challenges around labor. So it's something that we hear a lot about, you're seeing some of it. I don't know that we're at a point where it's really starting to make a meaningful difference yet. But there is no question that labor has been a challenge, I think, it remains a challenge. In talking to the homebuilders, it's certainly something that's still top of mind for them and they're really looking at all different avenues to try to help with that, from off-site panelization to really ramping up their programs to incent people that come into the trade. So they're really looking at that across the board, because it does still remain a challenge, I think, to get to you, what would otherwise be full building. Mark Connelly : Is there a role for Weyerhaeuser in that process? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think there is, in the sense that, we want to make sure that we stay very close to all of our customers throughout the value chain to make sure that we're looking for opportunities, whether it's panelization, whether it's off-site manufacturing, to leverage our supply chain expertise to get them products and what they need to be successful at the right cost. So, it's something that we are focused on. We're certainly in discussions with all of our partners on how we can help them. I don't know that we're necessarily looking to get into panelized manufacturing, if that's the question. But I do think we'll look for opportunities to leverage that if it does get some momentum with our customers. Mark Connelly : Super. And just one question, you mentioned the fiber log demand in the South being down. If that stays down, how meaningful will that be assuming more normal lumber prices? Clearly, some paper and pulp markets have been hit and aren't going to come back quickly. So, I'm curious is that going lead you to think about shifting harvest cycles or marketing programs. Or is it just not big enough to matter? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I don't think it's big enough to matter. A couple of comments on the Southern fiber markets. Obviously, we've seen some puts and takes in pulp log demand. Some segments, whether it's containerboard, boxboard, those kinds of markets, those have done okay. Printing paper, obviously, in a COVID environment has been somewhat challenged. I don't think all things considered, it's at a point now where it's going to make a meaningful difference to us one way or the other, just in what's going on in the current market conditions. I would say a couple of other comments there, going into fourth quarter for whatever it's worth, I think the log decks for most of the pulp and paper manufacturers are pretty light relative to normal. So, certainly, not significant log inventories in that market. And then the other, just piece of color there is, we did see a number of our pulp log customers defer maintenance earlier in the year when the markets were a little stronger and a lot of that ran through Q3. And so, that's a little bit of the softness that you saw as well. Those are mostly coming out of those maintenance shutdowns as we head into Q4. Mark Connelly : Thank you, Devin. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much and good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Paul Quinn : Hey, just a couple of questions in Wood Products there, Devin. When I take a look at Slide 12 and third-party sales volumes. So this is just shipments for lumber and OSB over the last seven quarters, it's pretty much flat. I'm just wondering on the production side, whether that production has been flat and whether you've been able to meaningfully increase that. And also, whether you are running at capacity? And what's your ability to take that up going forward? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I do think, particularly in the lumber side, we will grow that production over time. We've got the Dierks and the Millport mills that are up and running. I think with respect to Q3, in particular, there were a few things in the quarter, we had to take some downtime in the West due to wildfire smoke. We had downtime at some of our mills in the South with the various hurricanes coming through and power outages, some maintenance downtime, those kinds of things. But over time, our lumber production will increase and even, I'd say, on OSB around the margins just as we continue to improve on reliability across our various products, we'll see some improvement there as well. Paul Quinn : And then just on mass timber and it is part of what Mark was asking around, but there has been a lot of activity there and this is an area that's growing straight line with your sustainability goals. Just -- and you guys already manufacture a number of components for it. Just wondering if that's an area of interest to be able to expand that side of the business. Devin Stockfish : Yes. We're really excited about the momentum we're seeing around cross-laminated timber, mass timber, it's certainly something that has gotten people excited across the board and we're seeing that move, frankly, faster than we had anticipated. So, we are in touch with the manufacturers of CLT. I don't know, in the near-term, we're really looking to get into manufacturing CLT. But certainly, we know how to manufacture wood products and we'll continue to look at that market down the road, maybe that makes sense. But I think in the near-term, it's really more of an opportunity for us to sell lumber and other engineered wood products into that space. Paul Quinn : All right. That's all I had. Best of luck. Devin Stockfish : Terrific. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks. Good morning, guys. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Buck Horne : I wanted to go back to the dividend for a quick follow-up, maybe you -- maybe I missed this early in the discussion. I'm just curious on the timing of the initial supplemental dividend with the suspension of the dividend for the better part of this year and, of course, the strong EBITDA results coming out of Wood Products. What was the decision process in terms of not doing a supplemental dividend in the first quarter of '21 and then waiting another full year for the first payment to be in 2022? What's the -- what was the thought process in going that much further out with the supplemental? Devin Stockfish : Yes. A couple of comments on that. I guess, first, when we think about the cash flow that we generated from 2020, clearly, we have prioritized debt reduction with the cash flow that we've generated this year. We've allocated over $1 billion to debt reduction, which has been a significant percentage of our overall 2020 cash flow, which is the $400 million that we've reduced gross debt year-to-date. The $500 million we're paying down in Q4, another $150 million we've got earmarked for 2021. And so, this has really taken us to a place where we've reduced leverage, where we feel it's an appropriate level of cross-business cycles. Obviously, we have also returned $375 million of cash through the dividend payment that we made in Q1 and the fourth quarter dividend we just declared. So, on balance, that's how we allocated the cash flow from 2020. When we talk about the supplemental dividend, we talk about Q1 2022 payout. I mean, that's generally going to be the approach with the dividend framework to do that annually. But again, as we said, we're not going to be overly dogmatic there, could there be a situation where we would consider an interim supplemental dividend during 2021, even Q1? Certainly, I think that's conceivable. We wouldn't shut the door on that possibility. We're going to continue to look at that. But again, we're expecting that, on -- as a general matter, the supplemental dividend will be paid out annually in most circumstances. Buck Horne : Okay. Thanks for that color. I appreciate that. And just with the[notes] in the Wood Products a little bit further. Just maybe longer-term bigger picture, I think we agree with you, certainly on the potential runway for the housing recovery and the single-family housing shortage that in all the demographic factors that go into that equation, and of course, the demand for lumber capacity is going to likely continue to increase. How do you guys look at the longer-term potential of your existing Wood Products capacity in terms of what additional CapEx projects could move the needle to increase your capacity internally with higher return projects? And/or would you need to -- or would you consider additional acquisition opportunities if there are any out there to increase your manufacturing capacity? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, I think there definitely are opportunities for us through our capital expenditures program to continue to drive value through the Wood Products business. We have done, I think a remarkable job over the last four or five years with our CapEx in the Wood Products business. We've been primarily focused during that time on cost reduction. I think you've seen that shown up in our relative performance. In that business, we've reached the point of being black at the bottom. We did have some come along volume that came through those programs to date as I mentioned with Dierks and with Millport. We've got a number of additional projects in the queue that we think can return very good returns, continue to ensure that we have a very cost-effective, efficient mill set and in that, will be some opportunities for increased lumber capacity and production as well. So, this is something I think is really -- it's a great opportunity for us and we'll continue to look at that. I would expect us to provide more guidance on 2021 CapEx on our next earnings call. Buck Horne : All right. Thanks. Good luck. Thank you. Appreciate it. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Buck Horne : Take care. Operator : Our next question comes from Steve Chercover with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Steven Chercover : Good morning. Thanks for taking my late question. So, if memory serves, I had to step away from my desk, you took an $80 million write-off for the Oregon fires. In a prime west side Oregon, the land is about $4,000 an acre. Is it safe to say that greater than 20,000 acres were destroyed or can you just give us a number? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, just a little context around that. So, for us, we had about 125,000 acres that were impacted to some extent. What I would say is, when you think about each individual acre, they were impacted depending on topography, age class, the rate of spread, species. So, it's variable the extent of the damage. But what I would say is, at a high-level, at least based on our early work in the salvage operations, we think we're going to be able to capture the vast majority of value on our merchantable timber. So, in other words, as we have gone in, even on the acres that had relatively severe burn, we are still able to capture the value of the fiber, the bark has done its job and protected the underlying fiber. So, we do think the good news there -- obviously, it's never a good news when you have a big fire like this, but the good news is, we think we're going to be able to capture most of the value on that merchantable timber over the next, call it, 12 months to 18 months. Steven Chercover : Yes. That's why I assume that the acreage impacted was substantially more than, call it, the total loss for a certain volume. So, over the 20 years I've covered Weyerhaeuser and also Plum Creek, everyone has self-insured and I'm wondering if that makes you rethink the whole notion of insurance, acknowledging that premiums tend to go up significantly after a disaster. Devin Stockfish : Yes. As a practical matter, there is really no economically feasible way to buy insurance on significant acreage of timberland. And so, for us, the way we mitigate fire risk is, we have a diverse area of timberland coverage across various regions. We are very active in our work around fire management, working with other landowners in the state to make sure to the greatest extent possible that we're protecting our lands. But there is going to be some risk, that's the nature of the business, and it's really not something that you can [uncover] -- that you can cover through insurance. Steven Chercover : Yes. And finally, I'm in Oregon, so I can attest to this how windy it was and how extreme the weather was. But normally your lands are sufficiently managed, but it's really only adjacent land, federal lands that catch on fire that impact you. And was this just a whole new kettle of fish? Devin Stockfish : Well, it was just a -- it was a situation -- this is the worst fire situation we've had in decades, and it was just a situation where the humidity dropped really low. We had a period of no rain. So, it was very dry. You had fire start-up and then you had the significant wind, and when all of those things happen together, it can get bad quickly as we saw this year. But, look, we're not -- it's not anything new dealing with fires. It's something that we see in the West every year. Most years, we have very minimal damage and impact. This was just a tough year. Steven Chercover : Okay. Thanks. Good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, thank you. And thanks to everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your interest in Weyerhaeuser. Stay safe and healthy, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations and Enterprise Planning. Thank you, Ms. Baum. You may begin. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2020 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com.  Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website.  On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Russell Hagen, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $797 million or $1.07 per diluted share, on net sales of $7.5 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2020 earnings totaled $962 million or $1.29 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was $2.2 billion, more than 70% increase over full year 2019 and the highest EBITDA performance in nearly 15 years. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $292 million or $0.39 per diluted share, on net sales of $2.1 billion. Excluding net after-tax charges of $69 million for special items, we earned $361 million or $0.48 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $657 million, or more than 150% higher than fourth quarter 2019.  I'd like to open this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our employees for their exceptional performance, dedication, resiliency and flexibility in 2020. Our people maintained a safety focus, continued to serve our customers and delivered strong results in the face of unprecedented operating and market challenges. All of our businesses executed exceptionally well, further strengthening our unrivaled portfolio of assets, improving our industry-leading operating performance and positioning the company to drive superior long-term value for shareholders.  I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2020, which included : delivering a record-breaking $1.5 billion of adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products segment, a more than $1 billion increase over 2019; capturing approximately $100 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, significantly exceeding our annual target; achieving record low controllable manufacturing costs in our lumber operations; strategically upgrading our Oregon Timberland Holdings; reducing gross debt by more than $900 million; introducing a new dividend framework that is sustainable across market cycles; reducing employee and contractor serious injuries by over 50%; and launching a new sustainability strategy.  Before I discuss fourth quarter business results, let me first make some comments on the housing market. U.S. housing activity continued its torrid pace throughout the fourth quarter, with no seasonal slowdown in building activity. Total U.S. housing starts averaged 1.6 million units for the fourth quarter on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 11% over the third quarter.  Single-family starts were the primary catalyst, improving nearly 20% quarter-over-quarter. Single-family now represents approximately 80% of new residential construction activity compared with 66% one year ago. Additionally, housing permits have surged to the highest level since before the Great Recession, reaching a seasonally adjusted 1.7 million units in December.  As we progress into 2021, we expect numerous macroeconomic tailwinds will continue to drive favorable U.S. housing activity, including a post-COVID preference for larger single-family homes, supported by ongoing work-from-home flexibility, mortgage interest rates near record lows, strong homebuilder confidence, record low inventory for existing home sales, demographic trends that support growing millennial homeownership while older adults are deciding to age in place, and the possibility of a federal tax credit for first-time homebuyers under the Biden administration.  U.S. homebuilders are seeing strong demand in January, with months of backlog, and this supports what we are hearing anecdotally from our customers. Certain cautionary headwinds are worth noting, most notably, constraints relating to building materials as well as lot and labor availability challenges for homebuilders. However, the housing backdrop appears increasingly favorable, and we anticipate 1.45 million housing starts in 2021, primarily driven by continued strength in single-family activity. With an aging housing stock, rising home equity and low interest rates, we expect repair and remodel activity will also remain strong in 2021. Collectively, we expect these positive housing dynamics to be a tailwind for our businesses over the next several years.  Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the third quarter. Earnings increased by $297 million, which included a $182 million gain on the previously announced sale of certain Southern Oregon Timberlands. Western Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $30 million compared with the third quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations for domestic and Japan export logs.  In the western domestic market, demand remained favorable throughout the quarter as mills sought to take advantage of strong lumber prices and replenish lean inventory positions following the severe fire season. Log markets were tight to start the quarter, particularly in Oregon, where some harvest operations were slow to come online as landowners prepared for salvage activity. As salvage operations commenced, log supply improved and pricing for smaller diameter logs softened, primarily in markets with significant salvage activity.  Our fee harvest volume increased by 9% compared with the third quarter as we fully resumed harvest operations and initiated salvage activity on our affected Timberlands in Oregon. We are not experiencing any downgrades and realizations on our salvage logs. Log and haul costs increased modestly during the fourth quarter due to higher safety and operational requirements, moderately lower yields and increased hauling distances to market, all associated with salvage logging activity in Oregon. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs strengthened through the fourth quarter as housing activity improved and robust U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber. Our Japanese log sales volumes and realizations increased significantly compared with the third quarter. Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs strengthened in China in the fourth quarter as container availability reduced the supply of European salvage and Australian imports were restricted due to pest issues. Our sales volumes to China increased significantly over the third quarter and average realizations increased slightly.  Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets improved modestly in the fourth quarter, as strong lumber and panel pricing drove steady demand and wet weather limited log supply in some Atlantic Coast markets. Fiber markets in most areas softened slightly as seasonal maintenance outages reduced demand, although the Atlantic markets remained more tensioned due to limited log availability.  Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower in the third -- slightly lower than the third quarter as we completed less spending activity due to the unusually wet October weather. Average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter as improved realizations for sawlogs were offset by slightly lower fiber log realizations. Northern Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased $2 million compared with the third quarter, partially due to slightly higher sales realizations for hardwood logs.  Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, Pages 10 and 11. Real Estate and E&R contributed $14 million to fourth quarter earnings and $23 million to adjusted EBITDA. For the full year, the segment generated $241 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly more than our revised full year guidance. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $37 million lower than the third quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2019, our Real Estate sales activity in 2020 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was up significantly compared to the third quarter and the year ago quarter due to transaction mix. Fourth quarter 2020 included an unusually high proportion of high value, small parcel transactions.  Wood products, Pages 12 and 13. Wood Products contributed $481 million to fourth quarter earnings and $530 million to adjusted EBITDA. I'm incredibly proud of our strong performance in Wood Products this year, despite significant operational disruptions and challenges from the pandemic. In 2020, our lumber and OSB businesses delivered the highest full year adjusted EBITDA on record. And our distribution business generated the highest adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years.  In the fourth quarter, demand remained strong across our product lines, with robust new residential construction activity, a limited seasonal slowdown in repair and remodel and favorable weather conditions for construction. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter at record levels, but declined sharply through October, as repair and remodel activity began to ease and buyers limited replenishment in expectation of a seasonal slowdown in housing. As the quarter progressed, strong construction activity, lean inventories and concerns about COVID-related supply disruptions drove buyers to step back in and pricing improved through December. On average, the framing lumber composite decreased 9% in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter. OSB markets performed at a stronger pace, with pricing softening only modestly in late November and rebounding shortly thereafter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 18% compared with the third quarter. EBITDA for lumber decreased $109 million compared with the third quarter. Average sales realizations decreased by 10% and Western and Canadian log costs increased significantly. Sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. OSB delivered a record $220 million of EBITDA during the fourth quarter, surpassing the prior record by $60 million, which was established just last quarter. Average sales realizations improved by 27%. Operating rates decreased compared with the third quarter. And unit manufacturing costs increased as we completed planned maintenance shutdowns at 4 of our OSB mills.  Engineered wood products' EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the third quarter as a result of higher raw material costs, primarily for oriented strand board web stock. Average realizations for solid section and I-joists improved slightly as we began to capture the benefit of our third quarter price increases.  In distribution, EBITDA decreased $13 million compared to the third quarter due to a modest seasonal reduction in sales volumes. Despite this reduction, our current distribution business established a new fourth quarter EBITDA record as demand remained above what is typical for this time of year.  Now I'd like to turn to operational excellence. Our employees continued an unwavering commitment to OpEx despite a very challenging operating environment. In 2020, our teams delivered approximately $100 million of margin improvements, exceeding our $50 million to $70 million target, while also capturing meaningful opportunities to enhance future value, avoid future costs and improve efficiencies across our enterprise.  In Timberlands, business -- our Timberlands business delivered $43 million of OpEx improvements in 2020, with notable contributions from initiatives to increase mechanized harvesting in the west, implement machine planting in the south and optimize our southern fertilization activity. The business also created significant future value through initiatives to reduce reforestation turnaround time, further enhanced seedling survival rates and improve data capture and analysis capabilities through expanded use of drones and LIDAR technology.  Wood Products captured $50 million of OpEx enhancements through a continued focus on controllable costs, mill reliability and enhanced product mix. This enabled us to achieve multiple operating records and milestones despite fluctuating operating postures in response to the pandemic. For example, our lumber business achieved record low controllable manufacturing costs for the second consecutive year, and our OSB mills increased reliability and delivered record production volumes. The business has also avoided future costs through procurement and efficiency initiatives. In addition to these achievements, we captured $13 million of cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. Examples include an ongoing effort to ensure that every log we sell internally is routed to its most value-accretive mill, strategically flexing harvest volume to our internal mills to reduce out-of-log downtime. And flexing our wood products procurement to consume additional fee harvest logs during the pandemic-related market disruptions. As we look forward to 2021, we're targeting another $50 million to $75 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses. And I'm excited to see the creativity, innovation and collaboration that emerges as we continuously strive to deliver industry-leading operating performance across all business segments.  I'll now turn it over to Russell to discuss some financial items and our first quarter outlook. Russell Hagen : Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin our key financial items, which are summarized on pages 15 and 16. Cash from operations totaled $444 million for the fourth quarter and over $1.5 billion for the full year. This is our highest fourth quarter operating cash flow since 2007, and our strongest full year operating cash flow since 2005. We invested a portion of this cash back into our Timberlands and Wood Products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $281 million for the full year. Adjusted funds available for distribution, or FAD, for 2020, totaled $1.24 billion, as highlighted on Page 16.  We used a significant portion of this year's adjusted FAD to reduce our debt outstanding. During the fourth quarter, we redeemed our $500 million 4 5/8% notes that were due September 2023. We incurred a $58 million pretax charge on the early extinguishment, which is included in our results as a special item. We ended the year with just under $5.5 billion of total debt outstanding, which is a reduction of approximately $900 million in 2020.  This activity, in addition to strong 2020 EBITDA performance, has substantially improved our net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio, which, at the end of 2020, was 2.3x compared to a high of 4.9x at the end of 2019. With this reduction, our leverage ratio is comfortably below our target of 3.5x net debt to adjusted EBITDA over the cycle. We also have cash earmark to repay our $150 million, 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter of 2021. After repayment of this note, we will have no additional debt maturities until late 2023.  In addition to improving our leverage, we returned over $380 million to shareholders during the year, which included reinitiating the dividend with a $0.17 per share base quarterly dividend, which was paid in the fourth quarter 2020. Overall, we ended the year in a strong financial position, with a sustainable dividend framework and a debt structure that is appropriate over the cycle and supports our solid investment-grade credit profile.  Turning now to our key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2021, which are summarized on Pages 17 and 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. In our Western Timberlands operations, we expect our first quarter domestic log sales volumes will be comparable to the fourth quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the fourth quarter at moderate levels, and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber markets. We expect first quarter domestic average sales realizations will be slightly below the fourth quarter average. We anticipate the first quarter fee harvest volumes will be comparable with the fourth quarter. We also expect Western road spending will be lower compared to the fourth quarter as our roadwork activity slows during the winter months.  We revised our 2021 Western harvest plan to focus Oregon salvage activities, and we currently anticipate salvage wood will comprise nearly half of the 2021 Western harvest volume.  We'll be front-loading this activity as we are not currently experiencing any price erosion for our salvage logs. Additionally, unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly compared to the fourth quarter. The salvage activity results in lower efficiency and increased hauling distance to market. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, our first quarter average sales realizations and average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Log demand remained strong as Japanese housing activity improved in the fourth quarter, and lumber imports to Japan remain limited. Chinese export log sales realizations and average log sales volumes are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Demand remains solid, supported by an improving economy, government infrastructure spending and continued disruptions in the supply of log imports. In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be higher than fourth quarter following the conclusion of our 2020 harvest reductions. Additionally, we expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to be comparable to fourth quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower.  Turning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2021, we expect total company harvest volume will be approximately 34.5 million tons. We expect our southern harvest volumes will be up approximately 10%, and as we resume a more normalized level of activity following our 2020 pandemic-related harvest reductions. In the West, we expect our harvest volumes will be approximately 5% lower. This reflects the lower productivity on our salvage logging operations. We expect Northern harvest volumes to be moderately lower than 2020. This reflects the divestiture of our Montana Timberlands and softer demand for northern fiber logs. I'll wrap up the Timberlands segment with a few comments on our fourth quarter Oregon Timberlands transactions. As Devin indicated, fourth quarter included a gain of $182 million on the sale of 149,000 Southern Oregon acres, which was reported as a special item. We reported a cash inflow of $381 million related to this sale and a cash outflow of $425 million for the purchase of 85,000 acres in mid-coastal Oregon Timberlands. The net cash outflow for these 2 transactions was $44 million.  Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Interest in our Real estate Properties remain strong. A shifting societal preferences during this time are driving robust demand for real recreational properties. We expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million. And we anticipate the cadence of our 2021 real estate activity will be similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. Land basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 45% to 55% for the year. For the first quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA for this segment will be modestly lower than first quarter 2020 due to the timing of transactions. We expect net earnings, however, to be slightly higher than the first quarter 2020 due to mix.  For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity carried forward from the fourth quarter at very favorable levels, and our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, demand is expected to remain solid as rising home equity, continued work-from-home trends and an aging housing stock drive continued interest in home remodeling and upgrades. Channel inventories remain generally lean, with limited purchasing in advance of the spring building season. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter.  Production volumes within our OSB and engineered wood businesses are expected to increase during the quarter, following the completion of planned maintenance in the fourth quarter. We expect improved manufacturing costs across our product lines and slightly higher sales volumes, primarily for lumber and engineered wood products, while costs should be comparable to the fourth quarter.  Entering the first quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board reached a new peak in January, and the framing lumber composite is also at near-record levels. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $210 higher, and current realizations are approximately $250 higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $55 higher, and our current sales realizations are approximately $70 higher than the fourth quarter average.  As a reminder, for lumber, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realizations is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.  For engineered wood products average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products will be modestly higher as we capture the benefits of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021.  Turning now to the major components of our unallocated items as summarized on Page 14. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $3 million lower than the third quarter, with unfavorable variances from elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO and the effects of foreign exchange rates, partially offset by lower variable compensation expense. The charge for the elimination of intersegment profit and inventory on LIFO was primarily driven by a seasonal increase in log inventories at the end of the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter, when inventories were below normal levels.  Moving to pension. In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which transfers approximately $765 million of our U.S. pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. Contract purchase was funded from our U.S. pension plan assets, with no company cash contribution required. As a result of this transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $253 million noncash pretax settlement charge. The transaction is the latest in a series of actions taken to reduce our pension plan obligations.  We have now settled nearly $3 billion since the beginning of these efforts in 2018. For our pension and post-employment plans, the year ended 2020 funded status decreased by approximately $200 million compared to 2019, driven primarily by lower discount rates. Discount rates decreased by approximately 90 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Cash paid for pension and post-retirement plans in 2020 was $30 million. In 2021, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified plan. Our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million.  Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, nonoperating pension and postretirement expense was $37 million in 2020. We expect to report approximately $35 million of expense in 2021. I'll wrap up with a few additional outlook items highlighted on Page 18. Our full year 2020 interest expense, before special items, was approximately $350 million. This excludes our early extinguishment of debt charges of $92 million. We expect interest expense will be $315 million for the full year 2021.  Turning to capital expenditures. We expect total CapEx for 2021 will be approximately $420 million, which includes $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $300 million for Wood Products and $5 million for planned corporate IT system investments. Wood Products' CapEx is increasing as we undertake some of the high-return capital projects deferred last year, and began a multiyear project to modernize our strategic hold in Louisiana sawmill. Similar to the highly successful rebuilds of our Dierks and Millport sawmills, this project will significantly reduce the mill's cost structure, enhance its product mix to better serve market demand and optimize the equipment to more efficiently process logs from our adjacent timberlands. These improvements will also result in approximately 100 million board feet of additional production capacity. This will begin ramping up in 2023 when the project is completed.  Turning now to taxes. Our full year 2020 effective tax rate was 20%, excluding special items. For the first quarter and full year 2021, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid in net $76 million for the full year 2020. As previously discussed, we expect to receive a $90 million refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution in mid-2021. Excluding this refund, we expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. Now I'll turn the call back over to Devin, and I look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Russell. In closing, I want to, again, thank our employees for their dedication, flexibility and adherence to our company values in 2020, despite being tested personally and professionally in ways that, frankly, weren't imaginable at this time last year. Notwithstanding these challenges, we achieved remarkable operating results, and I'm very pleased with the progress we made on numerous strategic initiatives. Looking forward, I'm excited by the opportunities in front of us this year. U.S. housing market has accelerated sharply, and we believe that strong macroeconomic and demand fundamentals will continue to support a favorable backdrop for our products.  The potential for a federal stimulus package from the new administration could also drive incremental demand for our products. Our manufacturing facilities are operating with unprecedented reliability and an industry-leading cost structure. We have a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that enables us to return meaningful cash to shareholders across market conditions. In mass timber and climate Solutions, including potential opportunities relating to carbon, present exciting new sources of future demand.  Entering 2021, we're well positioned, and we remain steadfast in our pursuit to serve customers and create value for our shareholders through an unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Devin, your southern log prices have been fairly flat over the past year, which kind of corresponds to the South-wide averages that we see from Timbermart-South. I'm just wondering, there seems to be some subregions of the South that are seeing real price tension and maybe some regions where prices seem challenged in the long term. I guess my question is, when we look sort of underneath the hood of that flat average price, is there any color you can give us on sort of the regional differences between what you're seeing maybe in your strongest submarket and weakest submarket?  And then you upgraded the Oregon footprint last year. With your balance sheet where it is, is there maybe a kind of a parallel opportunity or a bigger opportunity to upgrade sort of the regional footprint in the south? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Maybe I'll take that in a few different pieces. Just, at a high level, Anthony, you're right. We are still seeing issues in the south that really -- it goes back to the Great Recession with the oversupply that we've seen in a number of markets. As you note, that, obviously, differs somewhat by market. And it's always important to remember that supply and demand are very wood basket specific.  Now as I would say, the good news is that we've seen a fair amount of new capacity coming into the South, about 6.5 billion board feet of new capacity over the last several years, some recent announcements on some new capacity. A couple of those are in wood baskets that should be very favorable to us, the [indiscernible] mill, Idaho Forest products mill in Mississippi. And we're expecting continued new capacity coming into the south in the coming years.  When we think about the submarkets, a thing to remember is that our business has scale across all major markets. And this really allows us to take advantage of stronger markets, such as the Atlantic region, really from Florida up through North Carolina. We have about 1.2 million acres in total across those regions. We're also starting to see some improvements in certain markets and other regions, Southern Arkansas, Central Mississippi, North Central Louisiana, some areas of Georgia and Alabama.  We're starting to see a little bit of tension in there that, I think, could continue to grow here over time. And then the other thing I would just mention is just the export markets in the South. As you know, back in 2018, we really had started ramping up our export programs primarily to China. With the tariff situation that came into play, we backed that off, but now the tariffs have come off. We've reaccelerated our export programs into China, picking up some India opportunities as well.  So that's another area, frankly, for those regions that have proximity to a port, to tension that up over time. With respect to the optimization work that we did in Oregon, that's work that is ongoing all the time. That's true in the West. It's true in the South. We've been doing that for quite a while, frankly, with Russell's new role and some of the work they're doing. I would expect that, that work will continue and perhaps even accelerate going forward. But again, we're going to continue to look for ways to drive value across our portfolio, and that will include optimization work for sure, both in the South and the West. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching gears. I mean, with Biden taking office, there have been kind of a flurry of announcements on the first-time homebuyer credit and environmental plan, stimulus, maybe more moderate approach to China. Of what you've seen, what could be the most meaningful for Weyerhaeuser near term? Is there anything that can really move the needle in 2021? And then maybe any thoughts kind of on the long term? Devin Stockfish : Yes. As with the new administration, there are going to be some puts and takes, and we're watching that closely. Tax, regulatory policy, those are things that we look for really in any administration to see how that's going to impact our business. But I do think, as you noted, there are some real opportunities for us with the Biden Administration. You mentioned a couple of them. A more normalized trade environment where we can avoid tariffs into China will help us continue to accelerate our export programs into that market, which should be a positive. I think, on the immigration side, a little bit different policy, perhaps, could allow some additional labor, both into the homebuilder market, which is downstream for us, but also even in the forestry side. And I think that could be a benefit. The infrastructure plan, we'll see how that progresses. But to the extent that we got a significant infrastructure plan through Congress, that's something that could spur some additional demand for our products.  And then I think the big thing is really just around the environmental policies that come out of the administration around global warming and climate change. And that's certainly something that, I think, will find its way into every aspect of policy under the new administration. And I think that's something that could have some incrementally positive benefits for us. Since that falls squarely within Russell's new responsibilities, maybe I'll ask Russell, anything you want to mention specifically on the carbon side? Russell Hagen : Sure. I mean, clearly, the Biden Administration is going to focus on climate change, and we're seeing some of the policy specific to carbon, starting to get framed up and discussed. The early actions that they've taken demonstrates that this is going to be a focal point for them. So I would say at a federal level, I don't -- I'd be surprised if we saw a carbon tax or cap and trade type structure. I just don't think the political will is there to pull something off like that. But I do think we'll see policies supporting climate change mitigation across all the federal agencies. And that could come in the form of purchasing preferences for wood-based building because of the environmental benefits of that, solutions aimed at forest health and then recognizing the benefits of carbon stored in wood. And so I think those are all very positive, not only for Weyerhaeuser, but for the industry as a whole.  So again, as they continue to focus on this area, we'll see more innovation, and we'll see markets continue to mature. And I think that's beneficial, again, for the industry and for Weyerhaeuser, in particular. Operator : Our next question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Congratulations on the results. I wanted to start with a top-down question for you related to housing and kind of the ultimate impact on demand. So you enumerated a number of things, demographics, the move towards larger single-family homes and these sorts of things. I would also imagine a benefit to housing would be hopefully improved employment and wages for that matter, too. That said, some of our contacts are beginning to get a little bit worried about affordability based on rates moving higher and home prices moving up even more quickly. So I acknowledge that the answer is probably going to be all of the above, but of the things that you talked about in your opening comments, what gives you the most confidence that housing can continue to move higher? What gives your customers that confidence, given what's been a little bit of a spike in the wrong way in terms of affordability? Devin Stockfish : Yes. And I think you note the affordability piece is going to be a headwind. There's no question about that. In terms of just the confidence, though, around the building environment right now, it just -- it starts with overwhelming demand for homes. There is virtually no existing home inventory for sale at present. The new home inventory for sale is pretty low. And I think we've just hit a point where, whether it's specific to COVID or whether it's just the demographic trends have finally reached that inflection point, there's just a significant amount of demand in really all markets that we participate for more housing. And the builders are really -- they're confident that they're going to have a lot of building activity this year.  Certainly, I think to the extent that interest rates can stay relatively low in the near term, which seems to be the federal policy at present, that will be supportive. But in any event, it goes back to some of the things we've been talking about for years, which is, we've been massively underbuilding in the United States for over a decade. We need to build millions of homes over and above just kind of keeping pace with normal demand just to get back to even.  So I think there are a lot of tailwinds to support that, but you're exactly right. The affordability piece is the one that is going to have to be solved. But, in the near term, at least for 2021, we're feeling pretty positive about the construction setup for this year. George Staphos : You had mentioned, switching gears a bit, this new sawmill project in Louisiana where you're rebuilding the mill much as you did with dirks and the other project, and you're adding about 100 billion board feet of capacity by '23. What else can you do across panels, across lumber to improve your ability to produce given, I imagine, in a lot of places you're more or less sold out. And as we just talked, demand looks like it's not stopping its growth anytime soon. What can you crank out of your mills, either with additional projects like Louisiana project or through productivity or additional shifts to get more capacity? And what kind of number would you put on that in terms of new capacity or creep? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So just a few comments there. Just really briefly a comment on hold in. This is a project that we're really excited about. This mill is very strategically located. It's situated very well in terms of serving some key customers. It's surrounded by a significant amount of our fee timberlands. This new mill configuration. It's going to allow us to improve the product mix from the mill. We've got a great employee base there. So we're really excited about this. I think this is going to be along the lines of our Dierks and Millport mill in terms of just really a very low-cost, highly efficient mill that's going to make some great lumber over time. In terms of the ability to flex up for additional volume in the near term, we are very focused on improving mill reliability across our footprint. And that comes into play in a number of different instances. And a good example of that, right? Is on the OSB side, where we hit a production volume record in 2020, notwithstanding the fact that we took a fair amount of downtime in the spring. And so those reliability improvements will provide extra volume across the system. And that's equally true from a lumber and an EWP standpoint. So there's going to be some volume creep that comes through that. And we're continuing to invest back in our mills across the system as part of our CapEx program. But what I would note is that those capital programs are largely focused on reducing costs, improving reliability and driving efficiencies in the system as opposed to being directly focused at increasing our volumes.  And so that's a long-winded way of saying, we are adding another 100 million of volume from our holding project, continuing to ramp up Millport, so maybe another 50 million to 60 million board feet coming off of Millport this year. And then just some additional flex from continuing to run our mills well, at least that's the answer here in the short term. George Staphos : No, that's good color, Devin. A last one, if I could ask, what was the effect of the maintenance outage activity in the fourth quarter in Wood Products? If you could give us some sort of guardrail on what that might have impacted your numbers by? Devin Stockfish : Yes. And so that was in our OSB business. And that really drove unit manufacturing costs up by $10 million to $15 million for the quarter. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Devin, it's hard to imagine where we were just 9 months ago. Devin Stockfish : Well, that is an understatement, Mark. I think, for sure. It's been a wild ride in 2020. Mark Wilde : Yes. Probably something good for all of us to keep in mind. Just following on George's question. Can you give us some sense then of, beyond that $10 million to $15 million of maintenance in the fourth quarter, what we have that's kind of helping you from just operations and throughput standpoint in wood in the first quarter? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So really, if you think about for Wood Products, Q4 to Q1, that's around $35 million net of any increases in OSB or lumber pricing. The majority of that, a little over half, is going to be on reduced manufacturing costs, and then the rest is going to be some incremental volume and a little bit of price as we recognize the increases in EWP. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's helpful. And then if we continue on the current trajectory for the next 6 to 9 months, you're going to generate a lot, a lot of cash. Could you just give us some thoughts on how you would prioritize the use of tariff? Whether you might pull at supplement a dividend forward, whether you might be in the market repurchasing stock, whether you just would accumulate cash, what the priorities might look like? Devin Stockfish : Well, we're optimistic that we are going to see strong markets over the course of 2021. And if that plays out, like you say, we're going to generate some very strong cash flow. As we've indicated with our new dividend framework, the plan is to return 75% to 80% of our 2021 FAD back to shareholders, both through the base dividend and then, ultimately, the supplemental dividend.  And any cash flow over and above that 75% to 80% of FAD would be available for growth, further debt paydown or, under the right circumstances, share repurchase. And so we'll continue to look at those opportunistically and allocate the cash to those opportunities that create the most long-term value for shareholders. And I would say Timberland's growth opportunities are an area that I would expect we'll continue to look closely at, both from just an optimization standpoint and growth more generally. But obviously, that's something that's dependent on finding the right deals that are accretive and strategic. And so we're going to continue to be very disciplined in that respect.  In terms of a potential interim supplemental dividend this year, as we mentioned, the new framework really anticipates that supplemental dividend is going to pay -- be paid out annually in Q1 for the prior year. And really, the reason for that is just to make sure that we're matching our variable dividend component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. So generally, we're anticipating that, that first supplemental dividend would be paid in the first quarter of 2022 based on the 2021 cash flow. Now look, if things go really well, could there be a situation where we would consider some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year? Certainly, that's conceivable. I wouldn't shut the door on that definitively. But again, we're expecting that to be paid out annually in Q1 under most circumstances. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. And then the last one for me is just, we are more consolidation taking place in both wood products manufacturing with this West Fraser-Norbord deal. We're also seeing consolidation taking place in the building products distribution business. Can you help us think about the impact or implications of that for Weyerhaeuser's businesses? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So comment on West Fraser-Norbord and the BFS-BMC deals. On West Fraser-Norbord, we have a lot of respect for both of those companies. Both Ray and Peter have solid teams. They're both very well-run companies. I'm sure the combined company will be very well run. These companies are both customers and competitors for us. And so we're going to continue to do everything we can to be good suppliers for them on the log side. And then, obviously, we'll compete with them in the lumber and OSB markets.  The BFS-BMC merger, both of those businesses have been long-standing customers of Weyerhaeuser. We've had really good working relationships with both of these firms. Dave Flitman has put together a strong team from the combined firm. And I anticipate we'll continue to have a great relationship with BFS going forward. And we'll work with them as we always have, to help find ways to create value in their supply chain and for their customers.  I think, just on consolidation, generally, I'm sure that there are still some opportunities out there in the market for companies to create value for their stakeholders through consolidation. Timing specifics, those things are always hard to predict, but I wouldn't be surprised if there's continued consolidation in the markets. Mark Wilde : But do you see any implication for you in those businesses or not? Devin Stockfish : Well, I mean, so we're always looking for opportunities to create value as well. And so I wouldn't comment specifically on any deals, but we're always looking for opportunities to improve the value of our portfolio. If you're asking specifically about the West Fraser-Norbord or BFS-BMC deals, I don't think those are going to have a materially -- material impact on any of our businesses. We'll continue to work with them as we always have and compete with them as we always have. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Mark Weintraub : Devin, one question, kind of following up on actually both George and Mark. So if you were to ballpark what production in lumber and OSB for you guys in 2021 might be, how much of a pickup? And kind of as a part of that, was there much in the way of COVID disruptions, labor force disruptions that affected your production levels during the year? Devin Stockfish : Yes. With respect to the second part of the question, the answer is yes. We did take some downtime in the spring really across all 3 of our businesses. And so that did have an impact on our overall volumes for the year. As we think about 2021 relative to 2020, I think it's safe to assume we'll have a few percentage points of increased volumes across those businesses really as a result of both continued focus on reliability, but also just with the 2020 comp being down a little bit due to that market-related downtime in the spring. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then shifting gears to 1 area where you used to make a lot more money and the question being, can that be happening again sooner rather than later? And that's in kind of the western timberlands, where, obviously, your export markets used to be a terrific driver. Given that 1.45 million housing start forecast you're anticipating, what does -- does it appear that, that basket might get more tension, and we might see some real price action there? Or what would be your thoughts at this juncture? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So I think the short answer is, yes. With this level of housing activity, just as a general statement, the western market is, by far, the most tension market in the United States. And a big driver of what kept log pricing down for really all of 2019 and a portion of 2020 was depressed lumber prices. And so what we've historically seen, at least in the recent past, is much of the benefit of lumber prices increasing will go back to the woods in the form of log pricing. But obviously, people are not going to pay more for logs that caused them to be cash flow negative. And so when you have low lumber prices, that does put some restrictions on your ability to increase log prices.  But as we continue to see lumber prices stay at healthy levels, the tension in the market will remain. Certainly, we've seen strong export markets. Coming out of Q4 into Q1, we expect that to continue. That's a japan statement. That's a China statement. So the market tension is there. It's really just a function of what lumber prices are doing. The only caveat to that, Mark, is just, there will be a dynamic going on in portions of Oregon this year as landowners work through their salvage volumes. And so one of the things that we're seeing here, probably in the near term, is that, as all of the landowners, ourselves included, are working through salvage activity, what that typically means is that you're harvesting some stands that are younger than you would normally harvest. And so as we're out and we're harvesting stands that are in the low 30s as opposed to 40 to 45, we are going to see more chip and saw really going into that market. So that may have a little bit of a depressive effect here for a portion of 2021. But overall, the wood basket in Washington and Oregon remains fairly tensioned. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Connelly with Stephens, Inc. Mark Connelly : This is one of the first calls we've listened to where we haven't heard a lot of warnings about transportation and logistics. So I was wondering if you could just give us a sense of how that is playing out now? And what do you think that's going to become a bigger issue for you? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I'd say we didn't mention it specifically, but that does not mean that there aren't issues around transportation. Trucking availability in the south, in particular, is pretty tight and so a lot of companies are having some challenges finding trucking capacity in the South. The rail issues haven't been as significant this year as they have, in some years in the past, some tightness in certain geographies. But overall, not seeing the same magnitude of issue with rail. But again, I would say trucking capacity is a bit tight, particularly in the South, and folks are struggling somewhat with that. Mark Connelly : That's still a pretty good situation to be in. And as you respond to the short-term market conditions in pulpwood, have you made or are you contemplating any substantial longer-term harvest plan changes? Or is it just too early way and see how much that goes back? Devin Stockfish : Yes. As we think about -- this is primarily a southern statement because we have a much higher percentage of our logs that go into the pulp market in the South. As we think about our harvesting activity generally, we're looking at that on a regular basis because the point of how we manage our harvest is, obviously, we want to keep the growth in the harvest in balance over time. But on a year-to-year basis, we're looking at what's going on in the markets, and we're really trying to maximize the value of our timberlands over time.  And so as we think about 2021, as Russell mentioned, we are a little heavier to fiber in the South, and that's really catching up on some thinning backlog, which is really important from a silvicultural perspective, and we need to do that. But obviously, that does put a little bit more pulpwood into the market, and you don't get as many tons from thinning as you do from clear cutting. But the high-level answer is, we continue to look at that really on a year-to-year basis, looking at what's going on in the markets, what the different opportunities are for that wood. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Kurt Yinger : Two quick ones. First in Wood Products, you talked about the drag from higher log costs in the quarter. Is there any way to maybe quantify what that looked like versus either Q3 or fourth quarter '19? Devin Stockfish : Yes. And that -- when we talk about the higher log costs, that's, obviously, primarily, in the West and in Canada. And the impact, for example, for lumber from the higher log cost in Q4 relative to Q3, within that $25 million to $30 million range. And so that's -- obviously, that benefits us as well. So we sell a lot of logs in the west. And so we get it in one pocket, but certainly, that was a little bit of a drag from a cost standpoint for the lumber business. Kurt Yinger : Right. Okay. Makes sense. And then just lastly on engineered wood. Could you talk about how long you would expect to kind of fully get the August price increase in due realizations? And then I believe Russell noted an additional increase during January. I just wanted to make sure I heard that right and whether that was kind of a similar amount as the one in August as well? Devin Stockfish : Yes. The January increase was 8% to 15%, and that varies by product and geography. And so we're in the process of rolling that through as a general matter with price protections that are building to contracts, et cetera, you usually get most of that within a year, the vast majority of it within 3 quarters and then just a little trailing, last a little bit within a year. But you'll get most of it within 6 months. Operator : Our last question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : I guess, just an easy question. Devin, you're trading at quite a discount to your peers, Polo, Rainier, Mark, just wondering how you're going to make up that difference? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So I think, obviously, a couple of things go into that. Number one, 2020 was an interesting year for us. We did take some action with respect to the dividend, putting a new dividend framework in place. And so I think there's -- some of that is people getting their minds around that. As you can imagine, we've had a lot of conversations with our investors since we rolled out that new dividend framework. Overall, I'd say the response has been pretty positive and supportive. I think people get the rationale and how it fits in with the business and the cash flows. But we still have to prove that out. And so I think that's a part of it. And we'll continue to look forward to delivering on the commitments that we made as part of rolling that new framework out.  So I think that's a piece of it. And certainly, we are in a position where we feel like the markets are pretty strong. They're going to be a tailwind for us. Our businesses are running really, really well. And so we're very well positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and generate a lot of cash, and we'll be giving most of that back to shareholders. And so, I think, as we deliver on that commitment, you should see that gap continue to close. Paul Quinn : Okay. And just as a follow-up, any changes that you're anticipating on the portfolio side? And I just note that West Fraser-Norbord transaction over did put themselves up for sale in 2018, whether you looked at that asset? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So for us, I would say, we're always looking on the Timberland side to continue to optimize and grow that timber portfolio. That's something we do year in and year out, and something we will continue to do going forward. And I'm really excited about some of the work Russell is going to be doing in that space. And so that's probably the most likely portfolio moves that we're going to make would be on the Timberland side. On the Wood Products side, I think we like the assets that we have. And so I wouldn't anticipate big portfolio changes necessarily on the Wood Products' side. If we found a mill here or there, sort of a small bolt-on acquisition in the Wood Products space, we would look at that if the price is right and it's in the right locale. But in terms of large acquisitions on the Wood Products' side, I'd say that's not currently our focus.  Well, I think that was the final question. So again, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Stay safe, everyone. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference.

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations and Enterprise Planning. Thank you, Ms. Baum. You may begin. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2021 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Beth. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter net earnings of $681 million or $0.91 per diluted share on net sales of $2.5 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $1.1 billion, a 68% increase over the fourth quarter of 2020 and a 167% increase compared to the year ago quarter. This represents the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record, surpassing the third quarter of 2020 by 48%. I'm extremely proud of the operational and financial results delivered by our team, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions and supply chain challenges throughout the quarter. The hard work we've been doing over the last several years has positioned us well to capitalize on these current favorable market conditions and we remain focused on delivering superior value for our shareholders. Additionally, I'm very pleased to introduce and welcome to the call, Nancy Loewe, who joined Weyerhaeuser in March as our new CFO. Nancy brings more than 20 years of leadership and financial and operating roles across a broad range of industries. She's hit the ground running and we're excited for the energy and expertise she is bringing to Weyerhaeuser and our leadership team. With Nancy now onboard, Russell Hagen has fully transitioned into his new role as Chief Development Officer. I'm confident this organizational change will deliver meaningful portfolio management benefits as we align our real estate, energy and natural resources, acquisitions and divestitures, and business development activities under one umbrella. I'm equally excited for the work this team is doing to support the company's increasing focus on emerging carbon and other natural climate solutions opportunities. In a moment, I'll dive into our first quarter business results, but first let me make some brief comments on the housing market. First quarter housing starts averaged 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 2% over the fourth quarter. Activity dipped briefly in February, driven by severe winter weather, but March activity rebounded sharply. March housing starts totaled 1.7 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest level since 2006. Single family starts in March reached the highest rate for any month since June of 2007 at nearly 104,000 units. Additionally, housing permits in the first quarter averaged nearly 1.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, surpassing last quarter by 10% and surging to its highest quarterly average since before the Great Recession. Continued improvement in this key leading indicator points to increasing demand for new home construction in 2021. With these encouraging tailwinds, our housing market outlook is very favorable and further supported by macroeconomic fundamentals that will continue to drive strong U.S. housing activity, including record low supply of new and existing homes for sale, strong homebuilder sentiment, favorable demographic trends, flexible work arrangements driving increased mobility and migration to the suburbs, higher savings rates and continued post-COVID improvements in GDP and unemployment. Repair and remodel activity also remained robust in the first quarter, supported by rising home equity, additional federal stimulus and limited resale inventory. Feedback from our customers indicates a shifting trend from small do-it-yourself projects to larger professional remodels. We expect repair and remodel demand to remain strong throughout 2021 as project backlogs continue to expand. We are keeping an eye on certain cautionary factors, including the impacts of increasing home prices and mortgage rates on affordability and challenges for homebuilders resulting from rising material costs, supply chain disruptions and labor availability. However, we do believe the supportive fundamentals considerably outweigh these headwinds. With the additional prospect of a federal infrastructure bill and growing demand for mass timber, we anticipate very favorable demand for wood products for the foreseeable future. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with timberlands on pages six through eight of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $108 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $5 million compared to the fourth quarter. Turning to Western timberlands starting with domestic market conditions, demand remained strong throughout the quarter as mills maintained healthy log inventories to capitalize on record lumber prices. Log supply in the first quarter continued to improve as salvage harvest activity in Oregon increased substantially. Similar to the fourth quarter, salvage operations resulted in an abundance of smaller diameter logs in the market. This, in turn, is driving stronger demand and pricing for larger diameter logs. Our fee harvest volume was comparable to the fourth quarter and our proportion of salvage volume increased significantly. Average domestic log sales realizations were slightly lower than the fourth quarter as salvage operations resulted in a greater mix of smaller diameter logs. We continue to make great progress on our 2021 salvage plan. And as of the end of the first quarter, we\u2019ve harvested approximately 40% of our planned salvage volume. We did not experience any downgrades in realizations on our salvage logs during the quarter. Log and haul costs increased slightly during the first quarter due to increased salvage activity and forestry costs were seasonally lower in the quarter. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the first quarter. Reduced lumber imports into Japan resulting from strong U.S. domestic lumber markets and a global shortage of shipping containers allowed our customers to increase market share and drove stronger demand for our logs. Our Japanese log sales volumes increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter, with a slight increase in realizations. Similar to Japan, the market for U.S. logs in China remained strong in the first quarter as supply headwinds persisted, including lower overall lumber import volumes, a lack of container availability and restrictions on Australian log imports. Log inventories at Chinese ports increased in February as manufacturing activity paused over the Lunar New Year period, but were drawn down rapidly in March as strong takeaway resumed. Average realizations for our China export logs increased modestly compared with the fourth quarter, but this was offset by higher ocean freight rates. Our sales volumes to China decreased significantly as we intentionally flexed volume to the domestic market to capitalize on the strong pricing for our large diameter logs. Moving to the South. Southern timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased $5 million compared with the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog market strengthened in the first quarter as record lumber and panel pricing drove strong demand and supply was limited by severe winter weather and seasonally wet conditions. Fiber markets also improved as demand increased following the fourth quarter maintenance outages by many of our pulp log customers. Our fee harvest volume was slightly lower than the fourth quarter as we lost several operating days due to the snow and ice in February. Average sales realizations were slightly higher than the fourth quarter due to improved sawlog and fiber log realizations as well as favorable mix. Road and forestry costs decreased seasonally. On the export side, we continue to see growing demand from both China and India. Southern export log pricing increased substantially in the first quarter, but volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter as container availability and increased freight rates were notable headwinds. Northern timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased $1 million compared to the fourth quarter due to improved sales realizations for hardwood logs. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, pages nine and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $66 million to first quarter earnings and $96 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $73 million higher than fourth quarter due to timing of transactions. Similar to 2020, our 2021 real estate sales activity is heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre was down significantly compared to the unusually high fourth quarter, but still substantially higher than one year ago. As was the case in fourth quarter, first quarter included a number of high value retail transactions in the US South. Wood products, pages 11 and 12. Wood products contributed $840 million to first quarter earnings and $889 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was 68% higher than the fourth quarter and surpassed by 45% the previous quarterly record, which was established in the third quarter of 2020. Our lumber, OSB and distribution businesses delivered the highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record during the first quarter. Demand remained extremely strong across our product lines, with continued strength in the new residential construction and repair and remodel end markets. The framing lumber composite entered the first quarter near the record levels achieved in the third quarter of 2020. After a slight pullback in January, prices reentered record territory and continued to increase as the quarter progressed, notwithstanding a low-end consumption in the South following the severe winter weather event in February. Inventory in the distribution channels remained lean throughout the quarter as buyers delicately balanced their need to replenish inventory with buying at record high price levels. Average lumber composite pricing increased 41% compared with the fourth quarter. EBITDA for lumber increased $259 million compared with the fourth quarter, a more than 100% improvement. Average sales realizations increased by 42%. Cost for Canadian logs increased significantly and Southern log costs increased slightly during the quarter. Our lumber production decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter as a handful of mills lost production days due to severe winter storms in the US South. Sales volumes decreased by 5% compared with the fourth quarter, as customer takeaway and supply chains in the South were temporarily disrupted following the severe winter weather. OSB markets performed at an unprecedented pace in the first quarter. Limited resin availability added incremental constraints to an already lean supply of OSB in the market. This dynamic coupled with continued strong demand resulted in a record setting price run that persisted for the entire quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 30% compared with the fourth quarter. OSB EBITDA increased $80 million compared to the fourth quarter, a 36% increase. Average sales realizations improved by 22%. Production volumes increased slightly compared with the fourth quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved as a reduction in planned maintenance more than offset weather-related downtime at one of our Southern mills. Although resin availability was a challenge across the OSB market, our supply chain and transportation teams did a fantastic job of effectively navigating the disruption, resulting in no material impact to our OSB production volumes or mix in the first quarter. We continue to benefit from proactive initiatives to diversify our resin supply. Engineered wood products EBITDA increased $5 million compared to the fourth quarter. Average sales realizations for solid section and I-joists products improved as we continued to benefit from our August 2020 price increase and quickly began capturing the benefit of a second increase announced in January. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board web stock, resin and veneer. Production volumes also decreased slightly across several product lines as a result of weather-related downtime. In distribution, EBITDA increased $15 million compared to the fourth quarter, a strong demand drove sales volumes across all products and the business captured improved margins. Turning briefly to operational excellence. After exceeding our 2020 operational excellence target, we remain focused on OpEx in 2021, targeting another $50 million to $75 million across our businesses. With one quarter of 2021 behind us, we're on track to achieve our full year 2021 target and look forward to sharing some accomplishments as the year progresses. Finally, I'd like to comment briefly on two recent timberland transactions. As we've noticed -- noted previously, we're continuously evaluating opportunities to optimize and grow the value of our timberland holdings. Today, we reported the closing of our previously announced acquisition of 69,000 acres of Alabama timberlands. These are high quality acres that are accretive to our portfolio and exhibit strong operating on [ph] our existing footprint. We also announced this morning an agreement to sell 145,000 acres in the North Cascades region of Washington to Hampton Resources for $266 million. Hampton is a strategic buyer with a complementary manufacturing footprint in the area. This transaction is part of a multi-year effort to strategically optimize our Western Timberlands portfolio and completes our targeted large-scale divestitures in the region. The North Cascades is our least productive acreage in the West. It's primarily high elevation white wood with high operating costs and does not serve any of our internal mills or export customers. This property does not materially contribute to EBITDA and was not expected to generate a competitive return within our portfolio, even considering future alternative sources of value. We're really pleased with this transaction and plan to redeploy the proceeds in line with our priorities for opportunistic capital allocation, including continue to enhance and grow our timberlands portfolio in a disciplined manner. So, with that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. Nancy Loewe : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'm looking forward to meeting many of you in the coming months. It's a privilege to be joining Weyerhaeuser at such an exciting time and I want to thank everyone for the warm welcome I've received. Over the past two months, I've spent a great deal of time with the senior leadership team as well as the finance team here at the company immersing myself in the business and getting to know our employees and operations. I've come away from that with tremendous excitement about the future and our ability to create significant long-term value for shareholders. I'm looking forward to the work ahead. So, this morning I'll cover a few aspects of our first quarter financial performance as well as our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with the first quarter results for our unallocated items as summarized on page 13. First quarter adjusted EBITDA for this segment improved by $7 million compared to fourth quarter 2020. This improvement was mainly due to lower corporate function and variable compensation expenses, partially offset by higher charges for the elimination of inter-segment profit in inventory and LIFO. This charge was primarily driven by higher lumber inventory in the South, where customer takeaway was disrupted after the severe winter weather. Turning now to our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 14. Cash from operations totaled nearly $700 million for the first quarter. This is our highest quarterly operating cash flow since fourth quarter 2006 and our highest first quarter cash flow on record. We generally expect cash from operations to decrease significantly in the first quarter, primarily due to seasonal working capital increases. However, operating cash flow improved by over $250 million compared with the fourth quarter as these factors were more than outweighed by higher pricing for lumber and oriented strand board. We reinvested a portion of this cash in our timberlands and wood products businesses through capital expenditures, which totaled $53 million for the first quarter. Adjusted funds available for distribution or FAD for first quarter 2021 totaled $645 million as highlighted on page 15. In the first quarter, we returned $127 million to our shareholders through payment of our first quarter base dividend of $0.17 per share. As a reminder, we plan to target a total annual return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. We will deploy the remaining 20% to 25% of our annual FAD consistent with our stated priorities for opportunistic capital allocation. Turning to the balance sheet, we ended our first quarter with over $1 billion of cash and undrawn line of credit, and just under $5.5 billion of outstanding long-term debt. As a reminder, we have cash earmarked to repay our $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. Our strong balance sheet position in addition to our record EBITDA performance has resulted in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA leverage ratio of 1.5 times. Although our leverage ratio is significantly below our over-the-cycle target of 3.5 times net debt to EBITDA, we believe that's appropriate given the extremely strong commodity markets we're experiencing today. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on page 16. In our timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the first quarter. In our Western timberlands operations, we expect our second quarter domestic log sales volumes will be significantly higher than the first quarter. Domestic mill inventories ended the first quarter at moderate levels and log demand in the West remains favorable due to strong lumber market. Domestic average sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared with the first quarter. Additionally, while we expect average sales realizations for large logs to improve, we believe this will be offset by an unfavorable mix of small logs as we continue to work through salvage wood. We anticipate second quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher, in that forestry and road spending will increase as we enter the spring and summer months. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, log demand remains strong. Japanese Douglas Fir lumber producers continue to experience very favorable demand as lumber imports into Japan remain limited due to the high price of US lumber and low availability of shipping containers. Our second quarter average sales realizations on log imports to Japan are expected to increase modestly compared to the first quarter. Our average sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. For China, average export log sales realizations are expected to increase significantly. Demand for imported logs is strong due to significant economic growth, limited lumber imports and continued disruptions in the supply of imported logs. However, our average log sales volumes are expected to be lower compared with the first quarter. With strong US domestic demand for large logs and high ocean freight costs, we'll flex more logs to the domestic market to capture the highest margin. In the South, we anticipate fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than first quarter due to seasonally higher thinner activity -- thinning activity as well as the deferred harvest activities related to the adverse weather we experienced during the first quarter. We expect average log sales realizations will be comparable to first quarter. Forestry spending in the South is expected to increase, which is typical coming into the spring months. In the North, average log sales realizations are expected to increase slightly compared to first quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. I'll wrap up the timberlands segment with a few comments on our recent timberland transaction. In the second quarter, we will report a cash outflow of approximately $149 million for the 69,000 acre Alabama timberlands acquisition that we completed this week. And as Devin mentioned, we have also announced the sale of our North Cascades acreage and we expect to complete that transaction in the third quarter. A gain on sale will be reported as a special item within the timberlands segment. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resource segment. Real estate markets remained strong into the second quarter as societal preferences during this time continued to drive robust demand for rural recreational properties. We expect second quarter net earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be moderately lower than first quarter due to timing of transactions. We continue to expect full year 2021 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $255 million, although we now expect land basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year due to the mix of properties sold. We continue to anticipate our 2021 real estate activity will be heavily weighted to the first half of the year similar to our cadence in both 2019 and 2020. For our wood products segment, new residential construction activity has remained at very favorable levels. And our builder and dealer customers are anticipating a strong second quarter, following the already strong first quarter. In repair and remodel markets, we are seeing a shift from small do-it-yourself improvement projects to larger remodel activity further solidifying the demand for structural wood products within this market. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect second quarter adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the first quarter. For lumber, we expect production volumes to increase during the quarter as operating rates are expected to improve following weather-related mill downtime in the first quarter. We expect these higher production volumes to have a favorable impact on our manufacturing costs. We also anticipate this increased supply as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown to drive higher sales volumes during the quarter. Oriented strand board is expected to have a slightly lower production level in sales volumes and slightly higher manufacturing costs due to an extended outage to complete a planned capital project at our Elkin OSB mill. This equipment has been on-site, but installation has been delayed multiple times due to COVID-related travel restrictions and vendor resource availability. Log costs are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Entering the second quarter, benchmark pricing for oriented strand board and the framing lumber composites have continued to rise beyond the record levels experienced in the first quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $105 higher and current realizations are approximately $130 higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our quarter-to-date average sales realizations are approximately $135 higher and our current sales realizations are approximately $185 higher than the first quarter average. As a reminder for lumber, every $10 change in realization is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For OSB, every $10 change in realization is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. For engineered wood products, we expect higher average sales realizations for our solid section and I-joists products as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in August 2020 and January 2021. Additionally, in March 2021, we announced a third increase, which ranges from 10% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. This will be partially offset by higher raw material costs. I'll wrap up with a few additional comments on our total company financial items. We continue to expect full year 2021 interest expense will be approximately $315 million. Additionally, we continue to anticipate 2021 capital expenditures to total $420 million, with most large projects executing in the second half of the year. Turning to taxes, we continue to expect our full year 2021 effective tax rate will be between 18% and 22% before special items based on our forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. As previously discussed, a $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution remains in process. We anticipate receiving this refund in second quarter 2021. Excluding this refund, we continue to expect our 2021 cash taxes will be generally comparable to our overall tax expense. Now, I'll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Nancy. In closing, our first quarter financial performance was the strongest on record, and I'm incredibly proud of the work our teams are doing to achieve these results. Whether it's navigating winter conditions and supply chain disruptions, keeping our people safe through a pandemic or the relentless focus to capture OpEx opportunities across our portfolio, our employees have done an outstanding job positioning the company to capitalize on the strong markets we're experiencing today. Looking forward, the demand for our products is extremely favorable, supported by encouraging macroeconomic conditions and continued resiliency in the US housing and repair and remodel markets. We remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading performance across our operations. When combined with a strong balance sheet and a dividend framework that returns meaningful cash to shareholders, we're well positioned to drive superior long-term value into the future. And now, I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : Devin, given lumber prices where they are, are you undertaking any debottlenecking or brownfield expansions beyond the Holden expansion that you talked about last quarter? Could you even look at a greenfield mill in the South here? I'm just wondering, if you could talk about how you kind of balance making sure you get your share of growth versus not getting ahead of yourself in maybe an unusual market? Devin Stockfish : Yes, absolutely. Happy to comment on that. If you think back to our capital program over the last several years, we have been investing significant amounts of capital across our wood products business. In fact, we're doing $300 million of incremental capital this year, part of which, as you know it, it goes to the Holden mill, which will increase by about 100 million board feet capacity at that location. We continue to get incremental capacity through the capital program that we've had in place for a number of years. Just for reference, if you think back over the last couple of years, our Millport and our Dierks mill brownfield expansions, have added about 300 million board feet of incremental capacity. And we continue to put capital to work across our wood products manufacturing businesses, and it's always a balance, Anthony. We're always looking to continue to drive down costs and improve efficiencies at our mills. One of the course to our operating strategy on the manufacturing side is to have the best cost structure in the industry, so that we can continue to drive good margins, regardless of where we are on pricing. We're going to continue to look for opportunities across our Wood Products manufacturing footprint, whether we're going to go out and do a greenfield mill. I think as we said in the past, our inclination is to really focus in the near-term on our existing mill set. And the reason behind that is just we think we can get better risk adjusted returns by putting that capital to work in our existing mill footprint. Now, over time, as we continue to work through our capital programs down the road, is there an opportunity for a greenfield? Sure, we're always going to be open to that. But I think in the near-term, it's going to be more focused on our existing footprint. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then, understanding that the special dividend is the main use of cash for you, given you're levered at 1.5 turns. Would you potentially look at share repurchases if your stock price isn't reflecting the strong earnings growth that you're seeing and maybe you can see it for some time here? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. Just a quick comment and then I'll answer that specifically. And certainly, we're experiencing incredibly strong pricing right now. And if that continues to play out over the course of the year, we're going to generate very strong cash flow. And as you noted with our new dividend framework, around 75% to 80% of that is going to go back to shareholders through the base dividend and supplemental dividends. So, any cash flow over and above that really goes to our opportunistic options, which are growth, further debt pay down and share repurchase. As we think about share repurchase, specific to your question, Anthony, I think that can be a really good opportunity to return cash to shareholders under the right circumstances. And we continue to view that opportunistically. And so to the extent, we feel like our shares are trading at a material discount, that's a great way to return cash to shareholders. But absent that, I think the preference really is to distribute that via the supplemental dividend. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi, everyone. Good morning. Thanks for taking the question. Devin, I think you can take the rest of year off, what do you say, amazing how things -- I doubt you'll do that. Amazing how things change in a year. I just want to\u2026 Devin Stockfish : Well, there is still money to be made, George, so we\u2019ll keep working. George Staphos : Understood. So a way, I guess. So, I just want to make sure I understood. Holden, you said that's 260 million board feet. I just wanted to make sure that I had that, I had a slightly different number in my forecast just for clarification. And then my first real question is, tell us why your customers aren't really worried about housing affordability or aren't -- don't see that as a big enough speed bump based on everything else that you're seeing right now because the price of construction of home is going on, it's going up beyond 10%, 15% given our numbers for aggregate cost of construction? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, with respect to Holden, so it's a 100 million board feet of incremental capacity and that takes you up to about 260 million board feet when that project is complete. George Staphos : That's what I got. Okay. Devin Stockfish : So, with respect to your question around affordability, I think the short answer, George, is just there is so much demand for housing right now that the builders are able to -- even though they are experiencing some increased costs, they're able to pass that on to the buyer. And ultimately, you can't continue to see housing prices continue to go up at this level year after year. There is obviously some limit where that starts to take some increment of the buying community out of the market. But with low mortgage rates sitting around low 3%, that gives a little bit more flexibility. But, again, the reality right now is there is a real shortage of housing in the market and the demand is just overwhelming. When we talk to our homebuilder customers, they just -- they have more buyers than they can satisfy at present. And so, in that environment, it does give the builders more pricing power and we're certainly seeing -- you see that in the numbers with the permits and the starts and builder sentiment, just a lot of demand for housing. And if you think about it just at a broader level, and we've been saying this for years, the country has been under building for a decade. And you probably saw the Freddie Mac number out, where they were estimating 4 million units under bill. The amount of time it takes to build through that overhang, it's just -- it's a lot of demand and that's ultimately I think what keeps the buyer still there even though pricing continues to go up. George Staphos : Understood. And I appreciate the thoughts there. I was hoping you could give us a bit more granularity to some degree piggybacking off of Anthony's questions in wood. One, if you -- we didn't -- if we hold Holden outside of the equation for a minute, what kind of productivity capacity increases might you get around the rest of your network in lumber and OSB this year? And recognizing you said significantly and there are lots of ways to define that, I guess, or throw that into a model, if we take pricing aside and just assumed average pricing in the first quarter to second quarter, what kind of increase would we be looking at for wood products 2Q versus 1Q? If you can give us any kind of guardrails around that? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. Well, I'll answer the second question first and then we'll swing back to the capacity question. So, good way to think about it quarter-over-quarter if you take out lumber and OSB pricing is about $75 million to $100 million of incremental EBITDA, and that's really primarily a result of increased lumber volume and the EWP pricing increase rolling through. And so, where you sit between that $75 million and $100 million really depends on how much OSB prices continue to go up because web stock obviously is -- it's an input cost that we have to bear in EWP. Although I will note, we supply almost all, if not all, of our web stock comes from our OSB mills. And so, we do get that in a different pocket. So, that's the range about $75 million to $100 million. In terms of incremental capacity, every year through our capital program, you get several percentage -- several percent increase just on the debottlenecking work that we do, you get incremental volume. So, that kind of comes year after year just through our normal cost programs in CapEx. We've also added as I mentioned about 300 million board feet over the last couple of years. And so, that's now rolling through the system. We've got another 100 million coming in Holden. And so, we don't necessarily talk about it this way all the time, but we are seeing organic growth in our wood products manufacturing operations just through those capital programs, even though they are primarily focused on cost reduction. George Staphos : Okay, thanks for the thoughts, Devin. I'll turn it over and I'll come back in queue if there's time. Thanks. Devin Stockfish : Great, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wilde : Devin, it really is amazing what a different situation we're in from a year ago. Devin Stockfish : It's been something else, Mark. That is to say the least, it's been quite a ride over the last 12 to 18 months. Mark Wilde : Yes. I wondered, if you could -- just to start out, you could give us some sense of where your order books are for lumber and OSB and engineered wood? How far into the second quarter you've sold at this point? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, I'll go by product. Starting with EWP, I mean, we're essentially off the market into the third quarter at this point, so those order files are really extended. On OSB, we're five to six weeks out, so really at the outer edge of what we're comfortable with in terms of order files. And even on lumber, we're at two to three weeks at this point, which for lumber is on the high end of where we typically have order files. So, when you think about what's going on in the market, lean inventories everywhere, order files extended and that's playing in partly to what you're seeing on the price side. Mark Wilde : Yes. I wondered, just thinking about what is going on in the price side, how much of an issue is rail and trucking transport? I mean, I've heard about some lumber producers in the Northwest significantly short of railcars, we've heard about some issues coming out of Western Canada. Just trying to figure out kind of how much kind of transit delays and transit bottlenecks might be contributing to kind of the current market situation? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. I think it's definitely playing a role. When you think about transportation across the system, it's challenging, there is no question about it. And the place I would highlight for you that is the most acute is trucking in the South. And really across all industries, just with what we're seeing in the economy, the spending across all kinds of different industries, trucking availability is really short. And so, that's definitely a challenge really in a lot of different places. The South, as I mentioned, is the most acute issue, but that's really bleeding over into the rail side as well. So, securing trucking capacity and rail capacity, it's been a challenge for the industry, something that, believe me, we're focused on this 24/7 to make sure that we're getting product to customers and keeping them satisfied. So, that's a challenge. And I think part of it, when you think about having lean inventories, you add the transportation challenge for customers really across the channel trying to get product to serve their existing projects and their customers, it just adds one more challenge. And so, I think when people can get product on a short-term basis, they're willing to pay really high prices just to secure the product. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then finally, Devin, I wondered, I think everybody saw the release this morning about the Northern Cascades timberlands, so we kind of -- we understand what the issues were there in terms of valuation. But I wondered, if you could provide just a little color about the deal down in Alabama? Because from the outside, it looks like it was probably $300 or $400 an acre kind of above surrounding comps. So, I wondered, if you could just help us put a little color around that 21.50 kind of bid price that you made? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. Happy to. So, really, Mark, when we think about doing acquisitions or divestitures, for that matter, for us, it's very specific to that individual land base. And so, certainly, we look at comps to get a sense of what the market looks like. But when we are doing our future cash flow projections, it really goes down to things that are specific to that land, the stocking level, the species mix, what we think the road infrastructure looks like, what we think the costs of logging and hauling in that region are going to be. So, we do a very, very detailed analysis, we have some tools that we have that I think are proprietary that help with that to really dial-in on what we think that the cash flow will look like over a period of time. And we layer on top of that what do the local market conditions look like and we have a pretty good sense because we're in all of these markets on what we expect market dynamics to look like. And then we layer on top of that what are the synergies that we can bring to that specific land, things like leveraging our scale to drive lower log and haul costs, finding opportunities for export or alternative values like solar, wind, HBU. So, our model bakes all of those things in. And when we look at that particular land down in Alabama, a few things really jump out. It's in a very good market. I would say that Pine Hill, Alabama market is one of the stronger markets in the area, it's growing both on the saw timber side, but importantly it's a strong fiber market which can really help the economics of owning timberland. We've got an expanding mill capacity. We've got a diverse set of customers there that we think we can really leverage to drive additional value on that. And it really fits well with our existing timberlands portfolio. We have people on the ground there, so we don't have to add a lot of personnel to manage this incremental land. So, when we look at all of these things, good species mix, good site index, good synergies, logistics benefits, it's a really good property for us, it's really one of the better properties that we've looked at in quite a while in the South. And so, we're really excited to add that to the portfolio. Mark Wilde : Okay, very good. Good luck in the second quarter through the balance of the year, Devin. Devin Stockfish : Great. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Mark Connelly : Hi, Devin. Just two things. You talked about the timber sales cleaning up the situation in the Pacific Northwest. Should I assume that your backlog of timber that you want to monetize is below normal at this point? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, I would say in the Pacific Northwest, specifically, we've really gotten through all of the big transactions that we had as part of the review, the Southern timber -- or the Southern Oregon timberlands deal that we did last year and then this North Washington deal. Those were really the two big pieces of property in the West that we wanted to clean out of the portfolio. And again, it's really as you think about our Western portfolio as a whole, you take out the North Cascades and the South Oregon, I mean, the rest of the property is really cream of the crop timberland. And so, I think at this point from a Western perspective, we're pretty much there in terms of getting the portfolio where we want it to be and obviously we'll continue to look for opportunities to add good timberlands to that. But in terms of the big divestitures in the West, I think we're pretty much there. Mark Connelly : Okay. And -- but what about in the South, I mean, where would you say you are in that optimization process? Devin Stockfish : Yes. When we think about the South, I wouldn't say we've identified really large transactions like you saw in South Oregon and North Washington, but I would absolutely anticipate that we're going to continue to trim small pieces here, add pieces there. So, the optimization work will continue to be ongoing in the South, but at least sitting here today, I don't know that I would expect any sort of large transactions in the near-term. Mark Connelly : Okay, that makes sense. And just a question on Russell's role. Do you expect his work to change the way you've managed real estate and natural resources? We tend to think of that as generating steady cash flow, but are you looking to try to substantially grow that business over time? Devin Stockfish : Yes, the short answer is yes, definitely. When we think about what we're asking Russell to do, I mean, there is a piece of it that obviously continues to be the HBU land sales that we've been doing for a while. The energy and natural resources, construction materials, that will continue to be a part of it, but what we're really excited about is looking across the portfolio and better leveraging some of these additional opportunities. Great example is around natural climate solutions. So, whether you think about carbon opportunities, whether you think about mitigation banks, just a whole host of opportunities that we have owning so much land, there is just inherent optionality when you have a large land base like we do. And one of the things that we're really excited about with Russell stepping into this role is to further take advantage of some of that optionality. So, we're really excited. He's only been in the role for a couple of months, but I think you're going to see some real traction on this front over time. Mark Connelly : That's super. Thank you, Devin. Devin Stockfish : Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Devin, first, the infrastructure bill. You made comment to that, how that could be a positive catalyst, and I realize nothing is finalized. But kind of big picture, is that potentially a meaningful dial mover for wood products demand and kind of what's your assessment there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, I think it could be a nice little tailwind for us, Mark. You think about a couple of things that we've seen in the infrastructure bill. Obviously, there is a housing component that is embedded in the infrastructure bill. And so, incremental housing demand obviously is supportive for the industry in driving incremental demand. But even when you look more broadly, roads, highways, bridges, other infrastructure, certainly a lot of that is going to be concrete and steel. But you do have incremental demand anytime you have infrastructure spending with concrete forms and just other incremental lumber or plywood or OSB that you see when those projects are put out. And so, just kind of a rough order of magnitude guess from our standpoint is, if this does get passed and not even considering necessarily the housing piece, you could see another 1 billion, 1.5 billion board feet of incremental demand on the lumber side coming out of an infrastructure program. And so, we'll dial that estimate in as we get closer and get more clarity on what an infrastructure bill looks like. But I do think that if you see a bill of this magnitude come to fruition, it's going to have incremental demand implications for our industry. Mark Weintraub : Great, that's really helpful. Second, we hear quarter after quarter of late, lumber prices, fantastic, going up and then we hear log prices in the South comparable to last quarter. What's it going to take to potentially change that? And kind of likewise, are timberland values themselves presumably tied to log prices? And in that context, as you're looking at the M&A pipeline in timberlands, are you seeing any changes or is it still looking fairly similar to what it has been in prior months and quarters? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think at a high level, the reality is many of the markets across South are still over-supplied from a log standpoint. And so, when we think about what's going to change that, it's couple of things. One, it is continued capacity coming into the South and we've seen a lot of that. We continue to see announcements coming in for new mills being built in the South. Lumber, we see pellet mills coming into the South. So, the trajectory is right, I think also to the extent that you have land that's approximate to ports, I feel really optimistic about the export opportunity. We're seeing great demand into China, India is a growing market. We're sending chips into Turkey. So, I think there are opportunities to continue to expand the pulp into offshore markets. And so, that can have a tensioning effect. But really the third piece Mark is just time. We need some time for these new mills to come onboard and to chew through some of the inventory. And so, that's something that will continue to happen. It's going to be differential by market. Again, when you think about places like Pine Hill, Alabama or your spots in Louisiana and Arkansas and South Carolina, North Carolina, where you've seen some capacity come in, you see things starting to tighten up a bit in the local area, but really, it's something that's going to take some time to work through and it will be differential. One note I would make on that front; while Southern -- average Southern sawlog prices across the South is moderately interesting to us, what's really interesting is what's happening in the wood baskets where we have fee timberland. And so, I can tell you, and this goes back to something that Russell and his team are working, we want to make sure that when new mill capacity comes into the South that it's being cited in the geography that fits well with our fee timberland. So, we're having lots of conversations with people about how we can help them if they decide to put a mill in a geography that's a place where we have fee timberland. So, we're working all of those things. As you think about how does that translate into M&A, it's differential. Most of the players in the market are pretty astute in terms of understanding local supply-demand dynamics. So, people will bake in what they think is going to happen in that wood basket over time as they put valuations into their model. Mark Weintraub : Thank you, Devin. Thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Yes. Good morning, everyone, and thanks for taking my questions. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Kurt Yinger : Good morning. I just wanted to start off on the EWP front. Obviously, some more room to run as far as pricing in Q2. Just given kind of the timing lag and what you've already announced, is there any way you could kind of frame how much incremental price you kind of expect over 2021? And then with the most recent announcement, is that primarily something that's going to be relegated to 2022 or could you start to see some benefits from that this year as well? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, just high level as you think about the timing to rollout a price increase, and as we mentioned we had one last summer, we had another one in January and then you had another one in March. And typically that takes a couple of quarters to really start rolling through in a meaningful way. The March increase, we'll start getting a little bit of that in Q2, but we'll get more of that, the majority of that as you get into Q3. So, when you think about 2021 as a whole, certainly the vast majority of the August 2020 price increase will be included in 2021. I would say most of the January will be included in 2021 and the March price increase we'll start getting more of as we get into the back half of the year. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay, that's helpful. And then my second one. You indicated that at the end of the first quarter, you're about 40% through your salvage plans in Oregon. Could you update us on the timing of when that will be kind of fully complete based on your plans and perhaps talk about what type of mix impact that might have had on Western realizations in the quarter? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. So, we're doing a good job getting through that salvage operation. I mean, that is a monumental effort. When you think about 125,000 acres that were impacted by the fire, that's a bigger impact than we saw Mount Saint Helens just to put it in the context. And so, the team has done a great job of organizing contractor and trucking availability in the region, so we can get after that quickly. Our expectation is that we are going to get through the vast majority of the salvage work in 2021. So, I would expect to have that mostly complete this year. We're obviously trying to get at it as fast as we can, so that we can make sure we're capturing the maximum value of those salvage logs before you start to see any sort of degradation in the wood. So, we're going to be trying to do as much as we can in Q2 and Q3. And that really has a few impacts, one of which, to your question is, it does have an impact on mix because we're harvesting a lot of acres that are younger than ordinarily would be the case. And so, that adds smaller diameter logs into the market. And what we're seeing primarily in Oregon is the mix of log volume into the market is a lot more smaller log, that's the truth -- that's the case for us, but it's also I think broadly speaking the case in the market. So, that brings realizations down a little bit and that'll be a little bit of a headwind in Q2 and Q3. The flip side of that is that puts a bit of a premium on larger logs into the system. And so, you're seeing a little bit of an uplift there. So, I think it's going to be a little bit of a headwind, Q2, Q3, which is why we said domestic pricing in the West is going to be down a little bit in Q2. That's really just a function of those smaller salvage logs going into the market. The one other point I would just make there is, as you think about 2021 for us in the West, salvage logging is obviously a little bit more expensive. And so, there's a little bit of a cost headwind in the West for the next couple of quarters as well. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay, great. Well, appreciate the color and good luck here in Q2. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Our final question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks. Good morning, Devin, and welcome to Weyerhaeuser Nancy. Nancy Loewe Thank you. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Paul. Paul Quinn : Yes. I'm mystified, so you just put up great Q1 results, Q2 is looking significantly better. Operations, as far as I've covered the company in the last 15 years, have never run as well as they are right now. Stock is down 6%, well below now, so shareholders can't be happy. And I'm just wondering, if you consider changes to the portfolio now or is it just too early? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, just with respect to today's stock prices, our focus is much more on what happens over the long-term. And when we think about how we're running the business, the assets that we have, the cash that we're generating, the supplemental dividend that's building, I think that will resolve itself over time. So, we're really more focused on the long-term. And I'd say with respect to the portfolio, by and large, we like the businesses that we're in. We've done a lot of work to improve our operating performance. You can see that in our relative margins really across our businesses. We're generating a lot of cash. We think we still have opportunities to improve. You can see that in the OpEx target we have for 2021. So, we think we're doing a lot to improve the business. And I think certainly over time, that's going to get reflected in the stock as we continue to build value in what we're doing. So, we're always looking at the portfolio, Paul. It's something we've done a lot of over the years. I think on the timberlands side, we'll continue to try to optimize. But at least as of right now, we like the businesses that we're in. Paul Quinn : All right. Best of luck. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. All right, I think that was our final question. And so, thanks everyone for joining us this morning. Thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Stay safe everyone, and have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Beth Baum, Vice President of Investor Relations and Enterprise Planning. Thank you, Ms. Baum. You may begin. Elizabeth Baum : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2021 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you Beth. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us today. This morning Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter net earnings of $1 billion or $1.37 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. I'm extremely proud of our team's accomplishments in the second quarter. Their collective efforts delivered the company's strongest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.6 billion, surpassing last quarter's record by 43%. Our year-to-date adjusted EBITDA is almost $2 billion higher than the first half of 2020. Wood products delivered another record quarter at $1.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA surpassing last quarter's record by 56%.  Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter. In the West adjusted EBITDA increased slightly in the second quarter. Western domestic markets remained favorable despite the decline in lumber prices late in the quarter and a healthy supply of logs to the market. Demand remains strong as mills took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories in response to an early fire season resulting from persistent dry conditions and a period of extremely high temperatures. This steady demand pull drove our sales volumes modestly higher during the second quarter.  Salvage operations from last year's fires in Oregon are continuing to supply an abundance of smaller diameter logs to the market. Consequently, prices for smaller diameter logs in Oregon have experienced some downward pressure. As a result of this dynamic, our domestic sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. To date, we have harvested nearly two thirds of our planned salvage volume in Oregon. Salvage productivity has slowed somewhat as warm summer weather arrived early and we began to transition salvage harvest operations in the higher elevation tracks which generally have lower productivity and higher operating costs. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher during the quarter as we do a significant amount of this work during the warmer summer months.  Turning to our export markets, in Japan and China demand for our logs remained strong and our sales realizations increased significantly. Global logistics constraints particularly with respect to shipping container availability and strong North American lumber prices continued to impact the availability of imported lumber into Japan and China. This has resulted in strong demand for locally produced lumber and increased demand for imported logs. Additionally, a ban on Australian log continues to reduce the supply of imported logs to China. Our China sales volumes increased in the quarter as we intentionally flexed volume from the domestic market to capitalize on strong demand signals in pricing from our Chinese customers.  Moving to the South, Southern timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased by approximately 10% compared with the first quarter. Southern saw log markets improved due to record lumber and panel pricing for most of the quarter and supply limitations resulting from persistent wet weather. Fiber markets also strengthened as mill inventories remained lean and wet conditions constrained supply. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the first quarter. Fee and sales volumes were significantly higher in the quarter despite impacts from multiple heavy rain events across the go [ph] South. The wet weather in the quarter did however limit our ability to catch up on delayed harvests from the first quarter snow and ice events. Log and haul costs increased slightly and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. Although Southern export represents a small component of our operations, we continue to see strengthening demand signals from China and India resulting increases in both sales volumes and realizations in the second quarter. However, container availability and increased freight rates continued to be notable headwind. In the North adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring break up conditions partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations.  Turning to real estate, energy, and natural resources on Pages 9 and 10. Earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 5% compared with the first quarter due to timing of real estate sales and mix of properties sold but we are significantly higher than the year ago quarter. Earnings increased by more than 230% compared with the second quarter of 2020. Demand for HBU properties has been very strong year-to-date and average price per acre remained elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to capitalize on this market and have been increasing our prices in many regions. This is resulting in a steady stream of high value transactions with significant premiums to timber. In energy and natural resources production of construction materials increased as demand remained strong during the quarter.  Wood products Pages 11 through 13. Wood products earnings and adjusted EBITDA improved by almost $0.5 billion compared with the prior quarter. Our lumber, OSB, and distribution businesses all established new quarterly adjusted EBITDA records in the second quarter. These exceptional results were delivered not withstanding ongoing challenges with transportation and resin availability in the quarter. I want to specifically call out and thank our supply chain and logistics teams for their tremendous work in helping us successfully navigate these headwinds.  In the lumber market average framing lumber composite pricing increased 29% compared with the first quarter. Lumber demand was strong during the first half of the quarter but began to soften as do it yourself repair and remodel activity weakened towards the latter part of May. The drop off in the do it yourself segment, largely a result of changing consumer spending habits coming out of COVID restrictions and to some extent record high lumber prices resulted in lower sales activity and higher inventories at the home centers and treaters. As a result, lumber prices peaked in late May and retreated at a rapid pace for the remainder of the quarter. Although inventories at home centers and treaters increased, inventory levels at dealers and distributors serving the home building and professional repair and remodel segments remain below normal at quarter end. Buyer positioning remains cautious with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory positions and dynamic pricing environment.  Adjusted EBITDA for lumber increased $291 million or 57% compared with the first quarter. Our sales realizations increased by 25% and sales volumes increased moderately. Log costs increased slightly in the second quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. OSB markets experienced historic strength in the second quarter as demand continued to outpace supply. Inventories remain lean throughout the channel and supply constraints persisted due to resin availability and transportation challenges. As a result, pricing continued to accelerate to record levels before peaking at the end of the quarter. Average OSB composite pricing increased 52% compared with the first quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $172 million or 57% compared to the first quarter. Our sales realizations improved by 48%. Production and sales volumes decreased modestly and unit manufacturing costs increased primarily due to a planned extended maintenance outage to complete a capital project at our Elk and OSB mill. Fiber costs were slightly higher in the quarter, primarily for Canadian logs. Engineered wood products adjusted EBITDA increased $11 million compared to the first quarter, a 26% improvement. Sales realizations improved across all products, and we continue to benefit from the price increases announced over the last year for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by higher raw material costs for oriented strand board webstock, resin, and veneer. Sales and production volumes increased for solid section and I-joist products. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased $36 million compared to the first quarter, a 92% improvement as strong demand drove higher sales volumes for most products, and the business captured improved margins. With that, I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook. Nancy S. Loewe: Thank you, Devin and good morning everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated over $1.3 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and over $2 billion year-to-date. These are our highest first half operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD for year-to-date second quarter 2021 totaled nearly $1.9 billion with approximately $1.2 billion related to second quarter operations as highlighted on Page 16. Year-to-date, we have returned $255 million to our shareholders through payment of our quarterly based dividend. As a reminder, we target a total return to shareholders of 75% to 80% of our annual adjusted FAD. From the case of 2021, the majority will be returned to the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.  Turning to the balance sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $1.8 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. During the second quarter we repaid our $225 million variable rate term loan due in 2026 and incurred no early extinguishment charges. We plan to repay $150 million 9% note when it matures in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter and full year 2021 are presented on Pages 17 and 18. In our timberlands business we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than second quarter.  Turning to our Western timberland operations, domestic mills ended the second quarter with ample inventory. We anticipate slightly lower domestic log sales realizations in the third quarter absent significant fire related disruptions. This is primarily due to modestly lower pricing for smaller diameter saw logs. We expect large log pricing will remain favorable due to limited supply and strong export demand. We anticipate seasonally, higher forestry and road spending as those activities accelerate with favorable weather condition. Typical of the drier warmer summer months, harvest activity will focus on higher elevation tracks where operations are less productive, resulting in slightly lower fee harvest volumes and higher per unit log and haul cost.  Moving to the export markets, in Japan log demand remained strong. We expect our third quarter sales realizations and log sales volumes to be generally comparable to the second quarter. In China, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes and slightly higher sales realization. Although Chinese log demand generally moderates during the summer rainy season, we expect demand for U.S. logs will remain strong as imports from other countries remain constrained. In the South, we anticipate significantly higher fee harvest volume as well as higher per unit log and haul cost during the third quarter due to a seasonal increase in thinning activity. Although our saw log and fiber log pricing should be comparable to the second quarter, we expect average sales realizations will be slightly lower due to a higher percentage mix of fiber logs. We also expect seasonally higher forestry and road cost as most of this activity is completed during these drier summer months.  In the North, sales realizations are expected to be lower due to mix while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher as we come out of the spring break up season. I'll wrap up the timberlands outlook with a comment on the sale of our North Cascades timberland, which was completed on July 7th. In the third quarter, we will record a cash inflow of $261 million and a gain of approximately $30 million related to this transaction. The gain will be reported as a special item within the timberland segment.  Turning to our real estate, energy, and natural resources segment, we expect third quarter adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter 2020, but earnings will be approximately $20 million higher than one year ago due to a lower average land basis on the mix of properties sold. As Devin mentioned, we continue to capitalize on exceptionally strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. In addition, we've seen strong year-to-date production of construction materials. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2021, adjusted EBITDA to $290 million. We now expect land bases as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 30% to 35% for the year.  For our wood product segment, third quarter benchmark pricing for lumber has significantly reduced from record levels, and benchmark pricing for oriented strand board has also recently declined. As a result, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower in the third quarter. For lumber, our quarter-to-date realizations are approximately $425 lower and current realizations are approximately $535 lower than the second quarter average. For OSB, our current realizations are still significantly higher than the second quarter average due to the length of our order files. Our quarter-to-date OSB realizations are approximately $155 higher, and current realizations are approximately $125 higher than the second quarter average. As a reminder, for lumber every $10 change in realization is approximately $11 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis. And for OSB, every $10 change in realization is approximately $8 million of EBITDA on a quarterly basis.  For lumber, as prices have retreated we expect higher sales volumes as inventories at home centers and treaters normalize and demand signals improve for do it yourself activity. We are also anticipating improved unit manufacturing costs during the quarter. We anticipate this would partially offset by slightly higher costs for Canadian and Western logs. For oriented strand board, we expect demand will remain favorable due to continued strength and new residential construction activity. We expect improved operating rates following the second quarter outage to complete the capital project at our Elk and OSB mill previously mentioned. With increased operating rates, we anticipate higher third quarter sales volumes and improved manufacturing costs. These improvements are expected to be partially offset by higher fiber cost. For engineered wood products we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products as we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases. In May 2021, we announced another increase which ranges from 15% to 25% and will be captured over the next several quarters. We anticipate significantly higher raw material costs primarily for oriented strand board webstock as the cost of webstock lags benchmark OSB pricing by approximately one quarter. For our distribution business, we're expecting the recent declines in commodity pricing will result in reduced margins and significantly lower adjusted EBITDA. Business results are expected to remain strong compared to a historical perspective. I'll wrap up with a couple of additional comments on our total company financial items. For each year in the second quarter, we finalized prior year end estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded $138 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our non-cash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense. Slide 18 includes our current full year outlook for pension and post-employment items. It also shows a $40 million capital expenditure increase we announced back in June for some additional high return projects across our businesses. Turning to taxes, we now expect our effective tax rate to be between 20% to 24% based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. The $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution has now been approved and we expect to receive the refund in the third quarter of 2021. So now I will turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin W. Stockfish: Great, thanks Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning I'll make a few comments on the housing in repair and remodel markets. U.S. housing activity continues at an impressive pace with total housing starts in the second quarter averaging 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis and total permits averaging 1.7 million units. Single family starts in June reached their highest monthly level since May of 2007. Notwithstanding a slight pullback in the second quarter as home builders navigated supply chain disruptions, year-to-date momentum is strong and our customers continued to expect robust housing activity over the back half of the year. Our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remains very favorable and is bolstered by encouraging long-term housing demand fundamentals.  Turning to repair and remodel, although demand for small do it yourself projects has softened from the elevated levels established in the pandemic, demand for larger professional remodels remain healthy. Our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity, and low interest rates. In closing, we delivered our best financial performance on record in the second quarter and we're well positioned to capitalize on favorable demand fundamentals for U.S. housing. Looking forward, we remain focused on industry leading performance across our operations and are on track to deliver our 2021 OPEX target of $50 million to $75 million. Our balance sheet is extremely strong and with year-to-date adjusted FAD of nearly $1.9 billion, we expect to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders through the variable supplemental component of our new dividend framework.  And finally I'm pleased to announce that we will hold a Virtual Investor Day on September 22nd. Nancy, Russell, and I will give an update on our key longer-term strategic capital allocation and sustainability initiatives. Event details and registration instructions will be included in a press release later this morning. We're excited to share that update and we'll look forward to speaking with you all again in September. And now I'd like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin, can you talk a little more about kind of how you see the lumber market currently, I mean price declines seem to have moderated over the last week or so, you talked about inventories below historical levels, and I would think that prices are below cash costs for a decent chunk of your competitors, I'm not sure if you would agree with that? And specifically you talked about anticipating a pick-up in demand in 3Q. I am just wondering are you seeing that right now at the end of July or is that something that you anticipate to see in August or September, just wondering if you can give any more color there? Devin W. Stockfish: Absolutely. Well just a little bit of context and then we'll address the different pieces of the question. Obviously lumber and OSB pricing for that matter reached historically high levels this spring and that was really a function of housing, repair and remodel just being very strong through most of the spring into May. We've seen the pricing come off significantly here recently. Although I will mention pricing is still reasonably strong by historical measures. I'd say what's been going on of late is really primarily a function of the smaller do it yourself market. We've seen that over the past couple of months come down 15% to 20% in terms of our sales into that market in June and July relative to the spring. So that's caused a little bit of inventory to build up in the home improvement, Weyerhaeuser -- warehouse and treater segments, which, that's really been sort of the pricing pressure as the producers look to move that product that would have gone into those markets to other customers. In terms of how we're looking at the current situation and as we head into fall, I think the do it yourself market should be picking back up here. In fact, even just this week, we've seen a little bit of a pickup there in terms of sales activity into the home improvement warehouse and the treater. So, I think that's going to start picking up and we would expect that to accelerate.  As we get into the fall, you'll see cooler weather, you'll see kids going back to school, vacation season will be winding down. And frankly I think just the moderation in lumber prices. I suspect some of the downtick and the do it yourself was a little bit of sticker shot with the high lumber prices and all the press that that was getting. So, in terms of the pricing environment, we think first of all, wouldn't be surprised at all to have seen the lumber prices over-correct a little bit. We've seen that in the past when prices have come down. We're expecting that to settle into a range that is certainly higher than historical levels albeit probably not at the record levels that we saw earlier in the spring. A couple of comments just on inventory, I think it's differential depending on what part of the channel you're talking about. I think in the home improvement warehouse and treater segment, it's probably still a little bit elevated relative to normal, but when you look at the builder and the dealer portions, I think that's probably a little lower than normal as they really haven't wanted to build inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. I will say with respect to your question about cash costs, certainly I think in British Columbia with the increase in log prices and some of the other dynamics there, it's entirely possible that a segment of the BC manufacturers have gone below cash costs where pricing went. So we'll see how that develops. I do think overall probably the cost floor in North America has gone up a little bit because of that dynamic relative to history. So again, we're expecting residential construction should remain strong. The pro segment of repair and remodel should stay strong and that do it yourself segment should start picking up here as we head into fall. So overall we're expecting pricing to settle into a new range that's still very strong pricing by any historical context. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just shifting gears, can you talk about the market for higher quality timberlands, I mean, we saw a pretty big transaction announced this morning, I think at an attractive price. It seems to be a lot of M&A just sort of accelerating across sectors. Can you talk about valuations you're seeing for high quality industrial timberlands, have they risen versus maybe 2019, is there any ESG premium that you're seeing creep in, and should we think about Weyerhaeuser as sort of a net buyer, net seller in this environment? Devin W. Stockfish: Well, I think no doubt we're starting to see the activity pick up a little bit. It was a little slow I'd say for the first half of the year, but certainly we see that picking up. In terms of valuations, we've definitely seen a pickup in interest in quality timberland, and that's a statement both in the West and in the South. You can see that in some of the valuations of recently announced deals. I think there is a lot of interest in this space, the ESG piece, the carbon piece, I think that may be playing into it a little bit. But I do think certainly we're seeing those valuations tick up a bit. Certainly that's what we're seeing in the market. With respect to our activity, as we've always said, we are always looking to optimize and improve the quality of our timberlands to grow the value of our timber base, that's something we're doing day in, day out. And sometimes that's on the sell side, but that's also on the buy-side. You've seen us with Oregon and Alabama, a couple of transactions of late. So we're always looking, we look at every deal that comes through. I think we'll continue to be active in that space. Russell and his team are looking at deals, are having lots of conversations, but you've got to be disciplined. And so we'll remain disciplined and execute on deals that make good financial sense, and that are like value accretive for us. So, we expect to be active, we'll continue to look in terms of just growing and optimizing and improve on our timber base. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi Nancy, hi Devin, hi Beth. Hope you're doing well. Thanks for taking my question. Congratulations on the quarter. The first question, I want to come back to something that Anthony had teed up. So, we've heard about dealers and distributors keeping their inventories low and something of a standoff, right, no one wants to order and then see just as that those sticks of lumber showing up for price to head lower yet as a dealer or distributor taking on the risk that prices and demand start to pick up on you and you're left with low inventories. What do you think will break that log jam, are you seeing any signs at all that the distributors and dealers are beginning to rebuild inventory or maybe not just because of where prices are going to be in this period of very, very low hand to mouth kind of ordering, which might not be the best thing for you, how do you see that shaking out? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, well you're exactly right. That's the dynamic that plays out in our markets day in day out and has for a very long time. When you have pricing that's in a falling environment, people are going to be very cautious about building inventories. And I think what really starts to bring people back into the market is one of two things; first, they get a sense that you've really started to bottom out in terms of what's going on in the pricing environment. You look at what's going on today. In fact, the print last night it showed that we saw the smallest downtick in pricing that we've seen in 10 or 11 weeks. I think because of the fires in British Columbia, there's some other dynamics that are going on that perhaps are starting to give people the feel that we've reached a floor and things will start normalizing upwards. That usually gives people some confidence to start building inventory. The second thing is, it's always a matter of if you're in that space, you have to make sure that you're supplying your customers. And so, to the extent that you feel like there's any risk whatsoever, that you're going to have enough inventory to meet your customer demands, then people will have to come in. I say, with the fire situation, with some of the transportation challenges, what we're hearing from the builder customers in terms of their outlook for the back half of the year, it's a careful dance for them to make sure that they don't get too low and get caught short. And we've seen what happens when that dynamic is played out and that usually results in pricing picking up relatively quickly. So, I wouldn't say in terms of the dealer distributor network we've seen them really start to build material inventories at this point. Although, as I said earlier, we have seen the home improvement warehouse and treater start coming back. Even this week there's been a little bit of an uptick that we've noticed to the extent that that gains momentum and starts pulling inventory out of the system, you could see that dynamic change here relatively quickly. George Staphos : Okay. Thanks for that, Devin. That's very helpful. I want to switch gears for my second question, kind of a two-part on timber. We've heard of some disruptions in China as they've been particularly with Tycon remediating, redoing the way they handle timber and from what we gathered inventories are relatively high. So I was a little surprised, pleasantly surprised that you're still seeing strong demand on timber into China. If you could explain why you think that's happening and to some degree why the U.S. is gaining share versus other regions? And then in the South, I want to say prices have begun to pick up on stumpage, a couple to three bucks a ton year-on-year, you're starting to see some commentary now that prices are lifting for more than seasonal reasons. Do you buy that or are you fairly skeptical of that and you think we're still in a flat perhaps deflationary period on a real basis in terms of timber? Thank you. Devin W. Stockfish: Well thanks. I'll cover the China question first and, the China market has been very strong for us this year. Pricing has been well above what we've seen, really in a number of years. Part of that has been the supply chain challenges from European exporters, the ban on Australian logs, but all of those things have come together and really opened that market back up for North American logs. And so that's been a really nice market for us. As you mentioned the inventory levels at the ports at the end of June did go up 5.5 million cubic meters, which is up from May, take away at the ports is down a little bit overall. And I'll get to Weyerhaeuser specific comments momentarily, but there are a few things that are driving that George. I mean, first of all, there's always a little bit of a tick down in demand when you get into the hot rainy season. We see that every year into China, so that's a piece of it.  But there are also some regulatory issues. They've had some increased environmental inspections and the big one you mentioned, which is just a changing dynamic at the port, which is one of the largest log-in port facilities. And what they're doing is essentially they're trying to push the saw mills deeper inland. And so there's a little bit of a dynamic going on there where they're trying to move some of those mills away from that port. That happens from time to time in China, it will get resolved. We're still very optimistic that you're still going to need a lot of logs imported into that China market. So I think that's really more of a temporary issue. For us in particular, our Chinese customer log demand is still very strong. Pricing is strong. And so we're actually contemplating or expecting rather to have our export volume into China up quarter-over-quarter Q3 versus Q2. So a little bit of dynamic going on there just, from the items I mentioned, but we're still very positive about that market over the back half of the year.  Moving to the Southern market, obviously we have seen a bit of an uptick in pricing, and I think there are two things going on there. One of them is certainly the weather dynamic. When you see multiple wet weather events in the South that keeps the logging out of the woods for a period of time, which limits the supply to the saw mills and the pulp mills. And that's been going on over the course of the summer and the spring. And that's really particularly in the pulp log that's kept inventories pretty low for this time of year. And so that's been a piece of it. But I do think there's also an increment of that, which is in certain geographies, the new saw mill capacity that's come in. And we've been talking about this for several years. If you put 7 billion board feet of new capacity into the South in those wood baskets where that new capacity is coming, you see a tensioning effect. And so, I don't think it's going to be a hockey stick by any stretch of the imagination. It's just going to be slow, steady improvement across different geographies. And so, we think that's going to slowly tension a number of wood baskets and again, it's going to be specific to each geography but that will continue to happen. We've seen a number of mills announced even just recently and we expect that to continue here for the foreseeable future because the South is a great place to manufacture lumber. George Staphos : Clearly. Thanks for the thoughts Devin. Good luck for the quarter. See you guys. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Connelly with Stephens. Please proceed with your question. Mark Connelly : It's been a long time since Weyerhaeuser has talked much about silver [ph] cultured gains. It used to be a big topic of conversation, but can you talk about how advances in silver culture are affecting the trends in your yield versus other issues that we talk about more like the weather? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah. I think part of the reason we don't talk about it as much is it's just become part of our day to day operation. And we have a R&D team that works on seedling improvements and different silver culture regimes to maximize the yield across our portfolio. So, you're probably right. We don't talk about it as much, maybe as we used to just because it's become part of our normal course. I would say that that is something I think over time we'll continue to be a competitive advantage for us. I think we do silver culture in forestry very well. We have a lot of great folks, a lot of PhDs, a lot of foresters that are working every day to make sure that we're driving the best yield across our land base. And so, I think it is an important part. I will say even when you think about climate change, for example, the ability of our teams to really make sure that we're using the right seedlings, for example, as the climate gets warmer and really targeting the seedlings that we're planting across our landscape, to ensure that we're maximizing the growth and the survival in a changing landscape. So it is definitely something that's still very important and the core to what we do, even if we're not talking about it on a day-to-day basis as much. Mark Connelly : Helpful. Just switching gears, the home builders are talking a lot about affordability, about labor challenges, but I feel like we've been talking about this for a couple of years and we haven't actually seen big shifts in the way homes are being constructed. Do you think that those changes are actually coming anytime soon, and if they are is that going to require a change on your part or a big investment? Devin W. Stockfish: Well, I think when we talk to folks throughout the supply chain, there is an awareness of the need to get more efficient on how we build homes. And that's at the home builders, that's at the big dealers, really across the board, just for a variety of reasons to make housing more affordable, number one, and to overcome some of the labor challenges that we've seen for many years. So there's a desire to make improvements there. But I think you're right, the improvements that we've seen to date have really been around the margins. I think it's tough to really fundamentally change how we build houses and that's going to be a slow process. And I'm not sure if we're having this conversation three, four, or five years from now, you're going to see a real material change in the way that we build homes. You'll probably see continued improvements around the margin. But it's an established supply chain in terms of how we build this -- build these homes. And so we just haven't seen big improvements to date, and I'm not sure I'm overly optimistic that that's going to change in the near-term. We have talked to our customers, we're very close with them and we're -- I think we're a very nimble supplier. So to the extent that we need to adjust how we do business to meet our customer needs, we'll be well positioned to do that. Mark Connelly : Thanks Devin, that\u2019s helpful. Operator : Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is around your thoughts on capacity, especially as we think about the emerging kind of stories around the forest fires out West, and some of your peers taking capacity offline in Canada. Can you talk a little bit to your outlook for your business and the potential implications from these natural events as they do potentially come together? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah. So, I guess a comment here on the near-term, and then maybe some observation longer-term. In the near-term we, obviously we're seeing a fire situation in the West and we can speak to that here in a moment. No issues on our land, but certainly it's been a rough start to the fire season overall, British Columbia even worse, I would say at this point. Nothing in the near-term that we're expecting from our production, specifically around natural disasters or fires. That being said every year, we have to stay nimble and adjust as we see these things play out. And so, that's something on a day-to-day basis that can change, but nothing to announce here at this point. I will say over time, certainly the environment that we're seeing with forest fires in the West and some of the natural hurricanes, other events in the South, it's something that you have to bake into your long-term planning. And so, as we see British Columbia, for example, having another serious fire season, well obviously over time those trees are not available for wood products manufacturing. So as we think about our long-term planning, we do take that into consideration as we decide where are we going to put capital to work? Susan Maklari : Okay, that's very helpful. My second question is you mentioned in your comments that you announced a 15% to 25% increase in your engineered wood products in May. As we think about the dynamics around alternative products like framing lumber, those prices coming down, can you talk to your ability to realize and sustain that pricing going forward? Devin W. Stockfish: Well, the EWP market as a whole has been very tensioned. We primarily send that product into new residential construction. And so unlike lumber and OSB that have a little heavier component of repair and remodel, the EWP mark is primarily residential construction, which really hasn't seen any sort of noticeable slow down and nor are we expecting that for the back half of the year. So, the dynamic there is a little different than lumber and OSB. And part of the issue there too is with the run-up in OSB webstock prices, the resin challenges, veneer pricing, some of the input costs for making EWP have gone up quite a bit as well. So there's that balance in terms of the pricing for EWP to overcome some of those raw material costs. Absent something happening on the residential construction market I think we feel pretty good about capturing that pricing increase that we announced in May. Susan Maklari : Okay, alright. That's very helpful. Thank you. Good luck. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wilde : Good morning, Devin, Nancy, Beth. Devin, I'd like to kind of come back to that last question, because we have seen virtually all of the big Western Canadian lumber producers take some production cuts over the last couple of weeks. They're pointing to fires, they're pointing to inventories, they're pointing to prices that are at or below net cash. And I'm also aware that there are some producers in the Pacific Northwest and the U.S. they have just gone to reduce scheduling in July. Can you talk about your activity levels in July in terms of both production in Canada and production on the West Coast of the U.S. and whether you've ratcheted back at all? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, Mark, thanks for the question. We have not to date had any material reductions in our production in either the West or British Columbia. I would say and this is a general comment across the portfolio of manufacturing, we're probably dialing back in the sense that we're not trying to run those extra shifts and overtime hours that we were earlier in the spring when you had the pricing at all-time peak. So it's really dialed back to a more normal operating posture, but that's something that we look at closely all the time. The fire situation is something I do think we're keeping a close eye on, as I mentioned. No real impact star timberlands at this point and we've still got reasonable log decks across the Northwest in Washington and Oregon, but that's something that obviously we'll watch closely. British Columbia, we only have the one mill in British Columbia. I would say the fire situation up there is probably even a little worse than it is in Washington and Oregon. A lot of the logging activity has ceased at this point in BC, in a number of operating areas, just because of the fire situation. If that doesn't change at some point here in the near term, I think log availability at our BC mill is going to be challenged at which point we would obviously have to take some downtime, but at this point we haven't. Mark Wilde : And just to kind of follow up on that BC situation, BC log costs, just from a formula standpoint are due to go up again in October. Can you talk about what impact that might have on your operations there, it's a pretty significant increase as I understand it? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah. Significant increase, the one that was announced on July 1st, significant increase. And so log costs in BC have certainly gone up I think. That just adds additional challenge to the issue from a cost floor standpoint across the industry that we already had in BC. For us Weyerhaeuser specific we've been focused on having a low cost mill. I think we're probably top quartile if not top decile from a cost structure standpoint at our Princeton mill. But that being said, the log costs and other costs associated with operating BC have gone up and I think that's raised the cost forward. So, we at this price, I think we can still operate that profitably, but certainly it's getting closer even for our top costs mill or low cost mill rather. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's really helpful. Now for a follow-up, I just wondered, if we go back a couple of months ago and think about that variable supplemental that you had talked about paying in the first quarter of 2022, there seemed to be kind of a little bit of an opening that you might want to pay some of that in 2021. Is it safe to assume with what we've seen go on the markets the last couple of months, you're just going to wait until the first quarter of 2022 now? Mark Wilde : Well, you're right. And that the new dividend framework anticipates the supplemental dividends typically going to be paid out in Q1 for the prior fiscal year. And, as you know, Mark, the primary reason there is just to ensure that we're matching that variable component to the cash flow that we're generating for the year. But we've said previously, we haven't definitively ruled out the possibility of some sort of interim supplemental dividend later in the year. And, really you think about where we are, we're in a little bit of a unique situation and that through the end of the second quarter, we've already generated nearly $1.9 billion of adjusted FAD. We have a very significant cash balance. And so that's something the Board is continuing to assess in terms of both those factors and how we see the rest of the year playing out. So, I'd still say at this point, we haven't ruled that out for at some point later in the year, but I would say even if we were to do that, which again the Board is going to consider over the back half of the year, we'd still expect the vast majority of that supplemental dividend for the 2021 cash flow would be paid out in Q1 of 2022. Mark Wilde : Okay, alright, that's helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yeah, thanks very much. Good morning guys. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks. Paul Quinn : Hey, I noticed you have increased your CAPEX budget. Just wondering if you could give us some more details on the major projects you've got there and Elk and I guess was an issue in Q2 in terms of production, is that project finished now to get to the volumes back in Q3? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, so we did announce an increase in our 2021 CAPEX by 40 million, as we said. About 20 million of that is wood products, about 10 million or so is on the timberland side, and then we had some IT projects largely that were focused in our mills. So that's the breakdown. When you think about that 40 million, couple of things to keep in mind for context, if you go back to 2020 we did reduce our CAPEX budget in 2020. So we had a number of projects in the queue really across the wood products business, that we think will generate strong returns, continue to position the business to be low cost, highly efficient, very reliable. So, we have a variety of projects in the queue. They run the gamut from CDKs to upgrading sorter stacker, the Elk project which we completed was the forming line. So just a variety of projects across the mill, largely focused on de-bottlenecking, reducing costs, and improving reliability. So, there's not one thing necessarily that I would highlight in those projects really, as I said, it's just a broad range of projects. And it's all based on the individual mill roadmaps that we have to get each of our manufacturing assets up to top quartile performance. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then if I turn over to the lumber capacity in North America, I mean, a number of projects have been announced. I've got, totaling sort of 1.7 billion in 2021 coming up and then another 2.2 billion in 2022. Is that level of capacity addition where you are in terms of future lumber pricing or supply into the marketplace? Devin W. Stockfish: You know, it really doesn't for a couple of reasons. So when we think about the North American market as a whole, which is the way we typically think about it, we do think you're going to continue to see capacity coming into the U.S. South. We know that's a great place to manufacture lumber. I don't think you're going to see much in the way of new capacity coming into the Pacific Northwest, primarily just it's such a tension wood basket. And so I think the log costs associated with that probably will prevent folks from putting too much capacity there. And I do think over time, we're going to lose capacity in British Columbia because of the fiber availability issue that you're well aware of. So, I think on a net-net basis we will see more capacity overall in North America. But look, we need it, right. I mean, if you think about the amount of housing that we're anticipating over the next 5 to 10 years, we won't be able to cover that without some continued capacity additions across North America. And so, I think we will continue to see that. I think the demand signal will keep that more or less in tension. So it's not something that overly worries me at this point. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just lastly, I mean, you guys have put up back to back record quarters. Your stock is flat through the year here to date versus somebody like a Rainier which is up 25%, like what are investors missing here, any urgency at Weyerhaeuser to be able to do something to help shareholders here? Devin W. Stockfish: Well, as we always say, and I'll emphasize it here again, we are extremely focused on driving long-term value for our shareholders. And we do that in a number of ways. We're actively managing our portfolio to constantly improve the value of our underlying assets. You've seen a number of timber transactions to that effect, our CAPEX programs and wood products. We have an unrelenting focus on operational excellence and driving industry leading performance. You've seen that in terms of our OPEX results over the years, as well as our competitive positioning from an EBITDA margin. And I think importantly, over the last year we've made a series of capital allocation decisions that have really positioned us very well for the future. We've paid down over a billion dollars of debt, our balance sheet is strong, we have a new base plus variable supplemental dividend structure that is really going to enable us to return significant amounts of cash to shareholders over time. As you've seen with the FAD that we've generated through the first half of the year, we're positioned to deliver a very meaningful supplemental dividend payment in the first quarter of 2022. And that's something I think the market is probably just starting to digest the magnitude of what that variable dividend is going to be. So I think as our investor base and the market gets more familiar with the new dividend structure, starts to see the benefit as we pay out that variable dividend, we should start seeing the share price better reflect the underlying value.  The other thing I'd say is we're optimistic that the other actions that we're taking to position the company for the future, including our increased focus on natural climate solutions and some of the other business development opportunities are really going to be a catalyst to drive investor interest and enhance our market valuation over time. Paul Quinn : I hope you're right. Thanks a lot. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Maybe just first, carrying on the last question, the current dividend yield is a little over 2% because obviously you'd cut the ordinary dividend and then increase it but not nearly back to the prior level. So here your large supplemental dividends, can you kind of relay again sort of what would be the thought process on the core dividend, how much upside might there be to the core dividend, and do you think that investors haven't yet really embraced the new framework that you're using, and you're getting hurt by the fact that your core dividend level is low? Devin W. Stockfish: But again, Mark, I think it's a relatively new dividend structure and so the market is digesting it. I would say with respect to the base dividend, a couple of things, as we've said we certainly do intend to grow the base dividend over time. That's a core part of our overall dividend philosophy and framework. We want that base dividend to be sustainable and supportable from the cash that we generate across our businesses over business cycles. So, the growth in the base dividend is largely going to be driven from the growth in our more stable timberlands and E&R businesses. And that can come from a variety of different angles, the organic growth in the business, taking costs out, disciplined acquisitions. The key is incremental cash flow that is sustainable across the bottom of market cycles. But certainly, we intend to grow that over time. And I would note, just as you think about the overall dividend framework, obviously, when the pricing environment is strong or even reasonable, we're going to generate significant cash flow that will get distributed out to the shareholders over and above that base dividend. So, I think the short answer to your question is, the market is still digesting how this is going to work. I think as they start to see the variable dividend come into play, as they start to see the base dividend grow over time, there will be an increase in appreciation for how this is going to work over time. Mark Weintraub : Okay, thank you. And two quick follow-ups on the demand for lumber in particular. So you had mentioned there have been decline in the do it yourself, but that the big renovation business you thought could hold up, order of magnitude how much of your lumber is going into the Do It Yourself typically, versus say the big renovation type projects? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, so for us we have a big business into the home improvement warehouse segment. And so that can be up to -- in the South up to 30%, in the Pacific Northwest maybe slightly less than that. So it's a decent part of our overall lumber business. When you think about the market as a whole, the Do It Yourself segment is somewhere in the neighborhood of 20%. We think of overall repair and remodel demand. So, we do sell a lot into the big box stores, of course, but you look at that across the overall market, the Do It Yourself is a much smaller portion of the overall repair and remodel spend. Mark Weintraub : Okay, so just to make sure I understood that So, Do It Yourself is like half of the repair remodel or it's 20% of the 40%.  [Multiple Speakers] Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, when you think about repair and remodel spend in total, the Do It Yourself segment we think is about 20%. Those numbers are hard to come up with in terms of a concrete look, but I think that that estimate is borne out from some of the stuff we've seen from the Harvard Joint Center as well and some of the other sources that we look at. So we triangulate that, and we think it's about the 20%. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And you mentioned kind of housing builders still quite optimistic. And certainly they got a lot of backlog and a lot of homes to build. That said that they're confronting supply chain issues, etc. Are those supply chain issues creating any impact, you think, on the demand that you're seeing maybe stretching things out, as opposed to killing it but are you seeing negative impact because of the supply chain issues affecting the builders? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, I think that's been the primary issue. To the extent that you've seen slowdown in building, I think the largest reason behind that has been the building products, supply chain issues. And so when you go and talk to the builders, what we hear is they're having troubles getting everything from appliances, to paint, to windows really just it runs the gamut. And I think, on some level, they've slowed the sales activity a little bit to try to catch up with some of that. But again, as we talked to those customers, they're optimistic for the back half of the year. The demand is there, notwithstanding some of the affordability challenges I think from the buyer community, but the demand for housing still is incredibly strong. And we think, based on those conversations and other discussions we've had with customers in the supply chain, that we're still going to build a lot of houses in the U.S. this year. Mark Weintraub : Right, and just a thought, so there's no doubt they've slowed the sales pace. I guess the question was more, are you seeing that there is a slow in their production pace too right now or not so much? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, I definitely think we've seen a little bit of that and the conversations that we've had you've heard anecdotes like we have to tell buyers that we can't sell them a house right now, we'll put them on a waitlist, they'll have to come back in a couple of months. So I think there has been a little bit of that. The magnitude of how much that's kind of hard to pin down exactly. But directionally, we think that's right. Mark Weintraub : Okay, and then just real quick, in the past you've given us some time sort of a bracketing X pricing, what the impact of various changes in the wood products might be versus the prior quarter, is that something you can share with us or the magnitude, the improved efficiencies and things like that? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, so I think, X price wood products EBITDA would be up quarter-over-quarter. I'm not going to give you a magnitude because I think just in terms of what's going on with the Home Improvement warehouse sales volumes, there's a little bit of question there as to whether that's up some or up materially. But certainly we expect sales volume to be up and we expect cost to be down. So X price EBITDA would be up in the quarter for wood products. Mark Weintraub : Okay, thanks so much. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great, thanks, and good morning everyone. Just on the wood product side, sorry, on the timberland side, the fundamentals for lumber look pretty solid, export demand sounds pretty healthy, you lapped the salvage activity and you sound pretty optimistic on potential gains in Southern pricing. Do you think we're finally at an inflection point where that business can start to see a sustained improvement in profitability and what would you consider kind of the big factors that could get in the way of that? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, so I would say, and I'm going to answer this by West and by South because they're slightly different dynamics going on in each market. In the West, we're seeing good pricing this year. It's a very tension wood basket and so as long as lumber demand and lumber pricing is reasonable, that's going to be a good strong business. We saw a little bit obviously of a dip in harvest levels as a result of the Oregon fires last year. We'll work through that salvage this year and you'll start to see the harvest levels kind of ticking up slowly here over time. So we feel really good about that business. I think it'll continue to be strong here for the foreseeable future. The South, obviously, we've had some disconnects between demand and supply, just in terms of the amount of inventory out in the woods coming out of the Great Recession and we've talked about that quite a bit. And I do think that there are markets within the South, geographies within the South that are starting to tension up a little bit. And that's largely a function of new capacity coming in, that's continuing to happen.  We've got, for example, several mills that have been announced the Bewer [ph] mill, the Idaho Forest Products Mill, Mississippi, the Toko Mill that was just announced in Louisiana, those are in good wood baskets for us. And as we continue to see that play out over time, I think that will just put pressure on pricing to slowly recover. I don't think that's going to happen overnight. It's a process it's going to play out over a number of years, but directionally I'm feeling good about where we're going there. From an overall margin standpoint, putting aside pricing, we are very focused on operational excellence. Our operating performance I think is very good in that business. But we're trying to improve every day, that's part of our OPEX program, and we put new targets out every year to increase the efficiency and lower costs. And so I feel good about the margin improvement opportunity there as well. So we've got good businesses, we've got good people, overall story around housing and repair and remodel demand to drive wood demand through the system, I think is positive. So we feel good about both of those businesses. Kurt Yinger : Got it, okay, that's helpful. And maybe just looking at the second half for timberlands, looks like the harvest should be up pretty meaningfully from the first half to maybe 15% or so. Q3 profitability down versus Q2, sounds like there's some seasonal costs in there, is there any way as we look ahead to the fourth quarter, that we could see that incremental volume have kind of a greater overall impact on profitability? Devin W. Stockfish: Yeah, so a couple things there. Q3, that's always a lower earnings quarter for us, because we do more forestry and road work in that quarter. And in the West, we typically move up the hill to higher cost elevation units or higher elevation units. So that's a typical seasonal pattern. In Q2, we did ramp up harvests, certainly relative to Q1, there has been a lot of rainy weather in the South. And so we weren't able to catch up as much of the Q1 issues that we saw with the ice storms as we had anticipated. I expect we'll get most of that up over the back half of the year, absent weather events that are hard to control. So you'll see the harvest activity pick up, cost activity is or costs typically in Q4 are a little better, because -- to reverse the dynamics I just mentioned. So, I can dimension it that way, but probably not just in terms of giving you a specific number. Kurt Yinger : Okay, no, that's great. Thank you. Alright, that's all I had. Appreciate the color. A - Devin W. Stockfish: Alright. Well, I think that was our final question. So thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. And thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers remarks, there will be a question and answer [Operator instructions] As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host for today's call. Andy Taylor, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor (ph), you may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you Rob (ph). Good morning everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser 's Third Quarter 2021 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking will be made during this conference call.  We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning of Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer, and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Great. Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported Third Quarter GAAP earnings of $482 million or $0.64 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Excluding a special item with a net after-tax benefit of $32 million, we earned $450 million or $0.60 per diluted share. In the Third Quarter, we delivered strong results across each of our businesses. Despite weather-related disruptions, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, and continued supply chain challenges.  Our teams did an exceptional job navigating these headwinds, and I'm incredibly proud of their collective efforts and focus on safely operating our businesses and continuing to serve our customers truly. Great execution across the entire supply chain in a difficult environment, which has resulted in record earnings in cash flow in 2021. Year-to-date we've generated more than $3.4 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $2.4 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. Turning now to our third quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on pages 6 through 9 of our earning slides.  Timberlands earnings increased by $20 million in the quarter, which included a $32 million gain on the previously announced sale of our North Cascades Timberland. Adjusted EBITDA decreased by $15 million dollars compared to the second quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $13 million compared to the second quarter. Western domestic log markets started the quarter in a favorable position despite weakening lumber prices and ample log supply. Demand remain elevated as mills continue to bolster log inventories during the peak of wildfire season. But we can somewhat in September as a number of producers experienced COVID-related disruptions and finish lever inventories increased above normal levels.  Despite these headwinds, our Third Quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the Second Quarter, driven by strong domestic log prices in July and August. Salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon wildfires, continued in the Third Quarter. The teams have done an outstanding job in managing these salvage efforts over the last year. To date, we've completed approximately 80% of our planned salvage harvest and expect to conclude most of this work by year-end. As expected, during the warmer and drier months in the summer, we transitioned to higher-elevation and higher-cost operations.  Additionally, although we experienced very minimal wildfire damage to our timberlands, active fires and dry conditions across the region resulted in restrictions on our harvest activity in the quarter, particularly in Oregon. As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were modestly lower in the third quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were higher. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remains strong in the third quarter. Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by the ongoing shortage of global shipping containers.  This dynamic is driving increased market share for our customers, and robust demand for our logs. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations increased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were comparable. In China, demand for our logs remained favorable in the quarter, despite seasonally lower consumption, COVID impacts to construction activity and other supply chain disruptions. Imports of lumber and log into China continue to be constrained by global shipping container availability, as well as, the ban on Australian logs. As a result, sales realizations for our China export logs increased moderately compared to the Second Quarter. But we're more than offset by higher ocean freight rates. Sales volumes to China were comparable to the Second Quarter. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the Second Quarter. Southern sawlog and fiber markets continued to strengthen as log supply was constrained and mill inventories remain lean, resulting from ongoing wet conditions and significant weather events. As a result, our sales realizations were slightly higher than the second quarter. Fee harvest and sales volumes increased slightly in the third quarter, but fell below our planned activity level as a result of persistent wet weather, and operational disruptions from Hurricane Ida.  Per unit log and haul cost increased slightly in the quarter, as did forestry and road cost. On the export side, we continue to see growing demand for our southern logs. Our export log pricing increased substantially in the third quarter, but volumes were lower than second quarter as we continue to face challenges associated with container availability and increased freight rates. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. Sales volumes were significantly higher coming out of spring break-up conditions though sales realizations were lower due to mix. Turning to real estate, energy, and natural resources on pages 10 and 11. Real Estate ENR contributed $45 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA.  Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $31 million lower than the second quarter due to timing of transactions, but comparable to the year-ago quarter. Similar to last year, our 2021 real estate sales activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Third Quarter earnings more than doubled compared to the Third Quarter of 2020 due to the mix of property sold. We continue to capitalize on strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Moving to Wood Products, pages 12 through 14. Wood Products earnings and adjusted EBITDA decreased by approximately 60% compared to the prior quarter as lumber and OSB pricing declined substantially from record levels earlier in the year before stabilizing later in the quarter.  Additionally, weather events in the U.S. South, including Hurricane Ida, resulted in temporary downtime, and loss production in our lumber business. And together with COVID related staffing disruptions, further exacerbated transportation challenges in the region. Despite these headwinds, our teams performed well and delivered strong results. Our EWP business established a new quarterly EBITDA record in the third quarter, and the overall Wood Products segment has achieved year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of more than $2.8 billion. Lumber markets began the third quarter with elevated home center and treater inventory levels due to softening do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. As a result, pricing continued its downward trajectory in July and for much of August. The market began to strengthen later in the quarter as home centers and treaters worked through excess inventories and consumer spending shifted back to do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity after Labor Day. When combined with solid demand from new home construction and professional repair and remodel activity, each of which remained healthy throughout the Third Quarter. These dynamics cause pricing to stabilize in late August and increased gradually through September. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business, decreased $686 million compared to the Second Quarter. Our sales realizations decreased by 52% in the Third Quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 61%. Our sales volumes increased moderately in the Third Quarter, and log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian logs. The OSB market, we can significantly at the outset of the third quarter with the softening of do-it-yourself repair and remodel activity. This dynamic drove lower sales activity, and higher inventories at the home centers. As a result, we experienced a rapid decline in pricing from the peak record prices that we reached in July. Pricing then stabilized above the historical average in August as demand from strong new home construction activity continued, and the market faced supply constraints resulting from ongoing [Indiscernible] availability and transportation challenges.  This dynamic, along with late quarter improvement in do-it-yourself repair and remodel demand, drove prices gradually higher through September. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $128 million compared to the second quarter. Our sales realizations decreased by 24% in the third quarter, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 43%. This relative out-performance was largely a result of our higher percentage of premium OSB products. Our sales and production volumes improved modestly in the third quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly primarily for resin costs. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased $23 million compared to the second quarter.  A 43% improvement. Sales realizations improved significantly across most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by a higher raw material cost for OSB web stock, resin, and veneer. Sales and production volumes were moderately lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $53 million compared to the second quarter. Despite lower sales volumes for most products, and significantly lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction, our teams did a great job navigating these challenges and delivered $22 million of adjusted EBITDA in the third quarter. With that, I will turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items in our fourth quarter outlook. Nancy Loewe : Thank you, Devin. and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with our key financial items which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $659 million of cash from operations in the Third Quarter, bringing our year-to-date total to nearly $2.7 billion, our highest year-to-date operating cash flows on record. Adjusted funds available for distribution or adjusted FAD, for year-to-date Third Quarter 2021 totaled over $2.4 billion as highlighted on page 17. Year-to-date, we have returned $382 million to our shareholders through the payment of our quarterly based dividend, and we will supplement the base dividend each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD.  For this year, we intend to achieve this entirely through a variable supplemental cash dividend. Though in future years, we may also utilize opportunistic share repurchase for a portion of this cash return. The supplemental dividend will normally be paid in the first quarter of each year based on prior year cash flow. However, as a result of the record year-to-date performance, we accelerated a portion of the supplemental dividend by returning $375 million to our shareholders through our previously announced $0.50 per share interim supplemental dividend earlier this month. We look forward to returning the remaining portion of the supplemental dividend with a significant payment in first quarter 2022.  During the third quarter, we also returned $26 million to shareholders through share repurchases. Further, as previously announced, we authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase program. And as always, we'll look to repurchase shares opportunistically under circumstances when we believe it will create shareholder value. Turning to the Balance Sheet, we ended the quarter with approximately $2.3 billion of cash and just under $5.3 billion of debt. Subsequent to quarter-end, we repaid our $150 million, or 9% note at maturity, which brings our debt balance to $5.1 billion. After this repayment, we have no additional maturities until 2023. Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18.  In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings, and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the third quarter. Turning to our Western Timberland operations, although domestic log inventories ended the third quarter higher-than-normal, takeaway of finished lumber and log demand have improved following a brief pullback in September. We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the fourth quarter. As result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to improve from the lower levels experienced in September. For the fourth quarter, we anticipate our average domestic sales realizations to be moderately lower than the elevated third quarter levels.  As Devin discussed, we have made great progress within our salvage operations in Oregon and expect our salvage volumes to decrease in the fourth quarter. As a result, we expect fourth quarter fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher with lower per-unit log and haul costs. Moving to the export markets, in Japan, log demand remains favorable. We anticipate our fourth quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the elevated third quarter levels, partially offset by moderately lower sales volumes due to the timing of vessels. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the port, demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable as construction activity increases seasonally, and imports of lumber and logs continue to be constrained from other countries.  We expect our Fourth Quarter sales volumes to be higher than the Third Quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations. Elevated freight costs and labor to load ships continue to be headwinds. In the South, weather conditions improved at the outside of the Fourth Quarter, as a result, we anticipate slightly higher fee harvest volumes compared to the Third Quarter. Log demand continues to be favorable as mills work to bolster lean inventories, resulting from persistent wet conditions and reduced log supply.  As a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales realizations during the fourth quarter. We expect this will be offset by slightly higher per-unit log and haul cost, as well as a moderately higher forestry and road costs as a portion of our planned activities in the third quarter were deferred due to weather disruptions. As a result of persistent wet conditions in 2021 and significant weather events in the third quarter, we now expect full-year Southern fee harvest volumes to be comparable to 2020. In the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower due to mix and fee harvest volumes are also expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter.  Turning to our real estate energy and natural resources segment, fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than third quarter due to timing of transactions. We continue to predict full-year 2021-line adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $290 million and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 25 to 30% for the full year. For our Wood Products segment, new residential construction activity remains strong and demand from the repair and remodel segment continues to strengthen following the improvement in do-it-yourself activity in September.  This dynamic continues for most of the quarter before weakening seasonally into winter. Excluding the effective changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect fourth-quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the third quarter. For lumber, production volumes are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. However, our sales volumes are expected to be modestly lower, resulting from the inventory draw down we experienced in the third quarter. We anticipate this will be offset by slightly lower log cost and improved unit manufacturing cost. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for lumber are slightly higher than third quarter average. For oriented strand board, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes and improved unit manufacturing cost, primarily due to less downtime for planned maintenance during the fourth quarter. We expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber cost. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date realizations for oriented strand board are significantly lower than the third quarter average, but still elevated compared to historical standards. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect sales realizations for solid section and I-Joist products will be comparable while realizations for plywood will be lower.  We anticipate this will be more than offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we are expecting higher adjusted EBITDA in the fourth quarter, primarily due to improved quantity margins partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes. I'll wrap up with a couple additional items or comments on our total Company financial items. We now anticipate our full-year outlook for capital expenditures to be slightly below our previous guidance of $460 million as a result of supply chain and contract labor constraints with $15 to $25 million potentially at risk. Turning to taxes, the $90 million tax refund associated with our 2018 pension contribution was approved during the Second Quarter.  However, we are still awaiting the refund. We expect to receive it by the end of Fourth Quarter 2021. Excluding this refund, we now anticipate our full-year cash taxes will be slightly lower than tax expense. Now, I'll turn the call back to Devin, and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I will make a few comments on the housing and repair remodel markets. Notwithstanding a slight decrease from the prior quarter, U.S. housing activity remains strong in the Third Quarter, with total housing starts and permits averaging around 1.6 million units on a seasonally-adjusted basis. Although housing starts in 2021 continue at a strong pace, the cycle time between starts and completions has extended as home builders continue to experience supply chain and labor availability challenges. Despite these headwinds, our customers tell us they continue to expect strong demand for new home construction for the balance of 2021.  The latest new home sales number released earlier this week further reinforces our positive view on the current state of the housing market. With favorable long-term demand fundamentals, including a decade of under-building favorable demographics, we continue to have a bullish outlook on U.S. housing activity well into the future. Turning to repair and remodel, we've continued to see strength in large professional projects over the course of 2021 and expect that to continue for the balance of the year and into 2022. And while we did see some softening in the smaller do-it-yourself segment during the summer, demand has improved significantly coming out of Labor Day, and we've continued to see strong demand from the repair and remodel segment through October.  Overall, we continue to have a favorable long-term outlook for repair and remodel activity, supported by numerous demand drivers, including an aging housing stock, rising home equity, and low interest rates. Finally, we hope you had the opportunity to participate in our Virtual Investor Day on September 22nd, where we outlined a series of multiyear strategic growth targets, including growing our Timberlands portfolio, growing our new Natural Climate Solutions business, and organically growing our lumber business. We also announced several capital allocation actions and enhanced our ESG leadership by releasing our carbon record and announcing new greenhouse gas emission reduction targets. Our strategy, as we outlined at Investor Day, is simple.  We intend to grow the value of our portfolio, improve our cash flows, build on our competitive advantage in the marketplace, and solidify Weyerhaeuser as a premier ESG investment opportunity. These actions will ensure that we drive superior returns for our investors, including returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders through our growing base dividend, a variable supplemental dividend, and opportunistic share repurchases. All while continuing to invest in our businesses and maintain an appropriate capital structure. We're excited about the future of Weyerhaeuser, and we're well-positioned to capitalize on strong macro trends driving continued growth and demand for our products and new opportunities for our businesses.  Before turning to questions, I would like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank Beth Baum for her leadership of our Investor Relations team over the last several years. We're greatly appreciative of Beth's contributions to our IR function and look forward to our next opportunity at the Company. With Beth's transition, Andy Taylor has assumed the lead role of our Investor Relations program. Andy joined Weyerhaeuser in October of last year, after an 18-year career in the energy industry, where he served a numerous leadership roles, including Investor Relations. He's been a great addition to the Weyerhaeuser team and we're really excited to have him taking on this new role. So now I would like to open up the floor for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator instructions] One moment please, while we poll for questions. Our 1st question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is around any color you can give us on inventories in the channel, given all the moves that we saw during the quarter in terms of pricing as well as the demand environment, how much do you think the industry worked through and where your inventory sitting and how does maybe that compare to the broader industry? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. And Susan, I assume you're talking about Wood Products inventory? Susan Maklari : Yes. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes. So I think at present, is we think about inventories across the channel, I would categorize them, generally speaking, for lumber and OSB as anywhere from normal to perhaps a bit lean in certain areas, I think with respect to the treaters and to some extent the home improvement warehouses, they are more or less than normal inventory levels for this time of year. I think in some of the dealers, perhaps a little lean in spots. On EWP, really, that's pretty tight across the system, so I don't think there's a whole lot of inventory there. And that's generally the case for us as well. We're sort of normal to perhaps a little light in certain spots in terms of Wood Products. Susan Maklari : Okay, that's helpful. And then as a follow up, obviously there's been a lot of puts and takes as it relates to the supply chain especially in the quarter. Can you just give us maybe a bit more color on any highlights areas where you're really seeing some headwinds there? And then also the implications as we think about resins and some of the inputs to things like OSB or some of your other products like EWP and any kind of read - throughs from there. Devin Stockfish : Yeah, I'd say at a high level, there have been a lot of challenges from a supply chain standpoint and that really cuts across really all aspects of the supply chain. The big one that I think has been a challenge for everyone, has been on the transportation side, and that's trucking, particularly in the U.S. South. It's been a real challenge, that bleeds over into rail, in many instances, all the way to the export side and finding shipping containers. So really anything having to do with transportation is a real challenge right now.  As you think about other aspects of the supply chain, labor is a challenge in many spots. You read a lot about that, I think it's impacting pretty much every industry, ours is no different. So labor challenges, really to us, that's made us a little bit be more challenged in terms of running extra hours when we might otherwise have done so. So I think labor issues across the industry continue to be an issue. In terms of some of the inputs resin, it hasn't really impacted our operations to date, but certainly, there is a tightness in terms of resin availability and I think that's impacted the industry as a whole. The other one I would call out really is veneer, and that's been a challenge as well. So really, there are impacts across the entirety of the supply chain, and I think that's really why we're so pleased with the work our team has done in navigating some of those challenges and delivering the results that we were able to deliver in Q3. Susan Maklari : Got you. Okay. Thank you. That's very helpful coloring, good luck. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Thanks very much. Hi, everyone. Good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, George. George Staphos : And congratulations to Beth and Andy. Andy, looking forward to working with you in the future. So I guess the first question I had, when I look at wood, and lumber EBITDA in particular, obviously you took it on the chin from a pricing standpoint, and all you did a little bit better than the composites, but when I apply that to your volumes, actually EBITDA held up a little bit better than I would have expected. So what were you doing from a process and operations the cost standpoint, obviously, you've been working on this for the last number of years that helped the performance in the quarter. And that had a couple of follow - on. Devin Stockfish : Yes, you really touched on it, George, and -- and the reality is the OpEx work that we've been doing for a long time has been a core part of our strategy. That's -- that's really true in any environment, but I think particularly in an environment where we are seeing inflationary pressures, that work is just absolutely Devin Stockfish : critical, and so kudos to the teams for all the work they're doing to, again, manage through some of the supply chain challenges, really try to battle some of the inflationary pressures. And we're going to continue to do that. We didn't mention that on the script. But certainly we do plan to meet our $50 to $75 million OpEx target for the year, which I'll just say that's a -- that's a really high hurdle given the inflationary environment that we are seeing. So it really just goes back to operational expenses George. And really what we are doing on the up front to make sure that we are -- we are driving cost out wherever we can and delivering for our customers. George Staphos : Devin, does that suggest you'll be at the upper end of that range or you don't really want to be that precise at this juncture on OpEx? Devin Stockfish : Yeah, I wouldn't want to be any more precise than just to say that we were confident that we'll be within that range. George Staphos : Okay. Understood. 2nd question for you and for Nancy. Obviously, we'll see what the fourth quarter brings, but so far it looks like your guidance is for performance that's at least as good as was the case in the third quarter, you gave us the guidance on CapEx for the year and not making adjustments for the tax refund, is it unfair to think of the potential special dividend in the first quarter, again, lots has to happen as being in the $1.70 range, or perhaps higher when we do the math, or how would you have us guardrail it if you will? Nancy Loewe : Hi, George. This is Nancy. Adjusted FAD is cash from operations, less CapEx and significant non-recurring items. So we will actually adjust the tax credit for that. And we don't provide guidance on adjusted FAD or the supplemental dividend, and that's because our cash flow fluctuates, you know, with working capital changes and we can't predict the lumber and OSB prices. So we do provide the adjusted FAD each quarter as you saw, and you'll know that the payout is targeted at 75 to 80% of adjusted FAD and you will see that each quarter as we go here. And I think what we've shared today is that the remainder of the supplemental dividend than we've seen will be significant. That's about what we can say. George Staphos : Nancy, and I appreciate that, but if we hold pricing constant and we'll leave other stuff to the side, would be fair to say that your operating cash flow should be at least as good in 4Q versus 3Q? Are there some other things that we should be remembering in terms of, I don't know, working capital, cash, taxes, etc.? Nancy Loewe : Yeah. We'll just remember the CapEx as a significant amount of our fourth quarter and that's because our CapEx is George Staphos : You're currently operating with cash flow and it's excluding CapEx there. So an operating cash flow? Devin Stockfish : Yeah Yes, George, I mean, when you build it up, we're talking about comparable EBITDA from the Timberlands standpoint. It is going to be lower for the real estate. But again, up to the 290 that we guided to. And then on the Wood Products side, as we said, we're thinking [Indiscernible] lumber and OSB prices, which, obviously, we're not going to try to predict, it is going to be higher for the quarter so when you build those up, I think you're not wrong about the operating cash flow, although, like Nancy said, you have to build in CapEx when you're trying to calculate the FAD. George Staphos : Of course. My last question I'll turn it over. I assume it's just the supply chain and the lack of other markets being able to hit Asia. But if you could give us a bit more common terms of why the southern log exports were strong in the quarter. Thanks, and good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yeah sure. And that's primarily going into the China and India markets George, in terms of our Southern export. And it's really a combination of a few things. Number 1, particularly in China, there are some overall global supply chain issues, as you mentioned, shipping containers for European wood going into that market have been strained, there's also a ban on Australian logs. And so that's really opened up some opportunities for North American wood and we've really seen that demand spike up, and so that's true for China, but we've also seen the demand going into India. Coming up, we've started shipping into Pakistan, Turkey as well. And so we're just seeing good, strong global demand for logs, and from the Southern George Staphos : yellow pine stand -- standpoint, we think there's a really good, strong market for us going out into the future, particularly when we can start resolving some of these logistical challenge with shipping availability and container availability. Devin Stockfish : Thank you, Devin. George Staphos : Yup. Thank you. Operator : Our next question [Indiscernible] Mark : [Indiscernible] larger than I would've expected, given what people have always told me about sort of how these price increases cadence, and I know you've got a lot of increases over the last year, but you know, my understanding was that those typically phase-in over a three or four quarter period. Devin Stockfish : Yeah Mark. Well, you're absolutely right in terms of the timeline for how those pricing increases typically take place, it is over a multi-quarter period. I think the way to think about that though is that just given the dynamics of what's been going on in the market, both with respect to the OSB pricing and some of the other input costs like resin, veneer, etc., we've had a number of price increases over the last year, and so they just sort of have layered on top of each other. And generally speaking, that's the answer, is in this quarter, we saw several of those price increases really start to take hold. We still have more coming in terms of the previously announced price increases. So Q4 and Q1 we'll see a little bit more. The only thing I would say on that front is, it's always dependent on particular regions and customers, and so we did see perhaps a little bit more in Q3 than you might otherwise think. But generally speaking, the answer is, it's just a number of price increases over the last year that have kind of layered on top of each other. Mark : Okay. And the second question I have was just around southern log in timber pricing, because you're up a little bit, but not much. But in talking with people around the trade, it seems like there's a little more of a pickup going on than you're showing or the timber mart data you're showing, and I'm just curious, do you sell forward such that if we had a pickup in the markets that was starting to occur, it would take a while to be fully reflected in your numbers, because maybe you are selling forward three or four quarters? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So certainly that's correct with respect to some of our volume that we sell in the South. So we sell through a variety of methods, including spot prices, which obviously those are reflected real-time. time. But we also do a lot of quarterly pricing which will reflect the prior quarter indexes. And so to the extent you see a run-up, there will be a lag in log pricing in the South. Mark : Okay. And then finally, on this Southern log export business. Is there any case over the next, I don't know, 2 years, 3 years, we should actually put some dedicated freight in place? In the Pacific Northwest you've got dedicated boat ships for log export business, whereas I think in the South, we're basically stuffing logs in the shipping containers right now, which has to be higher cost. Devin Stockfish : Yeah, Mark. Well, that's the goal. Ultimately, we'd like to build that program to the size where we can transfer that over from the container shipping up to break-bulk. So that's the goal. I think we're making some good progress. We were heading in that direction pre - tariffs a few years ago when we had the trade dispute with China. That set us back a little bit. That was a bit of a headwind there with the size of the tariffs on Southern yellow pine, but as those have come off, we've really been building that program back up. We do see the demand in China for Southern yellow pine growing. I think we will see some interesting dynamics here over the next few years. 1, with the export ban of logs from Russia, I think that will be an interesting dynamic to follow. And then 2, you know, we have seen elevated levels of European logs going into that market after the beetle infestation that we've seen there. Our view is that volume's peaking maybe over the next year or so and then should start to diminish over time. And again, I think that just opens up another opportunity for Southern yellow pine. Mark : And if you go to break-bulk, Devin, can you give us an order of magnitude on what that does to shipping costs? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I think it'd be hard for me to give that to you right off the top of my head, Mark, we can certainly follow up. But there's no question it's better economics if you can go to break-bulk versus shipping container, and that's true in any market conditions, but particularly right now when you think of the inflationary pressures we've seen on containers, it would be even more so in today's environment. But no question about it, the economics are much better with break-bulk versus container. Mark : Great. I will turn it over. Thanks, Devin. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Global. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Good morning. First -- Devin Stockfish : Morning. Mark Weintraub : First wanted just to clarify a little bit, the answer to George 's question. Were you -- I thought I heard you saying, it sort of doesn't really make total sense to me, that cash from operations in the fourth quarter look like they're going to be higher than the third quarter? And I just wanted to clarify if that is what you were saying, because I guess if lumber and OSB prices stayed where they are today, would that be the case or would they probably be somewhat lower? I'm just a little confused by that exchange. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So we were really just speaking to EBITDA absent the impact of lumber and OSB sales, which are pricing as you know which we don't try to forecast. Mark Weintraub : Right. But you have provided an indication of where they are quarter-to-date and where they are currently, so if we were to just assume that type of pricing level, can you give us a sense or do you want to hold off from that? Devin Stockfish : Well, but I think keep in mind right, so if we think about quarter-to-date lumber pricing, they're up just a little bit, but OSB pricing is still down quite a bit relative to Q3. So if you took today's pricing, then obviously it would be lower quarter-over-quarter. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And that's what I thought, just wanted to clarify what was a misunderstanding. But I guess another thing though, on the OSB, we do -- you pointed out in the slide that there is a lag on the way that the pricing does show up, and so when you give that current number, is that reflective of what's in random length today or is that really reflective of what was in random lengths several week back -- several weeks back. So that -- we've already got this -- a built-in ramp up some amount in the coming few weeks? Devin Stockfish : Yes, there's always going to be a lag when we talk about our realizations relative to random length, because the order files that we have and OSB that creates a lag effect. And particularly today where we're targeting at three-to-five-week order file, you're going to see a comparable lagging in terms of pricing relative to what's going on with random links, when we talk about our realizations. Mark Weintraub : And then lastly, we've seen -- certainly noted your bullish comments that make a lot of sense to me on housing, et cetera, for next year and implications for the Wood Products business, as well as, your other businesses. What are you expecting for the balance in this quarter? Are we most likely going to see more normal seasonal patterns or do you think that there's enough of that underlying strength that it could play out counter-seasonally? Do you have a strong view or it's grayish at this point? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. So I will tell you what we hear from our home builder customers which is, they're going to try to build as many homes as they can. So I think from the standpoint of the demand signal and what they're going to try to do, it's pedal to metal. Now, the caveats to that are really two-fold. One, that largely depends on whether they can manage through the supply chain issues that they've had. So whether they can get windows and doors and paint, etc., I can tell you from our conversations, that continues to be a struggle and there's no doubt that that's held back what we otherwise might have seen from a housing standpoint, so that issue is still out there, and I think will be, to some extent, a governor.  And the other big wildcard is just what goes on with weather. To the extent that you have mild weather, I think you're going to see probably as much homebuilding as you can possibly squeeze into Q4. if we start getting an early winter in the northern regions or you have a lot of rain or other weather events obviously that could impact it. But on balance, we're expecting a strong fourth quarter just given the level of demand that our customers are seeing in the market right now. And I think you can look at just the permitted not yet started number, you can look at the new home sales number that we just saw. There's just a lot of demand out there and the homebuilders are trying to meet that to the extent that they can get the products to do it and manage through the weather issues as we get deeper into the year. Mark Weintraub : Thanks. Last one, quick, just clarification. I think you mentioned in the EWP business that you had higher OSB web costs in the third quarter, which I guess puzzle me a little bit given that OSB prices were lower in the third quarter than in the second quarter, so just wanted to understand that a bit more or maybe I missed something. Devin Stockfish : Yeah, again, that just goes -- that just goes back to the lag. And when we talk about OSB sales to web -- when we talk about OSB cost for web stock Remember, that is almost exclusively coming from our own OSB business. And so that -- that rolls on, I think, a 12-week kind of rolling average pricing dynamics. So you see -- you see that lag a little bit, but that will show up in Q4. Mark Weintraub : Got it. Thanks very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much. Morning guys. Paul Quinn : Just to [Indiscernible] on Wood Products. Lumber shipments to-date they are up only 1.5%, which is quite a bit lower than what you suggested up 5% on Investor Day. So just wondering how confident you are in getting that 5% over the next number of years for the year. Devin Stockfish : I would say we are highly confident. We would -- frankly, we wouldn't have said it at Investor Day if we didn't have a high level of confidence in. as we think about how that's going to play out over the next several years. All of that is built up from individual mill level, 5-year capital road-maps, and so we have the projects identified. The vast majority of the projects that are going to make up that incremental production have already been completed at one mill or another. So it's -- we view it as relatively low-risk to continue to execute across these projects that we've by and large already done somewhere else. So that's the long answer. The short answer is we're highly confident in that number. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then if I flip it over to OSB, you're down 8.7% year-to-date on shipments. Just wondering why that is? Devin Stockfish : Yeah, it's really just a reflection of some planned maintenance that happens during the year. And so when you look year-over-year, mills will have different quarters, different parts of the year where they'll have planned annual maintenance, and so that's just a reflection of that. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just lastly, just that I hate to harp on, but I can't understand it. You've got record Wood Products pricing this year, but your share performance to-date is less than half your biggest reap year. So the question is why and how can you make up the difference? Devin Stockfish : I guess what I would say to that Paul is first and foremost, we're always focused on driving value for our shareholders. And we do that in a number of ways. Managing our portfolio, we've done some transactions on the Timberlands side that we think have increased value. We have a focus on OpEx and I think that showed up in how we've driven industry-leading performance across our businesses. We've taken a number of actions of late to continue to work on the portfolio and improve our performance. We strengthened the Balance Sheet by paying down over a billion dollars of debt. I think our new base plus variable supplemental dividend structure is going to return significant amounts of cash over time.  And we've seen how that's played out this year with the interim supplemental we paid out in October, the sizable supplemental dividend we're going to pay out in Q1 2022. And so from my standpoint as we continue to execute on the long-term growth opportunities that we laid out in Investor Day and achieve those targets. There's no doubt in my mind that's going to make us a better and more valuable Company. And I think as we continue to grow the Company, improve our margins, return cash to shareholders, that value will ultimately be reflected in the stock price over time. Paul Quinn : Alright. That's all I had. Best of luck. Devin Stockfish : Alright, thank you. Operator : Our final question is from Kurt Yinger with DA Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Morning. Kurt Yinger : I just wanted to start off on the harvest side, in 18 and 19 you are in the ballpark of 38 million tons last year down to 33 million with some of the restrictions and it looks like you'll be around that same level this year. Could you just help us think about what a good baseline for the different regions is as we look ahead to 2022, and is there anything from a labor or supply chain perspective that you foresee being particularly challenging as you maybe look to ramp that up? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. So without giving specific guidance on 2022 harvest levels, which we'll do when we report Q4 earnings. I will make a few comments by region and starting in the west. So as you think about the western harvest levels relative to history, a few things things to keep in mind. 1. When you think about the harvest levels and 2015 through 2018-time frame, to some extent that was impacted by the Longview timber acquisition that we did back in 2013. And as we said, that had some very mature timber that came along with that acquisition. So our harvest levels were a bit elevated for several years after that acquisition as we work that H-class down to a more normalized level.  So we always expected that to come down a bit over time. We had expected that start going back up, but obviously in 2020, we had a pretty significant fire season in Oregon. And so that impacted the harvest levels both in 2020, but also in 2021 as we worked through some of that salvage volume, but we would expect that to start going back up next year. In the South, we've had a few things going on last couple of years, obviously last year we did defer some harvest volume in the South due to some market conditions and COVID, etc. We had planned to have that going back up by 10% this year, year-over-year. There's just been a really wet year in the South.  A lot of weather events that has really reduced our ability to get out and move wood in some of those weather events. And so we're able to catch some of that up, but I do think to the point you just made one of the challenges that we have in fully catching that up is just some of the availability of contracting loggers and tracking availability. So I would say on the margins that's probably hindered a little bit our ability to ramp up to make up for some of that loss production in kind of the wetter months here. But again, we do expect that to start going back up next year, and we'll give more fulsome and clear guidance on harvest levels when we report for Q4. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then, just on the lumber and OSB markets, as you look out over the next 12 to 18 months outside of new residential construction activity and repair and remodel demand levels, what are you thinking about in terms of key factors determining the direction of the markets? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. You mentioned 2 of the big ones; what's going to happen with residential construction? What's going to happen from a repair and remodel standpoint? We're pretty bullish on both of those fronts. I think some other things that come into play, obviously, to the extent that we continue to see supply chain disruptions, that can impact the availability of wood into the market, which, obviously, can have an impact on pricing. Labor availability, I would put in that mix to the extent that the industry can't find enough labor to run the middle expo, that can have an impact on overall supply and that can impact the market. I do think there are a few things that are also coming into play to some extent, one of which is depending on what happens with the infrastructure bill that I think could drive some incremental demand for wood, both from a lumber standpoint, plywood, OSB, etc. to the extent that that ultimately gets passed. And then just we do continue to see more and more momentum around wood-based building, tall buildings, mass timber CLT, etc. So that could be another tailwind as well. So overall, I think we have a pretty optimistic view of what things are going to look like in the Wood Products market over the next couple of years. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. Makes sense. And then just my last one on the southern log export business with tree costs and pricing where they are, how do the economics compare? I guess, to keeping those logs in the domestic market? Devin Stockfish : Well, we've seen a pretty dramatic run-up in pricing on the export side. and even when you take into consideration the increased transportation costs to get those logs to market, it still represents a pretty decent premium over what we would get in the domestic market, so it's advantageous for us to move as much as we can into the export market. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. Well, I appreciate all the color, and good luck here in Q4. Devin Stockfish : Terrific. Thanks. Well, I believe that was our final question, so thank you to everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Andy Taylor : Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s Fourth Quarter 2021 Earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during the conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $2.6 billion or $3.47 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full year 2021 earnings totaled $2.5 billion or $3.37 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA was a record $4.1 billion, more than 86% increase over full year 2020. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $416 million, or $0.55 per diluted share on net sales of $2.2 billion. Excluding a total after-tax benefit of $49 million for special items, we earned $367 million or $0.49 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $674 million. I'll start this morning by thanking our employees for an exceptional year. Through their collective efforts, Weyerhaeuser delivered its strongest financial performance on record. Each of our businesses executed remarkably well. The team has maintained a safety focus and continue to serve our customers, all while navigating persistent operational and market challenges. I'm extremely proud of our accomplishments in 2021, which further positioned the company to drive superior long-term value for our shareholders. Notable 2021 highlights include delivering record adjusted EBITDA from our Wood Products business of $3.4 billion, a 120% increase over 2020, capturing more than $70 million of company-wide operational excellence improvements, optimizing our timberlands holdings through strategic transactions in Alabama and Washington, launching our Natural Climate Solutions business with a growth target to achieve $100 million of annual EBITDA by year-end 2025, publishing the company's inaugural peer-leading carbon record, establishing a leadership position amongst our North American peers in setting a science-based greenhouse gas reduction target, strengthening our balance sheet by paying down an additional $375 million of debt and increasing our share repurchase authorization to $1 billion. In addition, as highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slide, we generated more than $2.6 billion of adjusted FAD in 2021, further demonstrating the strong cash generation capability of our unmatched portfolio of assets and industry-leading operating performance. Based on our 2021 results, we announced this morning that our Board of Directors has declared a supplemental cash dividend of $1.45 per share payable on February 28 to holders of record on February 18. This supplemental dividend represents the final installment of our cash return to shareholders based on 2021 results. When combined with our 2021 quarterly base dividends of $0.68 per share and the one-time interim supplemental dividend of $0.50 per share that was paid in October, we are returning a total of $2.63 per share of dividends to shareholders based on 2021 results, which equates to a 75% of 2021 adjusted FAD. Including the $100 million of shares repurchased in 2021, Weyerhaeuser is returning more than $2 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2021 results or 79% of 2021 adjusted FAD, which is at the upper end of our commitment of returning 75% to 80% of FAD on an annual basis. Moving forward in 2022, we remain committed to returning a significant amount of cash to shareholders. This will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend which, as previously announced, we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025. As outlined in our cash return framework on Page 18, we will supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash, as appropriate, to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80%. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase.  We continue to believe this flexible and sustainable cash return framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to our shareholders across a variety of market conditions. Turning now to our fourth quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands, on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $110 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $11 million compared to the third quarter. For the full year, Timberlands' adjusted EBITDA increased by 14% compared to 2020. These strong results were delivered despite persistent weather, transportation and pandemic-related challenges in 2021, and I would like to specifically recognize our Western Timberlands team for their exceptional work managing through the salvage operations resulting from the 2020 Oregon fires. As of year-end, we've completed substantially all of the planned salvage harvest. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the third quarter. Western domestic log market showed signs of improvement at the outset of the fourth quarter following a brief softening in demand in September. As the fourth quarter progressed, log demand further improved as mills sought to capitalize on rapidly increasing lumber prices. While log supply in the Western system was sufficient as the quarter began, it became constrained later in the quarter, particularly in Oregon, as a result of supply chain disruptions and adverse weather conditions. Despite this dynamic, our fee harvest volumes increased slightly compared to the third quarter. With lower log inventories and limited regional log supply as the quarter progressed, we increased the volume of our fee logs to our internal mills, resulting in modestly lower third-party domestic sales volumes compared to the third quarter. This is a great example of how we leverage our integrated business model to effectively navigate and capitalize on temporary market disruptions. Our average sales realizations in the West were comparable to the third quarter but increased each month and ended the year at their highest levels of 2021. Per unit log and haul costs decreased in the fourth quarter, as did forestry and road costs. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the fourth quarter as persistent global supply chain disruptions, a shortage of shipping containers and strengthening U.S. domestic lumber markets reduced the availability of imported lumber into Japan. This dynamic continued to drive solid demand for locally produced Japanese lumber and for our imported logs to support that domestic production. As a result, our Japanese log realizations in the fourth quarter increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Sales volumes were modestly lower due to timing of vessels. In China, end-market demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter, despite lower-than-expected overall Chinese consumption and elevated log inventories at the ports. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be impacted by global shipping container availability and the ban on Australian logs. As a result, our sales volumes to China increased significantly compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for our China export logs decreased slightly and ocean freight rates improved during the quarter. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million compared to the third quarter. Southern saw log and fiber markets continued to strengthen in the fourth quarter despite ample log supply resulting from dryer weather conditions. Mill inventories returned to normal levels in most geographies during the quarter, but log demand remained strong across the south as mills sought to capitalize on rising lumber and panel pricing and focused on bolstering log inventories heading into the first quarter. As a result of these dynamics, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the third quarter and fee harvest volumes were modestly higher. Per unit log and haul costs increased slightly in the quarter, primarily for transportation costs. Turning now to Southern export, which remains a small component of our overall operations. During the fourth quarter, Chinese regulators implemented new rules for imported pine logs to address potential phytosanitary concerns. These regulations imposed additional costs and administrative requirements. As a result, we paused our Southern pine log exports to China. And consequently, our export log volumes to China decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. In response, we redirected logs to domestic mills and significantly increased our export log volumes to India in the fourth quarter. We are optimistic that this headwind for pine exports to China will be transitory and still maintain a constructive, longer-term outlook for our Southern export business. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $2 million compared to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were significantly higher, resulting from favorable weather conditions and robust log demand as mills built inventory. Sales realizations increased slightly primarily for hardwood logs. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. Real estate and ENR contributed $36 million to fourth quarter earnings and $49 million to adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter EBITDA was $11 million lower than the third quarter due to the timing of transactions. Similar to 2020, our real estate activity in 2021 was heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. For the full year, the segment generated $296 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than a revised full year guidance and 23% higher than 2020. Despite a year-over-year reduction in acre sold, full year earnings increased by 144% compared to 2020 due to the mix of property sold. And average sales price is increased by more than $2,000 per acre, a 120% increase. These results underscore the strength of the HBU market in 2021, the quality of our properties and our team\u2019s ability to capitalize on these strong markets to deliver significant premiums to timber values. Now I\u2019ll make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business, which we launched in 2021. As shown on Page 22, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business increased by 73% compared to 2020, driven primarily by growth from existing businesses in our portfolio, including mitigation and conservation, as well as renewable energy. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our Forest Carbon pilot project in Maine and we continue to look to seek approval in 2022. We\u2019re also advancing discussions with high quality developers of solar, wind and carbon capture and storage projects across our ownership. We continue to see multi-year growth potential from these businesses and maintain our target of reaching $100 million of annual EBITDA by the end of 2025. Moving to Wood Products, Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $466 million to fourth quarter earnings before special items and $517 million to adjusted EBITDA. Our EWP business established a new quarterly adjusted EBITDA record in the quarter, surpassing the prior record established just last quarter by 50%. For the full year, our lumber OSB and EWP businesses established new annual EBITDA records and our distribution business generated the highest annual adjusted EBITDA in over 15 years. This is all notwithstanding ongoing challenges resulting from supply chain, transportation, weather, and pandemic related disruptions. This is truly exceptional performance and I\u2019m extremely proud of the resiliency, flexibility and determination exhibited by our teams as a navigated multiple headwinds in 2021. In the fourth quarter, demand remained unseasonably strong across our Wood Products businesses, driven by continued strength in new residential home building and repair and remodel activity, as well as favorable weather conditions for construction for the majority of the quarter. Starting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber prices entered the quarter on an upward trajectory driven by strong home building and repair and remodel demand. In contrast, OSB markets remained fairly balanced for the first two months of the quarter, resulting in relatively flat composite pricing. Both lumber and OSB pricing increased at a rapid pace starting in December as supply was disrupted by a myriad of factors, including major flooding in British Columbia that disrupted transportation and supply chain networks across Western Canada; labor challenges exacerbated by the Omicron variant, which impacted industry-wide mill operations, log supply and transportation carriers; and significant weather events that further impacted transportation and log supply in the Northwest and Canada in December. Channel inventories of both lumber and OSB ended the year in a lean position with continued strong demand. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business increased by $77 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 15% in the fourth quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing increased by 40%. This relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lagged surging lumber prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions. Our sales volumes decreased significantly in the fourth quarter, resulting from weather-related transportation challenges in Canada and lower inventory drawdown compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were modestly lower and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher, resulting from weather-related events in the Northwest and Canada, including one week of downtime at our Princeton mill following the flooding event in British Columbia. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $168 million compared to the third quarter. Despite a rapid increase in pricing in December, our average sales realizations decreased by 29% in the fourth quarter, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. Similar to lumber, this relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lagged surging OSB prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions. Our sales volumes decreased slightly compared to the third quarter, resulting from weather-related transportation challenges in Canada. Production volumes and unit manufacturing costs improved in the quarter due to less downtime for planned maintenance. Fiber costs were moderately higher in the quarter. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $38 million compared to the third quarter, a 50% improvement. Raw material costs were significantly lower, primarily for OSB web stock. Sales realizations improved for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously [Technical Difficulty] price increases for solid section and I-joists. Sales and production volumes were lower for most products as a result of planned annual maintenance during the quarter and the impacts of COVID-related staffing shortages. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $18 million compared to the third quarter, an 82% improvement as the business captured improved margins, primarily for lumber and OSB, partially offset by seasonally lower sales volumes. I\u2019d like to now turn to operational excellence. In 2021, our teams captured more than $70 million of margin improvements, meeting our $50 million to $75 million target, while also making meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities, including with respect to future value creation, cost avoidance, driving efficiencies and cross business synergies throughout the company. This was a remarkable accomplishment when considering the numerous challenges facing our business in 2021. Once again, our people demonstrated unwavering focus and exceptional teamwork to deliver innovative and creative solutions to overcome obstacles and drive OpEx across the company. In addition, I\u2019m pleased with how well our employees continue to drive cross-business OpEx that improved margins in both Timberlands and Wood Products. These efforts optimized internal log deliveries to Weyerhaeuser mills to maximize value and avoid out-of-log downtime. And our teams worked together across our businesses to ensure that we maximize the recovery value from our salvage operations in Oregon. As we look forward to the future, we\u2019re targeting another $175 million to $250 million of OpEx improvements across our businesses between 2022 and 2025. And I look forward to sharing more about our key initiatives and results in the years ahead. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items in our first quarter and 2022 outlook. Nancy Loewe : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2022 outlook. I\u2019ll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $494 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to approximately $3.2 billion, our highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we\u2019re returning over $2 billion to shareholders based on 2021 results, which includes $100 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $74 million at an average price of $37.60. This leaves us with approximately $926 million of the remaining capacity as of year-end 2021 under the $1 billion program we announced in the third quarter. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which nearly $1.1 billion is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced this morning that will be paid in February. We ended the year with total gross debt of $5.1 billion. At the beginning of the fourth quarter, we repaid our $150 million 9% note at maturity, and we have no additional maturities until 2023. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Fourth quarter unallocated adjusted EBITDA decreased by $24 million compared to the third quarter. This decline was primarily attributable to higher than expected health care expenses, partially due to pandemic-related deferrals of non-essential medical treatment from 2020 into 2021. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2022 are presented now on Pages 20 and 21. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. Beginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log demand continues to be favorable as mills capitalize on strong lumber pricing. We anticipate this dynamic continuing for most of the first quarter. As a result, our average domestic sales realizations are expected to be significantly higher than the fourth quarter. As Devin discussed, we have substantially completed our salvage harvest operations in Oregon. In addition, we have made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower cost harvest operations. As a result, we expect our first quarter fee harvest volumes will be significantly higher than the fourth quarter with lower per unit log and haul costs and seasonally lower forestry and road costs. Moving to the export markets. In Japan log demand remains favorable, and we anticipate our first quarter sales realizations will be moderately higher than the fourth quarter with comparable sales volumes. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports demand for our logs is expected to remain favorable in the first quarter as imports of lumber and logs from other markets continued to be constrained. We expect our first quarter sales volumes to be comparable to the fourth quarter, partially offset by slightly lower sales realizations. In the South, despite log inventories near target levels, log demand continues to be strong as mills position to benefit from strong lumber and panel pricing and build inventory to avoid potential disruption from wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter. We anticipate comparable sales realizations and seasonally lower forestry and road costs. This is expected to be offset by slightly higher per unit log and haul costs and slightly lower fee harvest volumes due to seasonal wet weather patterns. In the North, sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter due to mix with slightly lower fee harvest volumes resulting from a seasonal reduction in harvest activity. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For the full year 2022, we expect total company fee harvest volume to increase to approximately 34.5 million tons. In the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be slightly higher than 2021 as salvage harvest operations in Oregon are substantially complete. We expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels in 2021, resulting from persistent adverse weather conditions. Similar to 2021, we expect our Northern harvest volumes will be moderately lower year-over-year due to softening fiber markets in New England. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remained strong and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. We expect full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment. Similar to 2021, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2021 due to an increase in real estate acres sold. For our Wood Product segment demand remains favourable supported by strong new residential home building and repair and remodel activity. As Devin mentioned, channel inventory started the year in a lean position and supply continues to be constrained by persistent transportation, supply chain and COVID related labor challenges. This dynamic is expected to continue for most of the first quarter and has driven lumber and OSB benchmark pricing to unseasonably high levels quarter-to-date. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the fourth quarter. For lumber, we expect improved production volumes and unit manufacturing costs in the first quarter with slightly lower sales volumes resulting from ongoing transportation disruptions. Log costs are expected to be moderately higher than the fourth quarter, primarily for Western logs. For oriented strand board, we anticipate improve production volumes in the first quarter, driven by less planned maintenance and modestly higher sales volumes. We expect this will be partially offset by moderately higher fiber costs. As shown on Page 23, our current and quarter-to-date sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board are both significantly higher than the fourth quarter average. For engineered wood products, we expect comparable sales realizations to the fourth quarter and sales and production volumes will be higher resulting from less planned maintenance in the first quarter. For our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to moderately lower sales volume. So I\u2019ll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 21. Our full year 2021 interest expense was $313 million. Due to the additional debt reduction during 2021, we anticipate interest expense will be $305 million for the full year 2022. Turning to taxes. Our full year 2021 effective tax rate was 21.5% excluding special items driven by the higher percentage of total income coming from our taxable REIT subsidiary. For first and full year 2022, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 19% and 23% before special items and based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid a net $609 million for full year 2021, which included a $95 million tax refund received in the fourth quarter, which was associated with our 2018 voluntary pension contribution. Excluding this tax refund, our cash taxes were in line with our tax expense. Our 2021 cash taxes were slightly higher than our prior guidance due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2022 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense. For pension and post-employment plans, the year end 2021 funded status improved by nearly $500 million as a result of favorable asset returns and higher discount rates compared to year end 2020. Discount rates increased by approximately 40 basis points for the U.S. plans and approximately 60 basis points for the Canadian plans. Our non-cash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense was $19 million in 2021. We expect to record approximately $60 million of expense in 2022. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2021 was $59 million. In 2022, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $30 million. Turning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2021 capital expenditures totalled $441 million, which was slightly below our guidance due to supply chain and contract labor constraints experienced during the fourth quarter. We expect total capital expenditures for 2022 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $320 million for wood products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Great. Thanks, Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I\u2019ll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. U.S. housing activity continued at a strong pace in the fourth quarter. The total housing starts averaging more than 1.6 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis. And total permits averaging more than 1.7 million units. For the full year, total housing starts were nearly 1.6 million units representing a 16% increase over 2020 and the highest annual level since 2006. These increased levels of housing activity are notable considering the persistent supply chain and labor challenges that home builders faced in 2021. Notwithstanding the recent uptick in mortgage rates and ongoing affordability concerns, both our near-term and longer-term housing outlook remain optimistic and is supported by encouraging housing demand fundamentals, including favorable demographics, a decade of underbuilding and historically low inventory for new and existing homes. Turning now to repair and remodel activity, which strengthened in the fourth quarter. Demand continued to be strong bolstered by large professional R&R projects, which remained healthy for most of 2021 and a resurgence of smaller do-it-yourself activity following a period of temporary weakness in the summer months. As we entered 2022, our out outlook for repair and remodel activity continues to be positive with demand supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity and healthy household balance sheets. In closing, our 2021 financial performance was among the best in our company\u2019s history, and I\u2019m incredibly proud of our employees and their efforts to achieve these outstanding results. Additionally in 2021, we continued to drive improvements across each of the value levers of our investment thesis. We made great progress on upgrading our portfolio, improving our operating performance, building on our ESG leadership and demonstrating a commitment to disciplined capital allocation. Looking forward, we\u2019ve announced a series of multi-year targets that will drive additional growth and deliver superior value for our shareholders. With our unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance, strong balance sheet and supportive macro tailwinds, we\u2019re well positioned to capitalize unfavorable demand fundamentals generate strong cash flows, grow our company and return significant amounts of cash to shareholders. And now I\u2019d like to open the floor for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi. Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the details and congratulations on the year. Congratulations on everything that you\u2019re doing with OpEx, it\u2019s amazing what the company has done over the last number of years on that front. Devin Stockfish : We appreciate it. George Staphos : So quick questions. First, in the South, could you give us a bit more color in terms of the outlook for timber this year and what you\u2019re seeing in the first quarter? I would have expected maybe a bit more positive outlook for 1Q, given obviously where lumber prices are, what you\u2019ve discussed in the past that wood capacity going into the market. Any thoughts there would be great. Second question, what is \u2013 what are you seeing in terms of the near supply? And how are you set up relative to engineered wood? And what are the sort of commercial opportunities you see in EWP for maybe further realization improvement over this year? And then I had one follow-up, time allowing. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, let\u2019s start with the Southern markets. Just as we think back to what happened in 2021, obviously, we did see some pricing improvement for Southern logs. That\u2019s both with respect to pulp logs and sawlogs. I think several drivers behind the pricing improvement that we\u2019ve seen lately. First, obviously, on the supply side, some of that price improvement was driven by the persistent wet weather that we saw across many regions in the South. I think, certainly, that reduced the flow of logs to the system, tension the market to some extent. I think COVID, transportation, other supply chain issues had some effect on log availability as well which, I think, pushed up pricing a bit. But then on the demand side, we did have very strong wood products markets across the South and that supported healthy log demand. Mill certainly didn\u2019t want to run out of logs and miss out the opportunity to capture the benefits of higher lumber and OSB prices. And then lastly, and you alluded to this, just the continued pace of new capacity coming online in the South, I think, certainly has helped tension the market in certain wood baskets. But in any event, demand was strong, pricing improved, and we certainly do anticipate that to continue to be the case in the first quarter. Really across the South inventory levels right now, I\u2019d say range from normal to even a bit lean, depending on geography. Customers are going to want to protect inventory levels to make sure that they\u2019re fully wooded to avoid out-of-log downtime in these stronger wood products markets. I do think we continue to see some challenges for logging and trucking availability in certain geographies. And so that can have some tensioning effect, particularly if we see additional weather. So look, for the balance of the year, we\u2019re expecting solid demand for logs across the South, perhaps not as much pricing appreciation as we saw last year. Some of that, I think, was driven by weather. Certainly, there\u2019s still plenty of regions where there\u2019s excess inventory in the forest. But as we\u2019ve been saying for a number of years, with each year that we have more capacity coming into the region, which we\u2019ve certainly had plenty of that over the last several years, we continue to see that continuing into the future. That tensions things up wood basket by wood basket. So we\u2019re optimistic about the trajectory in the South, and we think we\u2019ll have a solid year this year in 2022. Moving to your second question around veneer supply, that\u2019s certainly a challenge. That is one of the constraints for EWP production. That\u2019s a Weyerhaeuser statement for sure, but I think it\u2019s a broader industry statement. And that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re really focused on, both with our internal veneer supply. We have some veneer manufacturing within our EWP business. And certainly, as we partner to source veneer for our EWP products, I think that\u2019s an area that we\u2019re seeing very, very strong demand. Our order files are quite extended from an EWP standpoint. And so we\u2019re doing everything we can to make sure that we\u2019re meeting customer needs. In terms of the pricing environment, we obviously did raise prices a number of times for EWP products last year. As of now, we\u2019ve substantially captured all of those price improvements. And so a strong environment in terms of the pricing for the remainder of the year, not in a position today to talk about any sort of price increases, we\u2019ll continue to monitor the market in that respect. But overall, very strong market for EWP right now. George Staphos : All right, Devin. Thanks for that. I\u2019ll turn it over and if there\u2019s time, I\u2019ll come in the queue. Thanks, Devin. Thanks, Nancy. Devin Stockfish : Great. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : We\u2019ve seen a fairly sharp jump in mortgage rates this month and maybe a view on the more hawkish Fed. And obviously, this is just a few weeks, but have you seen any impact to customer discussions or maybe even order patterns or activity? And then just maybe from a bigger picture perspective, is there anything you could say about how you\u2019d expect the business to perform kind of longer-term in a rising rate environment, given timber obviously has a role as an inflation hedge, but you obviously have exposure to housing. Just kind of how you think about that and how it\u2019s worked historically. Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. No, that\u2019s a great question. I think with respect to the rising interest rates, certainly, I think there is some angst among many about what rising mortgage rates are going to do to housing demand. And I think that\u2019s a fair thing to give consideration to. I can tell you, as of today, we are not hearing any sort of change in tone from our homebuilder customers. I think from where we sit, and this is based both on our own internal view, but also the conversations that we have with folks, really across our customer universe, we\u2019re still sitting at a place where we\u2019re relatively low in terms of mortgage rates by any historical context. I think even if we assume that mortgage rates are going to go up over the next 12 to 24 months, which we do think that they will, we still have a ways to go, I think, between where we are today and where you\u2019re going to see a material amount of demand drop off from a mortgage rate standpoint. And I think it\u2019s also important just to remember the context of what we\u2019ve got going on in the market right now, and we\u2019ve talked about this before, but just the underbuilding that we\u2019ve done in the U.S. over the last decade has left a real shortfall for housing. And we think about the demographic trends with millennials coming into the market, and you\u2019ve certainly seen some data to support that. I think the price increases that we\u2019ve seen, that\u2019s largely a function of there just not being enough housing supply for the demand out there. And so from our standpoint, we\u2019re certainly looking to a strong year of housing in 2022. Our customers, when we go out and talk to the homebuilders, they\u2019re telling us that they\u2019re expecting a good strong year. We\u2019re certainly starting off from a good spot when you think about the homebuilder confidence levels, when you think about the home sales numbers that we just saw, the number of sold not yet started, there\u2019s a big backlog there. So notwithstanding, obviously there can be some headwinds at times with housing, whether it\u2019s product availability, labor demand or rising mortgage rates, but I think the demand levels out there is just very strong and should support, I think a strong homebuilding year in 2022. As we think about interest rates and inflation, there are puts and takes there. Obviously, as you see, inflation, that\u2019s an issue that we have to deal with in our business, and we\u2019re very focused on that. A big part of our OpEx program is trying to make sure that we\u2019re very focused on cost. I think that will serve us well if we\u2019re in an inflationary environment. But again, as you mentioned, historically, timber has been a pretty good inflation hedge. And so there are puts and takes there. I do think from an interest rate standpoint, how you value timber and discount rates, generally speaking people take a pretty long-term view. So we\u2019re not seeing any sort of big impact from higher interest rates in terms of timber valuations. So notwithstanding that it does create some challenges here and there, on balance, I think we\u2019ll manage it pretty well. And again, we\u2019re looking forward to a strong 2020 even in a slightly higher inflationary environment and with interest rates rising somewhat. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just maybe a very quick follow-up on Timberlands. You talked about pausing, I think, Southern pine log exports to China given maybe some regulatory changes there. And you talked about that headwind potentially lifting. I was wondering if you could \u2013 is there any sort of time line? Or if you can talk about what causes that pause or that headwind to lift. And are there any sort of costs associated with that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Yes, sure. And so really, just it relates to a new rule that the Chinese government put into place. There was a nematode issue that was discovered on some exports into China, not Weyerhaeuser exports. But that was a new rule set they put in place. And it adds administrative burden, some additional costs around fumigation and channeling into different ports. And so it\u2019s relatively new. At this point, it doesn\u2019t make a lot of sense for us to continue to export in to China out of our Southern business in the near-term. Ultimately, our view is China needs fiber supply. The U.S. South is a wood basket that\u2019s healthy and can support that over time, particularly as you think about the Russian log ban, the Australian log ban, some of the challenges over time I think with the European supply going down as they work through their beetle issue. I think net-net, China is going to need fiber supply. And so our hope is that as these rules kind of get figured out over time, some of those burdens in sourcing wood from pine regions into China will ease a little bit and we\u2019ll resume our activity. But as I noted, in the meantime, we\u2019ve got a very active program going on into India that we\u2019re continuing to look to grow, Vietnam, Pakistan and Turkey. So we\u2019re going to continue to look to grow our export business regardless of what happens in China. And we do think that, ultimately, we\u2019ll be back in that market, and that will just be another increment to support our growth of the export program. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone and congratulations on a great quarter and year. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is just trying to get a little bit more details on the operational backdrop and the outlook as it relates to your forecast. Can you talk a little bit about supply chain and COVID-related disruptions that you are seeing or sort of expect that you could see in the near-term? And then does your outlook sort of assume any level of improvement related to some of those disruptions? And how should we be thinking about the labor force and your ability to sort of ramp up there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, I'll start with what we saw in Q4 and what we're seeing so far in Q1 around transportation and COVID. Candidly, it's been a challenging environment. Starting with transportation, we've had some challenges as an industry with transportation as most other industries are also having challenges. Trucker availability is very, very tight, I'm sure you've heard about that numerous times. When we get into the winter months, particularly up in Canada, with some of the cold weather and weather events, the rail becomes pretty challenging. And so when you think about just the overall transportation infrastructure right now, it's pretty tight and it's pretty challenging. And so we've done, I think, a reasonably good job of navigating that, but it's nevertheless a tough situation to get product moved. I don't necessarily anticipate that getting dramatically better here in the very near-term. Now hopefully, as the weather improves and Omicron starts to trend down, maybe we'll get a little bit better. But transportation has been a challenge even before the last few quarters. I'd say on Omicron, we, like pretty much every other company, have been struggling through just keeping our mills and our operations staffed with the high levels of COVID outbreaks with Omicron. We haven't lost a significant number of shifts, but it certainly has impacted our operations. And in many respects, it's prevented us from running extra shifts where we otherwise might have done so. I do think we're either at or starting to come down off of the peak. As we look at daily quarantine levels, it does look like we're starting to see that break a little bit. So we're optimistic that over the next several weeks, we'll really start to get past this wave of COVID. And hopefully, that will ease things up a bit. I don't know on balance, as we think about the overall supply chain, other than Omicron getting better. Labor availability being tight, I don't see that really easing here in the near-term, hopefully as the year progresses, but certainly not in the first half. And I'd say similarly with transportation, I'm not sure we see that getting dramatically better in the first half of this year. We are hopeful that over time, as more people return to the workforce, that some of these will start to ease, but it doesn't feel like a first-half-of-the-year issue for us. Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. I hear you. That's helpful. And then my second question is kind of focusing a little bit more on the DIY and the consumer. As we think about the move up in commodity prices that we've seen sort of post Labor Day, can you talk a little bit about how you're thinking about that market's ability to continue to absorb that level of inflation? Now when you go back to last summer, you think about the fact that, that was sort of the piece that really kind of drove the relative supply-demand dynamics and the impact of pricing that had. So as we do go into the spring here, can you talk a little bit about what you're hearing in terms of the home improvement retailers, inventories in that channel and the order rates that you're seeing there as we do go into the busier season? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. Well, I'll start with the second half of your question and then get specifically to the DIY segment. In terms of what we are seeing today from repair and remodel, the pro segment has been strong, really across 2021, you didn't really see the dip like you saw in the DIY segment. And that's certainly the case as we head into Q1, we're seeing good takeaway, good demand from big box as well as just the R&R segment generally. And so feeling pretty good about where that is, particularly for this time of year. I think you asked a great question with respect to the DIY segment as you see pricing trend up. No question, I think last year, as we got into the summertime, and you saw $1,000 lumber prices were in the news every day, no question, that caused a pullback in the DIY segment. Now how much of that was just coming out of a COVID wave, where it was the first time people could go out and really go to concerts, movies, ball games as opposed to do repair and remodel, some of that's a little hard to tell. But I think certainly, just the level of press that we saw around high lumber prices probably caused some people to pause on those smaller do-it-yourself projects. Now whether we see that same demand impact now that we're back up in that range, we're not seeing it yet, but I think that's an open question whether you'll see a little bit of a tick down. Now the flip side of that may be people may ultimately become more accustomed to $1,000 lumber prices. I can tell you, just in terms of the level of press coverage that you're seeing from $1,000 lumber prices today versus last summer, it's a little less. So maybe people become a little bit more accustomed, but that's something we'll certainly be watching closely. But again, as we think about where we are in the year with pricing where they are, we've got long order files, inventories across the channel are moderate to lean for lumber, and I'd say pretty darn lean for OSB and EWP, heading into the building season, it does feel like it's a pretty good setup for market dynamics. Susan Maklari : Okay, I appreciate all that color. Thank you and good luck. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you, Devin, congrats on a very good year. You just mentioned order files being long. Could you give us more specificity in terms of how long they are, in lumber and OSB for you? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sure. Well, thanks, Mark. So when we talk about lumber, that's bumping up against three-week order files, which for us is on the long end of where we typically would see those. On OSB, we're out three to five weeks, which again is pretty much on the outside of where we like that to be. You didn't ask about EWP, EWP is essentially on allocation through the second quarter. So pretty long order files for this time of year. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thank you. Question for you on demand on lumber, in particular, if we look \u2013 actually structural panels as well. If we look at industry data last year, it looked like apparent consumption for structural panel is up about 5%. If you look for lumber, I guess I've only seen it through October, but it was up 3.5% or so, quite a bit lower than what housing starts were up, which more in the order of 15%, a little less than that, single family, but close to it. Do you have a perspective as to what might be driving that variance, be it \u2013 is it reductions in inventory channel? Is it economizing on the use of lumber and/or OSB? Is it the fluctuations in repair, remodel? Or is it something else? Devin Stockfish : Yes, there's probably a little bit of all of that in there, Mark. But I also think, on some level, there are houses that are started, that have not been completed. And so there's probably a little bit of gap there that will catch up over time as well. If I had to say what I think the biggest driver is, I think that's probably it. But there's a little bit of the other items you mentioned as well. Mark Weintraub : Okay. That's helpful. And then lastly, kind of a similar type of question, and maybe it's trying to quantify the comments you were making on COVID and supply chain and how that's impacting production for you and also for the industry in general. I mean, interestingly enough, again, and maybe the data we get is not fully accurate, but it suggests that production of lumber in the U.S. South, actually it was only up like 1.6%, at least through the first 10 months of the year, which seems surprising given the level of demand and given the capacity. Do you think that there's \u2013 is there the capability for there to be a significant ramp in production? And obviously, that has implications for lumber markets, but also has implications potentially for your timber sales in the South. So any thoughts on that, please? Devin Stockfish : Yes. There's no question that COVID and supply chain disruptions impacted overall production in the South. We saw that. Obviously, we sell logs to a number of customers, and we saw that in terms of our customer base. We also saw that in our own operations just in terms of an inability to get people for extra shifts for a good portion of the year because we had people out with quarantine. But it also, I think, even goes beyond the mill, and it goes to some of the labor shortage issues that you have to staff mills, higher turnover levels, the ability to get trucks and transportation, even, I think, in some geographies, the ability to get logging contractors. And so all of those things together, I think is the reason why you saw that production volume increase being so minimal over the course of last year. I'm not sure I see anything that's going to be dramatically different here in the near-term, even as we get through Omicron, which will certainly help. There's a real challenge in finding labor, and that's across the system. It's not just our industry, but our industry is certainly affected, finding truck drivers, logging contractors finding employees to work in the mills, really across the supply chain. I think that makes it challenging to really dramatically ramp up that production. Mark Weintraub : Great, I appreciate your insights. Nancy Loewe : Mark, I'll just add that for the fourth quarter, to help quantify it, there was probably about a $25 million impact in the quarter from those COVID-related issues and supply chain disruptions. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. And that presumably includes Canada as well? Devin Stockfish : Correct. Nancy Loewe : Yes. Mark Weintraub : Great, thanks a lot. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wilde : Thanks. Good morning, Devin. Good morning, Nancy. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Mark. Mark Wilde : I wanted to just follow on Mark Weintraub's question. Do you think it's fair to say that approximately 60% to 65% of your first quarter shipment volume has been sold at this point? Just kind of taking what you said about the order book. Devin Stockfish : Yes, I don't have the specific percentage number right off the top of my head, Mark, so I don't want to misquote that, and we can certainly follow up. But there's no question, as we think about those extended order files, that's certainly pushing out a pretty healthy percentage of our Q1 volume that's been sold and not shipped. Mark Wilde : Yes. Okay. And then to the question we were just talking about, the impact of COVID, and not only on just people being out, but on increased labor turnover, has that had a material effect, do you think, on just productivity across your operations? Devin Stockfish : Yes. There\u2019s no question that\u2019s had an impact. As you think about running a sawmill, running an OSB mill, as you have higher levels of turnover, that impacts just the expertise running the equipment. It impacts reliability. It impacts safety. All of the things that make you a top-notch producer, when you have higher levels of turnover with new folks, all of those things become more difficult. And so that\u2019s been something that we\u2019ve really been working on and making sure that we institutionalize a lot of the OpEx, innovation, reliability things so that we make it easier for people to get up to speed quicker. But it does have an impact, there\u2019s no question. Mark Wilde : Yes. And just more broadly, we did have some nice improvement in kind of Southern log prices in 2021. Do you think we\u2019re beginning to see a sustained recovery in the region? Or do you view this as more cyclical than kind of a trend structural pickup in Southern log markets, particularly for sawlogs? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think if you think about the South as a whole, I do think some of it was driven by weather events, some of it was driven by the COVID labor, all those challenges. That had an impact, there\u2019s no question. Now there also is, no question, there are certain geographies where you\u2019re seeing that new capacity tensioning things up. So Arkansas, North Central Louisiana, North Carolina. I mean there are spots where we\u2019ve seen the mills come in, ramp up to full production where you see a tighter wood basket. And so that\u2019s also having an impact. We still have several billion board feet of new capacity that\u2019s been announced, that\u2019s not up and running yet. And I think we\u2019ll continue to see, as those new mills come in, get up and running, get to full production that will continue to have an upward impact on pricing. But the question is, do we think that we\u2019ve hit the point now where Southern sawlog recovery across the South has happened. I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be the case. But we do think that we\u2019re on the right path that we\u2019ll continue to see improvements, albeit slower in some areas than others. But the trajectory is right. But I do want to \u2013 I don\u2019t want to leave anyone with the impression that 2021 was all just new capacity. Some of that was weather. Some of it was supply chain disruption. Mark Wilde : Yes. All right. I think that\u2019s fair. And finally, can you just give us any color on the perspective solar project in the South, whether this is a land sale or this is a long-term lease, which it sounds like is more common in other people\u2019s discussions. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So if you\u2019re referring to the Apex deal that we just announced, that\u2019s really the relationship that is going to cover a number of different potential projects over the time. And it\u2019s a continuation of an existing relationship. So we\u2019ve done other work with Apex. Now assuming that all of the projects that we\u2019ve got under this agreement move from the exploration stage to final development, the number of acres is going to vary depending on project, physical characteristics. But we would retain the fee ownership. You would get milestone payments as the projects move through various stages of development. And then once it\u2019s operational, you\u2019d have an annual lease payment for each acre in the footprint. So again, we keep the fee, we have the timber economics and then we get paid on lease payment over time. Mark Wilde : Okay. All right. Sounds good. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thanks, Mark. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question, please. Paul Quinn : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning. Yes, I note, as others have that lumber production was up less than 1% in 2021. Just wondering if we\u2019re still on track for a 5% gain in 2022 as per your Investor Day. And then on that CapEx budget of $320 million in Wood Products, besides the Holden Louisiana project, any other major CapEx projects on the lumber side? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So with respect to your first question, yes, we\u2019re still on track for the 5% a year. Year-to-year, that may vary by a little bit, but that is the trajectory, still on track for that, feeling good about the momentum we\u2019ve got within our CapEx and our organic growth programs. In terms of the big projects, really, Holden, obviously, big project, it\u2019s on track. The rest of it is really just a series of capital projects, nothing of the Holden magnitude. But each of our mills, as we\u2019ve said before, has a multi-year road map. And so it\u2019s debottlenecking, it\u2019s driving improved reliability and it really cuts across all of the different machine centers, merchandisers, sorter stackers, planers, CDKs. Really each mill has capital projects that really just take away the constraints to let us grow volume. So nothing big to call out other than Holden. Largely, these are all projects that are being replicated, that we\u2019ve already done in some other mill, which is why we have such a high level of confidence in the organic growth story. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just on the OSB side, shipments were down 8.5% in 2021 here. So I just wondered if 2022 we can expect to get closer to the 3 billion square foot capacity. Devin Stockfish : Yes, that\u2019s a safe assumption. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just maybe just squeaking the last one. Just on capacity, as in 2022 overall industry, it\u2019s looking like about $2.75 billion word fee, which is about 4%. What kind of pricing impact? Or do you think that\u2019s really going to impact the market in this year? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Just a couple of observations I\u2019d offer there. First of all, there\u2019s a lot of announced capacity that we have coming on over the next few years. We certainly think people are going to continue to invest in the U.S. South. It\u2019s a great place to make lumber. But that being said, a few things to keep in mind. Number one, and we\u2019ve certainly seen this to some extent, the time line for some of those projects may get extended. To the extent you\u2019re not already in the queue for equipment, we\u2019ve seen the time line for getting equipment pushed out a bit, the labor to install some of this equipment pushed out a bit. So not clear to me all of that actually will come to fruition in 2021. The other thing I would say, over a multi-year period, to keep in mind, I know you\u2019re all very well familiar with this, some of that new capacity that\u2019s coming in, in the South is going to ultimately be offset by capacity coming out of other regions, British Columbia, in particular. And so net-net across North America, I\u2019m not sure all of that is going to really come to pass in 2022. But even if it does, as we think about \u2013 and our view is we are going to see year-over-year growth in residential construction, we think we\u2019re going to see maybe low single-digit growth in repair and remodel. So the market as a whole, we feel pretty good about the demand signal. So even as we do see some of that new capacity being added on, we\u2019re going to need that really to keep overall the North American market in balance. So I think the capacity that we see coming online shouldn\u2019t have a material impact overall other than just to keep things balanced. Paul Quinn : Thanks, Devin. Best of luck. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great, thanks. And good morning, everyone. Just wanted to start off on Western log realizations, is there any way to maybe bucket how much of the kind of price improvement that\u2019s anticipated in Q1 is kind of underlying price improvement versus maybe some mix benefits as you move fully past the salvage harvest? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, just a quick \u2013 a couple of comments on Western markets. Generally, we have seen really strong demand in the Western system. That\u2019s a comment both on domestic demand as well as export demand. Sitting here end of January, I\u2019d say log inventories are generally at or slightly below normal levels. And so we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the dynamic that we\u2019ve got going on in the West. Most of the realization improvement, there\u2019s a little bit of mix, but most of it is really just driven off strong levels of demand and balancing that against the available supply. And as you think about, just to kind of dimension that for you, as you think about the quarter-over-quarter EBITDA guidance, we talked about being up significantly, most of that is in the West. And we\u2019re thinking probably in that $30 million to $40 million range in terms of kind of how that should look in the first quarter. So really setting up to have a strong quarter in the West. Kurt Yinger : All right. All right. That\u2019s helpful. And then just my second on Timberlands M&A, I mean, it seems like there\u2019s been a nice general uplift in deal activity. But curious what you\u2019re seeing in terms of return profiles relative to your own kind of near-term cash yield targets? Devin Stockfish : Yes, there\u2019s no question there has been an uptick in activity on Timberlands M&A. I think last year, we probably came in somewhere in the $3.5 billion range in terms of total transactions. That\u2019s our estimate for where we\u2019re going to come in again as an industry in 2022. So definitely a pickup. I think the big differences that we\u2019ve noticed is people are being a little bit more aggressive with their underwriting and discount rates for, I would call it, maybe more challenged properties. The underwriting for the high-quality properties, that\u2019s always been competitive. That never really changed and that continues today. So for us, as we think about our return profiles, you got to be disciplined. For us, as we think about it, when we look at deals, and we look at a lot of deals, we bid on a smaller number, just making sure that we think it\u2019s going to meet our return profile. We do have some advantages. I think some of the analytics tools that Russell and his team are developing are helpful in that respect. The scale, the operational synergies, some of the other things that we can bring to the table, as we mentioned on our Investor Day, can help us boost our returns maybe a little bit more. But again, it\u2019s always been a competitive market for high-quality property and we anticipate that remaining the case. And so you just have to be very smart about how you do timberland deals. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. Well, appreciate the color and good luck here in the New Year. Devin Stockfish : All right. Terrific. Well, I think that was our final question. So just want to thank everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Director of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation to GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Nancy Loewe, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $771 million or $1.03 per diluted share on net sales of $3.1 billion. Excluding special items relating to our debt refinancing actions, we earned $978 million or $1.31 per diluted share. Our employees once again delivered phenomenal operational and financial results in the quarter, notwithstanding, persistent supply chain, transportation and pandemic related disruptions. Their collective efforts helped the company achieve its strongest first quarter adjusted EBITDA on record at $1.5 billion. This represents a 122% increase over the fourth quarter of 2021. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on pages six through nine of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $182 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $71 million, compared to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by 77%, compared to the fourth quarter. Western domestic log markets were favorable through the first quarter, driven by strong demand as mills sought to capitalize on unseasonably high lumber prices. As a result, our domestic sales realizations were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter. Overall log supply in the Western system was plentiful during the quarter due to favorable weather conditions as well as increased volumes from other landowners in response to strong log pricing. This drove log inventories at the mills to above target levels by the end of the quarter, particularly in Oregon. Our fee harvest volumes were significantly higher compared to the fourth quarter and per unit log and haul costs were lower as we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower in the quarter. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the first quarter. High North American lumber prices combined with global logistics challenges, particularly with respect to port congestion and shipping container shortages continue to limit the availability of imported lumber into Japan. These dynamics are driving strong demand for our customers locally produced lumber in Japan and increased demand for our imported logs. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations in the first quarter increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter. Sales volumes were slightly lower due to the timing of vessels. The Russia-Ukraine conflict did not have a material impact on our log export business into Japan during the first quarter. However, we do ultimately expect a reduction in Russian and European wood supply into Japan as a result of the conflict, which will likely bolster demand for our log exports into the Japanese market over time. In China, log inventories at the ports have remained elevated coming out of the Lunar New Year and we're seeing lower takeaway as a result of ongoing pandemic-related disruptions in the country. Notwithstanding these headwinds, end-market demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter due largely to supply disruptions into China. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be impacted by global logistical challenges, port congestion, and restrictions on imported Australian logs. Imports were further constrained in the first quarter as Russia commenced its previously announced ban on log exports. And later in the quarter, European log supply was also disrupted by the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, our sales realizations for China export logs increased slightly in the quarter. Our sales volumes to China, however, decreased significantly as we intentionally shifted volume to the domestic market to support our domestic customers and capitalize on strong Western log prices. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the fourth quarter. Notwithstanding ample log supply and improving log inventories as the quarter progressed, Southern sawlog markets remained favorable in the first quarter as mills sought to benefit from the strong lumber and panel pricing environment. Fiber markets were also favorable as mills bolstered inventories from the lean levels experienced at the outset of the quarter. As a result, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes in forestry and road costs were seasonally lower in the first quarter and per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher, primarily for fuel-related transportation costs. Regarding our Southern export business, our log exports to China remain temporarily paused as a result of recently adopted and fairly restrictive rules implemented by Chinese regulators to address potential phytosanitary concerns on imported pine logs. In response, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills and the India export market during the first quarter. We continue to maintain a constructive longer term outlook for our Southern export business to China and other Asian markets. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million compared to the fourth quarter due to improved sales realizations across all products. Fee harvest volumes were seasonally lower in the first quarter. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $81 million to first quarter earnings and $116 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $67 million higher than the fourth quarter due to the timing of real estate transactions. Similar to the last few years, our real estate activities in 2022 are more heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold, but remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to benefit from strong demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Now, for a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. In March, we announced an agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures to pursue our first carbon capture and storage project. This partnership combines more than 30,000 acres of Weyerhaeuser's uniquely positioned subsurface ownership in Louisiana with Oxy's proven technical expertise in the management and sequestration of carbon dioxide. It will take several years to bring this project into production, and we expect that will come online in 2025 or 2026. This project represents an important milestone in our previously announced plan to grow our Natural Climate Solutions business. We expect to announce additional carbon capture and storage agreements as we continue to advance discussions with high quality developers on portions of our Southern US acreage. Moving now to Wood Products on pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $1.2 billion to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA increased by $716 million, compared to the fourth quarter, a 138% improvement. This represents the second highest quarterly adjusted EBITDA on record for our Wood Products business. These are exceptional results considering the ongoing transportation and supply chain headwinds faced by our teams in the first quarter. I want to specifically recognize our supply chain and logistics teams for their continued focus and resolve while navigating these challenges. Starting with lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the quarter on an upward trajectory as demand for homebuilding and repair and remodel remained favorable and supply constraints persisted due to supply, transportation and labor-related challenges in addition to winter weather disruptions. This dynamic continued for most of the quarter, driving lumber and OSB prices once again to near record high levels. Demand softened somewhat late in the quarter as many buyers paused to assess downside risk with elevated price levels and to evaluate the potential impacts of rising mortgage rates on the housing market. Lower than expected takeaway from home centers also impacted demand to some extent in the quarter. Despite generally lean inventories heading into the spring building season, buyers remained cautious through the end of the quarter, with the reluctance to build meaningful inventory in a dynamic pricing environment. As a result, lumber and OSB prices peaked and started on a downward trajectory in March. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business increased by $453 million, compared to the fourth quarter, a 232% improvement. Our average sales realizations increased by 76% in the first quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing increased by 81%. Production volumes increased moderately, resulting from less planned downtime and weather related downtime. Sales volumes were slightly lower, driven by ongoing transportation challenges. This dynamic resulted in an expansion of inventory levels during the quarter. Log costs were significantly higher, primarily for Western logs. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business increased by $216 million, compared to the fourth quarter, a 123% improvement. Our average sales realizations increased by 61% in the first quarter while the OSB composite pricing increased by 94%. This relative difference was largely a result of extended order files that lag surging OSB prices and shipping delays due to transportation disruptions primarily in Canada. Our production volumes improved slightly in the first quarter, resulting from less downtime for planned maintenance. As a result, sales volumes increased moderately compared to the fourth quarter, notwithstanding, significant transportation headwinds in Canada in January and February. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher in the quarter and fiber costs were significantly higher. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $22 million compared to the fourth quarter, surpassing last quarter's record by 19%.  Sales realizations improved in the first quarter and we benefited from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joist products. This was partially offset by moderately higher raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock and resin. Production volumes were moderately lower for solid section and I-joist products driven in large part by tight veneer supply and pandemic-related staffing challenges early in the quarter. As a result, sales volumes were comparable to the fourth quarter. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, an 80% improvement, as the business experienced strong demand and captured improved margins across all products. Before turning the call over to Nancy, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands business. Earlier this month, we announced an agreement to acquire approximately 81,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in North and South Carolina for approximately $265 million. This is a unique opportunity to enhance our portfolio with highly productive and well-managed timberlands, which are located in some of the best coastal markets in the US South and strategically positioned to deliver operational synergies with our existing timber and mill footprint.  This acquisition offers extremely attractive timberland attributes and is expected to deliver portfolio leading cash flow and harvest tons per acre within our Southern Timberlands business. Additionally, we expect to capture incremental benefits from real estate and natural climate solutions opportunities overtime. The transaction is expected to close later in the quarter and represents an exciting milestone in our multiyear strategy to grow the value of our Timberland portfolio through disciplined investments. So with that I'll turn the call over to Nancy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. Nancy Loewe : Thank you, Devin and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance, before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $957 million of cash from operations in the first quarter, this is an increase of over $460 million from the fourth quarter and is our highest first quarter operating cash flow on record. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of $5.1 billion. At the end of February, we initiated a series of transactions to further enhance our strong financial position by effectively refinancing $900 million of debt. This included the issuance of $450 million of notes due in 2033, with 3.375% coupon and $450 million of notes due in 2052 with a 4% coupon.  The net proceeds plus cash on hand were then used to close cash tender offers for $931 million of principal on notes with considerably higher rates. We incurred a net after-tax charge of $207 million related to premiums and unamortized debt issuance cost and debt discount, in connection with the early debt repayments, which is included in our first quarter -- results as a special item. These actions enabled us to capitalize on favorable interest rates prior to the most recent increase by the Fed, resulting in a meaningful reduction in the weighted average coupon in our debt portfolio, while also smoothing and extending the weighted average maturity. Overall, our annualized interest savings will be approximately $38 million. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $70 million, which is typical in the first quarter. We returned $121 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $37.87. And as of quarter end, we had approximately $800 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. We also returned $134 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.9% to $0.18 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. Adjusted FAD for the first quarter totaled $850 million, as highlighted on Page 18. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $31 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decline was primarily attributable to a $59 million non-cash charge for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO in the first quarter due to the elevated levels of high-value inventory. As seasonal inventory levels are reduced in the second quarter, we do expect to record a non-cash benefit for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the first quarter but still higher than any other quarter since the fourth quarter of 2018. Turning to the Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand softened somewhat at the outset of the second quarter in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced takeaway of finished products as lumber prices retreated from historically high levels. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be lower in the second quarter, but still substantially higher than any quarter in 2021. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to increase. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the first quarter. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong as imported lumber continues to be restricted by global shipping challenges and more recently, in response to wood flow disruptions, resulting from the conflict between Russia and Ukraine. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes are expected to increase significantly compared to the first quarter. We anticipate our second quarter sales realizations to be comparable to the strong levels experienced in the first quarter. In China, despite elevated log inventories at the ports, demand for our logs remains favorable as imports of lumber and logs from other countries continue to be constrained. As a result, our sales realizations on log imports into China are expected to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes to be significantly lower, as we continue to flex logs to our domestic customers to capture the highest margin. In the South, despite the pullback in lumber and OSB pricing at the outset of the quarter and a seasonal increase of log supply, log demand remains stable as mills maintain elevated inventories to mitigate risk from ongoing transportation challenges. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher, as seasonal weather patterns transition to drier conditions. Similar to the West, forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and we anticipate moderately higher per unit log and haul costs. In the North, due to product mix, sales realizations are expected to be significantly higher than the first quarter, while fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets remained strong, heading into the second quarter and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect net earnings will be comparable to an adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the second quarter of 2021. We expect an increase in acres sold and a higher basis year-over-year due to the mix of properties we anticipate to sell. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be higher than the first quarter, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Demand for our products remain favorable, heading into the spring building season, supported by strong new residential construction and professional repair and remodel activity. As Devin mentioned, supply continues to be constrained by transportation challenges and inventories through the channel remain lean. Despite these dynamics, benchmark pricing for lumber and oriented strand board entered the second quarter on a rapid downward trajectory, as buyers continue to assess downside risk of elevated price levels and we're reluctant to build inventories in this dynamic pricing environment. By late April, benchmark pricing for both products stabilized as buyers took steps to replenish inventories to prepare for the spring building season. As shown on page 20, for lumber, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are significantly lower than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current realizations are comparable and quarter-to-date realizations remain higher than the first quarter average due to the length of our order files. For our lumber business, we expect improved production volumes and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs in the second quarter. Sales volumes are expected to improve significantly, with increased production, as well as higher seasonal inventory drawdown. We anticipate moderately lower log costs compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western logs. For our OSB business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes compared to the first quarter, resulting from higher production volumes and improving transportation networks, primarily in Canada. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly lower and fiber costs are expected to be comparable. For our engineered wood products business, as we continue to capture the benefit of price increases announced in February, we expect higher sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products. We anticipate this will be completely offset by significantly lower sales realization for our plywood products. Our sales and production volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the second quarter as veneer supply continues to improve. We anticipate this will be partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs primarily for OSB web stock. And for our distribution business, we're expecting adjusted EBITDA to be significantly lower than the first quarter primarily due to reduced commodity margins. And with that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks Nancy. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. First quarter housing starts averaged 1.75 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, an improvement of 5% over the fourth quarter. Activity dipped slightly in January, driven by winter weather and pandemic-related labor challenges, but improved as the quarter progressed. March housing starts totaled nearly 1.8 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, the highest monthly level since 2006. Housing permits in the first quarter averaged nearly 1.9 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, surpassing last quarter by 7% and surging to its highest quarterly average since before the Great Recession. Although these results demonstrate strong underlying demand for new home construction, the cycle time between starts and completions continues to be extended as homebuilders face ongoing supply chain disruptions, labor availability challenges, and rising material costs. Additionally, we do expect increasing mortgage rates and higher inflation to have some impact on the housing market. However, notwithstanding these headwinds, our customers continue to see strong demand and remain optimistic for new home construction in 2022. And we remain constructive on near-term and longer term housing demand fundamentals given favorable demographic trends, a significantly underbuilt housing stock, a strong labor market, and elevated household balance sheets. Turning to repair and remodel. We continue to see favorable activity from large professional projects in the first quarter, representing a continuation of the strong demand signal we saw from this segment in 2021. Demand from the Do-It-Yourself segment softened modestly in the first quarter, largely driven by concerns over the return of near record high lumber prices. Overall, our long-term outlook for repair and remodel continues to be favorable, supported by an aging housing stock, rising home equity, and historically low supply of new and existing homes for sale. In closing, we delivered our strongest first quarter financial performance on record and I'm incredibly proud of our employees for their continued dedication and resilience. We continue to make meaningful progress towards the multiyear growth targets we announced at our Investor Day last September and remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading performance across our operations. Our balance sheet is strong and with $850 million of adjusted FAD generated in the first quarter, 2022 is off to a great start. We believe the company is well-positioned to deliver considerable long-term value and superior returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone, and congrats on a great quarter. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Thank you. Susan Maklari : Yeah. My first question is, obviously, there's a lot of puts and takes and moving parts when you think about housing and the lumber and OSB markets that are out there. Appreciating a lot of that commentary that you gave around some of those shifts in terms of demand and different sort of dynamics in the quarter. But I guess think about the builders and the backlog that they're seeing and even the continued sales paces that have been coming through April, how do you think about the potential to see some of this inventory starting to reverse itself as they try and get through those backlogs? And what that could possibly mean for pricing as we go through the summer and maybe even into the early parts of the fall? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. No, great question, Susan. I think, first of all, I'll just say trying to predict pricing for lumber and OSB is always difficult. But a few thoughts, I think, just to kind of put it in perspective. We've certainly seen some volatility from a pricing standpoint for both lumber and OSB over the last six, nine months. We saw the run-up over the first quarter, and then it came back down a fair bit as we got through the end of March into April seems to have stabilized here over the last couple of weeks. As we think about what's going to happen over the next several months, a few things, I think, drive our thinking. First of all, I do think that the inventory levels across the channel are pretty lean. And I think that's just largely a function of people being nervous about carrying inventory at the higher price levels. So heading into the spring building season, I think inventories are lower than you would normally expect for this time of year. And that's both with respect to lumber and OSB. I would say with the one exception that maybe the inventories at mills in Canada are probably at/or slightly above normal levels just because of some transportation issues. But again, across the system, inventory levels are pretty low. So on the supply side, I think we're going to get into the months where you're going to see production picking up, transportation should start to improve a little bit in Canada with the rail. But I think the demand side is going to continue to be strong. We certainly are seeing good strong demand from our homebuilder customers as they head into the spring building season. We can talk more about housing in general. But from our standpoint, we're expecting a good strong spring building season from a residential construction standpoint. On the repair and remodel side, the pro segment continues to go really, really well, a lot of demand out of that segment. And I think the do-it-yourself segment, even though we did see a little bit of a dip in the first quarter, that seems to be stabilizing as well as we get into the spring time period. So net-net, we're feeling pretty good about the spring and would expect the pricing environment to stay pretty strong. Susan Maklari : Yeah. Okay. I appreciate all that, Devin. I know there's a lot there and we'll see how it all comes together. But I appreciate the commentary. My follow-up question is it's exciting to hear the arrangement that you announced with Oxy in the quarter as we think about the carbon opportunities that are out there. Can you kind of talk a little bit more about that potential opportunity? And maybe how we should be thinking about some other announcements that could be coming down the line as you continue to invest in that? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yeah, we're really excited about it. Obviously, this is our first carbon capture and storage agreement that we've announced. I think we've picked a really good partner with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures, which is a subsidiary of Occidental Petroleum. And this is really an opportunity to combine the unique position that we are in with so much acreage, subsurface rights and good geologic information and partner with a firm that has a lot of experience, technical expertise in the management and sequestration of CO2. So really excited about the project. It is going to take a few years to get everything put together. You've got permitting, you've got infrastructure buildouts, etcetera. But we think this is going to come online somewhere in the 2025, 2026 timeframe.  We're not providing the economics behind the deal right now. But really, we'll start to see the real economics flow once it goes online and we're putting CO2 into the ground. But really excited about it. We're in active negotiations and discussions with a number of other partners throughout our southern ownership. So, we'd expect to be announcing some additional agreements over the next 12 to 18 months. Susan Maklari : Great. That's exceptionally helpful. I'm going to sneak one more in, which is just it was good to see you buying back some stock in the quarter. Obviously, it sounds like things are remaining supportive as we think about the balance of this year. Can you talk about just your appetite to maybe continue within the repurchase activity there? How we should be thinking about the opportunities for cash? Nancy Loewe : Yes. Susan, I'll take that. As we've said in the past, we do think that share repurchase is a good tool for returning capital to shareholders under the right circumstances. And specifically, that's when we see it's the best option for shareholder value creation. We did actually purchase $121 million as you saw in Q1, and we'll continue to look at share repurchase opportunistically and that's why we increased the repurchase authorization to $1 billion. We wanted to have more flexibility that was flexibility on price, but also on the ability to move quickly when we do see the opportunity. So, we'll continue to be assessing the share repurchase along with all the other options we have on capital allocation. And as we do every quarter, we'll report out our share repurchase activity each quarter. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you very much for that and good luck with everything. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi everyone. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Congratulations on the progress and also the well-timed refinancing activity. I had three questions. I'll ask them one, two, three, just to make it efficient for you. So first off, on inventories, Devin, you had mentioned some elevated log inventories in Oregon. What effect do you think that might have in the market, if anything at all? And are you seeing any signs that the Canadian inventory is finding its way into the market? Secondly, could you maybe piggyback on Susan's question, can you talk to us about the prospects for accelerating the supplemental dividend if, in fact, that's where we're at by the end of the year, obviously, lots can change. And doing one earlier as opposed to what has been your plan, which is to have it payable in the first quarter following the year? And then lastly, can you update us on where you stand in terms of getting project audits done and credits issued with the carbon sequestration credit project up in May? Thanks guys. And good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Thanks. Maybe I'll take the question on inventories and carbon and Nancy can cover the supplemental dividend question. With respect to inventories, we did see some elevated log inventories in Oregon. So, all things considered, I would expect that to put a little bit of pressure on pricing in the log market and the Pacific Northwest and that's reflected in our guidance.  But I think the overall story in the Northwest is still pretty strong. We've got good lumber prices. And so the mills are running full out. I think we're going to have some good export activity to Japan. So we're still expecting a very strong market in the Pacific Northwest. Just a little bit of a headwind down in Oregon as mills work through some of that inventory. With respect to the inventory at Canadian mills, I can speak with respect to our mills, obviously, not so much with respect to our competitors. For us, we're seeing those come down over the course of Q2. We are seeing some slight improvements in rail in Canada. And so that's certainly going to be helpful as we work that through. So I expect those to come down over the course of the second quarter as we progress into the deeper spring. With respect to the carbon project up in Maine, it's coming along on plan. So as we mentioned last year, we listed that project on a voluntary market. We're in the process of third-party validation. So that's going well so far, and we would expect that to continue and be in a position to have the credits actually issued later this year. And then we'll look to monetize those when the price is right for carbon. Nancy Loewe : Yes. And George, I'll take the interim dividend. So in terms of the interim dividend we paid last year, that was a one-time exception to our new dividend framework. We\u2019ve always anticipated that the supplemental dividend is going to be paid out annually in Q1 for the prior fiscal year and again, the primary reason for that, as you know, is to make sure we're ensuring we're matching our variable dividend component to the cash flow we're actually generating, so we've got to kind of wait until we see through the whole year, so we don\u2019t anticipate an interim dividend this year. George Staphos : Fair enough. Makes sense. Good luck and I\u2019ll now turn it over. Thanks, guys. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Obviously, we're seeing amazing lumber, OSB pricing. I think we've seen a lot of evidence now of pensioning in the wood baskets in the West when we see strength. In the South, how -- are you beginning to see in any of your basket where drain is catching up to growth? And how far away do you think we are from potentially a real inflection point for pricing and profitability in the South? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, Mark, I think the answer is it's really dependent on the specific wood basket, right? And so it's very regional in terms of the supply-demand dynamic within each individual wood basket. No question, there are some areas that, with all the new capacity coming online, you're getting back to a more balanced dynamic. You can look across spots on the Atlantic Coast, North Carolina, I think is a good example. There are some micro markets in Mississippi, Arkansas, North Central Louisiana. So there are spots where you're seeing that happen. I do think still on balance, though, when you look across the South as a whole, it's still more heavily weighted to being oversupplied. And so that's just -- as we've said, it's a long process, and it's going in the right direction. And I think we've seen some of that over the last 12 to 18 months when you look at Southern sawlog prices, and we expect that trend to continue. But I do think there are a number of spots where you still have a ways to go. So I would say it's just going to continue to be slow, steady improvement over time. But in the interim, we're really focused on generating value even at existing prices. And so, we'll be positioned through our execution, our ownership to participate as that continues to improve over time. Mark Weintraub : And I do appreciate you've been really consistent on this, and it's maybe not a fair question. But do you have a perspective on how long it might be, as this new supply comes on in the South, to when it's kind of a more broad-based balancing and tightening? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, I think, it's going to happen over a number of years. I mean, we've seen a lot of new capacity coming into the US South. I think the number I saw last, from 2017 through all the stuff that's been announced since coming online over the next year or two, you're talking 9 billion to 10 billion board feet of additional capacity that's coming into the system. So we'll see some of that coming on later this year. I think importantly, we're most important -- most importantly for us is just, where that capacity comes online, and we've certainly seen a number of mills coming into wood baskets where we have a lot of fee ownership. So I think it will happen over a number of years and some spots will improve faster than others, but we certainly see the trend heading in the right direction. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Appreciate the perspective. Mark Weintraub : Yes. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning. Just maybe start on the timberland acquisition from Campbell Global. The price was reported at $3,300 an acre, which is pretty high relative to just about everything I've seen out there. Just wondering how big that HBU component is? Can you give us some color there, so we can sort of understand that side of it? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So just maybe a few comments here to put it in perspective. This 81,000 acres of timberlands, really some of the best, highest quality timberland that's come to market in quite some time. It's really good stocking levels, mature age class, high percentage grade mix, high percentage planted pine acreage. So really very, very high-quality market -- or timberlands come into market. So that's -- really for us, that's how we underwrote this deal, was really from a timber standpoint and the $13 million a year of EBITDA that we're talking about over the next 10 years. That's really what we use to underwrite the deal, was just really the timber piece. So the HBU, we always find HBU opportunities when we do these kinds of transactions, and I suspect that will be the case with this transaction as well. Similar with some of the natural climate solutions opportunities there, sole or mitigation banking, we think there's some opportunities there as well. But we didn't underwrite this deal just based on HBU. It was really based off of the timber portfolio that's on the land base. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then, maybe just, you referenced, you expect log volumes to increase into Japan due to the Russian conflict. So Q1 looked pretty high. Just wondering how high Q2 is? And then secondarily, Europe shipped about 1.65 billion board feet of lumber into North America last year. How much do you think that is going to drop in 2022 as a result of the conflict? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So a couple of things there. For us, as we think about the impacts from Russia, Ukraine, we obviously don't do any direct business in either of those markets. But you noted two of the potential impacted markets for us. And it's really -- when we think about the three different geographies, Japan is number one and we've talked about this before. Our customers compete with European glue lam going into the Japan market. And we've seen -- even as we've gone into Q2, we've seen that volume dial back a little bit, which is an opportunity for our customers that are processing our Pacific Northwest [indiscernible] logs to pick up market share. And so we're going to do everything we can to support our customers as they try to build market share. So, I think there will be some opportunities to bolster our sales into Japan as a result of that. And we're certainly looking to do that in Q2. You noted the second potential impacted geography, which is North America and I think as we see the Europeans essentially ban Russian wood coming into Europe, the European market is going to have to keep more of that fiber lumber in that domestic market to satisfy their needs, which should result in a reduction of European supply coming into the US market. I don't -- I still think with the pricing environment that we have in the US, you are going to see some level of European lumber imports into the US, which I will note, just as an aside, is still a relatively small amount as we think about the overall market. But we'll see some reduction in that European volume coming into the US. The other market where we could be impacted is China. Obviously, we do have a business into China exporting logs. I would expect the Russians to send more wood into China as other markets have been closed off. So that will be a little bit of a mixed bag, a little bit more Russian wood coming into China, probably a little less European wood going into that market. I expect that's going to be kind of a net neutral for us, but could be bumpy here for a bit. Paul Quinn : All right. That\u2019s all I had. Best of luck guys. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wilde : Good morning Devin, good morning Nancy. Devin Stockfish : Good morning Mark. Mark Wilde : I just want to come back on Paul's question around the North Carolina, South Carolina acquisition. I think that you pointed to harvest volumes in the first few years in the sort of sic and a half to seven tons per acre per year, which is quite high relative to what I think most of us use for kind of sustain harvest. Can you give us some perspective on where that level is versus what you would expect on a trend basis? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I mean, so if you look at our Southern ownership as a whole, it's well south of that. So, you're usually looking kind of in the three and a half to four tons per acre from a harvest standpoint. So, this is quite a bit higher and that's really just a reflection of a couple of things. First of all, very high grade mix, particularly over the first decade or so, which drives a lot of that and a mature age class. And so we're just going to see a lot more opportunity to monetize just given the age class and stocking levels that we have on this ownership. Mark Wilde : So, is there any way to kind of take that and just think about sort of if $13 million a year is sort of coming out of the chute, your level of EBITDA of the land, what kind of more of a normalized trend would be? Devin Stockfish : You're talking in kind of the second and third decades? Mark Wilde : Yes. Yes, I'm just trying to think about it. I mean, you're clearly, you're getting some benefit in the early years because of the maturity of the lands. And I'm just trying to think about sort of what type of yield it implies on a more normalized basis? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, without trying to get into predicting decades out in this, what I'd say more -- we're feeling really good about the cash flow profile over the first 10 years. I mean, that will obviously go down over time, and it will, I think, go more in line with our historical trends across the southern ownership as a whole. But the other thing I would note about that when we talk about that EBITDA, that's really just focused on our existing Timberlands business, and it really does not reflect I think as Paul alluded to, HBU opportunities and other natural climate solutions opportunities, which we do think will be incremental to that over time. Mark Wilde : Okay. The second question I have is around the lumber business. And just when I look at the data for last year, kind of, striking that Southern lumber capacity was up 900 million board feet yet production was only up about 140 million. So you would think in the context of the highest prices ever that actually like operating rates would have gone up, but operating rent actually went down 400 basis points. I'm just trying to get your sense of what went on there? Was that like COVID related labor issues? And how much of a bounce back might we see in 2022? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I think it's primarily related to COVID disruptions. It's very difficult when you're in the midst of a pandemic to have sufficient labor to pick up shifts when things go wrong. I mean in a normal environment, you're going to have weather issues. You're going to have maintenance issues. You're going to have all the things that happen in a lumber mill. But you ordinarily have the opportunity to run a few extra shifts, whether it's a Saturday or a little over time to get that kind of back up to where you need it to be. That's really been challenging in the environment that we've been over the last, call it, 12 to 18 months. And I would say now, just given the fact that labor availability is so tight across the economy as a whole, even as you've come out of COVID, where you're not still facing the same level of issues with quarantines, it's just still hard to get people. And so I'd say, generally speaking, we're in an environment where there's just not enough labor to pick up those extra shifts. And when you have new people at a mill, the other thing that maybe sometimes people forget is the folks that run the equipment at a mill are very skilled and knowledgeable, and they -- having people that have been there and know what they're doing really drives the efficiency and productivity in a mill. And so when you have higher turnover or you're having labor challenges and getting people in roles, that has an impact as well. So I think it's really -- it's COVID and its labor market are the two things that are driving that. Mark Wilde : Yeah. And just from a Weyerhaeuser perspective, do you expect any kind of full year improvement just year-over-year in terms of your production capability, production volumes? Devin Stockfish : We do, and that's really a couple of things. One, on the lumber side, obviously, that's part of our organic growth strategy. So that will continue to progress on pace. And I would expect our production to be up year-over-year from a lumber standpoint. And even OSB and EWP, assuming that on the EWP side, we can continue to find sufficient veneer, I would expect that to be at/or slightly above last year as well. Mark Wilde : Okay. Just if I can slip one other one in here on EWP. You've got a really great franchise there, Devin. And it's a product area that is growing. So can you just talk with us about any kind of potential investment opportunities to continue to grow that franchise? Devin Stockfish : Yeah. I mean, we really do. The Trust Choice franchise is a great product. It has a lot of value in the market, both because of the quality of the product, but also the team in place to help support our customers. So, you're absolutely right. It's a great product. We are looking for opportunities to grow that organically through our capital programs. That's really where we're focused right now. But I do think as a product EWP as a product is an area where we've got a unique skillset and a really key part to play in the market for growing that. So, we're looking at that, nothing specific to announce today, Mark, but I think you're exactly right. That's an opportunity for us overtime. Mark Wilde : Okay. Sounds good. I will turn it over. Thanks Devin. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Can you talk a little bit more about kind of the current market for good quality industrial timberlands in the South? And maybe specifically what you're seeing in terms of prices in the market, maybe appreciation compared to pre-pandemic period, maybe level of sort of institutional interest you're seeing in timberlands. And I guess timber has historically been talked about as sort of a good inflation hedge. We're obviously seeing record inflation? How do you see that hedge playing out? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, there's no question. There has been a lot of interest in timberland over the last 12, 24 months. We're seeing a lot of parties at the table for all of the deals that come to market. So, a lot of interest, I think, both from your traditional buyers, the REITs, the TMOs, the private integrated companies. But we're also seeing some new entrants into this market in terms of some of the capital that's being raised around carbon and ESG. So it is -- it's a space where we're seeing a lot of interest. I think you've seen that reflected in some of the deal values of late.  And so, we are seeing the overall buying community value timberlands, maybe at a higher level than they have even just over the last few years. So we're certainly seeing that. To what extent is that people coming in, based on timber being an inflation hedge, a little hard to say. I mean historically, I think that has been true that timber inflation hedge. And so certainly, we continue to believe that that's true overtime. And as you say, this is a period where that will likely be tested given what's going on with inflation. But to your main question, absolutely, there's a lot of interest in Southern Timberlands \u2013 Western Timberlands for that matter as well. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then maybe just staying with Timberlands. I mean you made a couple of acquisitions last year, in Oregon and Alabama. But you also, I think, divested close to 300,000 acres. Should we be surprised to see you pursue kind of strategic divestitures in tandem with like acquisitions like in the Carolinas. And do you see kind of a decent pipeline of these kind of, I guess, 50,000 to 100,000 type acre pickups like Oregon, Alabama and now the Carolinas. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I'd say Oregon was a unique opportunity to really do two deals together. But I think if you just step back and look at all of the divestitures and acquisitions that we've done over the last several years, it really goes to our main strategy of optimizing and growing the value of our timber portfolio. So, we have done a number of sizable divestitures over the last several years.  I think to some extent in the West and in the South, we've largely taken care of the big opportunities. And so we're going to continue to look here and there to optimize. So you may see us sell smaller acreage here and there. But overall, I think we're certainly in more of a growth mode at this point given kind of where we position the portfolio over the last several years In terms of the pipeline, there's -- we've started off the year pretty strong. I think there's about $1.5 billion of acquisitions that have happened thus far this year. We'll see how the pipeline develops over the next several months. Our best guess here sitting here in April, probably in the neighborhood of $3 billion to $3.5 billion of acquisitions is what we're expecting for the year. So we're active. We look at all the deals that come to market, but we're also talking to people all the time about trying to create deals as well. So we'll continue to be active in this space and continue to look for opportunities to grow the value of our portfolio in a disciplined way. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Okay. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning. We appreciate your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speaker\u2019s remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today, I'm very pleased to welcome David Wold to the call. David became our Chief Financial Officer in May. He previously served as our Chief Accounting Officer and brings 20 years of significant accounting, financial and strategic acumen to the CFO role. He's demonstrated outstanding leadership since joining Weyerhaeuser in 2013, and I'm excited to have Dave on our senior leadership team and to partner with them as we execute on our long-term strategy. This morning, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $788 million or $1.06 per diluted share on net sales of $3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.2 billion in the second quarter. We delivered strong results across each of our businesses, and I'd like to thank our teams for their exceptional work and continued focus as we continue to navigate dynamic market conditions. Through their collective efforts, we've generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $2.7 billion, our strongest first half EBITDA results on record. Turning now to our second quarter business results, I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $153 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $219 million, a decrease of $28 million from the prior quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $21 million compared to the first quarter. Western domestic log market softened slightly in the second quarter as mill inventories recovered at the outset of the quarter and lumber prices declined considerably from elevated levels earlier in the year. As a result, our second quarter domestic log sales realizations were moderately lower compared to the first quarter, but remained high relative to historical pricing levels. While log supply in the Western system was ample at the outset of the quarter, it became constrained by unseasonably wet weather as the quarter progressed, which drove mill inventories to below target levels by quarter end, particularly in Oregon. These adverse weather conditions resulted in a moderate reduction in our fee harvest volumes compared to the first quarter. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher, and per unit log and haul costs increased significantly in the second quarter as we transition into higher elevation logging units. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs remained strong in the second quarter. Lumber imports from Europe into Japan continue to be restricted by ongoing global shipping challenges for most of the quarter. This dynamic continued to drive increased market share for our customers and robust demand for our logs. As a result, our Japanese sales realizations were moderately higher compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly, resulting from strong demand and timing of ships. In China, log inventories at the ports declined slightly in the second quarter, resulting from improved takeaway as pandemic-related lockdowns started to ease. Imports of lumber and logs into China continue to be limited by global logistical challenges and port congestion. Additionally, log supply into China continues to be impacted by restrictions on Australian logs, Russia's recent ban of log exports to China and disruptions of European wood flow resulting from the Russia-Ukraine conflict. As a result, demand for our Western logs remained favorable in the quarter, and our sales realizations for China export logs increased moderately. Our sales volumes to China, however, decreased significantly as we continue to intentionally shift volume to the domestic market to support our domestic customers and capitalize on favorable margin opportunities. Moving to the South, Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA decreased by $5 million compared to the first quarter. Notwithstanding weakening lumber and OSB pricing and a seasonal increase in log supply. Southern sawlog markets remained favorable during the second quarter as mills maintained elevated inventories to mitigate risks from ongoing transportation challenges. Fiber markets experienced a similar dynamic. As a result, our sales realizations increased slightly compared to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher as seasonal weather patterns transitioned to drier conditions. Forestry and road costs were seasonably higher and per unit log and haul costs increased significantly, primarily for fuel-related costs. Turning to our Southern export business. Our log exports to China remain temporarily paused due to the new phytosanitary regulations on pine logs put in place last year by Chinese regulators. We remain optimistic that this headwind for pine exports to China will be transitory and still maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to that market. In the meantime, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills in the U.S. South and look to grow our India export market. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions, partially offset by significantly higher sales realizations for most products. Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11, real estate and ENR contributed $65 million to second quarter earnings and $107 million to adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $9 million lower than the first quarter, primarily due to the timing and mix of properties sold, but was $16 million higher than a year ago quarter. Notwithstanding the recent macroeconomic headwinds, we continue to capitalize on favorable demand for HBU properties, as buyers seek the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Now for a brief comment on Natural Climate Solutions. Following our announced agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures in March for our first carbon capture and storage project in Louisiana, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers as this market continues to emerge. Additionally, we continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and are working towards project approval by year-end. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $863 million to second quarter earnings and $912 of adjusted EBITDA. Compared to the first quarter, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $321 million as lumber and OSB prices declined considerably from elevated levels earlier in the year, THESE are outstanding results considering the ongoing supply chain headwinds faced by our teams in the second quarter. Starting with the lumber and OSB markets, benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the second quarter on a downward trajectory as demand for homebuilding and repair and remodel soften and buyers remain lean inventories given uncertainty in the markets. Despite lean inventories throughout the channel, sentiment was cautious as buyers assess downside risk of elevated price levels and were reluctant to build inventories in a dynamic pricing environment. By late April, benchmark pricing for both products stabilized as buyers took steps to replenish inventories to prepare for the spring building season and in response to strong April housing starts data. This dynamic continued through mid-May, at which point, buyer sentiment once again turned cautious resulting from rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing affordability concerns and the prospects of a possible recession. This drove benchmark prices downward through late June before stabilizing at the end of the quarter as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. Despite the substantial reduction in lumber and OSB prices during the quarter, benchmark prices for both products remain elevated compared to pre-pandemic historical averages. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $289 million compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 25% in the second quarter, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 32%. Our sales volumes increased significantly due to seasonal inventory draw downs and improved production. Log costs increased slightly, primarily for Canadian and Southern logs and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $60 million compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realization decreased by 14% in the second quarter while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 34%. This relative outperformance was largely a result of order files that lag rapidly declining OSB prices. Our sales volumes increased slightly, resulting from improved production. Unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher in the quarter and fiber costs were comparable. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $37 million compared to the first quarter and established a new quarterly EBITDA record. Sales realizations were significantly higher for most products, and we continue to benefit from previously announced price increases for solid section and I-joists products. This was partially offset by significantly higher raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. Production volumes were significantly higher for most products as veneer supply improved. As a result, sales volumes increased for most products in the second quarter. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $24 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to lower margins resulting from the commodity price correction. The distribution team did a terrific job in managing inventories in this dynamic pricing environment. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davy to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook. David Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. It's a pleasure to be speaking with you all today and an honor to be serving as the CFO during such an exciting time in our company's history. I look forward to capitalizing on the opportunities in front of us and working with our incredible teams to continue driving growth for our businesses and superior long-term value for our shareholders. This morning, I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated over $1.1 billion of cash from operations in the second quarter and more than $2.1 billion year-to-date. This represents our highest first half operating cash flow on record, surpassing the previous record established just last year. We ended the quarter with approximately $1.7 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million, which is a typical level for the second quarter. We returned $138 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $36.23, and as of quarter end, we had approximately $670 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically. We also returned $134 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.9% to $0.18 per share. Adjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $1.1 billion, as highlighted on Page 18, and we have generated over $1.9 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase. Second quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $66 million compared to the first quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to an $18 million non-cash benefit for the elimination of intersegment profit in inventory and LIFO in the second quarter compared to a $59 million noncash charge in the prior quarter. The benefit was driven by a decrease in log and lumber inventories from elevated levels at the end of the first quarter. Key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the second quarter, but moderately higher than the third quarter of 2021. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was favorable at the outset of the third quarter, particularly in Oregon, as mills sought to bolster inventories prior to wildfire season. Log supply has improved following a period of unseasonably wet weather in the second quarter and is expected to remain elevated for the majority of the third quarter. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be moderately lower in the third quarter, absent fire-related disruptions in the region. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower as fuel prices have decreased. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be comparable to the second quarter. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs is expected to soften in the third quarter due to a number of factors including a recent increase of European lumber imports into Japan and a weakening Japanese housing market. As a result, our Japanese log sales realizations are expected to decrease moderately from the second quarter, and sales volumes are expected to decrease significantly. In China, although log consumption has improved slightly as pandemic-related lockdowns have eased, log demand is expected to soften in the third quarter, resulting from elevated log inventories at the ports and a reduction in construction activity during the summer rainy season. As a result, our sales realizations on log imports into China are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be lower as we continue to flex logs to our domestic customers to capture the highest margin. In the South, log demand in the third quarter is expected to remain stable as the mills continue to mitigate risks from ongoing transportation challenges by maintaining elevated inventories. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the second quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher in the third quarter as weather conditions remain favorable. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher, and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, consistent with prior years, we expect our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. We expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than the third quarter of 2021 due to a decrease in acres sold year-over-year. As Devin mentioned, Real Estate markets have remained strong year-to-date, and we have capitalized on strong demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are revising our guidance for full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA to $325 million, an increase of $25 million from prior guidance. Additionally, we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 30% to 40% for the year. For our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to the second quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. Following a substantial reduction in pricing during the second quarter, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter having stabilized as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. This dynamic continued throughout July, resulting in a steady increase in benchmark prices for both products. As shown on Page 21, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are significantly lower than the second quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect comparable sales volumes in the third quarter and moderately lower log costs. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be comparable. For our oriented strand board business, we expect slightly lower sales volumes and significantly higher unit manufacturing costs due to planned annual maintenance outages. Fiber costs are expected to be comparable. For our engineered wood products business, we expect significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. We anticipate this will be partially offset by lower sales realizations, primarily for plywood products. Sales realizations for our solid section and I-joist products are expected to be comparable. Our sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs will be slightly higher as a result of planned annual maintenance outages in the third quarter. For our distribution business, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the second quarter due to lower sales realizations for most products. I'll wrap up with a few additional comments on our total company financial items, all of which are summarized in our full year 2022 outlook update on Page 20. As a result of the debt refinancing transactions executed in the first quarter, we now expect our full year interest expense to be $275 million, a $30 million decrease from prior guidance. Each year in the second quarter, we finalize prior year-end estimates for pension assets and liabilities. As a result, we recorded a $67 million improvement in our net funded status as well as a reduction in our noncash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense. Finally, we now anticipate our full year outlook for capital expenditures to be $460 million due primarily to the acceleration of equipment orders with extended lead times for future planned capital projects. There is no change to our previously announced multiyear guidance of $420 million to $440 million of annual capital expenditures for 2023 through 2025. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin, and I look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Dave. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Second quarter housing starts averaged 1.65 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis, a 4% reduction compared to the first quarter. While April housing starts reached the highest monthly level since 2006, activity softened as the quarter progressed. Housing permits in the second quarter averaged 1.73 million units, a 7% reduction compared to the quarter. As we look out at the rest of the year, we do expect some softening in residential construction relative to earlier in the year, primarily as a result of the rapid increase in mortgage rates, ongoing housing affordability concerns, high inflation and concerns over a possible recession. We've already started seeing impacts from these headwinds with the reduction in new and existing home sales in recent months and through the most recent homebuilder sentiment data. However, as always, context is important. To that end, I would note that we are still expecting housing starts and demand for wood products to be above pre-pandemic levels in 2022 despite these near-term challenges. Homebuilders have a significant backlog of houses to complete and we expect this backlog will support construction activity in the back half of 2022. And importantly, we remain constructive longer term on housing demand fundamentals given favorable demographic trends of significantly under-built housing stock, a healthy labor market and solid household balance sheets. Turning to repair and remodel, where activity remained fairly stable quarter-over-quarter and continue to be supported by favorable demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment softened slightly in the second quarter as consumer sentiment turned cautious resulting from the recent macro uncertainties. That said, as the housing market enters a period of relative softening, this should result in more people remaining in their existing homes. And with healthy household balance sheets favorable home equity and an aging housing stock, we continue to expect steady demand from the repair and remodel segment with activity above pre-pandemic levels. In closing, our teams are delivering strong operational and financial results. Year-to-date, we've generated $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA and $1.9 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution. Looking forward, we remain constructive on long-term demand fundamentals that support our businesses, notwithstanding the recent macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong and we remain committed to serving our customers and delivering industry-leading operating performance across our businesses. We are very well positioned to navigate these dynamic market conditions and to generate long-term value for our shareholders. And with that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Three questions for me, and I'll turn it over. And congratulations again, Dave. First off, on the acceleration of equipment with extended lead times, just trying to get at what exactly is happening that you're now able to accelerate the -- it sounds like the deliveries on machinery where there had been an extended lead time is something happening in the supply chain where that's improving? Secondly, again, related to wood, is there anything out of the ordinary with the maintenance you're doing in OSB in the third quarter, if you could talk about what's going to be going on at the mills that we should be aware of if there's any way to sort of quantify what the production loss might be? And then lastly, can you give us a quick update on Maine, where you stand now with the stage gating in terms of the audits and certification. I know you said you want to be ready by the end of the year, but if you can sort of fill in a little bit more color there, that would be great? Good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, thanks, George. Well, first, on the CapEx, really, it's just a function of what we're seeing in the market right now is extended lead time for pretty much all equipment. So this incremental $20 is just really a reflection of our view you need to get into the queue so that you can manage efficiently these longer-term capital projects. So, it's really -- it's not that things are getting better. It's just an acknowledgment that the time line for getting equipment is a bit extended. So in order to get in the queue, you can put down your deposits now, and that just will make for a more efficient and effective flow of projects over the next 18 to 24 months. On the OSB side, really nothing to say there other than just each OSB mill has maintenance that we do. It's the typical annual maintenance. From a dimension standpoint, probably $5 million to $10 million in terms of lost production quarter-over-quarter. George Staphos : And then lastly on Maine. Devin Stockfish : Yes. And on main, thanks. So it's progressing as expected. We're working with the third-party certifiers, still expect to get it approved by the end of the year. So, it's really progressing in accordance with our schedule, and we're pleased with the progress. Operator : Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Let me offer my congrats to Davy as well. Good to have you on the call. David Wold : Thank you. Great to be here. Susan Maklari : My first question is, obviously, housing has been a key topic as we've gone through the quarter. And with a lot of the homebuilders starting to prepare their businesses just sort of guide their businesses to a more normalized sort of pre-COVID sales pace for next year. How are you thinking about your business? How it's sized to that level of activity? And where inventories are today and how you're preparing for something like that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, great question. Obviously, there's been a lot of commentary around what's going on with the housing market. We can get into that in further detail if you'd like. But certainly, I think we are seeing some slowing. As we think about heading into this period of some choppiness in the housing market, I think the key takeaway is we've been preparing our business for just this situation for a number of years. All the work that we've done around OpEx and cost control to have industry-leading performance, the work we've done to get the balance sheet in a really good place, the variable dividend structure. All of these things give us a lot of flexibility if we run into a period of softness. Now our personal view is we'll probably see some softening. I'm not sure it's going to last all that long because we still feel pretty good about the underlying fundamentals with the under-billed housing stock and all the other things we've been talking about for a number of years. But if we do see a period of softening, we'll continue to operate our business well, focus on cost, focus on OpEx and innovation to make sure that we protect our margins as much as possible and serve our customers. So we'll see what happens from a housing standpoint, but I think we're really well positioned if we do see some softening. Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. I appreciate that. And then can you talk a little bit about Timberland, the valuations that you're seeing there, has anything changed as the macro outlook has perhaps softened a bit in the quarter? And how you're thinking about the supply and demand dynamics there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. If you're talking about Timberlands transactions in particular, I think the answer is no, things really haven't changed. We're still seeing very strong demand for Timberland transaction. I think you've seen that in some of the deals that have been announced lately, we're seeing very strong pricing for Timberland assets. I think that's really a function of a few different things. First of all, historically, Timberlands have been a good place to be in an inflationary environment. So there may be some of that. But I think more importantly, there's just a view that the longer-term value in Timberland assets is there. And you've seen really over the last 12 to 18 months, the values that people are paying for Timberland deals continues to go up. And I think it's just a reflection of interest in the asset class. So notwithstanding some of the choppiness we've seen and some of the uncertainty we've seen in the markets generally, that really hasn't flowed through to the Timberlands transactions. Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. I'm going to sneak one more in, which is you did increase amount of repurchases you did this quarter relative to what you've done in the first quarter and certainly relative to last year. Can you just talk a bit about your appetite for further repurchases given the valuation today and how you're thinking about the outlook for the business? David Wold : Yes, Sue, you bet, this is Davy. As we've said in the past, we think about share repurchase as a useful tool to return cash to shareholders under the right circumstances, specifically when we see it as the best option for creating long-term shareholder value. So, yes, that increase to our authority of $1 billion last fall, that gives us more flexibility to buy back stock when we see good opportunities there. So, we did repurchase $138 million in Q2 at an average price of $36.23 per share, and we'll continue to look at those opportunities moving forward. We've progressed overall bigger picture against that $1 billion authorization. We've done $333 million year-to-date. So, we're -- cumulative to date since we announced that authorization. So, we're making steady progress against that. We'll continue to assess those share repurchases along with all the other options we have for cash deployment, and we'll report out on that share repurchase activity quarterly. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Devin, if we do go through a period of softer markets in wood products because of housing, what are some of the other factors that you think might make where pricing and profitability for your business stabilize, different than maybe what it might have previously beyond some of these internal measures that you've taken, in particular, I'm thinking about high costs in BC. Is that going to be a factor do you think in the future being different than what five years ago, let's say, how things might have played out in a softer supply-demand environment? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Absolutely, Mark. And I think really, -- so putting aside the cost side, which we've discussed a lot in the past. On the sales realization side, I do think that when you think about -- and I'll speak to lumber particularly here. When you think about where lumber prices go, there's going to be a different cost structure by geography. And we've talked about this a bit in the past, but I do think just the dynamics with fiber availability and how that's impacted the cost structure in British Columbia, I think what that means is for a pretty significant percentage of the overall lumber capacity in North America, when you get below a certain price level, it's going to be pretty hard for a lot of the mills to be cash flow positive. Now whether that's $550 million, whether that's $600 million, there's some debate there. We certainly don't have visibility into our competitors' cost structure. But we do have a mill in British Columbia that we think is a top quartile cost mill. So we do have some view on that. And I think relative to what's going on across North America, the BC cost structure is going to play into that and likely keep lumber prices in terms of a floor higher than they've been historically. And so, I think that's going to be reflected. In terms of some other -- that will be the biggest. In terms of some other issues at play, obviously, from a wood construction standpoint, our industry is always looking to increase the share of wood in building. And so even beyond single-family residential, whether you're talking multi or tall wood buildings. That's something we continue to look at a little bit around the margins with infrastructure. So there may be some other things at play that make this look a little different than the last time we had a dip in the market. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And kind of maybe a small question, but -- so the CME is going to be launching a new futures contract. Does that -- is that going to matter for your business at all, do you think? And also, why might there not be anything for Southern Pine? David Wold : Yes, Mark, we're aware of the new contract that's being rolled out. We'll keep an eye on it as it's introduced, although we monitor the futures market, it's not something we've used extensively given our business objectives and the volumes that have historically been traded there. And to your point on the species involved, it's possible the new contract may provide a little more volume and liquidity in the market. There may be a scenario where we'd have some use for the new contract and targeted transactions, but it's not something we'd anticipate using broadly at this point. Devin Stockfish : And on the Southern Yellow Pine Point, Mark, I do think that's going to be down the road. They've talked about thinking about that. They're just kind of -- they're doing this one first, and they'll look at Southern Yellin down the road. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Roxland : Just want to get a sense for you to what you're seeing in your order books at present, especially wood products specifically, any shortening, less committed orders, more purchases? And the reason I'm asking is, again, go back to home building, you've seen a notable pickup in the homebuilder cancellation rates. And as a result of that, you're also -- you're seeing more homes being placed in the market by billers just in one of products. So I'm wondering if what the home builders are seeing was actually trickling into your order book at present for wood products. Devin Stockfish : Yes. We haven't really seen it happen yet. In fact, on the OSB side, I'd say our order files are pretty much normal. On the lumber side, actually, our order books are a little elevated relative to normal, so a little longer on the lumber side. And on the EWP side, we're still on full allocation. So we really haven't seen that translate into our order files. And frankly, I think part of that, too, is just inventories across channel are pretty lean. And so there's still building going on and people need product that they're -- they're just not carrying much inventory. So there's a need to cover short-term requirements at present. George Staphos : Got you. How far do they typically the order books, in terms of line of sight. Devin Stockfish : Yes. On OSB, normal is in the range of two to four weeks. On the lumber side, it's usually one to two weeks. And like I said, on the lumber side, we're probably on the high end of that, a little north of that. And as I said, EWP is -- that's on allocation. So it's a little different story there. Mike Roxland : Got you. I appreciate it. One just quick follow-up -- second question. Just wondering if you could help us frame how you're thinking about harvest slowing housing demand environment? And if I think about the -- Great Recession, nothing we're headed there. But during the Great Recession, if I recall correctly, Weyerhaeuser reduced its harvest by over 30%, I think in the 2009, 2010 time frame, your peers did something similar. And as a result, post Great Recession, you had a very slowly improving housing environment. And long story short, you're dealing with a situation in the U.S. South that goes today where timber there's excess timber on this and it still hasn't been worked through fully just given the that occurred during that period of time. So I'm wondering if you can help us think about if we do get into a recession, I mean we're there right now, we're in a recession based on GDP numbers yesterday. But if it gets even more severe, how you plan to harvest to avoid a repeat of what happened during the Great Recession? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So a couple of comments I would offer on that. I think, first of all, not that our crystal ball is perfect, but we're not expecting anything close to the Great Recession. And any sort of normal recessionary environment, I wouldn't anticipate our harvest level is really changing much. We have an integrated model. So we have internal mill customers, we manage our harvest levels to stay at sustainable levels over time. So in a normal run-of-the-mill recession, I wouldn't anticipate that really impacting our harvest levels. Now obviously, if we have a Great Recession type of event, which, again, seems pretty unlikely to us, then of course, we're going to dial in our harvest levels to match that supply to demand. But particularly given the dynamic with all of the new mills coming into the U.S. South, ultimately, even if markets soften, the U.S. South is a place where you make money really almost under any lumber pricing scenario. So, Southern mills are going to run. So I don't really have a whole lot of concern about really reducing harvest levels in the South, absent something really, really significant. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : I just wanted to start off on Western log prices. I mean historically, at least the domestic market has been fairly correlated with lumber, and you talked a bit about how you expect, I guess, realizations to come in a bit during Q3, but hoping you could maybe talk a little bit more about into 2023, if we were to see lumber prices stabilize around current levels, whether you would think there might be a little bit more downside? And how -- I guess, what you're seeing in the export market factors into that as well. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, great question. I think the answer is really it depends on a number of different factors. There's no question that in the West, you do see a stronger correlation between log prices and lumber prices. Obviously, a sawmill is not going to pay a log price that causes them to go cash negative. So there is definitely a correlation between log prices and lumber prices. But there are two other dynamics at play that also weigh in on that. One of which is just the very tight supply demand dynamic that's going on in the West. There's -- it's a highly tensioned wood basket. And so typically, you're going to see log prices stay pretty close to that level where mills can still make some profit. And the other piece, as you mentioned, is just the export market. That is a big market for us. We send a fair number of logs over to the Japan market and depending on domestic conditions also to China. So those three things really work in unison to set log prices. So the way I would think about it as we roll into 2023, regardless of what's going on in the economy, it's still going to be a tension wood basket. We still anticipate having good demand from our export customers. And so I think the way it will play out is you'll see log prices stay as strong as they can to still allow mills to make some level of profit. So we're still expecting a good solid market in 2023, even if you do see a little bit of a softening in the economy. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then for my second question, I mean, the contributions from the EWP business have been really exceptional over the last couple of quarters. And I guess as you kind of look out, there's a number of different crosscurrents there, right, with demand being heavily dependent on new resi construction, but the supply side at least right now is still very, very tight. Commodity prices have been quite volatile, but EWP prices are obviously have made some significant gains over the last two years. So was hoping if you could just talk a bit about how you think about the prospects for that business into 2023? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, first, just a shout out to our EWP team. They're doing just a remarkable job running that business. It's been a really good run. We've had a lot of demand for EWP products. And so that's really translated into great profitability in that business. As we look forward, you're absolutely right. That product line is much more tailored to single family. And so to the extent you see some softening there, clearly, that will have some impact. But I do think just for perspective, that is a market where the supply of EWP has been pretty short, and that's resulted in a lot of shortages for our homebuilder customers. And so to some level or to some extent, there's a little bit of room just to catch up to have that supply meet demand, even if you see single-family tick down a little bit. The other thing I would just mention is during this period where there's been such a shortage of engineered wood products, you have seen builders converting into 2x10, 2x12s, open web, and so there's still some opportunity for EWP if housing softens a bit to go take some of that market share back. So absolutely, it is tied to single family, but I think even with a softening housing environment, the EWP business is still going to be pretty strong in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Just a couple of questions. Just -- and welcome aboard, Davy. Just Devin, just you had performance of Wood Products in the last couple of years here. Is there any issues around your REIT test? Devin Stockfish : No, we're in full compliance, expect to remain in full compliance, so no issues from a REIT standpoint. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then back to the Investor Day in '21, you had wanted to grow your lumber production by about 5% annually. Is that going to happen in 2022 here? Devin Stockfish : Yes. We are going to grow organic lumber production in 2022. I think our latest estimate is we'll be somewhere in the neighborhood of 5 billion board feet of production. And so that's along the path that we have to getting that 5% per year annual target. I will say we've got a little bit of catching up to do just because particularly in the early part of the year with all the COVID disruptions, et cetera, probably lost a little bit of production, but we're well on the way to meet that target over the multiyear period. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then what really needs to happen to accelerate and fully develop your Natural Climate solutions initiative? Devin Stockfish : Yes, a couple of things. I mean, one of them is just time. A lot of these efforts take time to develop, whether it's the carbon capture and storage business. We feel really, really good about the long-term prospects. But it takes time to get those signed up, get the infrastructure built, et cetera, similarly, with the forest carbon business. Solar, we're signing up lots of solar deals, but those take several years to get up and running and connect it into the grid. So part of it is just time. I think part of it is we do need to see the pricing develop. I'll give you the example of forest carbon pricing. That's been bouncing around between $10 and $15 per ton. We do think that's going to increase over time. But clearly, if we're going to flex some of our forestry into carbon markets from our historical timber markets, that has to be margin positive. So you need to see that pricing come up. I do think there's a piece of it that's regulatory in nature. And so just for example, the current bill that's being looked at in Congress right now does have some provisions that would help accelerate that, whether it's the increased tax credit from 45Q to help with carbon capture and storage, direct air capture, whether it's additional support for building out wind and solar. Those things ultimately are going to happen regardless, but I think certainly some support there from a regulatory standpoint can help accelerate that. But I feel really good about the work the team is doing, just a tremendous job across the board, whether it's wind, solar, carbon capture and storage, mitigation banking across the board. Russell and his team are building out that organization and making some really good progress. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Please proceed with your question. Mark Wilde : Just first of all, kind of curious for both of you. It sounded to me this morning, like you're maybe toggling a little more toward kind of the potential for share repurchase activity and perhaps in light of kind of prospective weakness in the housing market and weakness in share prices. Is that fair? It just seemed like you put more emphasis on that this morning than I have ever heard in the past. Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. I mean, again, I'll say we look at share repurchase as a useful tool in the right circumstance. So -- we're fortunate to have a lot of levers, whether it be M&A, investing in the business, paying down debt, base and variable dividend payments, we think share repurchase can be an important element of our capital allocation mix. A lot of it is going to depend on our ability to look at that acquisition target and the patients that we'll need as we are disciplined as we pursue those Timberland acquisitions and evaluating all the options that are available to us to create shareholder value over time. Mark Wilde : David, would you want to put a little color on just the process that you go through as you think about sort of the value of your stock versus going out and trying to buy incremental Timberland market. David Wold : Sure. Yes. I mean, as you'd expect, we've got a view on the intrinsic value of the Company, and that's informed by a number of factors. It's -- importantly, it's based on our long-term view of the Company. So, we've got some thoughts on that that we look at, and we're always evaluating all the opportunities available to us, and it's going to depend on the events and circumstances that are in place at the time and the opportunities that are available to us. But we'll continue to be disciplined in all of those options and weighing them opportunistically. Mark Wilde : Okay. And then also, I guess, kind of related to this whole question here. It appears to me that sort of the increased focus on ESG has brought down the discount rates that people are using and looking at Timberland transactions. And I just -- I wonder if you agree with that based on what you've seen over the last three to five years in the Timberland market? And then if you could just give us some sense of what you think others might be using in terms of discount rate? What's implied in what you've seen in timber transactions that have been done out there. Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. So a couple of thoughts here. I do think that this view, there's an ESG play embedded within Timberlands is playing into discount rates and just the overall interest in the asset class. And you can see that around the margin, certainly with some of the private equity-like capital that's coming into the space. You see JPMorgan buying Campbell. Things of that nature, I think, are very much related to ESG, carbon, natural climate solutions, those kinds of opportunities. The thing that makes it hard to really quantify the impact of that on discount rates is you're also seeing money come in from all over the globe, where the discount rates people look for in Europe are a little different maybe than you would think in the U.S. So some of that gets a little muddied, but I think you're absolutely right directionally that ESG has lowered the discount rates people are using. In terms of giving you the range, I would still say kind of 4.5 to 5.5 is normal. But that being said, we've certainly seen some transactions lately, at least from our math, that seem to be pushing those discount rates quite a bit further. And particularly when you see some non-traditional type buyers come into the market, some of those discount rates can get really low. So, I think you are seeing on balance discount rates go down a bit in some of the transactions we've seen lately. Mark Wilde : Okay. And just finally, real quickly, Devin. I mean the last four, four, six quarters in EWP pricing, like nothing I've ever seen before effectively just look at your graph this morning, I mean the price of I-joist looks like it's essentially doubled in about 1.5 years here. Can you talk about how you think about the stickiness of those prices if we see residential housing activities slow down? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, Mark, I'm probably not going to speculate on future pricing, but I will offer just a couple of directional comments on that. I think the big reason why you've seen this pricing dynamic is in a reasonably strong demand environment, there's just not enough EWP supply to go around. And so you take that, coupled with the fact that some of the input costs for EWP, so think OSB, web stock, resin, some of these other input costs have also gone up quite a bit. That's really just translated into a very strong pricing environment. And as I mentioned earlier, we're still on allocation across all of our products. Now obviously, as we go forward, this product feeds primarily into single-family, although I will say just as an aside, I do think there's lots of opportunity for EWP to find market share in commercial multifamily, some of the other focus on CLT, that kind of thing. There's more market opportunity for EWP. But even just a single family, if that goes down, that supply and demand dynamics will play out and impact pricing, but the underlying issue of EWP being in relatively short supply, unless you saw housing just fall off a cliff, I think that's more or less still going to be the case going forward. Operator : Our next question comes from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Appreciate squeezing me in. There's just continue to be -- seems like announcement after announcement about more expansions and new sawmill capacity coming into the U.S. South and some of which certainly have some pretty big price tags associated with that when you think about the capacity per 1,000 board feet. It seems like there's a really big disconnect right now in terms of how the private market is viewing valuations for U.S. South sawmill capacity versus kind of what's implied in the public market right now. Do you think that presents any opportunities for M&A or industry consolidation going forward? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, I think I would agree with the disconnect. I think part of that has just been in the public markets. If you're trying to figure out what mid-cycle pricing looks like, that's been really challenging with the volatility across most of the Wood Products business. And I think that has led to a bit of a disconnect between that valuation. But in terms of opportunities, well, I think absolutely, whenever there's a disconnect in the value underlying value and then the way the market is otherwise seeing it, then certainly, there can be opportunities for M&A. And frankly, if we do see a little bit of a downturn, those are oftentimes the opportunities to do the best deals when you see those big value disconnect. So certainly, that's something I think everybody is watching for as we progress into the next 12 to 18 months. Buck Horne : Okay. I appreciate those thoughts. Lastly, just for me, fire-related risks this year, has the wet weather out West really mitigated the impact for fires this year? How do you think that may shape up as we move through the summer? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Certainly, to date, that's been the case. It was a very wet spring and summer, didn't really start in the Northwest until July 5 or 6. So I think that's really put us in a position where, from a fire risk standpoint, standing here at the end of July, we're in pretty good shape. As always, I would just say that can change, and so we will do what we always do, which is monitor this closely. We've had a pretty good track record of managing fire across our ownership. So, we'll stay on high alert. But as of today, it's definitely at a lower risk than it would ordinarily be this time of summer. Operator : We've reached the end of the question-and-answer session. At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Terrific. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $310 million or $0.42 per diluted share on net sales of $2.3 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $583 million in the third quarter. This is approximately 52% lower than the second quarter and was largely driven by further softening in lumber and OSB pricing as cautious sentiment weighed on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook. Additionally, and to a lesser degree, third quarter results were also impacted by the work stoppage in our Washington and Oregon wood products and timberlands operations. The work stoppage commenced on September 13 and impacted our 4 lumber mills in the Northwest as well as a portion of our Western Timberlands operations. I'm pleased to report that as of last night, we've resolved the work stoppage, and we'll begin resuming operations next week. I want to acknowledge how important these jobs are to our employees, their families and our communities and how difficult this situation has been for all involved. We appreciate everyone who worked diligently over many months to come to an agreement that is fair and competitive for our employees, and importantly, that we believe is sustainable for our company throughout the business cycle. With the work stoppage resolved, we're focused on welcoming our employees back, supporting our customers and returning to full operating capacity in the Northwest as quickly as possible. We currently expect to ramp up to full operating posture over 7 to 10 days after returning to work. With that, I'll now turn to our third quarter business results. I'll begin the discussion with Timberlands on Pages 5 through 8 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $107 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $168 million, a $3 million increase compared to the year ago quarter. And third quarter EBITDA decreased by $51 million compared to the second quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales volumes in the West, resulting from -- stoppage late in the quarter as well as lower average realizations in the West, partly due to less export volume being shipped in the quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market. Despite lower lumber pricing, log markets remained fairly stable in the third quarter as log demand was steady and log supply in certain areas was somewhat constrained by harvest and haul capacity. Although Weyerhaeuser did not experience these challenges, the impacts kept log markets tensioned for most of the quarter. As a result, our third quarter domestic sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Notwithstanding favorable weather conditions, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes decreased compared to the second quarter as a result of the work stoppage that commenced in mid-September. It's worth noting that our Western log and haul activities are operated by a combination of Weyerhaeuser employees and outside contractors. As a result, a portion of our contract harvest and haul operations continued through the work stoppage. Our forestry and road costs were seasonally higher compared to the second quarter, and per unit log and haul costs were lower. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs softened somewhat in the third quarter due to a number of factors, including an increase of European lumber imports into Japan. Japanese log sales volumes decreased significantly compared to the second quarter due to the timing of shipments, combined with the reduction in log export activity resulting from the work stoppage. Sales realizations were slightly lower in the quarter. In China, demand for our logs softened modestly in the third quarter due to the ongoing impacts from disruptions in the Chinese real estate market as well as pandemic-related lockdowns. Despite softer demand, log inventories at the Chinese ports declined steadily from the elevated levels reported earlier in the year, as log supply headwinds persisted. These include restrictions on Australian log imports, Russia's ban on log exports and a reduction in European wood flow into China. Average sales realizations for our China export logs decreased moderately compared to the second quarter, and sales volumes were significantly lower as we continue to intentionally shift volume to the domestic market to capture better margin opportunities. Our third quarter sales volumes to China were further impacted by a reduction in log export activity resulting from the work stoppage. Moving to the South. Southern Timberlands\u2019 adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the second quarter and year ago quarter. Despite adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, Southern sawlog and fiber markets remained stable for the majority of the third quarter as mills maintain steady demand to mitigate risks from ongoing supply chain challenges. As a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Fee harvest volumes were also comparable as weather conditions were better than expected in certain geographies and affected our harvest activity for a portion of the third quarter. Forestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the second quarter. On the export side, our log exports to China out of the U.S. South remain paused due to ongoing rules imposed by Chinese regulators to address potential phytosanitary concerns on imported pine logs. As a result, we continue to redirect logs to domestic mills in the India market during the third quarter. We continue to view this as a temporary headwind and maintain a positive longer-term outlook for our Southern export business to China and other Asian markets. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the second quarter due to significantly higher sales volumes resulting from the seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter. Our sales realizations were comparable. Turning to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 9 and 10. Real Estate and ENR contributed $48 million to third quarter earnings and $60 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the year ago quarter, but $47 million lower than the second quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold partially offset by an increase in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business. Similar to recent years, our 2022 real estate activity has been heavily weighted toward the first half of the year. Although activity is moderating in response to broader macroeconomic uncertainty, we continue to see steady demand for HBU properties as buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Regarding our Natural Climate Solutions business, we continue to engage with high-quality developers for renewable energy and carbon capture and storage opportunities across our acreage. And we're encouraged by the recent passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, which should drive incremental demand for these markets and further support our Natural Climate Solutions growth strategy. Additionally, we continue to advance our forest carbon pilot project in Maine and are well positioned for project approval over the next few months. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 11 through 13. Wood Products contributed $344 million to third quarter earnings and $395 million to adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million lower than the second quarter, largely driven by the decrease in lumber and OSB pricing during the quarter. Starting with the lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark lumber and OSB prices entered the third quarter having stabilized from significant declines earlier in the year as buyers reentered the market to bolster lean inventories. Buyer sentiment improved slightly following a brief decline in mortgage rates and in response to solid June housing starts data. This dynamic continued through most of July, resulting in a steady increase in benchmark pricing for both products. By early August, buyer sentiment once again turned cautious resulting from rapidly rising mortgage rates, housing affordability concerns and in response to unfavorable July housing starts data. Buyers remain cautious through the end of the quarter, largely limiting orders to necessity purchases. While OSB prices stabilized in September, lumber prices moved gradually lower throughout the end of the quarter. Although for context, it's important to note that lumber and OSB prices each remained at healthy levels on a historical basis. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $271 million compared to the second quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 28%, while the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 30%. Our sales and production volumes decreased moderately compared to the second quarter largely driven by the impact of the work stoppage at our Washington and Oregon mills. Unit manufacturing costs were higher during the quarter and log costs decreased moderately. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $231 million compared to the second quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 41%, while the OSB composite pricing decreased by 44%. Our sales and production volumes decreased slightly compared to the second quarter due to downtime for planned annual maintenance. Third quarter sales volumes were further impacted by ongoing rail challenges in Canada. Unit manufacturing costs were higher in the quarter and fiber costs were comparable. Engineering Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million compared to the second quarter. Sales realizations were higher for most products in the third quarter, and we remained on allocation for most products throughout the quarter.  Sales and production volumes were lower for most products due to downtime for planned annual maintenance. Sales volumes were further impacted by ongoing transportation challenges in Canada and labor constraints at certain facilities. Unit manufacturing costs were higher in the third quarter, and raw material costs were significantly lower primarily for OSB web stock. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $7 million compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes for EWP and Specialty Products. Despite the quarter-over-quarter reduction, this was the strongest third quarter adjusted EBITDA result on record for our distribution business. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. David Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. This morning, I will be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 15. We generated approximately $560 million of cash from operations in the third quarter and nearly $2.7 billion year-to-date. We ended the quarter with a strong liquidity position with approximately $1.9 billion of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of just over $5 billion. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $94 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter. We returned $133 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and remain committed to growing this by 5% annually through 2025. We also returned $145 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity. And as of quarter end, we had $523 million of remaining capacity under our $1 billion share repurchase program. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically. Adjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $468 million, as highlighted on Page 17, and we have generated approximately $2.4 billion of adjusted FAD year-to-date. As a reminder, we will supplement our base dividends each year with an additional return of cash to achieve the targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. As demonstrated in 2021, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental dividend or a combination of a supplemental dividend and opportunistic share repurchase. While our return of cash for fiscal year 2021 was achieved mostly through base and variable supplemental cash dividends, our share repurchase activity this year has been more active. As a result, we anticipate share repurchase will represent a larger portion of our 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD cash return this year. That said, as a result of the strong cash generation throughout this year, we still expect a meaningful supplemental dividend to be paid in the first quarter of 2023. Key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18. As Devin mentioned, we will soon be returning to normal operating levels in our Washington and Oregon lumber and Timberlands businesses. That said, our fourth quarter outlook includes work stoppage impacts through October, followed by a 7- to 10-day ramp-up period to return to full operating capacity. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be significantly lower than the third quarter. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, resulting from reduced takeaway of finished products and elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved from the prior quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the fourth quarter, notwithstanding adverse weather conditions or supply chain constraints. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the third quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter largely driven by impacts of the work stoppage, and we now anticipate our full year harvest volumes in the West to be slightly lower than 2021. This reduction in volumes from prior guidance represents a harvest deferral that we expect to capture over several quarters after returning to normal operations. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower in the fourth quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities. Moving to the export markets, we expect steady demand for our logs in the fourth quarter. As Devin mentioned, the work stoppage resulted in a temporary reduction in our log export activity. As a result, we expect lower export sales volumes compared to the third quarter. Additionally, we anticipate sales realizations for our export logs to be lower in the fourth quarter. In the South, we expect log demand to remain steady in the fourth quarter as mills continue to maintain elevated inventories to mitigate risks from ongoing supply chain and logistics challenges. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly higher as weather conditions have improved from the prior quarter. Because of better-than-expected weather conditions in the third quarter, we now anticipate our full year harvest volumes in the South to be slightly higher than 2021 compared to our prior outlook of moderately higher volumes. We expect slightly higher forestry and road costs in the fourth quarter and comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, fee harvest volumes are expected to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter. We anticipate significantly lower sales realizations due to mix.  Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the third quarter due to timing and mix of real estate sales and lower royalty income in our Energy and Natural Resources business. We continue to anticipate full year 2022 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $325 million, and we now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be approximately 35% to 40% for the full year. For our Wood Products segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be lower than the third quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and oriented strand board. Following the reduction in pricing during the third quarter, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter showing signs of stabilization. Buyers are maintaining inventories at or below target levels as sentiment remains cautious. In October, benchmark prices for lumber continued on a slight downward trajectory for the majority of the month before stabilizing and increasing slightly. Benchmark prices for OSB have remained fairly stable through October. As shown on Page 20, for both lumber and OSB, our current and quarter-to-date realizations are moderately lower than the third quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect significantly lower log costs in the fourth quarter, partially offset by lower sales volumes resulting from the work stoppage in our Western mills in October, and we anticipate comparable unit manufacturing costs. For our oriented strand board business, we expect slightly higher sales volumes and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs, primarily due to less downtime for planned annual maintenance during the fourth quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. For our Engineered Wood Products business, we expect lower sales volumes in the fourth quarter. We also expect lower sales realizations for most products compared to the third quarter with solid section and I-joists pricing coming off record highs. This will be partially offset by significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. As a result, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower in the fourth quarter, but still higher than any quarter in 2021. For our distribution business, we are expecting adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the third quarter due to lower sales volumes and realizations for most products. I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Over the last several months, we've continued to see softening in new residential construction activity from the peak reported in April, particularly in the single-family segment. There have been notable reductions in new and existing home sales and home builder sentiment has turned more negative. Consequently, we expect near-term housing outlook to remain less favorable compared to the last couple of years, largely driven by several ongoing headwinds, including a rapid increase in mortgage rates, housing affordability challenges, high inflation and growing concerns about the economy. That all being said, homebuilder backlog should offer some additional support for building activity and wood products demand for the remainder of 2022 and into early 2023. And longer term, we continue to have a favorable view on housing fundamentals, given strong demographic trends, a significantly underbuilt housing stock, a healthy labor market and solid household balance sheets. Turning to repair and remodel. Despite softening in the housing market, repair and remodel activity remained fairly stable in the third quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment has continued to come off the recent pandemic peaks returning to a more normalized pre-pandemic demand level.  Although lower home sales activity ordinarily would be a drag on repair and remodel spending, we may, in fact, see some incremental spend on repair and remodel projects as homeowners elect to invest in remodeling projects in their existing homes if they're priced out of purchasing a new home in this more challenged mortgage rate environment. This should provide near-term support for additional repair and remodel activity, especially from the professional segment. Further, we remain optimistic on longer-term fundamentals supporting the repair and remodel segment, including an aging housing stock and favorable home equity levels. We expect these dynamics to support steady repair and demand for the balance of 2022 and into next year with activity levels comparable to pre-pandemic levels. In closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the third quarter despite increasing macroeconomic headwinds. And I'm incredibly proud of the continued focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams. Their collective efforts have generated year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $3.3 billion and adjusted funds available for distribution of $2.4 billion. Although near-term market conditions have moderated, we maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Looking forward, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong. We have a competitive cost structure and we are very well positioned to navigate through a full range of market conditions. We remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for our shareholders through an unmatched portfolio of assets, industry-leading performance and disciplined capital allocation. Now before we move to questions, I would like to briefly provide some details to help quantify the work stoppage impacts to our third quarter results and fourth quarter outlook. I'm sure that would have been a question, so we'll just go ahead and cover that now. Starting with Timberlands, it is important to note that the decrease in volume during this period is merely deferred, not lost. We will capture this deferred volume over the next year or so. And in the meantime, that volume will continue to grow on the stump. Additionally, I'd point out that in any given period, we have a base level of spend for items such as forestry, silviculture and roads that we maintain to ensure that we capture long-term value. So we've continued to incur those costs during the course of the work stoppage, which means our margins will be significantly lower during this period, but margins will then increase above typical levels in the future period when we ultimately harvest that volume. Taking all of that into consideration, the work stoppage resulted in approximately 360,000 tons of deferred volumes in the third quarter compared to our original plan. This translated to an EBITDA impact of approximately $25 million. But again, most of that will be recovered in future periods when the deferred log volume is harvested next year. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we expect Western Timberlands EBITDA will decrease by approximately $50 million from the third quarter, with approximately half of that decrease attributable to deferred volume from the work stoppage and the other half due to expected lower average sales realizations during the quarter due to general market conditions. We expect approximately 500,000 tons of deferred volumes in the fourth quarter resulting from the work stoppage. For Wood Products, the work stoppage lowered production volumes by approximately 60 million board feet in the third quarter, and we expect around 170 million board feet of impact in the fourth quarter. Given the more rapid pace of price erosion in lumber versus logs in the West, which compresses margins until log prices adjust accordingly, the last lumber production in September and October hasn't had a material impact on EBITDA in the third or fourth quarters. So with that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question, Devin, is you talked a little bit about some deflation in the input costs and wood products that you started to see in the quarter, and it feels like that could continue into the end of the year. As we do think about the cost structure coming down and given what is going on in housing broadly, can you talk about the ability to hold some of that price that you've seen in your EWP business over the last couple of years and perhaps what that could mean for profitability as we think about going through '23? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure, Sue. Yes. So I mean, certainly, we are going to see some, some of the input costs on the wood product side coming down. And so in particular, log costs in the West, OSB web stock, for instance, we may see a little bit of relief on some of the fuel costs related to transportation. So I do expect we'll see some of that come down over time. With respect to the lumber and OSB business, that's really primarily a supply-demand dynamic with the pricing, we can talk further about where we think that's going to go over time. But on the EWP specific, I do think we'll be able to hold those prices reasonably well. There is -- as we saw during the last run up in housing here over the last couple of years, there is a structural, I think, undersupply of EWP. I do think as we move forward, there are some opportunities for us to take back some market share in the EWP space from Open Web, some other alternative products that builders were forced to move to when we were at the height of building activity earlier this year. So I do think we'll be able to hold those prices a little bit better as we move forward. Susan Maklari : That's helpful. And then moving over to Timberlands. You talked about the fact that overall demand there remains pretty healthy. Can you just talk about how you're thinking of valuations as we go into next year? And the supply-demand dynamics as we think longer term about what is going on with Timberlands and obviously, the tie-in there with Natural Climate Solutions? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, as we think about the Timberlands market over the last 12 to 24 months, we have undoubtedly seen a lot of interest in the asset class. I think that's clear just in terms of the number of bidders that we see on deals, but also the prices that folks are paying for Timberlands deals. As we think about going forward, I think there are a few things that come into play. And as you mentioned, 1 of those is the interest in the Climate Solutions piece. I think that is driving increased interest in Timberland assets. Candidly, I don't know that folks are really fully underwriting all of those carbon and other alternative values at this point, but I do think it's a piece of the equation as people are trying to value those assets going forward. So I wouldn't expect prices to necessarily fall off of where they are. We are continuing to see a lot of interest in timberland acquisitions. And so we're expecting that to continue to be a very competitive market next year and going forward. Particularly, if we do see carbon prices trend where we think they are over the next 3, 5, 7 years, I think that will be a tailwind for timberland values going forward. Susan Maklari : Okay. And then I'm going to squeeze 1 more in, which is just you mentioned, obviously, you've stepped up the buyback activity this year. You still have some more room remaining on the current authorization. Any thoughts on how you're thinking of continued buybacks given where the stock is trading relative to some of the other alternatives for capital? David Wold : Yes, Sue, you bet. Sure. I mean really, our thoughts there haven't changed substantially. We think about share repurchase as a useful tool in the right circumstances to return cash to shareholders. So as always, we start with that commitment to returning a significant amount to shareholders through the base, and then we can supplement that through the variable return in the form of share repurchase or in the supplemental dividend. So we'll continue to evaluate that amongst all of our other options above that 75% to 80%, we can use that cash for investing in growth, further debt paydown or additional share repurchase. So we'll certainly consider share repurchase as 1 of the opportunities available to us. We have stepped up the volume of that over the course of the year. So certainly, that indicates that we believe it's a useful way to do that. So we'll continue to evaluate our opportunities there moving forward. Susan Maklari : Good luck with everything. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : On the impact from the strike, the deferred volumes that you discussed on the timberland side, is it accurate to say that the volumes that you lost in 3Q and 4Q of this year will mostly be recovered in 3Q and 4Q of next year? Or is it something that we could see more in the first half of the year? Or just wondering if there's any kind of finer point you can put on sort of the cadence of ultimately recovering those volumes over the next year? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes, our plan would be to sprinkle that in across next year. So it wouldn't be specifically targeted to Q3 or Q4. We would just add that into the overall harvest plan for 2023. And we'll provide a little bit more specifics on the magnitude of that as we provide our full year guidance on the earnings call in January. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's helpful. And then just a lot of materials companies have talked about a large buildup of customer inventories that have become kind of an impediment and negatively impacted demand. It might take a couple of quarters to work through. I think on the log side, you said mill customers have ordered pretty fully to compensate for supply chain issues. I'm just -- if I got that right. I'm just wondering, do you see any risk of if supply chain eases quickly that, that kind of inventory build becomes maybe a bit of a headwind for demand into the end of the year or in early '23? And then just maybe if you could -- maybe contrast that with inventory situation in Wood Products, especially lumber, that would be helpful. Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. So on the log side, I'm not sure that's a real material risk here in the near term. I suppose around the margins, if you saw trucking capacity and logging capacity flowing back into the system, maybe some mills would be more comfortable carrying lower inventories. But to be frank, that seems highly unlikely to me in the near term. There is a real challenge around getting trucking and logging capacity certainly across the South, but even to some extent in the West. So I suspect most mills are going to continue to carry a little bit heavier inventory levels to mitigate that risk. So I don't know that, that's a big issue on the Timberland side. On the Wood Products side, again, I don't know that mills necessarily have high levels of inventory. I can't obviously speak to our competitors, but for us, we're not carrying excess inventories, finished goods inventories across our mill set right now. So I don't think it's a meaningful risk there. The other thing I would say on the wood product side is, if you look across the channel in whole, I think most folks, particularly dealers, distributors are carrying relatively light inventories. Nobody is particularly interested in carrying heavy inventories given all the uncertainty in the macro environment. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Thanks for the details. Can you hear me okay? First question, and you talked about this during Davie's remarks, the ability for the company to flex its capital return with the parameters and guardrail that you have around your policy and strategy. Could you talk a bit about where you see the potential maybe to slow the regular dividend increase. We know the goal is 5% per year over time, given what could be a bit of a cyclical pullback in your markets over the next year? Or at this juncture, you feel that given what you know and recognizing it's a Board decision that 5% growth seems pretty reasonable, no matter where we are in the cycle? How would you have us think about that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. No, that's a great question. I think first of all, as you said, that's ultimately a Board decision. So obviously, we're not going to get out in front of the board on that. But what I would say is, when we put out that 5% per year target, that was based on a lot of different modeling. As you know, the dividend -- the base dividend growth is largely going to be funded by the growth in our Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources business. So as we think about it today, we've done several acquisitions on the Timberland side. We've done a lot of work around the debt structure to reduce our interest costs. So I feel like we are doing what we need to do to continue to grow that base dividend by 5% per year regardless of where we are in the business cycle. George Staphos : Next question, and I had I mean, obviously, we're going again through a bit of a downturn directionally, it wouldn't be a surprise. But nonetheless, can you give us a bit more color in terms of what is happening with log realizations, why they're declining on the West, recognizing that Weyerhaeuser doesn't dictate the market with the work stoppages that would have deferred and did, some of the harvest that would have been available in the market and the logs that would have been available in the market. So help me understand why even with the stoppage at least from your vantage point, some supply constraints, we're seeing log pricing and realizations down in the West and kind of what's going on there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So really a couple of things going on in the West, George. So first of all, with respect to the work stoppage, 2 things to keep in mind. First of all, nearly 2/3 of our log and haul is done by contractors. So we did still have logs feeding into the market even during the work stoppage. And the flip side is we also had 4 of the largest mills in the Northwest that were idle during the work stoppage. So it also hit on the demand side. So net-net, not sure it had a really significant impact 1 way or the other. I think what's going on with realizations in the West is really more of a function of what's going on with lumber prices. The West is fundamentally a tension wood basket. And I don't see that changing anytime in the foreseeable future. What's going to drive log prices is going to primarily be what's going on with domestic lumber prices and to some extent, the export markets as well. So as you've seen the lumber prices come down, you just hit a ceiling on what mills are willing and able to pay for logs. So that's going to be the primary driver. George Staphos : And last one, and I'll turn it over. Can you give us a bit more color in terms of export markets, what we're seeing in terms of fourth quarter right now, why you would be -- if you would be positive on export, again, particularly from the West, recognizing that we're going through a global slowdown. China obviously got its issues and housing remains perhaps less able to tension so you have this potential supply. What's your outlook for export out of the West realizations and what's happening right now? Good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. Well, I'll take that really in 2 different parts, so I'll start with Japan. There are some headwinds in Japan. As I mentioned, there's a fair amount of European glulam that went into the Japanese market here in Q3 into early Q4, that's a direct competitor with our customers and the dug for beams that they supply to the market. So a little bit of a headwind there. And obviously, with what the yen is doing relative to the dollar, that's an additional cost headwind for our customers. That all being said, I do think we have plenty of opportunity to move volume to Japan with the work stoppage. Certainly, their log decks have been a little bit depleted. And so we've got some volume that we need to get into that market to keep them up and running. Realizations, those are going to flow up and down depending on what's going on in the domestic market, usually get a premium to domestic, but those 2 are correlated. So as we see the domestic market realization soften, you're going to see a similar move with Japanese realizations. On the China side, we have intentionally this year been flexing volume to the domestic market to capture better premiums as the pricing softens in the West, I think we do have opportunity to move more volume into China. Notwithstanding all the issues in China with real estate and lockdowns, et cetera, we still have solid demand for our -- from our customers for the Doug fir log, so we can, we believe, move some increased volumes over to China, and those realizations will likely be comparable to domestic. George Staphos : Thank you, Devin. Good luck. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Just a quick 1 on guidance for timber prices in the U.S. South. You mentioned that you're expecting flat U.S. South timber pricing. Is that a deliberate or stumpage basis? What I'm trying to get at is I'm trying to get a sense of what's happening to underlying timber prices themselves. Timber market South and others have noted declining stumpage prices over the last 2 quarters. And that's following a number of quarters, even years where stumpage has gone up. So I'm just trying to get a sense of your guidance relative to -- your guidance relative to, I guess, stumpage pricing. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So we guide on a delivered basis. So our model is overwhelmingly delivered as opposed to selling stumpage. And you're absolutely right. There has been a little bit of a disconnect in terms of the direction of pricing in delivered versus stumpage. I think that's really largely a function of in many geographies finding logging and hauling contractors has been challenging. And so I think that's put a little bit more pressure on the stumpage market as opposed to the delivered market. And I do think that our delivered model is always a competitive advantage. It gives us the ability to really drive efficiencies throughout the supply chain, log, haul, et cetera. In this market, I think that's even more so. And we're, I think, probably picking up a little bit more margin opportunity with the delivered model versus stumpage. Mike Roxland : Got it. I appreciate the clarification. But it would be fair to say with stumpage coming down, obviously, that could put pressure on the delivered prices at some point as well, particularly if you noted that whole and harvest cost will be coming down. So I think what do you think is driving the -- looking at the -- is decline in stumpage pricing a function of what we're seeing in the overall housing market and some looseness in wood products. And how do you think that ultimately plays out to delivered pricing as well? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So if you're thinking about the South in particular, ultimately, from a mill standpoint, what they care about is what's the cost to get it to the mill. And so as we bring delivered -- a delivered model to our customers, we think we can get that price higher than they can get it through stumpage because we can deliver more efficiencies through the supply chain. Our scale and the expertise that we have at the local level to drive log and haul costs down relative to competition, I think, is what allows us to keep that delivered pricing a little higher than where you'd find stumpage pricing in terms of direction. I don't know that log and haul rates are going to be going down. I do think there's a lot of competition for that. So it's really, again, I think, a competitive advantage for us, the scale and expertise that we bring to the log and haul space with our contractor base to keep those prices lower than what others can get when they're going out and doing stumpage deals. That's what's going to allow us to keep more of that delivered price and drive that to the bottom line. Mike Roxland : Got it. That makes sense. Just 1 quick final question. Just on order files. Last quarter, you mentioned with respect to OSB, that order file was normal, a little longer lumber and that EWP was an allocation. Given what's transpiring over the last couple of months, where do they stand now? Devin Stockfish : Yes. On lumber and OSB, we're still in the normal range. It generally ranges 1 to 2 weeks in an ordinary environment. On EWP, we're still on allocation in spots. I think you're starting to see some open market purchases become available as we've seen a little softening in the single-family space, but still on allocation in spots. Mike Roxland : Got you. Good luck for the balance of the year. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Wilde with Bank of Montreal. Mark Wilde : Devin, I just want to say an opening. I mean a $395 million quarter in Wood Products is quite remarkable when you look back historically. So we're down a lot, but it's still a rather remarkable level, I think, by any standards. My question is first on the timberland side, can you just remind us in the West what your ability is to kind of flex just year-to-year kind of depending on market conditions. I know you want to continue to generate cash to cover that base dividend. You want to have some stability in terms of your contractors and keeping them employed. But what is your ability to kind of dial up and dial down depending on where the log market is? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark, I would say, in general, 5% to 10% is really the most you can go 1 way or the other. In the West, unlike in the South, where building roads is not overly complicated. The regulatory process for getting a unit laid out is not terribly time-consuming. In the West, there's a lot more that goes into it. And so we generally try to have 4 to 5 quarters' worth of roads built. So we have some level of flexibility to flex up or down. But beyond that, you do start to run into some constraints, both from an available unit standpoint, but also the contracting capacity is there's a limit to it, particularly on cable logging and some of the towers. And so there are some limits in terms of how much you can flex up. And on the downside, obviously, you can always flex down as much as you want. But as a practical matter, you do need to make sure that you're keeping your contract workforce available so that they are there when you need them coming out of whatever dip. So as a practical matter, 5% to 10% is really the max you're going to go year-over-year or any particular period. Mark Wilde : Okay. And the other question I had is just you produce lumber up in BC, you produce lumber in the Pacific Northwest. You produce lumber kind of across the [indiscernible]. I wondered if you could just give us a sense of how you see kind of regional profitability at the moment and also what you see kind of happening to those costs because low costs are coming down in BC and they're coming down in the Pacific Northwest, and it looks like that's probably going to carry into the first quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes, that's right. And I think, as you say, Mark, there are different cost structures depending on the region. No doubt, BC. is the most challenged from a cost standpoint. We are seeing a little bit of relief on the log side. October 1, log prices came down. I expect they'll come down a little bit further in Q1 of next year. But nevertheless, it's still a higher cost region to manufacture for a variety of reasons, but not the least of which is just the available timber supply in BC is challenged. And so I do think even as log prices come down in BC, it's going to be, frankly, a challenging place to make money. Now we've only got 1 mill in BC. It's our Princeton mill, it is top quartile, if not top decile cost structure mill. So I think that will give us maybe a little bit more latitude to drive profitability in a tougher market. But it's going to be challenging in BC. I think that's clearly the case. In the Northwest, we will see log prices adjust down. Mills are not going to pay more for logs than they can and still be profitable. I do think the Northwest is -- it's going to be tough for some folks to make money in a more challenged lumber environment. The last time we saw a dip in 2019, I think the costs have gone up since then. So that floor is probably higher than it was back in that last little dip in 2019. And it really just goes back to the point we've been making, to be successful in this business you have to have a good cost structure, and that's been really the focus of our strategy for a long time. So we've got some low-cost mills, some very efficient mills across our Pacific Northwest. So we'll be able to drive profitability, I think, regardless of where we are in the cycle just because our cost position relative to others in the industry. The South is a different story. As you know, Mark, just the cost structure there is -- it's a step change lower than those other 2 regions. So most producers, the vast majority of producers should be able to drive a profit in the south regardless of where we are from a lumber pricing standpoint. Mark Wilde : Okay. That's helpful. Good luck in the fourth quarter and next year. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Thanks, Mark. And thanks for pointing out just the historical context. I do think it's a really important point to make, even though prices have come down a lot. At any time over the last decade pre-pandemic, we would have been very, very pleased with the pricing that we're getting across the products. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : Devin, you had talked about in your Real Estate business, kind of the appetite for hard assets, and you also kind of alluded to, in Timberland markets, we're certainly seeing that as well and carbon being a factor as well. Given the types of valuations that are being put on, particularly some of these more recent Southern deals that are coming to market, what's your best assessment of what a typical southern acre might be going for now versus what it was 2 years ago, 5 years ago or whatever time line you think is appropriate to use? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark, and you've been around the industry for a long time, so you'll appreciate this answer. I mean it's hard to give a value on a typical acre because they vary so much depending on stocking, depending on percentage planted pine versus markets, et cetera. So it's hard to give you a specific dollar value. But what I will say, and I think you can see this in the deals that have been done over the last 12 to 18 months, we've definitely seen the values of timberlands going up. We've seen certainly some deals that are going north of $2,000 an acre, that a few years ago where you would have said maybe were $1,700 an acre deals. We've seen some mid-2000, high 2000 kind of deals lately that a few years ago would have been closer to that, too. So we've certainly seen some real, I think, price appreciation in the value of timberland deals, particularly, I would say, quality deals. When you see good, high-quality timberlands deals come to market. Those are getting very, very strong valuations these days. Mark Weintraub : And is there anything strategically that this can enable you to do? Or how does this change capital allocation, obviously, share repurchases is part of this perhaps. But anything else that this dynamic where we're in tricky times from a fundamental perspective in certain respects, but timberland valuations in private markets seem to be extremely robust. How is that driving behavior on your part? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. I think at a high level, I'm not sure it fundamentally changes how we think about things. We have been actively managing the portfolio and that is on the sell side and the buy-side for a number of years. We are always looking for opportunities to improve the portfolio. And so when we have a buyer that is willing to pay us substantially more than we think the asset is worth, then we're happy to do those deals on the sell-side. And that cash can be used for any of the capital allocation priorities that we have, whether that's additional timberland acquisitions, share repo, debt paydown, all of those things. So to the extent that this gives us an opportunity to create some capital to redeploy in other areas, that's certainly an opportunity for us. I will say just as a baseline, our view is that, in general, timberland values are going to go up over time. And there are a variety of reasons why we think that, whether it's our view on log prices over time, but really as much as anything on all of the alternative values that you can drive across timberland ownership. And so that also goes into the consideration as we think about the longer-term price appreciation of some of these assets. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Maybe just start in your Natural Climate Solutions. You mentioned your forest curbing pilot project in approvals over the next couple of months. What does that involve? And can you quantify any kind of potential economic upside from that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. On the economics, Paul, this first project is really -- it's a smaller pilot project. The economics are not going to be material. The purpose of this first 1 was really to build out the internal expertise so that we don't have to contract it out, and we get to keep more of the economics ourselves. So that's -- that's really the primary purpose of this first 1 up in Maine. The process is pretty involved. We're running that through the American Carbon registry, and it involves a series of submissions, third-party reviews, feedback from those third-party reviews, changes to the submission. So it's a process that takes a number of months, and we've been working that through over the course of this year. But I do think we've gained some really good insights on how to make this process more streamlined and quicker both with our own internal work, but also with the third-party reviewers and the submissions. And so pleased with how it's going, and I think it really is going to set us up to start scaling this to start putting more and bigger projects through the pipeline. Paul Quinn : Okay. Great. And then on Wood Products, I mean, Mark pointed at the $395 million in adjusted EBITDA, but I know that over half of that comes from from EWP and distribution, which is typically late cycle, how sustainable is that momentum that you're seeing in EWP? And why are you guiding for volumes lower in Q4? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So I mean the guide is really as much as anything, just a reflection of both kind of where we are seasonally, but also overall, just a bit of softening in the housing market. So -- maybe there's some upside there, we'll see. But generally speaking, EWP is very much a product that goes into single-family residential. And so as we think about how sustainable that is over time, again, there is a limit to how much EWP is out there. We've gone through a period where there just was not enough to cover the level of housing. During that period, we did see a number of builders that had to convert over to open web or even lumber and other products to meet their building needs. As the housing slows a bit, which I think realistically, we do expect that to happen, there will be some opportunities for us to try to convert some of that alternative back into EWP. It's just not a product where there is an overabundance of supply. And so I think that will help us hold both prices, but importantly, market share and be able to serve our customers even if we're in a [downward] [indiscernible] Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just slipping a bonus question. Just on OSB, you've got cost significantly lower going forward. Just wondering why that is. Devin Stockfish : Can you say that again? I kind of missed the last part there, Paul. Mark Wilde : Sorry, on your guidance for OSB, you have costs significantly lower in the manufacturing side. I'm just wondering what that pertains to. Devin Stockfish : Yes. It's primarily OSB, so the web stock input costs, as we've seen OSB prices go down. Most of the OSB that goes into our EWP product it does come from our internal mills and it's on a lag. Paul Quinn : Yes. Sorry, Devin. I confused you. I'm talking about the OSB segment itself, the manufacturing cost of OSB. You've got that going down in Q4. Just wondering why. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sorry. Sorry, Paul. Yes. So for OSB, specifically, that's just because we have less annual maintenance. Q3, we had a number of mills that took their annual maintenance shut down, and we don't have that in Q4. Operator : Our final question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Kurt Yinger : Great. Just 1 quick 1 for me. On the timberland side, the log pricing environment has been pretty favorable over the last 2 years, but there's also been some pretty meaningful increases on the cost side as well. As you look into 2023, are there any areas you expect to see some relief or I guess, buckets where you think you can take cost out there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. On the Timberland side, I would say the biggest driver overall has been fuel cost. That is something that plays in both on the haul side but also on the logging side. So that's had a real impact from a cost standpoint. To the extent that we see fuel costs come down over the next year to 18 months, that certainly will be a positive for us on the cost side. Beyond that, we've got a whole host of initiatives that are focused on driving down costs, whether it's -- we've got a transportation initiative to drive higher loaded mile, we've got a number of automation mechanization projects going on across timberlands to try to reduce overall labor cost. So we're always focused on that. But I would say in the near term, probably the biggest opportunity from a magnitude standpoint is around fuel costs. Kurt Yinger : Got it. That makes sense. Appreciate the color and good luck here in Q4. Operator : We have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, thank you, again, everyone, for joining us today, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a nice day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you. Mr. Taylor, you may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Melissa. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s fourth quarter 2022 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $1.9 billion or $2.53 per diluted share on net sales of $10.2 billion. Excluding special items, our full-year 2022 earnings totaled $2.2 billion or $3.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $3.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $11 million or $0.02 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding an after-tax charge of $160 million for the special items, we earned $171 million or $0.24 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $369 million. This is a 37% decrease from the third quarter and was largely driven by further softening in Wood Products markets as cautious sentiment continued to weigh on the near-term housing and macroeconomic outlook. I\u2019ll begin this morning by expressing my appreciation to our employees for their strong execution and performance in 2022. Notwithstanding a number of supply chain disruptions and dynamic market conditions over the course of the year, our teams operated safely, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful improvements across our businesses. Through their efforts, we delivered our second highest annual adjusted EBITDA on record and are well positioned to navigate a more challenged market environment entering 2023. Additionally, as highlighted on page 20 of our earning slides, we generated more than $2.3 billion of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2022, again demonstrating the strong cash generation capability in combining our unmatched portfolio of assets with industry-leading operating performance. We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.90 per share, payable on February 27th to holders of record on February 15th. When combined with our quarterly base dividends of $0.72 per share, we\u2019re returning total dividends to shareholders of $1.62 per share. Including $550 million of shares repurchase during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $1.75 billion of total cash to shareholders based on 2022 results, or 75% of 2022 adjusted FAD, which is in line with our annual targeted payout range of 75% to 80%. As summarized on page 21, we\u2019ve now completed the second full year of our new cash return framework. Upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned more than $3.8 billion in total cash to shareholders based on 2021 and 2022 results, through a combination of cash dividends and share repurchase. We continue to believe this framework will enhance our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a range of market conditions and deliver an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders. Moving forward into 2023, our cash return commitment will continue to be supported by our sustainable quarterly base dividend, which we intend to grow by 5% annually through 2025. As outlined in our cash return framework on page 19, we plan to supplement our base dividend with an additional return of cash, as appropriate, to achieve our targeted annual payout of 75% to 80% of adjusted FAD. And as demonstrated in 2021 and 2022, we have the flexibility in our framework to return this additional cash in the form of a supplemental cash dividend, or opportunistic share repurchase. With that, I\u2019ll now turn to our fourth quarter business results. I\u2019ll begin with Timberlands on pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $86 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $150 million, an $18 million decrease compared to the third quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales realizations in the West. For the full year, Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased by 13% compared to 2021. These were strong results, and I am extremely proud of the focus and resiliency demonstrated by our teams in 2022. Turning to our western Timberlands operations. Domestic log market softened at the outset of the fourth quarter, driven primarily by lower lumber pricing and ample log supply in the system. This drove domestic log pricing to lower levels early in the quarter. As the quarter progressed, log supply into the market became more constrained, resulting from a seasonal reduction in log availability. This dynamic resulted in a temporary period of log price stability into December. For the quarter, our average domestic realizations were moderately lower than the third quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were higher, as the business quickly returned to full run rate operations following the resolution of our work stoppage. We plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume from the work stoppage in 2023. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower compared to the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs were comparable. Turning to our export markets. In Japan, demand for our logs was strong in the fourth quarter as our key customers sought to replenish lean inventories resulting from our work stoppage. That said, our export sales volumes to Japan were slightly lower as work stoppage related impacts to our export program were disproportionately higher in the fourth quarter, compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations were significantly lower as broader log market softened in Japan, due primarily to an oversupply of European lumber imports, as well as lower consumption driven by reduced housing activity. Log demand from our China customers was solid in the fourth quarter, and our export sales volumes increased significantly compared to the lower levels in the third quarter, when we intentionally kept more volume in the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities. Our average sales realizations were significantly lower in the fourth quarter, as broader Chinese log markets softened due to lower consumption resulting from COVID disruptions and challenges in the Chinese real estate market. Moving to the south. Southern Timberlands adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter. Similar to the last several quarters, notwithstanding adequate log supply and softening finished product pricing, southern sawlog and fiber markets remained fairly stable during the fourth quarter. Log demand was steady as mills continued to carry higher inventory levels to mitigate potential risks from supply chain and weather challenges. As a result, our sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Fee harvest volumes were slightly higher as weather conditions remained generally favorable for most of the quarter. Forestry and road costs decreased slightly, and per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter. On the export side, our southern program to China remains paused due to ongoing phytosanitary rules imposed by Chinese regulators. While it\u2019s unclear when this issue will be resolved, we continue to have a positive longer term outlook for our southern export business to China. And in the interim, we will continue to grow our export business into India and other Asian markets. In the north, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter, due to significantly higher sales volumes as weather conditions were favorable. Our sales realizations decreased moderately. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $329 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance, and 11% higher than 2021. This was driven primarily by exceptionally strong demand for HBU properties in 2022 as well as robust energy and natural resources activity for much of the year. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $24 million to earnings. Excluding a $10 million noncash impairment charge, resulting from the planned divestiture of legacy coal assets, the segment earned $34 million in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $46 million, a decrease of $14 million from the prior quarter, primarily due to a reduction in real estate acres sold. Although HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns, we continue to see steady interest from buyers seeking the safety of hard assets in an inflationary environment. Notably, we delivered our highest average price per acre for all of 2022 on our land sales in the fourth quarter. These are high value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I\u2019ll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on page 13, full year adjusted EBITDA from this business was $43 million, a 13% increase compared to 2021. Growth during the year was primarily driven by conservation activity, with ongoing contributions from our mitigation banking and renewable energy businesses. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our emerging carbon businesses in 2022, including the announcement of our first two carbon capture and storage agreements, one of which was announced in the fourth quarter in partnership with Denbury. Similar to our agreement with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures announced earlier in 2022, the Denbury project will take several years to begin production, and we expect both projects will come on line in 2025 or 2026. Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality developers of carbon capture and storage on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future. Turning briefly to forest carbon offsets, we\u2019re nearing completion of our pilot project in Maine and expect third-party approval soon. This project serves as a proof of concept for Weyerhaeuser and positions us well to advance additional forest carbon projects in 2023. With these exciting developments, we continue to see multiyear growth potential from our Natural Climate Solutions business and maintain our target of reaching $100 million per year of EBITDA by the end of 2025. Moving to Wood Products on pages 14 through 16. Wood Products contributed $147 million to fourth quarter earnings and $197 million to adjusted EBITDA. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 50% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by continued softening in Wood Products markets and lower product pricing. For the full year, our Wood Products business generated over $2.7 billion of adjusted EBITDA, and our engineering Wood Products business established a new annual EBITDA record. Additionally, our distribution business generated the highest annual EBITDA in over 15 years. These are outstanding results, and I\u2019m proud of our team\u2019s ability to deliver this level of performance, notwithstanding numerous challenges in 2022. Turning to some commentary on the Lumber and OSB markets. Benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter showing signs of stabilization after falling for much of the third quarter. As the quarter progressed, both markets exhibited cautious buyer sentiment, resulting from a softening housing market in addition to broader concerns about the economy and inflation. Buyers maintained lean inventories and limited orders to necessity purchases through year-end. This drove benchmark prices lower for both, Lumber and OSB in the fourth quarter. As a result, the framing lumber composite pricing decreased by 24% compared to the third quarter and the OSB composite pricing decreased by 20%. That said, benchmark pricing for both projects -- products stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business decreased by $80 million compared to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations decreased by 11% in the fourth quarter with relative outperformance compared to the benchmark, resulting primarily from our regional and product mix. Our sales and production volumes decreased significantly compared to the third quarter. These decreases resulted from a combination of the work stoppage-related impacts in the Northwest, adverse weather conditions in December and challenged reliability at several mills during the quarter. As a result, unit manufacturing costs increased significantly during the quarter. Log costs were modestly lower, primarily for western logs. Specific to our Northwest mills, which resumed operations in November following the work stoppage, much of the lumber we sold in the fourth quarter was manufactured using logs purchased in the third quarter when log prices were higher. As a result, margins compressed and are expected to remain lower until we work through the higher-cost log inventories and log prices in the Northwest adjust to reflect current lumber pricing levels. Adjusted EBITDA for our OSB business decreased by $47 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 16% in the fourth quarter. Production volumes were comparable. However, sales volumes decreased slightly, resulting from weather-related disruption challenge -- weather-related transportation challenges in Canada late in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs decreased moderately and fiber costs were slightly lower in the quarter. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA decreased by $56 million compared to the third quarter. This result is directly tied to recent softening in demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. Although we often see demand for Engineered Wood Products slow somewhat during the winter months, the broader slowdown in the housing market in Q4 caused more of a pullback than ordinarily would be the case. As a result of this dynamic, our sales volumes decreased for all products compared to the third quarter. Production volumes were also lower as we elected to take temporary holiday downtime at several EWP facilities during the quarter. Our sales realizations decreased for all products, except for I-joist, which were comparable to the third quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable in the fourth quarter, and raw material costs were moderately lower, primarily for OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $18 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes, primarily for EWP products. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2023 outlook. Davie Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2023 outlook. I\u2019ll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on page 18. We generated $167 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $2.8 billion, our second highest full year operating cash flow on record. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $1.75 billion to shareholders based on 2022 results, which includes $550 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $146 million and we have approximately $375 million of remaining capacity under the $1 billion share repurchase program we announced in the third quarter of 2021. We will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.6 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $662 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. Our balance sheet remains strong with ample liquidity, and we ended the year with approximately $5 billion of gross debt. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on page 17. Unallocated adjusted EBITDA increased by $16 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO as well as benefits resulting from lower-than-expected health care expenses and increased discount rates on workers\u2019 compensation obligations. In the fourth quarter, we completed the purchase of a group annuity contract, which was approximately $420 million of our Canadian pension liabilities to an insurance carrier. The contract purchase was funded from our Canadian pension plan assets with no company cash contribution required. As a result of the transaction, fourth quarter special items included a $205 million noncash pretax settlement charge. This transaction is the latest in the series we have executed to reduce our pension plan obligations. Since we began these efforts in 2018, our pension obligations have decreased from $6.8 billion to $2.3 billion as of year-end 2022. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2023 are presented on pages 23 and 24. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the fourth quarter. Beginning with our Western Timberland operations, domestic log markets entered the first quarter showing continued signs of softening as a result of lower pricing and takeaway of finished products, along with elevated log inventories at mills. Regional log supply has improved compared to the fourth quarter and is expected to remain ample for the majority of the first quarter, notwithstanding winter weather disruptions. As a result, we expect our domestic log sales realizations to be significantly lower compared to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes are expected to be significantly higher in the first quarter as we have returned to full run rate operations following the work stoppage, which affected one month of operations in the fourth quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities. Moving to the export markets. Demand for our logs remained steady as customers in Japan and China work to build finished product inventories in preparation for seasonally stronger construction activity in the second quarter. We expect to significantly increase our export sales volumes to both markets compared to the fourth quarter, which was affected by one month of reduced export activity resulting from our work stoppage, but we also expect to shift additional volume to China to take advantage of higher-margin opportunities. That said, our export sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter as broader log markets continue to soften, resulting from the headwinds Devin previously mentioned. In the South, we expect log demand to remain fairly steady in the first quarter, although grade and fiber markets are showing signs of slight softening as we enter 2023, particularly fiber markets in the East. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. Fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower due to seasonally wet weather in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs and forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. In the North, fee harvest volumes and sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower in the first quarter. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2023, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35 million tons. In the West, we anticipate our harvest volumes will be moderately higher than 2022 as we plan to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volumes resulting from our work stoppage. We expect our Southern harvest volumes to increase moderately compared to 2022 as we resume a more normalized level of activity following reduced harvest levels resulting from adverse weather conditions, primarily in the third quarter of 2022. We expect our Northern harvest volumes will be slightly higher year-over-year. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, HBU demand has moderated somewhat in response to broader macroeconomic concerns. That said, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. We expect full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for this segment. Consistent with previous years, we anticipate our real estate activity will be heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings before special items are expected to be approximately $10 million higher than the fourth quarter, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $35 million higher, primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. Turning to our Wood Products segment. As Devin mentioned, buyer sentiment remains cautious. That said, benchmark prices for Lumber and OSB have stabilized in January as buyers reentered the market to replenish lean inventories. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter. For lumber, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and significantly lower unit manufacturing costs as we resumed operations in our Northwest mills following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. We also anticipate improved reliability across the system. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower, primarily for Western logs. For OSB, we expect sales and production volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter due to less planned downtime for annual maintenance and improved transportation networks following extreme winter weather in December. We expect fiber costs and unit manufacturing costs to be lower compared to the fourth quarter. As shown on page 25, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for Lumber and OSB are both moderately lower than the fourth quarter averages. For Engineered Wood Products, we expect significantly lower sales realizations in the first quarter, resulting from softening demand for EWP products. Sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower for solid section products while I-joist sales volumes are expected to be moderately higher. We anticipate significantly lower raw material costs, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we are expecting lower adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter due to lower margins for all products. I\u2019ll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on page 24. Our full year 2022 interest expense was $270 million. This represents a $43 million reduction from the prior year, largely due to the strategic refinancing transaction we completed in the first quarter of 2022. For full year 2023, we expect interest expense will be unchanged at approximately $270 million. Turning to taxes. Our full year 2022 effective tax rate was approximately 20%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2023, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 12% and 14% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid $566 million for full year 2022, which was slightly higher than our tax expense, excluding special items, due to the timing of Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2023 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense. For pension and post-employment plans, the year-end 2022 funded status improved by approximately $100 million, primarily due to higher discount rates compared to year-end 2021. Excluding our fourth quarter settlement charge, our noncash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense was approximately $50 million in 2022. We expect to record a similar total at approximately $50 million of expense in 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2022 was $24 million. In 2023, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan, and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $25 million. Turning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2022 capital spend totaled $462 million plus $6 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital spend for 2023 will be approximately $440 million, which includes $110 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $315 million for Wood Products and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. As we begin to wrap up this morning, I\u2019ll make a few brief comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Residential construction activity has clearly softened from the peak levels of 2022, particularly in the single-family segment. As we enter 2023, buyer sentiment remains cautious for new and existing homes and is being driven by numerous ongoing headwinds. Most notable is the affordability challenge brought about by increased mortgage rates, combined with significant increases in home prices over the last two years. In addition, we believe buyer psychology is being influenced by uncertainty related to the trajectory of mortgage rates, general concerns about the economy and falling home prices in many markets. As a result, we anticipate a more challenged housing market compared to the last couple of years, particularly in the first half of 2023. That being said, there are some signs recently that the environment may be improving. Mortgage rates have ticked down from recent highs. Homebuilder sentiment improved in January and mortgage application activity has picked up over the last several weeks. Additionally, the labor market remains fairly strong overall and household balance sheets are generally in good shape. There are still plenty of people who want a home and can still get a mortgage, but many buyers are likely to remain on the sidelines until we see some improvements, but at the very least some stabilization in certain macroeconomic and housing-related trends. I will note, however, that despite what may be a period of choppiness in the near term, our longer-term view on the housing fundamentals continue to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel. Activity in the repair and remodel market remained fairly stable in the fourth quarter and continue to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment continued to soften from the elevated levels of the last couple of years and has returned to a more normalized pre-pandemic level. In the near term, we expect stable demand from the repair and remodel segment, albeit perhaps at a slightly lower level than what we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. Looking out beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact and support our more bullish long-term outlook, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. Now, before we move into questions, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the progress we made in 2022 against the multiyear targets we set out during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on slide 22, we\u2019re progressing well on all fronts. Last year, we deployed approximately $300 million on Timberland acquisitions, including our Carolinas transaction. We grew our Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 13% compared to 2021 and announced our first two carbon capture and storage deals, and we remain on track to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025. Last year, our teams captured approximately $40 million of margin improvements across our businesses and also made meaningful progress against our other OpEx priorities. I\u2019m extremely pleased with this result, considering the inflationary pressures we experienced in 2022. We made progress against our 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target. And finally, we demonstrated our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by 5.9% and returning $1.75 billion to shareholders, based on 2022 results. So, in closing, our performance in 2022 reflected solid execution across all of our businesses. Entering 2023, our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, we have a competitive cost structure, and we are well positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions. We\u2019ll remain focused on servicing our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. My first question is, can you perhaps give us some more details on the Wood Products business based on the comments of a pickup as we came into the first couple of weeks of this year? Can you talk a bit about the supply and demand conditions on the ground as we go into the spring and the builders are obviously ramping up a bit, trying to get things closed and trying to have inventory on the ground for the selling season, and then, the opportunities for Weyerhaeuser within that, given your cost structure relative to some of your peers? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Good questions, Sue. I mean, look, we have seen a little bit of a pickup here really over the last few weeks on the Wood Products side. I think that\u2019s a reflection of a few things. Number one, going into the end of the year, most buyers really had very low inventories. And I think that was just a reflection of a lot of concern over what was going to be happening in the housing market. So, inventory levels were really low going into the end of the year. We\u2019ve seen a few, I think, green shoots on the housing side, whether it\u2019s the new home sales numbers, albeit down quite a bit from last year, up month-over-month. You\u2019ve seen homebuilder sentiment pick up a little bit. So, I think there\u2019s maybe a little bit more optimism than there was perhaps a month ago. And so, that\u2019s driving a little bit of sentiment. I think the other piece of it, which is probably even more impactful, is just on the supply side. We\u2019ve seen a fair bit of curtailment activity over the last few months up to another action this week from one of our competitors. And so, I think that\u2019s driving things to be a little bit more in balance. I do think we\u2019re probably still several weeks, if not a month, from really seeing a meaningful pickup from spring building activity. I think we\u2019ll have a better sense as we get deeper into February as how that\u2019s shaping up. But overall, it\u2019s certainly been a tougher period over the last several months. But, as we head into the spring building season, we start to see mortgage rates tick down. I think we\u2019re optimistic that it will be a little bit better than it was expected, even just a few months ago. In terms of our cost structure, that\u2019s really been, I think, one of the true success stories at this company over the last several years. The work that we\u2019ve done around OpEx just year after year after year driving improvements has put us in, I think, a very good competitive position from a cost standpoint, which is always important, and we\u2019re always focused on it, but particularly when you have these market dips, it becomes very important. So I think we\u2019re really well positioned with the scale, the cost structure that we have in place to navigate through market conditions, regardless of what they end up being for the first half of the year. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : Congratulations on the good end to the year. My two questions are around timber. There was a lot of discussion as we go into the year on I think you mentioned high-margin opportunities in China, some opportunities in Japan as well, yet there also seem to be some headwinds in terms of the market activity and ultimately, what will be realizations. Could you give us a bit more color, Devin and Davie, in terms of what we should take away in terms of the realization outlook, and why in timber in the export markets on the west? And I ask, particularly given that, at least from the day that we see and certainly there\u2019s a lag on it, exports to China on softwood are down quite a bit? My second question is can you talk a bit about the prospects for Climate Solutions to tension the timber markets, where would you expect to see the most impact and when and from which of your Climate Solutions business is in terms of ultimately helping support timber pricing in the future? Thank you, guys. And good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Thanks, George. Well, with respect to your first question and that\u2019s primarily, I think, a question about the Pacific Northwest. The dynamic is really being driven right now by lumber prices. So, as you say, I do think we\u2019re going to see a pickup in export activity out of the Pacific Northwest, both to Japan and China, particularly coming out of the Lunar New Year period, we\u2019re expecting our exports to China to really ramp back up. And so, that\u2019s going to be a nice healthy offtake and we\u2019re going to see more volume going to the export market out of the Northwest. And so, ordinarily, you would see that tension things up and support pricing. But the reality is in the domestic market, log prices are going to have to be within a range where the manufacturers can still generate a profit. And frankly, until you see those log prices come down a little bit given where lumber prices have been, that\u2019s been a real challenge. And so, I think ultimately, what\u2019s going to be the governor on pricing in the Northwest is really what happens with lumber prices. Now, if you were to see lumber prices start coming back up as we enter the spring building season and some of the weather issues in California resolve, so you see more takeaway out of that important market, to the extent lumber prices come up, then I think you\u2019ll see log prices follow. It continues to be a very tension wood basket. Regardless of lumber prices, there\u2019s just a shortage of log supply in the Pacific Northwest, and that will ultimately be reflected in log prices, particularly as we see exports pick up. But again, you\u2019re just not going to see that to the extent that lumber prices stay at a lower level. So, that\u2019s the answer on the log side. Just in terms of the Natural Climate Solutions business and tensioning log markets, I think, candidly, we\u2019re still a ways away from that. The primary tool for doing that is going to be on the forest carbon side. I do think over time that is going to be a big opportunity, not just for us but for other landowners. But we\u2019re still in the early innings, I think, of that market developing. You can read the commentary on it. I think as a whole, the market is still figuring out exactly how these carbon markets are going to work. So, that\u2019s still probably got a little bit of time before that has any real material impact. And frankly, I do think just remember, there\u2019s lots of forest land in the United States. So I think that\u2019s probably still a ways out before that becomes a real issue. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Devin, in lumber, you talked about, I think, the very large number of curtailments that we\u2019ve seen in BC. And I was wondering, in aggregate, do you have a sense if there are still kind of meaningful curtailments to go, or has that maybe sort of run its course and was more sort of a seasonal -- the seasonal actions with lumber, maybe back above 400, could we see some of that capacity coming back? I was just wondering if you could kind of talk about how the dynamic in BC could play out this year, assuming we\u2019re somewhere close to current lumber prices. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, look, I\u2019ll just say at the outset, it\u2019s hard for me to comment specifically on the cost structure of my competitors. So, I\u2019ll just offer some broad commentary because we obviously do have some operations in BC. And I think certainly, we\u2019ve seen a fair amount of capacity curtailment. I don\u2019t think that was unexpected, just given the higher cost structure that you see in British Columbia now. A variety of reasons for that, and we\u2019ve discussed that in the past. I think the curtailment activity is just going to be dependent on where lumber prices go. I think for where we were for much of the fourth quarter, particularly at the end of the year, it would be very challenging for the economics to make sense in British Columbia. Now, we\u2019ve seen prices come up just a little bit. As you know, the log price adjustment mechanism does happen quarterly, so that will adjust down a little bit. But, it remains a very high-cost region to manufacture lumber. And so, lumber prices are going to have to stay well north of probably the historical averages for the economics to work in that geography. And I\u2019d say too in the Pacific Northwest for that matter. The log cost to lumber ratio that we\u2019ve seen recently has been pretty challenging for the Pacific Northwest. And so, I suspect there are a number of producers that have been challenged in this environment as well. So, until you see lumber prices go up or log prices go down, the economics are challenging, and you could see continued curtailment activity. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then just following up on George\u2019s question on Natural Climate Solutions. If you look at the kind of the work streams and the different activities there, whether it\u2019s wind or solar or forest carbon or CCS, is there a sense that sort of partner interest and adoption is maybe progressing faster than expected or maybe slower than expected if you look at those different categories compared to when you kind of first unveiled those targets at your Analyst Day? And are there any sort of obstacles or pain points as you pursue some of these projects? Just curious if there\u2019s any additional color there. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I would say, on balance, the interest level has gone up since we first announced this target. And that\u2019s really true across the board, whether you\u2019re talking about conservation, mitigation with all the infrastructure activity that\u2019s going to happen over the next several years, there\u2019s going to be a lot of need for mitigation banking, carbon capture and storage, particularly with the 45Q tax credit going up to $85, solar wind, forest carbon. There\u2019s really a very significant amount of interest across all of those categories. The challenge is the time line to get these things to come to fruition. And that\u2019s true, particularly when you talk about the renewables, you think about solar. The demand for solar is off the chart. The challenge is every one of these projects has to go through a local permitting process and to get tied into the grid. And there\u2019s just way more activity than there is administrative support to make that happen. So, the time line for these things, carbon capture and storage, et cetera, it\u2019s just going to take time for these things to come to fruition. But I would say our confidence in the opportunity set in Natural Climate Solutions is higher today than it was when we announced these targets in 2021. It\u2019s just the time line. That\u2019s the big question. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Ketan Mamtora : Thank you, and good morning. Within your sort of the Wood Products CapEx outlook that you talked about for 2023, can you talk about sort of two or three key projects that you have for this year? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, a couple of things I would highlight. Part of our program, and this has been the case with the exception of our Dierks project, our Millport project and the Holden project that\u2019s ongoing currently. The vast majority of our projects are not really big enormous capital projects, they\u2019re replication projects that are -- whether it\u2019s a merchandiser, a new gangsaw, a new CDK, I mean, those are the kinds of projects that we\u2019re really doing across the system. And so it\u2019s all about going in mill by mill according to a multiyear road map, finding the roadblocks and bottlenecks and taking those out so that we can drive down costs, improve reliability, drive efficiencies and then obviously, there\u2019s some come along volume that is a part of that as well. So, it\u2019s not any particular big project other than Holden, which we did start up the sawmill at the end of last year, we\u2019ll be starting up the planer mill later this year. So, that project is going well. But other than Holden, there\u2019s not any particular project that I would really highlight. It\u2019s just a number of projects, all of which are largely replications of things that we\u2019ve already done in other facilities. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Devin. And then, just very quickly, we are starting to see kind of more European lumber make its way into the U.S. Do you think that there is more room for that to grow in 2023? Devin Stockfish : I think that\u2019s potentially the case around the margins. We\u2019ve certainly seen more European lumber coming into the market. So, on a percentage basis, year-over-year, it might look like a lot. But relative to the overall North American consumption, it\u2019s still a pretty small percentage. And so, even if we do see a little bit of a pickup in the near term, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to fundamentally impact the overall supply-demand dynamic. The one thing I would say is, over time, I would expect that European lumber supply to go down somewhat for a couple of reasons. Number one, with the beetle kill and the fires, et cetera, that we\u2019ve seen across Central Europe, there are a number of years that you\u2019re going to see elevated harvest levels to work through that salvage. But ultimately, that fiber supply is going to go away. And then the second piece being just with the bans on the Russian and Belarus lumber coming into Europe, if Europe is in a normal state, you would expect more of that European lumber to have to stay domestic. Now obviously, that\u2019s not the case because of the general economic conditions in Europe right now. So you still have, I think, a fair bit of that lumber coming into the U.S. But in any event, over the longer term, I would expect that to moderate, if not go down. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. One question, and I\u2019m certainly not projecting that this would be the case. But if markets were very weak in a given year and it ended up that your FAD wasn\u2019t at a level where even at 75%, you would meet the base dividend, would you still meet that? Or again, just it\u2019s not even in the contemplation universe right now, so you haven\u2019t really assessed that question. Davie Wold : Yes. I mean, look, Mark, we\u2019ve -- when we established the dividend framework, we looked at a number of different scenarios in establishing the level where we were going to put that base dividend and we feel confident in our ability to meet that. And I think coming back to some of the things we\u2019ve been doing with that base dividend being tied primarily to the Timberlands and Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources businesses, the Carolinas acquisition, for example, that helps us have confidence in our ability to increase that base over time and meet that and additionally, the work we\u2019ve been doing in the Natural Climate Solutions business to increase that target over time, along with our day-to-day commitment to OpEx and innovation. So I would say that gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to meet that over time. Mark Weintraub : Sure. And then just philosophically, is it fair to say then that if there were for whatever reasons, there was this short-term issue that led to a shortfall that you would cover it with the high degree of confidence you have that over time, it\u2019s a very, very manageable number, is that fair? Davie Wold : Yes, absolutely. Mark Weintraub : Two other quick ones. One, Devin, you talked about price realizations, Pacific Northwest and kind of the drivers there for the Timber business. In the South, we\u2019ve seen obviously, packaging demand has also been quite weak recently. And you laid out kind of some of the challenges in housing. Is that just a much stickier in pricing framework? So, what do you expect to see in the U.S. South for realizations as the year proceeds? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Mark. I mean, first of all, you\u2019re absolutely right. With the South, it\u2019s just a much less volatile pricing dynamic than you see in the West. So you\u2019re not going to see those big quarter-over-quarter, year-over-year swings in pricing in the South. I think when we look out to 2023, particularly the first half, I do think we\u2019re going to see some moderation in terms of the pricing dynamic, probably be down just a little bit. And that\u2019s a reflection of a couple of things. One, we do see end market pricing softening, and that\u2019s true both on the Wood Product side but also the pulp and paper side in general. But I think the bigger issue is one of the drivers in the South that\u2019s been keeping prices high the last couple of years has been a general -- I would call it, urgency on the behalf of mills to keep high inventory levels of logs. And that was really just to mitigate downside risk because of the supply chain challenges, trucking, logging capacity, et cetera. So, I think that was a little bit of a support mechanism for pricing over the last couple of years. I still don\u2019t think we\u2019re in a place where you have an overcapacity of logging or hauling capacity in the South, but it\u2019s eased around the margin. So, I expect pricing to soften just a little bit, broadly speaking, across the South in the first half. But the trajectory of pricing in the South, we still believe will be up over time with capacity additions and all the same drivers that have been really kind of pushing that up over the last couple of years. Mark Weintraub : And lastly, just real quick. So, we have seen more of a bounce in lumber than OSB. Is that just because it overshot more and you\u2019re getting some more of the supply response in BC, or -- any other thoughts as to why that\u2019s happened to date and any perspective you have kind of going forward? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, I think that\u2019s exactly right, Mark. I think it\u2019s largely a function of the supply response. OSB is a little different. Unlike Lumber where you can take a few shifts here, a few ships there, OSB is pretty lumpy in terms of capacity coming on and off, and you just haven\u2019t really seen that. So, I think that\u2019s really the primary difference. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Thank you, Devin, Davie and Andy for taking my questions. First one, just wanted to get a sense from you on -- your thoughts around China and potential for exports, particularly given how China has eliminated its COVID restriction. So, is there the potential -- are you seeing the potential for even greater demand to the country now that they\u2019ve -- reducing those restrictions around COVID? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, I mean, the short answer is yes. I think as they come out of the COVID restrictions, that will create more opportunity. But just for a little more context, China has been an interesting market of late. There have been a lot of puts and takes. Demand clearly has been down primarily as a result of the COVID lockdowns, but also just a broader shakeup in the real estate industry in China. So, I\u2019d say on balance, log demand, lumber demand in China has been down of late. But there have also been a lot of supply impacts as well. So with the Russian log ban, the Australian log ban, I think you\u2019re seeing some of the European log flow from the salvage activity start to wane a little bit. So, there have been, I think, impacts on both sides of the ledger. For us specifically, we\u2019ve got long-term customers. The demand for us was actually higher than the volume that we sent there last year. And as we\u2019ve said, that was really just a function of capturing the better margin opportunities domestically. As those two have come a little bit more into balance, freight costs have come down, we are anticipating ramping up our China volume into Q1. And that\u2019s -- I think that would be the case regardless of what\u2019s going on in China, just because our customers need that wood. But I do think coming out of the Lunar New Year in China, you\u2019re going to see log and lumber demand pick up. They\u2019ve been in a relative soft spot for a while. So, I think there\u2019s going to be plenty of opportunity for us to ramp up our export volumes to China. Mike Roxland : Got you. I appreciate the color. And then just on the repair and remodel markets, obviously, you reiterated this quarter that it\u2019s held up pretty well thus far in the professional segment. If you look back historically, there is a correlation between single-family housing starts -- or housing starts in general and repair and remodel -- typically repair and remodel follows housing starts by a couple of quarters. Wondering if you have any insights into the cadence of repair and remodel during 4Q? And whether that -- with activity is really steady or maybe it sort of started to decline as the quarter progressed? And then just quickly, with all the repair and remodel that has occurred over the last several years of people working from home, what gives you the confidence that R&R should continue to persist going forward at an elevated rate? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, in repair and remodel, I think there are a number of variables at play. And to some extent, it makes it a little bit harder to forecast than normal. I do think most of the drivers behind strong repair and remodel that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years are still in place. You\u2019ve got homeowners with a lot of equity. You\u2019ve got an aging housing stock. A lot of these older houses are smaller and have different layouts than some of the newer homes. So, I think that provides an incentive for homeowners to upgrade and add on to existing older homes. I think the other dynamic that\u2019s somewhat new with so many people having refinanced mortgages at lower rates to the extent that keeps them in existing house rather than going out and purchasing a new home at a higher mortgage, I think that could be also a catalyst for more repair and remodel activity. Now, of course, as you mentioned, historically, buying and selling a home is one of the times people often do repair and remodel projects. And so, that could be a little bit of a headwind to the extent that activity dies down a little bit. So, lots of puts and takes. But I think we\u2019re still expecting solid repair and remodel activity this year, albeit probably a little bit lower than we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. But we\u2019re still seeing good activity. Now, to your question about how did that trend in the fourth quarter, I mean there\u2019s always a little bit of seasonality when you get into the cold months. You\u2019re not going to be having people build decks in December like they would be in the spring. So, there\u2019s a seasonality impact. But on balance, we\u2019re still seeing solid demand and would expect that to continue in 2023. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Paul Quinn : Just one question, just to sneak it under the hour on lumber. You\u2019ve got the goal of growing it by 5% a year, and I appreciate the strike impacted and sales volumes were down a little bit over 5% in \u201822. But in the U.S. South, was your production up 5% in \u201822? Devin Stockfish : Yes, it wasn\u2019t. And when we talk about that multiyear goal and so just to reiterate, that\u2019s getting to 5.7 billion board feet by the end of 2025. We are doing the work year-to-year through our capital programs to get to that level. Now year-to-year, the production will vary depending on what\u2019s going on. And you look at what happened last year between COVID, the strike, a number of other issues that we dealt with last year with supply chain, labor, et cetera, we did see our production volume reduce year-over-year. But, the underlying projects that build the capacity within the system to accommodate 5.7 billion, we\u2019re still on track for that and expect to get there. But again, year-to-year, it will just depend on what the market dynamics are in terms of actual production. Operator : Our next question comes from the line of Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Kurt Yinger : Great. Thanks, and good morning, everyone. Just starting on the share repurchase side. I mean, do you expect to take your foot off the gas at all given what\u2019s likely to be a much leaner at least near term on the cash generation front to kind of ensure you can accrue some cash for a supplemental dividend next year, or how do you think about matching buyback activity with underlying cash flow as the year progresses? Davie Wold : Yes. You bet, Kurt. So, we\u2019re constantly evaluating how we think about share repurchase, the dynamic process, looking at all the factors, really, it comes back to weighing all the options available to us and allocating the capital in a way that creates the most long-term value for shareholders. So, as you know, we were active in 2022. We did $550 million of share repurchase, progressing well against our overall authorization. And as we\u2019ve demonstrated, we\u2019ve got the ability with our cash return framework to allow us to supplement the base with either the cash dividend or share repurchase. So, looking ahead to 2023, our process for evaluating it remains the same. I will note, of course, that with our cash return framework, to your point, the amount of cash committed to return to shareholders is going to flex up or down year-to-year based on the amount of FAD generated. But really, as we think about it from a framework perspective, from how we evaluate it, all that remains consistent, and we\u2019ll continue to assess repurchases along with all the other priorities available to us and report back to you quarterly on our activity. Kurt Yinger : Okay. Makes sense. And then, just on EWP, could you maybe put some numbers or a range around kind of what you\u2019re thinking on sequential pricing in Q1? Obviously, there\u2019s a lot of quarter left, but it is a product where you should have greater relative visibility than the commodity. So, any thoughts there would be helpful. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, as you know, the EWP market is most closely tied to single-family housing. And so, as we\u2019ve seen that market slow, it has had an impact on EWP demand and you could see in our quarterly numbers in terms of production, we did take some extra holiday downtime to try to better match that. So, I think as we think about pricing generally, it\u2019s always trying to balance market share, margins, operating posture, et cetera. We did take -- we did implement a targeted price reduction in EWP. We\u2019ll kind of see how the rest of the quarter plays out to determine what that pricing trajectory looks like. Probably not going to give specifics on the pricing just for competitive reasons, but I would note, we\u2019re still obviously above pre-pandemic levels. And to the extent that we see housing start to pick up again, we feel like we\u2019re in a really good competitive position with our Engineered Wood Products. Operator : Our final question this morning comes from the line of Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Devin, I wanted to talk a little bit about Timberlands, the overall kind of sentiment there. As we think about the cyclical versus the secular trends coming into this year, what is the overall appetite and sentiment there for those assets? And are you seeing any differences by region? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, I think the reality, and we\u2019ve seen this really over the last couple of years, and my expectation is this is going to continue. There has been a lot of interest in the Timberlands asset class. And that\u2019s from the traditional players, the REITs, the TMOs, the private integrators, just a lot of interest there. But we\u2019re also seeing interest come in from some new types of investors. And I think that\u2019s really driven a lot of activity. Last year, we were over $5 billion of Timberlands transaction activity. Our expectation is we\u2019ll still be north of $3 billion for this year. So, just a lot of interest there. And I think there\u2019s a few things. Number one, we have seen log prices trending up a little bit, so that could be driving some of it. But I think the bigger piece is just a lot more interest in the ESG properties of owning timberlands in an environment where there\u2019s so much focus on climate. I think, they\u2019re starting to be a better realization and recognition of some of the alternative values that are inherent in owning Timberlands, and that\u2019s renewables, carbon, real estate, et cetera. So, just a lot of interest there. My expectation is that\u2019s going to continue into 2023. Our view is that the trajectory for Timberlands is very positive in the years to come. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, I think that was our last question. So, I\u2019ll just say thanks to everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may now begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s first quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $151 million or $0.21 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 million. Adjusted EBITDA was $395 million, a 7% increase over the fourth quarter of 2022. These are solid results, and I\u2019m pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our team despite various market and weather-related challenges throughout the quarter. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I\u2019ll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $120 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $188 million, a 25% increase compared to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased $33 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes in domestic and Chinese markets and lower per unit log and haul costs. These favorable results were partially offset by lower sales realizations. Turning to the Western domestic market. Demand and pricing for domestic logs faced downward pressure at the start of the first quarter. Mills reduced consumption in response to lower pricing and takeaway of finished products and we\u2019re carrying elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, log consumption increased as end market demand improved, but log supply was constrained by consistent winter weather conditions. This dynamic drove log inventories to lower levels and cause log pricing to stabilize. For the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were significantly lower than the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest and domestic sales volume as well as per unit log and haul costs improved in the first quarter as we return to full run rate operations following the work stoppage in the fourth quarter. First quarter harvest activity included a portion of the deferred volume resulting from the work stoppage, and we remain on track to capture the majority of the deferred harvest volume in 2023. Forest and road costs were also seasonally lower. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan continued to soften in the first quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were moderately lower compared to the fourth quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. In China, log inventories at the ports declined during the quarter and daily takeaway increased as construction activity improved following the Lunar New Year and in response to the recent lifting of pandemic-related restrictions. As a result, log demand from our customers remained solid in the first quarter. Our sales volumes increased significantly compared to the fourth quarter and we intentionally flexed additional volumes to China to take advantage of improving market conditions in the first quarter. Our average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter aided by improved ocean freight rates and a favorable exchange rate. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Despite reduced log consumption in response to lower finished product pricing and demand, southern sawlog and fiber markets remain fairly balanced during the first quarter as log supply was constrained by wet weather conditions. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes increased slightly despite the adverse weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower in the first quarter, and forestry and road costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA in the North was comparable to the fourth quarter. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $53 million to first quarter earnings and $89 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $43 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily due to a significant increase in real estate acres sold, partially offset by a decrease in royalty income from our Energy and Natural Resources business. Similar to prior years, our real estate activities in 2023 and are more heavily weighted towards the first half of the year. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels, as we continue to benefit from steady demand for HBU properties. Despite broader macroeconomic headwinds, buyers continue to seek the safety of hard assets, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $95 million of earnings in the first quarter and $148 million of adjusted EBITDA. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a 25% reduction from the fourth quarter, largely driven by continued softening in wood products pricing. Regarding the lumber and OSB markets, benchmark prices for both products entered the first quarter showing signs of stabilization after receding in the back half of 2022. Pricing for both products increased slightly through early February in response to stronger-than-expected demand for housing and buyers replenishing lean inventories. The increase was more pronounced for lumber as supply concerns weighed on the market following a series of mill curtailment announcements, particularly in British Columbia. As the quarter progressed, overall buyer sentiment remains cautious. As adverse weather impacted homebuilding in several regions and in response to ongoing concerns about inflation and the economy, despite lean inventories, orders were limited to necessity purchases through quarter-end. And benchmark prices for both products were generally range bound. I would note, however, that prices for both products have trended higher as we\u2019ve moved into the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for our lumber business was comparable to the fourth quarter. Both the framing lumber composite pricing and our average sales realizations decreased 9% in the first quarter. Our sales and production volumes increased significantly versus the fourth quarter which was impacted by the work stoppage at our Northwest mills. Reliability also improved across the system. With increased production in the quarter, unit manufacturing costs improved significantly. Log costs were comparable to the fourth quarter. OSB adjusted EBITDA decreased by $32 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to the decrease in commodity pricing. Our average sales realizations decreased by 20% in the first quarter, largely in line with OSB composite pricing. Sales volumes were significantly higher as production volumes increased from less planned downtime for annual maintenance and transportation networks improved following adverse weather conditions late in the fourth quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and fiber costs improved moderately during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for Engineered Wood Products decreased by $28 million compared to the fourth quarter due to softening demand for EWP products. As a result, our sales and production volumes and average sales realizations were lower for most products in the first quarter. That said, we have seen a recent uptick in our order activity and our current realizations remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the fourth quarter and raw material costs decreased primarily for OSB web stock. Adjusted EBITDA for distribution was comparable to the fourth quarter as higher volumes and lower operating costs were offset by a decrease in realizations for EWP and commodity products. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Davy to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. David Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I\u2019ll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with approximately $800 million of cash and cash equivalents and total debt of approximately $5 billion. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong. And we reinforced our flexibility in the first quarter by extending the maturity of our existing $1.5 billion revolving credit facility to 2028. In the first quarter, we generated $126 million of cash from operations. It\u2019s worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $71 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased by 5.6% to $0.19 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $660 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2022 financial results. We returned $35 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the first quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $31.25. And as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $660 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $6 million compared to the fourth quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO, as well as the absence of non-recurring in healthcare and workers\u2019 compensation items that were benefits in the fourth quarter. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18. In our timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023. Beginning with our Western Timberlands operations, domestic log markets were fairly tensioned at the outset of the second quarter driven by improved pricing and takeaway of finished products leaner than normal log inventories and log supply constraints due to persistent winter weather conditions. As the quarter progresses, we expect further improvement in log demand and an increase in log supply as the weather improves seasonally. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to remain fairly stable throughout the second quarter. That said, we anticipate the quarterly average will be lower compared to the first quarter as log prices have fallen since the beginning of the year. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be significantly higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower, partly due to lower fuel prices. Moving to the export markets. Starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on log demand in pricing. We expect these conditions to persist through the second quarter. As a result, our Japanese sales volumes and realizations are expected to be lower compared to the first quarter. That said, we expect European lumber inventories normalize as the year progresses, which should increase demand for our logs in the Japanese market. In the meantime, we are shifting a certain amount of logs to our internal mills to capitalize on domestic market conditions. In China, construction activity and log consumption continue to improve following the Lunar New Year and the lifting of pandemic related restrictions. That said, log imports from New Zealand have increased significantly following the disruption in the first quarter due to cyclone activity. This dynamic is likely to put downward pressure on log pricing until excess inventories are cleared. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. We anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we direct logs to domestic customers to capture higher margin opportunities. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to remain fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improves with drier weather conditions and mills bolster inventories in response to weather related challenges in the first quarter. Southern fiber markets are expected to soften as a result of end market demand in pricing. Despite improving weather conditions, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of fiber logs as thinning activity increases following wet weather conditions earlier in the year. With a higher percentage of fiber logs, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the first quarter. Per unit log in haul costs are expected to decrease slightly as a result of lower fuel prices. And forestry and road costs are expected to increase seasonally. In the North, our sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower than the first quarter, and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower as we enter the spring breakup season. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing steady demand for our real estate properties and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect earnings will be comparable to an adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million lower than the first quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2023, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for both lumber and OSB have been fairly stable quarter-to-date, but we are seeing signs of increased demand for Wood Products as we get further into the spring building season, while channel inventories remain lean. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the first quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are slightly higher than the first quarter average. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating rates at our Northwest mills return to a more normalized level, reliability improves across the system and inflationary pressures continue to ease. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the first quarter, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our oriented strand board business, sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. We expect slightly lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to more planned downtime for annual maintenance in the second quarter. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly lower. Turning to our engineered wood products business, as Devin mentioned, we have seen an uptick in order activity quarter-to-date, and we expect steady demand as the quarter progresses. As a result, we anticipate significantly higher sales volumes for most products compared to the first quarter. That said, sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. We anticipate moderately lower raw material costs for most products including for OSB webstock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the first quarter due to improved sales volumes. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, David. Before wrapping up this morning, I\u2019ll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our view on the housing market is largely unchanged, and we still anticipate a somewhat more challenging backdrop in 2023, compared to the last couple of years. We\u2019ve clearly seen some softening from the peak levels of 2022 as home buyer sentiment remains cautious. That being said, there have been some positive signs lately that the housing market is holding up better than we anticipated at the beginning of the year. Specifically, we\u2019ve seen improvements in home builder sentiment, an increase in new home sales, and an uptick in single family starts over the last couple of months. Additionally, the labor market and household balance sheets are generally in good shape and inventory of existing homes for sale remains well below historical levels. Putting this all together, we continue to believe that underlying housing demand is solid. As we saw in the first quarter, there are buyers willing to step back into the market in response to lower mortgage rates and home builder incentives. Ultimately, we\u2019ll need to see further rate reductions combined with a stable to improving U.S. economy before the housing market fully returns to the levels of the past few years. However, not withstanding any near-term headwinds, we continue to maintain a positive and constructive longer-term view on housing fundamentals supported by strong demand, favorable demographic trends, and a significantly under-built housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel, where activity remained fairly stable in the first quarter and continued to be supported by steady demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment has largely normalized a pre-pandemic levels. Looking forward, we expect customer demand to be bolstered to some degree by prospective home buyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. Lower commodity building product prices may also support repair and remodel activity in the near-term. And in any event, we continue to have a bullish longer-term outlook for repair and remodel demand supported by strong home equity levels and an aging housing stock. In closing, we delivered solid operational and financial performance in the first quarter. We remain as focused as ever on operational excellence in supporting our customers to drive industry-leading margins. In addition, we remain committed to returning cash to shareholders. During the quarter, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% and returned more than $830 million to shareholders through base and supplemental dividend payments, as well as share repurchase activity. Looking forward, we remain constructive on the longer-term demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our business notwithstanding the current macroeconomic headwinds. Our financial position is exceptionally strong, and we are focused on delivering superior operating performance across our unmatched portfolio of assets, as well as enhancing shareholder value through disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Anthony. Anthony Pettinari : Devin, as you look at Southern log prices, are you seeing any regional trends worth calling out and I guess specifically, over the past few years as Southern log prices have seen some strength I think we saw maybe stronger price appreciation in some of these coastal regions versus inland regions. Now that log prices appear to be kind of moderating a bit. I\u2019m wondering, are you seeing those coastal regions holding price better or ultimately are they may be giving up kind of more of the gains that they\u2019ve had and maybe acting with a little bit more volatility? I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any trend that you would call out. I\u2019m just kind of curious what you\u2019re seeing and maybe how your portfolio is positioned there. Devin Stockfish : Yes, Anthony, good question. As we think about the southern sawlog pricing dynamic, as you say, there are certainly regional differences and we\u2019ve seen that play out over a number of years. As you mentioned, the Atlantic coast and we think about that from North Carolina, really all the way down through Florida and Georgia, certainly been a stronger market. I think there are a couple of things at play there. To some extent, the sawlog market is also impacted by the pulpwood markets on the coastal region. As you think about a lot of these mills and where they source logs, if you\u2019re next to the ocean, your sourcing radius is only about 180 degrees versus 360. And so that tightens up some of those markets and I think that bleeds into sawlogs and certainly I think that\u2019s been one of the drivers of lay for what you\u2019ve seen those prices tick up. We\u2019ll see if \u2013 with a little softening in the fiber markets, if that wanes a little bit more. But I think more broadly, as you mentioned, we have seen some capacity coming into the south and certainly that\u2019s benefited us in some of the markets where we have large fee holdings, you think Mississippi, southern Arkansas, some spots in Louisiana. What we have seen is as new capacity comes into a particular wood basket, we see an uplift on sawlog prices and we expect that to just continue to be the case as more capacity comes into that region. And I think the other thing at play of late has been, and this is particularly true, I\u2019d say over the last 18 or so months, there\u2019s just been a bit of a constraint on log and haul capacity, and I think that\u2019s another driver for why you\u2019ve seen a little bit of an uptick in sawlog prices just as mills wanted to maintain inventory, so they didn\u2019t lose out on the high lumber price opportunity. I would say that the haul capacity has probably gotten a little bit better here, as we\u2019ve gotten into 2023. But over the long-term, I continue to think you\u2019re going to have constraints on both log and haul capacity across the south just as labor will continue to be an issue. So the net-net, as we are seeing regional differences. Will we see the Atlantic coast come down a little bit more perhaps, but on balance, we still feel pretty optimistic about the trajectory of southern sawlog prices in the years to come. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. And then just on Natural Climate Solutions, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any kind of update you can give us in terms of level of interest and engagement and maybe how you\u2019re tracking towards that $100 million EBITDA target for 2025. Or if there\u2019s any kind of specific projects or work streams that you feel like are moving faster or slower than expected. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think the good news is there just continues to be an increasing level of interest across really all parts of that Natural Climate Solutions business. That\u2019s true with renewables, solar, wind, a lot of interest and activity there. It\u2019s true with mitigation banking. We\u2019ve seen certainly a lot of interest in carbon capture and storage in the forest carbon markets. So I think we\u2019re as optimistic as ever about the trajectory of growth over time with that business. And that\u2019s really, like I say, true across to every component of that Natural Climate Solutions business. I think the trick continues to be managing the timeline to get these projects to fruition, and that\u2019s unfortunately the case across each of those different businesses, whether it\u2019s the permitting and getting tied into the grid across the renewable section \u2013 sector or just the timeline to get for us carbon projects through the process of a third-party audit. And I think that\u2019s going to continue to get better over time as more resources go into the system. But it\u2019s really a question of timing more than magnitude, but we\u2019re really optimistic about the long-term opportunities across really each of those businesses within Natural Climate Solutions. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Operator : Our next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ketan Mamtora : Thank you. Good morning, Devin and Davie. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. David Wold : Good morning. Ketan Mamtora : First question just related to Anthony\u2019s earlier question. Devin, any update on the main carbon offset project, how that\u2019s coming along and when do you anticipate kind of \u2013 sort of incremental information around that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So I feel like we\u2019re right at the goal line. We\u2019ve had all of our materials and responses into the third-party auditor for quite some time. I think one of the things that we\u2019ve come to appreciate in this space is that there are not enough third-party auditors really to manage the magnitude of carbon credits that are coming to market. I do think that\u2019s something that will be resolved over time. But that\u2019s really been the bottleneck for us as we\u2019ve tried to move that through to the end game. I think we should have something here shortly and we would anticipate in the very near future getting those credits issued and then hopefully start selling those for us carbon credits. But I would say also, we\u2019ve also learned some things through the process that I think should help us scale this program going forward. So more to come on that, hopefully, in the very near future. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. And Devin, when you say very near future, I would still assume that to be kind of 2023, is that fair? Devin Stockfish : Absolutely. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. And then just switching to capital allocation. I\u2019m curious kind of your approach towards share purchases, especially in the context of broader capital allocation. In a year like 2023 where cash generation will be kind of hit by lower both product prices. Obviously, you guys have laid out the base and the supplemental portion. I\u2019m just curious kind of how do you approach share purchases here? David Wold : Yes, sure. Thanks. I mean, we have \u2013 as we\u2019ve said for a while now, we believe share purchase is a useful tool in the right circumstances and certainly we\u2019re fortunate to have a number of capital allocation levers, including M&A investing in our business and adjustments to our capital structure. So the current share price, share repurchase is an attractive lever, but we\u2019re constantly weighing that in light of all the alternatives and the overall backdrop. And we\u2019ve been quite active, repurchasing shares since we announced our increase to our authority in fall 2021, making our way through about two-thirds of that $1 billion authorization, including about $550 million last year. So as we moved into 2023, the process really remains the same, but to your point with the cash return framework, the amount of cash committed to be returned to shareholders is going to flex up or down year-to-year based on the amount of adjusted FAD generated. So in light of the economic environment we saw to start the year with the relative choppiness and housing, it\u2019s important to be disciplined and balanced as we deploy our cash over time, weighing all the market conditions and those available levers and ultimately allocating the cash in the way that creates the most value for shareholders. So in summary, I\u2019d say the evaluation process remains consistent. We\u2019ll continue to assess share repurchases along with all the other capital allocation options and report out our activity quarterly. Ketan Mamtora : All right. Now that\u2019s helpful perspective, I\u2019ll turn it over. Good luck. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. David Wold : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. David Wold : Good morning. Susan Maklari : Our first question is on the DIY segment of the R&R market. Devin, I know you gave some comments there on the activity that you\u2019re seeing. But as we get into the spring, what\u2019s the tone from your customers there and how are you thinking about the spring playing out? Devin Stockfish : Yes. On balance, we\u2019ve seen pretty solid demand. I would say, just for context, Q1 is always a little bit softer from the DIY segment just because people aren\u2019t doing R&R projects in the northern regions this time of year. I would say in the south, we\u2019ve actually seen the activity up a little bit year-over-year as we feed into the big box retailers. It\u2019s been a little lagging in the west, I would say, year-to-date, but that\u2019s starting to pick up. So on balance, we\u2019re still expecting a very solid year from the DIY segment. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to be at the same levels that we saw during the peak of the pandemic, but certainly very strong relative to pre-pandemic levels. Susan Maklari : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. And then looking at the EBITDA margin in lumber and OSB, it was really impressive given what you\u2019re seeing from a pricing perspective. And it does seem like it reflects some of the benefits of the productivity initiatives that you have put in place in the last couple of years. How are you thinking about the production cost going forward, just given the various puts and takes there? And with that, is there any update generally on OpEx 2.0? Any thoughts on how you\u2019re progressing against the $175 million, $200 million target for 2025? David Wold : Sure. Well, at a high level, I think the benefits of this OpEx program that we\u2019ve been undertaking for a number of years are really reflected in the Q1 numbers as you said in a very challenging market, we were still able to deliver positive margins across all of our businesses. And I think just from a relative operating performance standpoint, that\u2019s really, really served us well and has been a core part of our operating strategy for quite some time. We are progressing, I think, quite well to that $175 million to $250 million target. And I would say, I\u2019m particularly pleased with the progress we made last year. We generated $40 million of OpEx in an environment where we saw historically high levels of inflation. And so that was quite a headwind to navigate through. I think this year as we see some of the turnover starting to go back to maybe a more normal level and inflation comes down, I feel very good about the tailwinds that we\u2019ll have from an OpEx standpoint. And I think it\u2019s just a real testament to the teams that we have all across the organization that are staying focused on improving how we operate every day, trying to innovate everywhere we can and serving our customers to make sure that we\u2019re not just maintaining industry level \u2013 industry leading margins, but we\u2019re growing that over time. So really pleased with the efforts there. Susan Maklari : And any thoughts just on those production costs for lumber and OSB as we get into the spring? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I think as we look across the key cost elements of each of those businesses, the labor piece has remained elevated. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s increasing at the clip that we\u2019ve seen over the last several years, but it still remains at an elevated level. But besides labor, I would say on balance, we are seeing some progress in having that inflationary pressure kind of back off a bit, whether it\u2019s fuel, energy, resins really across the board we\u2019ve seen some of the fiber costs come down. So we are seeing some of those inflationary pressures start to wane and I think that will be a tailwind for us as we get through the year as well. Susan Maklari : Okay, great. Thank you for all the color and good luck. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. Kurt Yinger : I wanted to start out on the EWP business. I mean, it\u2019s been a really nice source of stability kind of in spite of volatility in commodity markets. Realizations there held in better than we expected. Looks like you\u2019re expecting some additional pressure in Q2, but could you talk about how you\u2019re thinking about profitability there over the next couple quarters and maybe give a little bit more color on what you\u2019re seeing on the volume side after maybe some destocking issues the last couple quarters? Devin Stockfish : Well, I think not surprisingly, given that EWP\u2019s primary market is single family construction. We did see softening in EWP demand as we got into Q4 last year. And that really flowed through into Q1. As you say, I think to a large extent, as the housing market softened last fall, the inventory levels across the channel probably built up a little bit more than expected. And we certainly saw in Q1, many of our customers had to work through some existing inventory. And so we adjusted our operating posture down to more \u2013 to be more reflective of the demand environment. And that I think together with just a little bit of softening on the price side is really what you saw reflected in the Q1 EBITDA numbers for EWP. But again, as we step back and look at this business from a high level, we\u2019re still at pricing that\u2019s well above historical levels, pre-pandemic levels. And I think as we get deeper into the spring, we\u2019ve seen our order files start to build. Certainly, I think what we\u2019ve seen going on recently with single-family construction in particular starting to get a little bit more optimistic about how that\u2019s going to be playing out in the months to come. So we\u2019re going to be increasing our production in Q2 as Davie mentioned. Not \u2013 still not up to the levels that we\u2019re running full out, but certainly above where we were in Q4 and Q1. And I think that will continue to trend in the right direction as we get deeper into the year, assuming that housing continues with this momentum. So we feel really good about the business. It\u2019s a quality product. We have great service and I think really a lot of customer loyalty and so we\u2019ll continue to serve our customers and as single-family housing continues to recover that business will be in really good shape for us going forward. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Make sense. And then just second on southern log pricing. I guess as you look over the next year, do you think we\u2019re kind of in a situation where maybe you see kind of a slow bleed in realizations absent or real inflection in demand? Or from where you sit today, any kind of confidence in the idea that things could really level out in the near-term at all? Devin Stockfish : I think our view is that it\u2019s going to stay fairly stable for most of this year absent a material change in market dynamics. That\u2019s certainly our view from a saw log perspective. I think there\u2019s probably a little risk with respect to fiber logs just given in markets in the pulp and paper space have softened a bit and so there may be a little softening here until that stabilizes and firms up. But for the saw log prices, our view is it\u2019s going to stay pretty consistent over the course of this year. And then as the market improves overall going forward, a lot of the same drivers for that log price appreciation we\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years should kick back into gear and we still feel pretty optimistic long-term that we\u2019ll see that gradual price increase across the saw log portfolio. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. Appreciate all the detail, Devin, and good luck here in Q2, guys. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. David Wold : Thanks, Kurt. Operator : Our next question is from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning guys. Just following-up on this real estate, energy, natural resource, especially the natural climate solutions looking for the extra color on the carbon project. But where are we at with the \u2013 you signed two deals of a carbon storage. Just wondering how that permitting is going for those companies that you\u2019re involved with? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I think it\u2019s progressing as expected. As we said before, there\u2019s a fair amount of work to do between signing the deal, an actual first injection, you\u2019ve got to prove out the data, which has been underway and that\u2019s progressing well, the permitting and ultimately building out the infrastructure. But I think from a timeline standpoint, things are progressing as expected and we continue to believe, we\u2019ll see first injection in late 2025 or into 2026. But I think a big part of why we chose those two partners is they\u2019re both very well equipped to manage through the process and the timeline. So we think it\u2019s progressing on plan. Paul Quinn : Okay. Thanks for that. And then just switching over to wood products. If I look at 2023 whole year, what are we tracking for lumber volumes? Is this \u2013 last year was down, are we going to go back to 2021 levels? And especially on the OSB side as well, it looks like you\u2019re tracking at record levels for 2023. Devin Stockfish : Yes. For lumber, we\u2019ll definitely be up year-over-year. Sitting here today, it\u2019s probably kind of a mid-single-digit, high-single-digit percentage wise improvement year-over-year. And remember, last year there were some things going on around the strike in the Pacific Northwest and frankly with some of the labor issues probably the production was down as a result of that to some degree as well. So we should see that improve in 2023. And then from an OSB standpoint, that should be up slightly as well. Paul Quinn : All right, that\u2019s all I had. Best luck. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Real quick on the OSB pricing, you show current up $5 versus the 1Q average. And by my math, when I look at the Random Lengths pricing it\u2019s up more like $45 or $50. And is that just because what you\u2019re showing is really where prices were three or four weeks ago given your order files? Or is there something else that might be going on that would depress the type of uptick you would expect to see in OSB pricing? Devin Stockfish : No. You hit on it exactly, Mark. It\u2019s just a function of when you have a three to five week order file, it takes time for the current prices that are reflected in Random Lengths to flow through to realization. So there\u2019s a lag on the way up, but then there\u2019s also a lag on the way down, so it nets out to be the same, it\u2019s just a timing issue. Mark Weintraub : Got it. Okay. And then a question on the U.S. south, a couple of questions on the timber markets and where they may be going. Of course, you don\u2019t just grow trees, you also consume logs and making lumber. So I was hoping to get a sense as to what your net position on saw logs might be, and if there\u2019s a difference regionally if you are net more long in the Carolinas or the Atlantic Coast versus in some of the Mississippi, Arkansas, Louisiana baskets, that would be super helpful. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, that\u2019s a really good question, Mark. I think from our standpoint, we have 7 million acres across really all of the major markets across the south. Unparalleled diversification. I think generally speaking, we have peer leading scale in every market. So, I think as we move forward in a world where we think saw logs are going up, I think we\u2019re really well positioned going forward. And as you know, there\u2019s just been a lot of new capacity coming into the south. And I think \u2013 and we\u2019ve seen this in markets where new capacities come in that\u2019s pushed up saw log prices. So as we think about how does that impact our business as a whole going forward, I think it\u2019s positive. First on the timberland side, we are a net seller of logs. So on balance, we generally sell between 40% to 50% of our grade fee logs in the south to our internal mills. So that means the remainder of those logs go to third-party customers. So higher saw log prices in the south will have a net benefit to warehouser on those third-party logs. Now obviously, higher log prices also have an impact on wood products manufacturing as that\u2019s a key input cost. But I think again, the integrated model that we have is going to help us in that respect. So the manufacturing side as those saw log prices increase over time those logistics and efficiency benefits that our manufacturing operations enjoy today on the fee timber that we supply is going to become even more important in maintaining industry leading margins. And you can just look to the Pacific Northwest for an example of that. So I think on balance, we feel very good about that. Obviously, there are regional differences, but I would say outside of the Southeast, we have manufacturing operations in every other wood basket. So, most of those dynamics will play out very similarly. And I think, all in, if you want to look at log prices and where they\u2019re going, I think, with our business to scale the integrated nature, we\u2019re going to be the premier investment vehicle to leverage increasing southern sawlog prices into the future. Mark Weintraub : Okay. That\u2019s super helpful. Just one follow-up, you mentioned that you use about 40%, 50% of your logs go to your own mills. Do you buy much from the outside for your sawmills? Devin Stockfish : We do. So generally speaking, our internal mills are going to get 50% of their logs from our fee timber, and then they will buy the remaining 50% from third parties. Mark Weintraub : Okay. So you\u2019re kind of moderately net long. Is that a fair, if I just do that \u2013 if I do the math in my head, it would suggest you\u2019re moderately net long saw timber in the U.S. South. Is that fair? Devin Stockfish : Correct. Yes. Mark Weintraub : Okay, super. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Please proceed with your question. Buck Horne : Hey, thanks. Good morning. Quick question on the lumber markets and just kind of one of the wild cards that\u2019s kind of probably affected prices this year. I\u2019m just wondering if you could help us characterize what\u2019s happening with the European wood import that have either hit domestically and or impacting international markets. Do you see a peak of some of that European wood out there? Or how long will it take to work through some of that inventory that\u2019s hitting the domestic market? Devin Stockfish : We certainly have seen an uptick in particularly the European lumber hitting the U.S. market. And I\u2019ll speak to Japan here in just a moment as well. I think that\u2019s a function really of a couple different things. First, if you look back over the last couple of years, clearly the lumber pricing dynamic in the U.S. made it a very attractive place to send wood. And so even overcoming the logistics and transportation costs, it was a margin positive move to get lumber from Europe into the U.S. market. Even as lumber prices have come down in the U.S., I think to some extent it\u2019s still probably the best margin opportunity for some lumber because the European demand has really come down with all of the dynamics that are going on there. And so, I think you\u2019re going to see European imports come down a little bit in 2023, probably not dramatically, however, until you start to see the European economy and European demand pick up. We did see in Japan a pretty significant slug of lumber hitting that market at the end of 2022. And as Davie mentioned, that has put a little bit of pressure on the Japanese market for our customers and our log deliveries. We have started to see the European volume coming into Japan Wayne [ph]. And so we expect that excess inventory of European lumber to work down here in the second quarter. And we should be back into a more normalized position as we get into the third quarter. I think over the long term though, Buck, the reality is with the beetle infestation issue that they\u2019ve had in Central Europe, that volume is rapidly becoming less viable, I think as the Russian imports of lumber into Europe. Assuming that those don\u2019t come back in a material way in the near future. The overall dynamic is going to be the Europeans will have to keep more lumber in Europe in a normalized circumstance. And so I think this is a short-term issue that will resolve itself in the not too distant future. Buck Horne : Very helpful color. I appreciate that. And then shifting to \u2013 you mentioned capacity that\u2019s come into the U.S. South in terms of mill production. Can you help us maybe characterize in terms of like how quickly some of that capacity is coming online in the U.S. South? Is that \u2013 is the growth rate that you\u2019re seeing faster and are we bringing in more lumber capacity in the U.S. South than we\u2019re \u2013 I guess replacing that\u2019s being curtailed in Canada? Or how do you see that dynamic in terms of what\u2019s being added domestically versus what\u2019s coming out to Canada? Devin Stockfish : Yes. There has certainly been a lot of new capacity coming into the South. But we\u2019ve also seen a lot of capacity coming out of BC. I suspect there will be more to come. If you just step back and look at the overall amount of new lumber capacity into the U.S., it\u2019s really not a significant amount over the last several years. Now we\u2019re continuing to see new mills come in and new announcements, although that\u2019s probably slowed just a little bit over the last six to nine months because of what\u2019s going on in the broader economy. But I think a good way to think about it is, you\u2019re going to see 1 billion, 1.5 billion board feet come into the South more or less every year for the next little bit. But I think you\u2019re going to see a comparable amount come out of British Columbia just given what\u2019s going on and the dynamic there. So net North American lumber editions, I\u2019m not sure it\u2019s going to be all that much really. Buck Horne : Very helpful. Appreciate that. Thanks guys. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Thank you. David Wold : Thanks, Buck. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi, guys. Thank you. Thanks for getting me in late. Just a couple quick questions here. Number one, Devin, Davie, can you remind us or call out what the headwind factors, the strikes, the weather, what that might have taken away from fourth quarter and perhaps aided operations specifically in wood products during the first quarter? And similarly, were there any things that specifically or particularly went well for you on operations within the wood segments during the first quarter because performance there was well ahead of our forecast even with the decline in realizations? Second question I had, all my other ones have pretty much been asked. Can you remind us what you\u2019re seeing in terms of log inventories in China at the ports? I seem to remember that inventories remain pretty elevated. But the outlook seems to be relatively stable to construct it from your vantage point. So I just want to see what the interplay is between inventories at the ports and what you\u2019re saying? Thanks so much and good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes, George. So, maybe I\u2019ll take China first and then comment briefly on the lumber piece. From a China standpoint, the latest published numbers from an inventory standpoint in China were down. However, what we saw on the ground in April is a number of ships that were coming over from New Zealand with wood that had been delayed post cyclone. And so I think the inventories in the next published number are going to be up a bit. And I think we\u2019ve also seen some very low quality European logs in that market that they\u2019re trying to get rid of more or less at fire sale prices. And so I think here in the very near term, it\u2019s just going to be a little bit softer environment as they work through some of that inventory. That being said, the takeaway has really started to pick up here as we\u2019ve come out of the Lunar New Year. I think as we get out past this period of working through some of this inventory that support at the moment, we\u2019re feeling pretty good about the back half of the year in China. I think that will be a nice flex opportunity for us out of the Pacific Northwest. On the lumber side and Davie may have the specific numbers in terms of the Q4 impact. But I would say beyond the strike impact, the one thing I would point out is just as we get into an environment where, as I mentioned earlier, turnover is starting to lessen a little bit more stability. We\u2019ve got the transportation networks that are starting to get a little bit more, I would say healthy and so. On balance, the business just ran better overall in Q1. And I think that\u2019s really again a testament to the work that our teams are doing and what\u2019s still a relatively challenging environment. David Wold : Yes, George. I just call out the impact in Q4 would have been pretty negligible based on where margins were at that point in time of the work stoppage. I mean, we had a marginal amount of cost associated that may have offset those marginal piece of additional income there. So not really much there. I just call out just another great example of the work we\u2019ve done over time on our cost structure and the OpEx performance of the team to deliver a great quarter in challenging market conditions. George Staphos : So Davie on a going forward basis, obviously, there\u2019s going to be seasonality and \u2013 but if we hold pricing constant, this is pretty much a good baseline for operations and for our own margin forecast on a going forward basis, would that be fair? David Wold : Yes, I\u2019d say so. As Devin referenced earlier, we\u2019ve seen some easing on the inflationary side with the labor piece still kind of being persistently strong. But across the board in terms of the other costs, we\u2019re seeing some nice signs of easing there. So I think this would be a reasonable baseline moving forward. George Staphos : Understood. Very good performance. Thanks guys. Good luck in the quarter. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, George. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : Okay. Well, thanks to everyone for joining us this morning. And thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. As forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $230 million or $0.31 per diluted share on net sales of $2 billion. Excluding special items, we earned $238 million or $0.32 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $469 million in the second quarter. This is a 19% increase from the first quarter and was largely driven by an increase in wood products commodity pricing and strong EWP sales volumes. Notwithstanding elevated mortgage rates, we've been encouraged by resilient demand for new homes this year, which provided a nice tailwind for our Wood Products business in the second quarter. We delivered solid results in the quarter, and I'd like to thank our teams for their collective efforts and focus on safety, operational excellence, and continuing to serve our customers. Before moving into our business results, I'd like to comment briefly on a Timberlands transaction we completed earlier this month. As we reported yesterday, we acquired 22,000 acres of high quality Timberlands in Mississippi for approximately $60 million. This acquisition is comprised of highly productive timberlands strategically located to deliver immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser timber and mill operations. With a mature age class and well stock timber inventory, we expect these timberlands to generate strong cash yields. Additionally, the acquisition offers incremental real estate and natural climate solution opportunities in the future. This transaction is a great example of our ongoing efforts to enhance our portfolio with high quality, well managed timberlands that generate solid returns for our shareholders. As highlighted on Page 22 of our earnings slides, we continue to make great progress against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $360 million against this target, including the recent Mississippi transaction and the acquisitions in the Carolinas and Washington, which were completed in 2022. Turning now to our second quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $104 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $172 million, a $16 million decrease compared to the first quarter. This was largely driven by lower average sales realizations for export logs in the west. Turning to the western domestic market. Favorable weather conditions during the quarter supported increased log supply across the region. Log demand improved as mills returned to more normalized operating levels in response to strengthening lumber prices and later in the quarter, took precautionary measures to bolster log inventories ahead of wildfire season. These dynamics kept log prices fairly stable during the second quarter. And as a result, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly higher than the first quarter as a result of favorable operating conditions. Domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we intentionally shifted logs to the domestic customers to capture higher margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs improved in the second quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. Moving to our Western Export business. In Japan, log markets continued to soften in the second quarter in response to elevated inventories of European lumber imports as well as lower consumption driven by reduced post-and-beam housing activity. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were lower compared to the first quarter, and our sales volumes were comparable. As we look forward, we expect European lumber inventories in Japan to normalize in the coming months, which should increase demand for our Douglas Spur logs into the Japanese market later in the year. In China, log markets softened in the second quarter in response to an influx of log supply from New Zealand combined with the reduction in log takeaway at the ports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were lower compared to the first quarter. Our sales volumes were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market. Turning to the south. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was $79 million, a slight reduction compared to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained fairly balanced in the second quarter as log supply improved with drier conditions and mills bolstered log inventories following weather-related challenges in the first quarter. In contrast, Southern fiber markets softened in response to elevated inventories of logs and finished goods at mills as well as lower overall demand for pulp and paper end market, in products. Given favorable operating conditions, our thinning activity increased in the second quarter, resulting in a higher mix of fiber locks. As a result, our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter, and our fee harvest volumes were comparable. Per unit log and haul costs were slightly lower, primarily due to lower fuel prices and forestry and road costs were seasonably higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $52 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $70 million, a $19 million decrease compared to the first quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased significantly in the second quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to make progress on our forest carbon pilot project in May. In the second quarter, we completed the third-party audit process and submitted the project to the American Carbon Registry for final approval. Once approved, we expect an initial issuance of approximately 30,000 credits in year one, and we're currently developing two additional projects in the U.S. South. We remain focused on positioning our credits to capture the highest value possible in the marketplace. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $218 million of earnings in the second quarter and $270 million of adjusted EBITDA. Second quarter EBITDA was an 82% improvement from the first quarter largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB sales realizations and strong sales volumes for engineered wood products. Starting with lumber. Adjusted EBITDA was $51 million in the second quarter, a $43 million increase over the prior quarter and largely driven by improved sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for lumber held fairly stable in April and May as sentiment remained cautious. Buyers mostly limited orders to necessity purchases despite lean inventories. By mid-June, overall sentiment and benchmark pricing improved in response to stronger housing activity, perceived risks to supply from Canadian wildfires and announced mill curtailments also bolstered buying activity in June. For the quarter, the framing lumber composite was comparable to the first quarter while our average sales realizations increased by 6% with the relative outperformance driven by our regional mix and product mix. Our sales volumes were moderately higher compared to the first quarter as our Northwest mills returned to more normalized operating levels. Log costs were slightly lower, primarily for Western logs and unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher during the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $15 million compared to the first quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing, slightly offset by higher unit manufacturing costs related to planned and unplanned downtime. Benchmark pricing for OSB entered the second quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by lean inventories and steady demand from new home construction activity. As the quarter progressed, buyer sentiment and benchmark pricing continued to improve as Canadian wildfires disrupted supply and in response to improving residential construction activity. As a result, the OSB composite pricing increased by 21% compared to the first quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 11%. This relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes were moderately lower in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance and a temporary period of unplanned downtime related to wildfire activity near one of our facilities in Alberta. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $62 million or 76% compared to the first quarter. This result is directly tied to improving demand for EWP products which are primarily used in single-family home building applications. As a result, our production and sales volumes were significantly higher for most products in the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved significantly for solid section and I-joist products. That said, our average sales realizations were lower for most products as supply and demand continue to rebalance across the broader EWP market. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Raw material costs decreased for all products in the second quarter. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $12 million compared to the first quarter, a 55% improvement as the business benefited from strong EWP sales volumes in the second quarter. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook. David Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I will be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $496 million of cash from operations in the second quarter and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.8 billion. In May, we took advantage of attractive capital market conditions and issued $750 million of debt due in 2026 and at a coupon of 4.75%. This debt issuance prefunded the majority of our 2023 maturities. And due to the shape of the yield curve, we were able to reinvest these cash proceeds in the interim at interest rates in excess of the bond coupon. As a result of this transaction, our full-year 2023 interest expense will increase by $10 million to approximately $280 million. That said, this increase will be more than offset by the interest income earned on the invested issuance proceeds. In mid-July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay our $118 million, 78% note at maturity, and we intend to use the remainder of issuance proceeds towards our December 2023 maturity. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $81 million. We returned $139 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend which was increased in the first quarter by 5.6% to $0.19 per share. In addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.59 and as of quarter, our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. As highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the second quarter totaled $415 million, and we have generated $470 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Looking forward, key outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $25 million lower than the second quarter of 2023. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations. Domestic log demand was steady at the outset of the third quarter in response to improved pricing and a way of lumber and as mills continue to build inventories ahead of wildfire season. That said, absent fire-related disruptions in the region, log supply is expected to remain ample as the quarter progresses, largely driven by a seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. As is typical during the warmer and dryer months, we have transitioned in the higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity. As a result, our fee harvest volumes will be moderately lower in the third quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher as we do a significant amount of this work during the summer months and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower, partly due to a decrease in fuel prices. Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, we anticipate our Japanese sales volumes will increase compared to the second quarter due to the timing of vessels, and we expect our sales realizations to be comparable. In China, elevated log imports from New Zealand and reduced log consumption continued to have an impact on the Chinese log market. We expect these conditions to persist through the third quarter. As a result, our sales realizations into China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and we anticipate our sales volumes will be significantly lower as we flex logs to domestic customers to capture higher-margin opportunities. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter and fiber markets to soften further. This is being driven by a seasonal increase in log supply, elevated mill inventories and softening demand, particularly for pulp and paper products. That said, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. Our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter and will include a higher mix of fiber logs as increased spinning activity continues. With a higher percentage of fiber logs, we expect our sales realizations to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Demand for our real estate properties remain steady, and we continue to anticipate a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the third quarter, we expect earnings will be slightly higher and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million higher than the second quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full-year, we continue to anticipate adjusted EBITDA of approximately $300 million for the segment and now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year. For our Wood Products segment, benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand relatively lean inventories and the prospects of supply disruptions following an early start to wildfire season in Canada. As shown on Page 21, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are well above the second quarter averages. Assuming this pricing dynamic remains intact for the balance of the third quarter, we expect our Wood Products financial results to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter of 2023. That said, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we anticipate third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly lower than last quarter. For our Lumber business, we expect moderately higher production and sales volumes in the third quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. For our oriented strand board business, we expect production and sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. Unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher and fiber costs are expected to be comparable. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. As Devin mentioned, we continue to see improving demand for EWP products, and this has extended our order activity well into the third quarter. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to increase slightly compared to the second quarter. Notwithstanding this dynamic, we anticipate slightly lower sales realizations as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. That said, third quarter EWP prices are expected to remain substantially above pre-pandemic levels, and we'll continue to adjust in response to demand signals from the homebuilding segment, which has seen more strength of late, particularly for single-family construction. Raw material costs are expected to be higher compared to the second quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the second quarter. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our view on the housing market has become incrementally more positive over the last several months, supported by improvements in homebuilder sentiment and increase in new home sales and an uptick in single-family starts. Despite elevated mortgage rates, we continue to see resilient demand from the homebuilding segment largely driven by the historically low inventory of existing homes, a strong labor market and solid household balance sheets. That being said, there continues to be a degree of uncertainty around the trajectory of mortgage rates in the broader U.S. economy. As a result, we still expect to sign starts in 2023 to be lower than the last couple of years. But again, our outlook has become more positive as the year has progressed, and there may be incremental upside if mortgage rates move down from the high 6% range. And longer-term, we remain quite optimistic on housing fundamentals supported by favorable demographic trends and significantly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel market. Activity strengthened slightly in the second quarter and has held up well year-to-date, largely supported by solid demand from the professional segment. Demand from the do-it-yourself segment was steady in the second quarter and is largely normalized to pre-pandemic levels. Near-term, we expect stable demand from this segment as prospective homebuyers may choose to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in a higher mortgage rate environment. And longer-term, we continue to believe the repair and remodel market will be an important demand driver for our businesses, supported by strong home equity levels and an aging housing stock. In closing, our teams delivered solid operational and financial results in the second quarter. In addition, we continue to make meaningful progress against the multi-year targets we set out in 2021 through strategic Timberlands acquisitions and the advancement of our Forest Carbon business. Looking ahead, we're encouraged by recent improvements in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. We remain focused on operational excellence and innovation, driving industry leading margins and supporting our customers. And with our strong financial position, our unmatched portfolio of assets and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we're well positioned to drive long-term value for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We'll now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Thank you everyone and good morning. Thanks for the details. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. George Staphos : How you doing Devin? I want to start off on SG&A, and I guess, relatedly, all things you're doing to manage costs at the company. Your cost management, at least from our vantage point, has been commendable. Again, year-to-date SG&A really hasn't moved much. Are there any cost pressures, though that you're looking at '24, '25 that you'll need to manage against that or maybe building and we'll see a little bit more movement to the upside there in future years? What do you think about that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, first of all, I say thanks for the recognition, George. As you know, this is work that we've been doing day in, day out for a number of years to stay focused on cost. And it's a never-ending journey to keep control on costs and particularly over the last few years with all of the inflationary pressures. I think in terms of what we're doing on a day-to-day basis, it's just incorporated into our planning and our operations to daily focus on keeping our costs down. I think we are seeing, from an overall inflationary standpoint, not specific to SG&A, but just overall, we are seeing some of our cost pressures starting to wane a little bit, fuel, energy, resin, waxes, things of that nature. But on the SG&A front, labor costs, those are sticky, and those inflationary pressures are something that we continue to have to manage. In terms of the primary focus areas over the next several years, I think it's largely more of the same. I think labor costs will continue to be something that we'll have to manage closely. But beyond that, I think it's a lot of the same things that we've been doing over the last several years. I don't know, Davie, would you like to add anything to that? David Wold : Sure, Devin. I would just point out that this goes back to everything we've been doing for a number of years on OpEx. And as we look forward, our focus on OpEx and continuing into innovation, and everything we're working on every day, we expect that to be a lever for us over time to continue to manage costs and drive those down into the future. George Staphos : Okay. Thank you. Two follow-ons and I'll turn it over very quickly. So given what's been a nice pickup in demand over the course of the year in Wood Products, recognizing it wasn't so strong earlier in the year. Are timber prices in the south for sawlogs where you would have expected them given that backdrop? Why aren't we seeing more lift recognizing, again, it's a market-by-market, very local market, but are timber prices in the south for sawlogs, where you would have expected given the backdrop, why or why not? And then can you give us a bit more color in terms of the normalization, the factors that you're seeing in supply/demand, in EWP, particularly in trust choice and why we're not seeing more of a lift higher given the favorable single-family outlook? Thank you guys. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I'll start with the sawlog question in the south. And I think we've seen over the last several years, some uplift on sawlog pricing. And we've been talking about this for a long time, a lot of new capacity coming into the south and certainly, what we've seen in those geographies where we've had new capacity or expanded capacity. We have seen those markets tension and we've seen upward pressure on pricing. I think this year, there are a few things going on. For the first half of the year, I think sawlog prices held up pretty well, at least in the markets that we participate in. I think unlike the fiber logs, which have seen a little bit more pressure just because of what's going on in the pulp and paper industry, the sawlog market has held up pretty well. I think there is a nuance going on there with respect to the availability of transportation. One of the things that we saw over the last couple of years was just a real shortage of trucking capacity. And I think that put a little bit of an uplift on pricing just as mills, particularly strong lumber markets. We're making sure that they had adequate log decks as that trucking capacity has loosened a little bit. I think some of that pressure has come off. As we think about where we are in the year, it's not a typical to see a little downward pressure on log prices just because in the summer months, and the drier weather, you have more supply hitting the market. So that's the dynamic at play. I do think over time and again, just going back to my point earlier, as we see capacity continuing to come into the region you are going to see continued pressure and tensioning across the South. So I think the trajectory is still what we had expected. And certainly, I think we're optimistic over the next several years as these mills continue to come into the region that you'll see continued upward price pressure. You'll have ups and downs seasonally like we always do, but the overall trajectory, I think, still looks positive. With respect to your question around EWP, I think if you really want to understand what's going on today, you have to look back a couple of quarters and just think about the trajectory of what's happened. As we got into late last year and early 2023, we had a fair bit of destocking going on. So you combine that with the lower residential construction activity and it really put the EWP market in a softer place earlier in this year. And so that was really the story in Q1. As you remember, we did dial back our production in EWP to address that. I think we have a pretty good customer base. We have a strong product. And so as that market started to recover, there was good demand for our product. And we certainly saw that over the course of Q2 moving into Q3, but the reality is, in Q1 and Q2, just as those markets rebalanced, we had to take pricing action as everyone else did, just to make sure that we were competitive in each individual market. There's generally a time lag in terms of those pricing actions, whether you're raising prices or lowering prices. And so some of what you're seeing in Q3 is just the lag effect of pricing actions that we had to take earlier in the year. I would say, on balance, the market is recovering nicely. Our order files are back to the place where they're fairly extended. We're even on allocation for a few products at this point. So the market is stabilizing, but each individual market has its own dynamics, and we'll make pricing action where necessary to make sure we're competitive. But I think directionally, we feel pretty good about where EWP is and the trends that we've seen lately. George Staphos : Thank you, Devin. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. David Wold : Good morning. Kurt Yinger : I know it wasn't a huge impact for you guys in the quarter, but could you just talk about some of the derivative impacts from the wildfires up in Canada in terms of just operating your facilities there, logistics and transportation and the role that has perhaps played in some of the pricing strength that we've seen in the last two to three months? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I'll give you an update on our operations, specifically and then mention more or less the impact that it had on pricing in the market. So in terms of the impact to us, we had two of our three mills in Alberta that were impacted. We had a lumber mill and our OSB mill that both had to take about two weeks downtime each as the fires caused evacuations in those local communities. And so the net impact to us from a financial standpoint was relatively minor, sub $4 million for the quarter. I think the bigger impact, though, as you mentioned, was just with all of the fire activity, it did cause some concern around supply, particularly, I think on the lumber side. And I suspect that was part of what drove some of the pricing activity to the upside in lumber as we got into June and early parts of July. So I think the real impact was on the overall lumber market and just kind of the concerns around supply availability with the fires. I would say from a transportation standpoint, it did obviously have some impact but I would say, not material. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. That's helpful. And then just two quick ones. First, could you talk about what you're hearing and seeing in terms of European lumber imports into the U.S. kind of for the back half of the year as well as on the timberland side, the pipeline of opportunities that you see and just kind of your outlook in terms of potential additional bolt-on or larger scale transactions going forward? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, with respect to European lumber, we certainly saw a higher-than-normal amount of volume coming in late last year, early part of this year. Ordinarily, I would say, European lumber volumes don't have a meaningful impact on the market. I do believe earlier in the year with the amount of volume that was coming in, particularly on the East Coast, it probably did have some impact on the supply-demand dynamic and probably push pricing down just a bit. We've seen the volumes of imports really starting to wane here over the last several months, which makes sense as the lumber prices have come down, it's less economically viable for some of that wood to come to the U.S. So our expectation is we will see lower volumes. I think you'll still have some degree of European volume coming into the market as many of those producers want to maintain that supply chain and give them the ability to flex depending on what's going on here versus in Europe but I suspect it will be a lower volume coming in for the back half of the year. As we think about the M&A market on the timberland side, as you probably have noticed, it's been lighter this year than it has been over the last few years. I think last year, you probably saw in the neighborhood of $5 billion of transaction activity. We're certainly trending much lower than that this year. And that's really, I think largely a function of A, probably some pull forward from last year, a pretty heavy year. I think there's probably a piece of this, too, that as the market is trying to figure out how to price carbon and ESG options in this space, perhaps some are holding out with the view that prices are going to continue to go up. So we'll see what the back half looks like, but we're expecting it to be a lighter year this year than it has. We're always in the market. That being said, as you saw with the Mississippi transaction. We'll continue to look at every deal that comes to market. We'll continue to have conversations with parties to see if we can do deals outside of the auction process. It's a competitive market, but I think there will be properties where we're very well suited to make those acquisitions and deliver returns for our shareholders. Kurt Yinger : Okay, thanks for the color, Devin and good luck here in Q3 guys. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. David Wold : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : My first question is, Devin, can you talk just a bit about the production levels and the inventory that you're seeing at the mills just across lumber as the builders are gearing up and adding that starts on the ground, how are you thinking about overall lumber inventory out there? And maybe what could that mean for your ability to hit that 5% annual growth target that you've set out there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So the first part of the question in terms of inventories, I'd say on balance in the lumber space, inventories are on the lean side, not nearly as lean as OSB, but I'd say leaner than normal. I think what's going on right now is there is adequate supply coming on. And so people are feeling more comfortable with those lean inventories. And as you know, typically, the August time frame is a period where you see a little bit of pullback in demand, particularly on the R&R side just because of the heat of the summer, people are less inclined to build a deck if it's 110 degrees outside. So I think you have some normal, seasonal demand pullback just on the R&R side. But in terms of what that leaner inventory looks like is as you get into the Fall, if buyers continue to carry lean inventories and certainly, our inventories at the mills are on the lean side as well. If you get into the Fall when that R&R activity picks up and you have strong single-family homebuilding, we've seen what happens there, particularly if you have some sort of supply shock maybe from fire season or some other thing happening, that can really push pricing up fairly quickly. And we saw that even just in June with the fire activity in BC, what that can do to pricing. So I think it all depends on if we see repair and remodel activity pick backup in the Fall as we normally do and the builders continue to build, which is what we're expecting, that could be a nice setup for Fall pricing in lumber. In terms of our ability to meet the 5%, there are going to be puts and takes every year. What we're doing is we're doing the work with building the capacity. So the CapEx projects, the improvements in reliability, et cetera, that we need to do to hit that target. Last year, obviously, we were down a little bit because of the strikes in the Northwest. This year, we did dial back production a little bit just because lumber demand has slackened a little, particularly in the Northwest and BC. So we'll see what the ultimate production number is for the year. But ultimately, we're doing the work from a capacity and an operations standpoint to support that 5% per year. Susan Maklari : Yes. Okay. That's very helpful color. And then I guess, as you do think about some of the dynamics that are going on in the lumber market from both a supply and demand perspective, how do you think about where pricing can go as we think about the back half of this year and probably even in the first half of next year, given what the builders are talking to and looking to add on the ground. And maybe how is that different from what happened in the last few years that could either put a floor or a ceiling in terms of the upside potential around the pricing? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean I'll offer the caveat that lumber pricing is very, very hard to predict as we've seen over the last several years. I would say, if we look back over the pandemic era, I don't know that I would necessarily look at $1,000 lumber prices as being something we're going to see very often. That was a result of just a number of factors coming together at the same time, all of the supply chain disruptions, et cetera. So I'm not sure that's how you should be thinking about things. As we think about where lumber prices are going to go in the Fall, it's really a function of, A, what's going to happen on the supply side. And I think we're going to continue to see puts and takes there with the additions in the South, the capacity coming out of British Columbia, that dynamic, I think is going to continue to play out. And then it's just really a function of what happens with homebuilding and repair and remodel. Our view is the homebuilders have done a remarkable job of managing and navigating an environment with higher mortgage rates. They seem to be pretty optimistic in the conversations that we're having with them. So my expectation is the back half of the year even with high 6% mortgage rates or even 7% mortgage rates is that we're still going to see strong single-family building, which will be supportive. And then it's the question of R&R. And we've seen pretty strong demand out of that segment just as a data point. Year-over-year, our second quarter into the home improvement warehouse market was actually up. So we continue to expect that to be a strong market. And as the treaters come back in, in the Fall. I would expect that we're going to see reasonably strong lumber prices. And then again, it will just depend on are there upside surprises on building? Or are there supply shocks that can cause that price ceiling to go up. Susan Maklari : Yes, okay. I appreciate all the thoughts, Devin. Thank you. And good luck with everything. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Thanks for all the details on lumber and walking us through your thought process on how pricing might evolve. If we think about OSB, I guess the first question I have is you give on that slide that I think the current prices were like $70 higher as of July 1, the way you look at it. But I think you also referenced that you've got -- your order files are, what, three or four weeks, I believe. And so if we were to kind of assess real-time pricing in OSB, what does that mean? Can you give us a sense as to what you'd expect your prices to be given what you already know three to four weeks out once the real-time prices are what you would be calling your current prices? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean without specifically giving the number, what I can tell you is directionally, our order files are actually five to six weeks out. So they're fairly extended. As you noted, Mark, what that means for us is that there is a lag to the current pricing. And so while what you see quarter-to-date in the earnings package is lower than current, that will catch up over time. So there will be a several week lag on the upside and the flip side of that is there's also a several weeks lag on the downside. So we ultimately get it. It's just a timing question. And for us, as we think about the quarter, there's a fair amount of leverage there, it's $8 million of EBITDA per quarter for every $10 increase. So there's a fairly significant upside. And I think just given the length of the order files, that's going to translate into a pretty strong quarter for OSB for us. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And recognizing that prices can move from where they are. But I mean, so if I -- can I look back five weeks or so and look at the increase that we've had and expect that to because that's over $100 plus to expect that to translate into your prices? And then they'll go wherever prices real time go as we go forward. Is that a reasonable way to look at it? Devin Stockfish : Yes, that's generally right. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then you kind of had -- you'd mentioned that you felt in lumber that maybe we can see some improvement in the Fall, et cetera. But it sounded like you're reasonably cautious over the summer. Correct me if I interpreted that incorrectly. How do you feel on OSB? Did you see the dynamics differently? And if so, why? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I do different just because there's not a lot of OSB available. And I think what you're seeing right now with the pricing dynamic is most buyers went into the summer with very little inventory. And as you've seen that building activity pick up, the demand ended up being higher than people expected. And when they're going out and trying to buy open market OSP, there's just none there. And so that's going to take a little while to figure itself out. OSB is not as reliant on the R&R market. So it's a little bit more focused on the single-family construction, which has continued to be pretty strong. So absent, a material pullback on the housing side, it would seem to me that we're going to see pretty tight market there for OSB, which should mean you should have strong OSB pricing into the Fall. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Super. And just one last one. I know there are lots of concerns on fire season weeks or a couple of months ago and not hearing as much about it and certainly not in your comments, recognizing there's uncertainty. Have things calmed down? Or are things feeling like it's not going to be as dangerous situation this year? Just a quick update. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So in the Northwest, it's been a relatively mild wildfire season to date. I always caution people though. It really starts to become an issue typically in August and the early part of September. So we're not necessarily in the heat of the wildfire season yet in the Northwest. Obviously, in Canada, it's been a really bad year so far. There has been some rain in Alberta. So while we still have fire activity going on, I think that's calmed a little bit. In Northern BC, I think the fire activity has started to pick up a little bit. So as you think about some of the key regions for us, Washington, Oregon, British Columbia, I think that story will play out over the course of August. But to your point, at this juncture in the Northwest fire season hasn't been that bad. Mark Weintraub : Okay, appreciate the color. Thank you. Devin Stockfish : Yes, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Just following up on the Mississippi deal, I think it transacted at kind of somewhat of a premium to some comps that we've seen in the state. I think you talked about it being well stocked and maybe having some synergies with existing operations. I'm just wondering if you could maybe touch on, I guess, the real estate and ENR opportunities that I think you were mentioned in the press release and maybe more broadly, I think you're the largest landowner in Mississippi. Can you just talk about the sort of Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas market in terms of anything that you're particularly excited about or concerned about maybe in the next few years? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. So it's a really nice acquisition for us. A couple of things I would highlight, as you noted, really good mature age class, high percentage of sawlog mix. And importantly, there's two pieces of it. There's a northern piece and a southern piece. Each of them are really close to short haul distances to lumber mills that we have in Mississippi. So some really nice synergies there. I think from a comp standpoint, just for frame of reference, one of our large competitors did a deal in Mississippi recently at $2,700 an acre. So it's pretty in line with what we've seen for the higher quality acquisitions in that Mississippi region. We are the largest landowner in Mississippi by a fair margin. I think the positive news from a Mississippi standpoint is we're seeing a fair bit of new capacity coming in there. From a sawmill standpoint, we've got the pellet mills that are coming in and building new mills in Mississippi. So it's a market while it's been less tension perhaps than some of the other markets. And this is true for Louisiana and Arkansas, by the way, I do think that's where a lot of the new capacity is coming in. And with the work that Russell and his team are doing, we're working real hard to make sure that we can influence where some of that capacity is coming in so that it's placed in a region where we benefit from a timberland standpoint can drive synergies for those customers. So I think we feel pretty good about the trajectory of all three of those markets. And my instinct here is that over the next several years, you're going to see some of the biggest price growth in those markets as that new capacity comes into place. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just switching to Climate Solutions. I think you mentioned two carbon projects underway in the South. Given the experience you've gained with the main pilot. I mean, is it possible to say how long it might take for those two Southern projects to maybe ultimately start issuing credits? Is that one or two years or maybe longer or shorter? And then I kind of thought that the main project was chosen because economics in the Northern region or maybe less compelling than in the Southern region. I don't know if that's the case or if that's changed. But is there any sort of change in view where carbon projects are getting more feasible or more attractive and you're moving them to the South or maybe these are special regions within the South. I don't know if you can comment there. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I think first of all, with the main project, and that's why we call it a pilot project is there were learnings that we acquired through that process. And I think we've been able to take the learnings from that main project and apply that to those two projects in the South. So my expectation is those projects are going to move dramatically faster than the main project. And we could have those issued as soon as later this year or early next year. So much faster. And again, I think we've taken a lot of the learnings from that initial project, which was the whole point in building out that group and the expertise so that we can start to scale this business. In terms of the regional decision-making for where carbon projects go, you're absolutely right. We started in May because the economics there are more supportive. But as you think about our portfolio of 7 million acres across the South, there are going to be certain parcels and certain tracks that are less economically beneficial than others. And so there are going to be places where the economics for carbon, even in the near-term still makes sense in the South. And just to be clear, we're only going to do carbon projects where we think the economics in doing carbon will be the economics of doing timber. And so part of that is the quality of the land base, but part of that is where we think carbon prices are trending. And what we've seen here of late is for improved forest management, carbon projects that are of high quality, they're generating strong pricing, and that's our expectation when we bring these credits to market. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes, thanks very much. Good morning guys. Just wanted to follow-up on this Natural Climate Solutions and the carbon optionality that you've got. If you could -- and I appreciate the extra color on the 30,000 credits that you expect in year one. What's the size of the main project that the scope of it that you put forward? And then what's the size of the two projects that you've got in the U.S. South? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So we're not providing the specific acreage really for a couple of reasons, Paul. First is -- as we think about how we're managing these carbon projects, we're not just taking those acres out of production. We're going to continue to generate timber revenues from those acres in addition to carbon. So it's a little -- we feel like it's a little hard to put that in context just by throwing acres out there. So we're not going to be providing acreages for these products -- we'll ultimately provide the number of credits and the revenues that we're generating from the credits. And that's how we'll dimension that going forward. Paul Quinn : Okay. Well, just trying to scale it from my side then. The 30,000 credits, is that equating to somewhere in the $500,000 to $600,000 range? Devin Stockfish : Well, it depends on what you think pricing is going to be $30,000, yes, mid-20s is kind of a good way to think about it in terms of what we've seen lately in I think the quality of the credits we're bringing to market are really going to be at the top of the range. So that's how we're thinking about it. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just lastly, just -- is this 100% addition to your cash flow? Or is there an impact when you put these projects -- the carbon projects forward, i.e., a severe impact on harvest in the area? Devin Stockfish : Yes, there will be some. Now obviously, we're picking areas which have economics where that's supported by the carbon. But ultimately, if you're going to get carbon credits, you are giving up some degree of volume. And so we're going to pick regions where that margin is the lowest and where that offset makes the most sense. But yes, there will be some offsetting impact to timber revenues where we do carbon projects. Paul Quinn : All right. Makes sense to me. Best of luck. Thanks. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your questions. Ketan Mamtora : Thank you and good morning. First question, Devin, you talked about the order files in OSP, which are quite extended right now. Can you give us some sense of what the order files are like in engineered world and in lumber and how they compare for this time of the year versus historical average? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Lumber order files are pretty normal. I mean, that's in a couple of week time frame, one to two weeks, which is pretty typical, particularly for this time of year. The EWP order files are extended depending on the product out even beyond OSB. So they're back to a place where they're fairly lengthy order files. Ketan Mamtora : Understood. Got you. And then coming back to wildfires. I mean, are your mills in Alberta back up to? I thought I heard you say that you all took some downtime at two of your three mills. Are they back up running kind of fully? Or are there some restrictions whether related to the log decks or anything else there? Devin Stockfish : No, those mills are both back up running full, no ongoing issues there. The downtime was really just when the fire got close to the community, there were evacuation orders. So everybody had to leave town. But as soon as those evacuation orders were lifted, we were back at the mills, and they're both back up running full. Ketan Mamtora : All right. Okay. That's all from my side. Good luck. Thank you. Devin Stockfish : All right, thank you. David Wold : Thanks, Ketan. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Roxland : Thank you, Devin, Davie, Andy for taking my questions. Very good quarter. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Michael Roxland : Just on EWP, can you talk about any regional differences that you've seen on EWP demand? I recall the West being more impacted some months ago from sort of market conditions and inclement weather so have you seen a ramp on the West more than the South. But just help us figure out how that demand improvement has been broken up by region? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, California, in particular earlier in the year and late last year was struggling, and that was, if you recall, just a result of wave after wave of storms hitting that market. So you really saw building activity slow quite a bit. As we got deeper into spring and early summer, the California market picked up quite a bit. And you can see that mostly in the Douglas fir lumber sales that we've got going into that California market that really saw an uptick as that building activity increased. I'd say there are always regional differences. California, I think has been picking up. Texas is always a strong market. The South has generally been pretty strong. And I think all of those trends are holding. When you think about what's going on with EWP, there's obviously two pieces of that, though. There's the demand and how much building is going on and then there's also the supply that's going into each individual region. And our experience is every local market has its own competitive dynamic. And so it's always balancing, making sure that you're serving your customers, trying to make sure your margins feel good, but also making sure that you're holding market share against competitors who all want the same business. So that dynamic plays out in every region, every day. But I'd say on balance, again, the EWP market certainly has stabilized. And as you can see with our order files extending out, we feel pretty good about that trajectory. I mean, there will always be some ups and downs on pricing. But directionally, we feel pretty good about where EWP is going. Michael Roxland : Thanks for that, Devin. Just following up, I mean, it's kind of interesting when you look at your special improvement in lumber versus EWP. Lumber about 5% sequentially in terms of volumes, but EWP up about 63% quarter-over-quarter. Can you help us frame like what's really driving the difference? I mean, is it all due to just the fact that EWP is more single family related, maybe lumbers got the R&R component? Or is there anything else driving the difference between lumber demand and EWP demand? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean when you look at our sales volumes, it's really more of a function that we had scaled down our EWP production early in the year because of what was going on and just the dynamic with so many buyers destocking. So the big volume increase in EWP, I mean, obviously, it's related to the fact that there's been a pickup in homebuilding activity, but the delta between the improvements in volume in EWP and the improvements in volume in lumber is just that EWP was operating at 60% capacity for the first quarter, whereas lumber wasn't down nearly as much. But that was an intentional decision on our part just to match supply with demand. Michael Roxland : Got you. And one final question before turning it over. Just the operating rate in EWP in 2Q? Devin Stockfish : Yes, it was in the mid-70s, mid or low to mid-70s. And so we think it will be up just a little bit in Q3. Michael Roxland : All right. Thanks very much and good luck in the second half. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Terrific. Well, thanks, everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's third quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements. As forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $239 million or $0.33 per diluted share, a net sales of $2 billion. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $509 million, a 9% increase from the second quarter. These are solid results and I'm proud of the performance delivered by our teams during the quarter. Turning now to our third quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $78 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million, a $29 million decrease compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales volumes in our Western and Southern operations, and lower average sales realizations for Western export volumes. In the West, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $22 million, compared to the second quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log supply was ample in the third quarter as the typical seasonal influx of logs from nontraditional timber owners came to market. Despite this dynamic, domestic log markets remained fairly balanced as mills maintain steady demand, driven by higher pricing and takeaway of lumber early in the quarter, and mills building log inventories to mitigate potential supply risks and the peak wildfire season. Our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the prior quarter. As expected, during the warmer and drier months, we transitioned to higher elevations [ph], and lower productivity harvest operations. Additionally, although wildfire activity was limited on our Timberlands, dry conditions across the Pacific Northwest resulted in harvest restrictions in certain areas. As a result, our fee harvest and domestic sales volumes were moderately lower compared to the second quarter. Our forestry and road costs were seasonally higher, and per unit log and haul costs were lower. Moving to our Western Export business. In Japan, elevated inventories of European lumber imports and reduced consumption continue to weigh on the Japanese log market. That said, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the second quarter, largely driven by stable log pricing in the western domestic market. Our Japanese sales volumes decreased in the third quarter. This was partially due to reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at one of its sawmills during the quarter. While the mill is being rebuilt, our customer is in the process of adding shifts and production at different facilities and expects to recover most of the lost production from the damaged operations. It will likely take several quarters for this customer to ramp up the additional production. As a result, we're expecting lower shipments to Japan over the next several quarters. During this period, we expect to ship volume to other customers in Japan and the Western domestic market. In China, despite steady decreases in log inventories at the ports and reduction in log supply, the Chinese log market continued to be impacted by reduced consumption in the third quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China decreased moderately compared to the second quarter. While demand for our logs continues to be steady, our sales volumes were significantly lower, as we intentionally flex logs to the domestic market to capture higher margin opportunities. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $6 million, compared to the second quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated slightly in the third quarter, and fiber markets continued to soften, largely in response to elevated mill inventories, a seasonal increase in log supply and reduced demand for finished goods, particularly for pulp and paper products. As a result, our average sales realizations decreased slightly compared to the second quarter. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. However, certain geographies did experience wetter than normal conditions at the outset of the quarter, resulting in moderately lower fee harvest volumes compared to the second quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the second quarter, due to significantly higher sales volumes resulting from a seasonal increase in harvest activity that is typical in the third quarter. Our sales realizations were moderately lowered due to Mix. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $56 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $94 million, a $24 million increase compared to the second quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of property sold. Average price per acre decreased compared to the second quarter, but remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to benefit from healthy demand for HBU properties, resulting in high value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I'll now make a few comments on an exciting third quarter achievement in our Natural Climate Solutions Business. I'm pleased to report that we received approval from ACR for our first forest carbon credits in Maine. The project covers approximately 50,000 acres, has an initial issuance of nearly 32,000 credits, and is expected to generate 475,000 credits over a 20-year crediting period. I want to thank our team for the exceptional work and diligence and completing this initial project and building the foundation to scale this business as the market continues to mature. Our goal is to develop and bring to market forest carbon projects that generate meaningful carbon additionality with measurable climate benefits. This initial project is an important milestone for Weyerhaeuser and demonstrates our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits. Looking forward, we are developing several additional forest carbon projects within our U.S Timberlands including two in the South slated for approval in the first half of 2024. As we've demonstrated since launching our Natural Climate Solutions business, Weyerhaeuser is uniquely positioned to lead in this space, given our expertise and unmatched Timberlands portfolio. We have established a target to grow this business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025 and we've made solid progress to date towards that target. And beyond 2025, we see significant upside from Natural Climate Solutions as markets continued to develop, particularly in the carbon and renewables businesses. And from our perspective, there is no other company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser. Moving to wood products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products generated $277 million of earnings in the third quarter and $328 million of adjusted EBITDA. Third quarter EBITDA was a 21% improvement from the second quarter, largely driven by an increase in OSB sales realizations. Before diving into the business results, I would like to take a moment to highlight the operating performance improvements that we've made in our Wood Products segment over the past several years. To illustrate the point, for the first half of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our wood products, businesses. I'm incredibly proud of the work that our teams have done, and for their unwavering commitment to our operational excellence initiatives, innovation and the successful delivery of our ongoing strategic capital investments. Through these efforts, we've positioned our wood products business to deliver industry leading performance. As we've demonstrated over the last several years, this has allowed our wood products business to generate significant cash flow for Weyerhaeuser. And despite a moderation in product pricing of late, this business remains well-positioned to navigate through a range of market conditions, and will continue to enhance our competitive advantage as a company, one that supports our commitment to returning meaningful amounts of cash to shareholders and enhancing the value of our portfolio over time. Turning now to lumber results. Adjusted EBITDA was $58 million in the third quarter, a 14% increase over the prior quarter. Benchmark pricing for lumber entered the third quarter on an upward trajectory, supported by improving demand, relatively lean inventories and the prospect of supply disruptions following an early start to the wildfire season in Canada. By late July, however, demand had softened as supply concerns dissipated, and buyer sentiment turned more cautious due to ongoing macro economic uncertainty. Despite lean inventories, orders were largely limited to necessity purchases throughout the quarter, and benchmark prices trended lower. For the quarter, our average sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were slightly lower, resulting from reduced production at several mills, partially driven by temporary operating disruptions. Log costs were moderately lower compared to the second quarter and unit manufacturing costs were comparable. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB increased by $81 million compared to the second quarter, primarily due to the increase in commodity pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB increased sharply at the outset of the third quarter, supported by resilient demand for new home construction activity, lean inventories and supply concerns resulting from annual maintenance outages that are typical in the fall. Pricing remained elevated until mid September and then decreased through quarter end as buyer sentiment turned cautious in response to weaker-than-expected housing starts in August, as well as general concerns about the economy and the prospect of additional supply coming to market. For the quarter, our average sales realizations increased by 39% compared to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower in this -- in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher due to planned downtime for annual maintenance. Fiber costs improved slightly during the quarter. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $125 million, a decrease of $19 million compared to the second quarter. Strong demand for EWP products, which are primarily used in single-family home building applications kept most of our EWP products on an extended lead times for the entire third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes increased slightly compared to the second quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continued to rebalance in certain markets. It's worth noting that our current EWP prices remain above pre-pandemic levels. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly higher in the third quarter, and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB webstock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA was $31 million in the quarter, a $3 million decrease compared to the second quarter driven by lower EWP realizations in certain markets and lower sales volumes for some products. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items in our fourth quarter outlook. David Wold : Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items which are summarized on Page 16. We generated $523 million of cash from operations in the third quarter, and ended the period with approximately $1.8 billion of cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, which includes amounts raised and are made debt issuance that pre-funded the majority of our 2023 maturities. In July, we used a portion of the debt issuance proceeds to repay $118 million of notes at maturity. Total debt at quarter end was approximately $5.7 billion, including 860 million that matures in December. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $99 million, which is a typical level for the third quarter, and we remain on track to invest approximately $440 million of capital for the full year. We returned $138 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and remain committed to growing this by 5% annually through 2025. In addition, we returned $25 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the third quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $32.67. And as of quarter end, we had completed $733 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. As highlighted on Page 18, adjusted funds available for distribution for the third quarter totaled $424 million, and we have generated $894 million of adjusted FAD year-to-date. Third quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $13 million, compared to the second quarter. This decrease was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the third quarter of 2023. Turning to our Western Timberland operations, we expect log demand and the domestic market to soften in the fourth quarter, as mills adjust to lower pricing and take away of lumber and work through elevated log inventories. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter absent weather related log supply disruptions. Our fee harvest volumes in forestry and road costs are expected to be comparable in the fourth quarter, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be moderately higher. Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we are expecting fewer export shipments into the Japanese market over the next several quarters in response to the operational disruption experienced by one of our customers in the region. As a result, we expect fourth quarter sales volumes to be moderately lower compared to the third quarter. Our Japanese log sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher. In China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels, and the market is trending toward a more balanced state. As a result, we anticipate fairly stable pricing for our logs shipments into China for the balance of the year. For the quarter, our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter average. Given steady demand for our logs coupled with moderating conditions in the western domestic market, we expect to increase our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter. In the South, we expect stable log markets in the fourth quarter, as mills maintain healthy log inventories ahead of wetter conditions that are typical in the winter months. As a result, we expect our sales realizations to be comparable to the third quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to be comparable, and we anticipate seasonally lower forestry and road costs in the fourth quarter. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the third quarter. We anticipate slightly lower sales realizations due to mix. Turning to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources, real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we've capitalized on steady demand in pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are revising our guidance for full year 2023 adjusted EBITDA to $310 million, an increase of $10 million from prior guidance. We continue to expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 40% for the year. For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be lower than the third quarter of 2023 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For our Wood Product segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be moderately lower compared to the third quarter of 2023 excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB entered the fourth quarter on a downward trajectory resulting from cautious buyer sentiment in response to a seasonal reduction in housing construction activity and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds. However, benchmark prices for OSB have stabilized in the last couple of weeks. As shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are lower than the third quarter averages. For our lumber business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes in the fourth quarter and slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be comparable to the third quarter. For our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the fourth quarter. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business, as Devin mentioned, we continue to see strong demand for EWP products given resilient single-family construction activity year-to-date. As a result, our order files are extended well into the fourth quarter and product pricing is expected to be fairly stable through year-end. For the quarter, our average sales realizations are expected to be lower compared to the prior quarter average. Our sales volumes are expected to be slightly lower, primarily for solid section products resulting from an increase in planned downtime for annual maintenance in the fourth quarter. However, we anticipate an increase in sales volumes for I-Joist products. Raw material costs are expected to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter primarily for OSB Webstock. For our Distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be lower compared to the third quarter, primarily driven by a decrease in commodity realization. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin, and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged. Although we have seen some recent headwinds in the multifamily segment in response to increasing interest rates. Importantly, however, the single-family segment has remained resilient year-to-date. In fact, despite the elevated mortgage rate environment, single-family starts increased 3% quarter-over-quarter, and new home sales were up in September. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business relative to multifamily. In the near-term, we continue to believe that the underlying housing demand is solid. Even at higher interest rates, we expect single-family demand to hold up reasonably well given the limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the home builders ability to offer mortgage rate buy downs and other incentives. That said, buyer sentiment will continue to be influenced by affordability challenges brought about by increased mortgage rates and elevated home prices, as well as the state of the overall economy. As a result, we continue to anticipate a choppier housing market in the near-term relative to the last couple of years. I will note, however, our long-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly under built housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel, market activity remained steady in the third quarter and has held up well year-to-date. Although we're likely to see a seasonal reduction in repair and remodel activity over the winter months, we believe underlying demand fundamentals are solid, supported by prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home and a higher mortgage rate environment. And looking beyond 2023, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an ageing housing stock. In closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the third quarter. We also achieved an important milestone in our natural climate solutions growth program with the approval of our first forest carbon credits and looking ahead, although near-term market conditions have moderated, we remain constructive on the longer term demand fundamentals that support our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong and we remain focused on maintaining our industry leading operating performance, serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value and returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can go ahead and open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi, thank you. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for the details. I wanted to \u2026 Devin Stockfish : Good morning. George Staphos : Good morning. I wanted to spend the first couple questions on wood. And the first one on EWP, Devin, if you could. So we'd heard as well that lead times in EWP have been extended for you. Do you think you're unique or is the industry operating at that same stance. Has there been any developments specific to Weyerhaeuser on EWP that's led to the extended lead times? Have you been able to pick up share, say, in distribution that in turn has fed into your demand in DWP. Any color there would be helpful. The second question, if we can take a step back and look at your EBITDA trends across the businesses, the last number of years, again, what Weyerhaeuser done on a manufacturing basis has been terrific. Do you still think that you are more or less black at the bottom across your mill system in light of the fact that there's -- certainly there's been a lot of inflation that's occurred in the cost structure, maybe not in fiber, but other areas that you'd have to contend with if we have a deeper downturn. So how would you have us think about those two points? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I'll take EWP first, George. Really, it's a combination of two things, and I'm speaking primarily with respect to Weyerhaeuser and not necessarily other participants in the market. For us, we candidly got a little behind the curve earlier in the year. Remember, back to the beginning of 2023, our view was that single-family housing was going to struggle a little bit in a higher mortgage rate environment. And so we did adjust our operating posture somewhat to reflect what we thought was going to be a softer housing environment. Well, what turned out to be the case was single-family held up remarkably well. And so we have ramped up our production to try to get back on track. But to some extent, that higher level of single-family construction activity combined with us dialing it back a little bit at the first of the year, put us behind a little bit. And so we've been managing through it. I think we're catching up. I will say, even though at this point, we do still have fairly extended lead times, but I think we're making good progress against that. In terms of the question around black at the bottom, there's no question that over the last several years in the inflationary environment that we've seen the underlying cost structure has gone up, not just for us, but I would assume for the entire industry. And what I would say, though, is I still have a high degree of confidence in our black at the bottom approach. We continue to be, in my view, the low-cost producer across all of our business lines. And so even if we do see a more material downturn, I do think we will weather that much better than the rest of the industry, and I would expect us to stay black at the bottom across each of our businesses. Now that being said, there are going to be presumably if we see a material downturn, there will be a few mills that will struggle to stay cash flow positive across the entirety of the year. I'll just highlight the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia, our two markets where it can be challenging. Just primarily because the dynamic in how log costs come down is oftentimes slower than how quickly lumber prices can move. And so we've seen that a few times when you've seen lumber prices move down quickly, typically -- particularly in those markets, the log prices come down a little bit more slowly, which can make the economics challenged for a brief moment in time. But we do still feel confident in black at the bottom. Our organization is focused every day on keeping costs out of the business, improving efficiency and overall driving down our cost structure. And I think that will serve us well across all points in the market, whether times are good or times are a little more challenged. George Staphos : Thanks, Devin. My last one, and I'll turn it over. If we go to Slide 8 in the upper left hand corner when we look at realizations for the West. And obviously, it's not a new development, it's been occurring. But I guess the question I had is, if we go back to Q2, what your view has been the reason why we've seen this steady erosion in realizations in the West? And in your view, what would be the single biggest factor to reversing that trend if we look out over the next 2 to 4 quarters. Thanks and good luck in the fourth quarter. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Great question. I mean it really comes down to lumber prices. In the Pacific Northwest, the market is very tensioned, and frankly, there are just not enough logs to cover all the demand. So the pricing for logs in the Pacific Northwest is really going to be governed by what happens with lumber prices. And so the mills they will pay up to the point where they can still drive some margin across the mill set, and that's largely going to really support what log costs do. Now the one nuance there is we obviously have an export program to Asia, and that can supplement our realizations. They're tied. There is a correlation between what happens in the domestic log market in Japan and China. And so to the extent that we can get the Japanese market back up, which I think we're trending in that direction just because you've started to see a lot of that European lumber that had built up in Japan work its way through the system. But it ultimately comes back to what's going on with lumber prices in the Northwest. George Staphos : Thanks, Devin. I will turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Yes, great. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great. Thanks and good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning. David Wold : Good morning, Kurt. Kurt Yinger : I just -- good morning. I just want to start off on capital allocation. And at least in my view you guys are currently trading at a pretty wide discount to NAV here. obviously, timberland M&A remains an important part of the strategy. But with the competitiveness on deals and your stock where it is, how do you think about the attractiveness of repurchases versus acquisitions. And then somewhat relatedly, if you were to continue to see that NAV discount, why then -- how willing are you to be kind of more aggressive with share repurchases maybe above and beyond what the variable returns framework would permit, so to speak. David Wold : Yes. You bet, Kurt. This is Davie. I'd just start out by saying, look, we are in a very fortunate position as you referenced. We have a lot of levers. So that includes M&A, investing in the business, paying down debt, dividend payments, among others, and we're constantly evaluating our views on capital allocation. But all the factors that go into that are dynamic. So it's something we always need to be watching. But as we've said, our capital allocation framework starts with that commitment to return 75% to 80% of our adjusted FAD back to shareholders via the base supplemental and share repurchase. So that portion is really earmarked for returning cash to shareholders. And with the remaining piece above and beyond that, i.e., the 20% to 25%, we can allocate that between acquisitions, share repurchase reducing our debt. So we do have our target to do $1 billion of timberland acquisitions here over the next few years. So that's something we're certainly intending to allocate a certain amount of our capital towards we're being disciplined as we navigate that market that you referenced. But look, yes, as we look at share repurchase, certainly, that's something that we've said. It's a useful tool to return cash to shareholders in the right circumstances. And specifically, when our shares are trading at a meaningful discount. We've been quite active in that space. We've done $733 million against our $1 billion authorization that we announced a little over 2 years ago. So we'll continue to be opportunistic there. But in summary, while that's really an attractive lever right now, we are going to continue to weigh all those options and ultimately allocate our cash in the way that creates the most long-term value for shareholders. Kurt Yinger : Got it. And I guess just kind of a follow-up, just making sure I understand. So would you kind of be willing to go some threshold above 100% of adjusted FAD in a given year kind of recognizing that you got to be cognizant of where debt levels are. But you would be willing to go above that 100% with kind of share repurchases, specifically if you felt like that kind of discount was widened us? David Wold : Yes. So we do have the flexibility within our capital allocation framework for that. So any cash above and beyond the 75% to 80% that's committed to be returned to shareholders, that's available for growth, debt pay down or incremental share repurchase. So as always, we are going to evaluate all those options and ultimately allocate our cash in a way that creates the most long-term value, but I'll also add that we're mindful in some periods of choppiness. Those might provide significant value creation opportunities. So we will be thoughtful and disciplined as we evaluate all those avenues moving forward. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. Thanks for that. And then just my second one, in regards to the fire at your Japanese customers facility, is there a way to kind of quantify what impact you expect that's going to have on kind of Japanese export volumes over the next couple of quarters? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes, we are thinking it's probably going to be in the neighborhood of 15% to 20% over the next couple of quarters. And then as 2024 moves through the -- moves on, we'll see that shrink down to probably around 10% impact as they move production to other facilities. But I would just note, we do have other Japanese customers, so we are working to reallocate some of that volume and then you can typically get a nice premium in the domestic market for those high-quality Japanese logs. And so we've obviously got plenty of domestic customers that we can move that volume to. So net-net, we wouldn't anticipate a material impact to our margins from this. Kurt Yinger : Okay. Well, appreciate the color guys, and good luck here in Q4. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. David Wold : Thanks, Kurt. Operator : Our next question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. So you're expecting flattish quarter-over-quarter realizations in 4Q in the South. And I'm just -- I guess, first question, is there any mix impact there? Or is that sort of like-for-like pricing. And then second, prices for southern logs have been kind of drifting lower for the past 4 or 5 quarters. Are you seeing any signs there that give you confidence in stabilization or be bottoming maybe cost curve support? Or is the visibility into end market demand and rates just does it make it too hard to kind of make a call there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. In the South, it's typically a little bit easier to predict what's going to happen on realizations than it is in some other markets. The comparable really, the mix doesn't change dramatically quarter-over-quarter. I think our delivered model and the customer mix that we\u2019ve, the demand has stayed pretty stable for us. There's still margin to be made on the lumber side. So the demand for sawlogs has remained pretty strong. And even on the fiber side, which certainly has drifted down over the course of the year as we've seen some softness in the pulp and paper markets. I don't know that we are necessarily anticipating a strong upturn here in the near term, but I will know we are starting for the first time in quite some time to hear a little bit of optimism for many of our pulp and paper customers that a lot of the destocking in their end markets has run its course and they're going to start rebuilding some inventory as we get deeper into the winter. So we may have bottomed in terms of some demand there. Now there are some regional differences. I think there are portions of the Southeast coastal markets just because of some mills that have closed down, that may take a little longer to recover. But on balance, I think, all things considered comfortable that we're going to see comparable realizations in Q4. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then just with regards to the -- we have seen a number of kraftliner [ph] mills that have gotten shut down in the South and I guess one in Washington State. Is that something I guess, that has a specific impact to Weyerhaeuser. I mean it sounds like it may have impact to some of your competitors. I'm just wondering what the potential impact is to you, if any? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Obviously, any time you see a customer go out of business or take a mill down, that's not great for the market. That does ultimately have some impact on the overall demand level. But we generally try to work pretty proactively to have long-term agreements, both for residuals on the wood products side, the pull logs on the Timberland side. So nothing that's happened to date would cause me a whole lot of concern that it's going to have a material impact to us specifically. But nevertheless, we do still need to find homes for those residuals and pulp logs. And so it's in everybody's interest to make sure that these customers are healthy long-term. Anthony Pettinari : Got it. Got it. And then just maybe shifting gears to Wood Products and maybe a similar question on lumber. With random lengths around 375, are you seeing or do you anticipate any kind of supply response maybe were below cash cost for some of the higher cost producers? And then I guess 1 thing that we've heard this year is that some mills are hesitant to let go of labor because they feel like if they let them go, they may not be able to get them back in this kind of labor market. Has that been like a real dynamic that you think has impacted supply? And I don't know if you just have any more kind of broad comments about kind of lumber supply with prices where they are. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes. I mean it's always hard to say what others are going to do, so I can't necessarily speak to that other than to just point out that historically, when we've seen lumber prices go below cash costs for any period of time, there ordinarily is some sort of supply response. And our estimation is that in certain regions, a decent amount of the ongoing supply is probably underwater from a cash standpoint. The issue with labor, I think that certainly has been a concern and that's probably something that's going to give producers a little bit of pause before taking material downtime. But that being said, ordinarily, you're only going to run so long, losing money before you ultimately make those decisions. And I would say, although certainly not great, we have seen the labor market improve somewhat versus earlier this year. I think if we were having that same discussion in Q1 or Q2 of this year, I think you probably would have been even more reluctant because the market was so tight. But hopefully, that will continue to get better as we move forward. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Devin Stockfish : Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Devin Stockfish : Good morning, Susan. Susan Maklari : Good morning. My first question is staying with Wood Products. It seems like the move in volumes that you saw in a lot of those products over the course of the quarter, is in contrast to the outlook that you gave for housing starts and especially, I think the commentary and the outlook that the builders have shared over the course of this earnings season. As you think about the setup for the industry going into the end of this year and maybe even into early 2024, how do you think that, that will come together? And what could it suggest for your ability to operate and to gain share within that segment? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I mean our view on what's going to happen with housing and I'll just caveat that, that there's obviously a lot of variables at play, but when we talk to the homebuilders, and I'll start particularly here with the larger national builders, my view is they're going to continue to build. It's going to require ongoing rate buy downs and other incentives to continue to get people into that market. But with such little existing inventory on the market, it is a demand driver that's helping weather what ordinarily would be a very difficult period at these kinds of mortgage rates. But when we talk to the big builders, I think they're going to continue to build. I suspect they're going to build slightly up relative to 2023. I think the more challenged into that market is the medium and particularly the smaller builders with these higher interest rates, I think that puts some pressure on them in terms of financing land and some of their other expenses, they don't necessarily have all of the same tools available to help getting some of those new homebuyers into a home. So net-net, I think single-family next year might be up slightly, but I think the market share for the big national builders will continue to grow. And for us, we have a diverse customer base. Obviously, we do business with all the big builders. We have good relationships with them. I would continue to -- I would expect us to continue to grow our business with them as they grow. We also do business with the medium and small builders as well. And so we'll just have to be nimble and to allocate our product to whichever builders are growing their market share. But notwithstanding all the doom and gloom that you hear about housing, I do think people want homes were massively under built. There are not a lot of them available. A lot of the people that are in their early 30s that want a home are ready to go out and be home buyers and homeowners. And so somebody is going to have to meet that demand. And I give a lot of credit to the builders to navigate this environment. They've done a remarkable job. And all things being equal, we would expect that to continue next year. Susan Maklari : And just building on that very quickly, Devin. How do you think about the channel inventories that are out there as we go into the fall? Is there anything you would highlight or call out there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. On lumber, it's still pretty lean. I think what we've seen is just nobody really has a good beat on the direction of building as we get into these winter months, and there's just a lot of negative commentary in the press. So I think people are fairly reluctant to build inventory. So people are keeping their inventories pretty light on the lumber side. I'd say on OSB relative to this time of year, it's probably at or maybe slightly below normal. So maybe not as lean as lumber, but certainly not big inventories either. And then AWP, like I said, at least from our vantage point, we're on pretty extended order files right now. And so not a whole lot of extra EWP in the system from our standpoint. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful color. And then I just want to squeeze one more in, which is congratulations on getting the forest carbon project in Maine approved. When you think about the progress that you're making there and the $100 million target for EBITDA that you've set out by the end of 2025, does that $100 million -- is that based on volume? Or is it based on the pricing to some extent and where these credits can come in? And any updated thoughts on that as you've made this -- as you hit this milestone? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes. I mean we are really pleased with this first carbon credit project. It's not a big number in and of itself, but we learned a lot and I think we are building the foundation to scale this. And so we've got two more in the south slated for approval in the first half of next year. We got three more in the pipeline behind that. And remember, these just continue to build. So each of these projects will have annual credit releases. So part of how we are going to get to the $100 million is we've got a lot of different levers and that's mitigation banking, conservation, renewables, carbon capture and storage and then the forest carbon. So I think it will probably be a little bit more heavily weighted to the existing businesses at the outset, but over time, we certainly think for us carbon, carbon capture and storage and renewables will make up a growing percentage of that. And as I said in our opening remarks, the more we learn about this market, the more people we talk to, the trajectory of the opportunity set, I think we have a lot of optimism that the size of this business is ultimately going to scale up into something more meaningful than $100 million. Susan Maklari : Okay. Thank you for all the color and good luck. Devin Stockfish : Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Michael Roxland : Thank you, Devin, Davie, and Andy for taking my questions. First one, just a point of clarification on EWP pricing. I think you mentioned in terms of the 4Q versus 3Q trajectory that price realization should be moderately lower, but then I think there was a comment made that product pricing should be stable through year-end. So how do I reconcile it? I mean, is it really that 4Q is really not going to move all that much relative to 3Q, it will be done slightly and therefore, that's why product pricing should be stable? I'm just trying to reconcile a little bit of a discrepancy between the two comments. Devin Stockfish : Yes, that's right. And so remember, when we talk about EWP, I mean there are a number of products that go in there. So you've got solid section, Trust Choice. We got plywood and MDF all flow through EWP. So when we talk about solid, what we are primarily talking about is Trust Choice and Solid Selection [ph], which were the majority products. We are going to see a little bit of the last couple of quarters, we've had to make some targeted price adjustments. Those usually have a little bit of a time lag, which are kind of flowing into Q4. So that's really what drives that slight down quarter-over-quarter. But on balance, we are seeing pretty stable demand and pricing across our Engineered Wood Products business. Michael Roxland : Got you. Thank you. Still [indiscernible] sorry. One -- on that price, the targeted price adjustments, I think even last quarter, you mentioned that you're also making some price concessions on some products in order to remain competitive. So is that something as you think about your -- how you operate in 3Q, did you do that maybe more in 3Q because you were slow to adjust your operating posture so in order to make up to maybe -- or to be more competitive with your peers that you decided to lower prices more aggressively to make up for \"less volume\"? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Actually, I think it probably had the opposite effect with very extended order files that probably took a little pressure off. But frankly, the way we've been approaching pricing is just very targeted and it's been market by market, and every market has its own supply demand dynamic. And just like we do with all products, we adjust prices either down or up, depending on what that dynamic looks like in a particular region. So I wouldn't say it was any kind of material moves in Q3. It was all very targeted and adjusted to the local supply-demand dynamic? Michael Roxland : Got it. Got you. Appreciate it. And one last question just on EWP. Just can you comment where your operating rate was in 3Q. I think in the last call, you mentioned that you have a low 70 -- low mid-70 type operating rate in 2Q and then you had a 50% in 1Q. So where was it in 3Q? Where do you think it will be in 4Q? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So in Q3, it was kind of in the high 70s range for an operating rate across EWP, and we are thinking that to be more or less comparable for Q4. There are some puts and takes. We are adding presses to kind of keep up with the demand. But on the same token, we have a number of scheduled annual maintenance downtime. So net-net, it will be more or less comparable from an operating rate standpoint. Michael Roxland : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Paul Quinn with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Paul Quinn : Yes. Thanks very much. Good morning, guys. Just a question of [indiscernible] was pretty strong in the quarter, but we've got some additional volume coming on at the end of the year. Just wondering why you took maintenance in Q3 as opposed to typically Q4 and why the shipment volumes were lower? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So a couple of things. From a maintenance schedule standpoint, we try to schedule them out over the year. To some extent, we may make minor adjustments depending on what's going on end markets. But as a general matter, it's very hard to predict what's going to happen with OSB prices quarter-to-quarter. And so largely, you kind of have to schedule them to get them done each year and you sequence the mills out across the year. So the maintenance schedule, more or less we set in advance and absent some material change, we try to stick to that. In terms of the sales volumes, the big driver there, the production was pretty comparable quarter-over-quarter. The sales volume was down a little bit, and that's really just a reflection of one of our mills where we had the annual maintenance downtime. We have contracted volume really at most of our facilities. And so we had to build up a little bit of extra inventory in Q3 to sell-through during that maintenance downtime in October. And so that was really the difference between production and sales volumes. We've already moved most of that volume now through the system as we've come out of the downtime. Paul Quinn : Okay. And then just over on the carbon credit side, congratulations on the project. Just wondering how we should think about that in terms of modeling that $475 million over the 20 years, obviously, comes out to lower than the 32,000 initials. So is that a straight line decline? And then when do you think about monetizing those credits? Devin Stockfish : Yes. In terms of monetizing, we are out in the market right now, marketing that. We are having, I think, some very productive discussions I would expect us to be selling through those initial credits in relatively short order. And as we said, I think during the last call, we are anticipating that's going to be priced somewhere in the mid- to high 20s range on a pricing standpoint. The annual carbon credits is really just tied to the growth trajectory and the carbon sequestration trajectory over that 20 years. So it can be a little lumpy. It's not necessarily a straight line in either direction. It will just depend on the growth profile across that particular forest. Paul Quinn : Great. That's all I have. Best of luck. Devin Stockfish : All right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Devin, I appreciated your rundown on thoughts for single-family next year. Would you share kind of your view of how you think repair remodel might play out and the key drivers behind that view? Devin Stockfish : Sure. I think it's -- there are kind of puts and takes there, Mark. On the one hand, a lot of the drivers that have been around for a number of years that have been spurring repair and remodel are still there. We still have an aging housing stock. People have equity in their homes. I do think this lock-in effect that we are seeing with everyone having refinanced at low rates, and it's going to keep a lot more people in their homes that otherwise would have moved. And so that's probably going to spur some level of repair and remodel demand. On the flip side of that coin, obviously, when people move, that's a catalyst for repair and remodel. And if fewer people are selling their house and buying into new houses, that's going to be a headwind. And to some extent, higher interest rates can also be a little bit of a headwind there. So some puts and takes. Our view is, overall, we are expecting that market to remain solid. And I think you've kind of seen few different views on this, whether it's up slightly or down slightly, our view is it's probably going to be flat to up slightly next year, all things being equal. We'll certainly see a little bit of a slowdown here in the winter months as we always do. There's always some seasonality to that. But as we look out into 2024, I don't think we're going to see the growth rates that we saw during the heat of the pandemic by any means. I think we've kind of returned to pre-pandemic levels of growth, and I expect that's probably going to be the case next year absent material recession or some other event that adds an additional headwind there. Mark Weintraub : Okay. Thank you. And maybe just following up on one of the prior questions that was asking about share repurchase and your stock trading at discount to underlying timberland values. I mean, are there scenarios where if the discount is wide enough, it makes sense to sell timberlands especially given that you're probably going to be in that situation when maybe your wood products businesses aren't doing so well. So you're not generating as much cash. And so are there scenarios where you have plans to sell timberlands and then use those proceeds to buy back your stock at what might be a wide discount? David Wold : Sure, Mark. Yes, this is Davie. We are always looking at ways to ensure we are maximizing shareholder value and how we generate cash and allocate that capital and like I said earlier, we are fortunate to have a number of levers there. But really, if I take each of those components separately, we've been very active in the market repurchasing shares, having done $733 million over the last couple of years. So we certainly view that as an attractive opportunity for us to deploy capital. And then on the selling of timberlands, our view is that the value of timberland is only going up over time and recent transactions certainly demonstrate we are not the only one with that viewpoint. And so that's why we've got that target to acquire $1 billion of timberlands over the next several years and ultimately why we expect to be a net buyer of timberlands over time. But of course, we haven't been afraid to make adjustments to our portfolio in the past. The real estate program is a great example on how we monetize properties with a better use to generate capital that we can deploy for other purposes. So as of now, given our strong balance sheet position and the views that we have about the value of timberlands over time, I'm not sure that we're looking to divest significant amounts of timberland. Mark Weintraub : Okay. But at the bottom line, kind of arbitraging the spreads is just -- it's not the type of thing that you think is sufficiently dial [ph] moving to be kind of a significant part of the toolkit. Is that there? David Wold : Yes. I mean we are always looking at all the levers available to us, but I don't know that I see us divesting a significant amount of timberlands in the near future. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And maybe just one small detail. So you had -- you're indicating OSB prices obviously are down from where they were in the third quarter. In EWP, though, you talked about the costs going up? And is that just a lag, or what was the difference between those two directions? David Wold : Yes, Mark. So the way we do those internal transfers is we have a 13-week rolling average on that pricing. And so based on the trajectory of where OSB prices went over the quarter, we do expect that to be up a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Mark Weintraub : Okay, great. And then lastly, is there much in the way of difference in how we should be thinking about the carbon projects in the South that you are reviewing versus what you did up in May? And maybe if you could explain how they might be different? And in particular, any financial ramification differences as we think about them? Devin Stockfish : Yes. At a high-level, not really, Mark. Obviously, the margin threshold that you have to overcome in the North is a little different than the South. But we think where we are getting ready to sell these initial main credits at a mid- to high 20s range. I think that would be sufficient for the projects we are thinking about in the South as well. There are different dynamics in terms of the growth rate of trees, et cetera. And so the biometrician work is a little different. But really from a high-level, there's not a material difference in the way we are thinking about those projects versus the ones up in the Northeast. Mark Weintraub : Great. Appreciate the color. Devin Stockfish : Right. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ketan Mamtora : Thank you. Maybe to start with, Devin, can you talk a little bit about what you are seeing in terms of lumber import from Europe? I know it has eased from the start of the year, but do you see that continuing to trend down? And then what is your sense of those European inventory sitting at the U.S. ports along the Eastern Seaboard? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, as you say, we certainly saw a pretty significant spike earlier in the year coming in from Europe, that's undoubtedly been coming down. One of the challenges in answering that question with specificity is real-time data on those European imports is tough to get at. There's usually a lag. So it's largely based on anecdotal statements from our sales team. I do think it's continuing to come down. I think it's probably pretty challenging to make the economics work coming in from Europe right now, and you have to cover all of the transportation costs given where lumber prices are. That being said, I do anticipate the European producers are going to continue to keep some level of supply coming in, even at these lower lumber prices because it's an important supply chain for them and an end market that they hope to grow over time. Now I will say, at some point, when the European economy improves, they still have, I think, a deficit in Europe when you take into consideration the lumber that is not coming in from Russia and Ukraine. I think we probably would have seen a little less European supply coming in if their domestic markets were in better shape. Currently, that's not the case, obviously. But over time, I would expect the European economy to improve and more of that lumber produced in Europe to stay domestic. But in direct answer to your question, we have seen it come down. I do expect it to come down a little bit more, but not go away completely. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. That's helpful. And Devin, have you worked through all of that inventory from part of the year [ph] spike. Devin Stockfish : I think so, yes. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. Perfect. And, Davie, just any early read on how you are thinking about 2024 CapEx? I'm not looking for a specific number, just directionally, is it similar to 2023 higher, lower? David Wold : Sure. Yes, Ketan. So at this point, we haven't given our 2024 guidance. We typically do that at the beginning of the year. So look forward to that next quarter. But I can just say our multiyear guidance that we've given of $420 million to $440 million. At this point, I don't see our 2024 guidance changing substantially from that. Ketan Mamtora : Perfect. Now that's very helpful. I'll turn it over. Good luck. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Terrific. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers' remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2023 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $839 million or $1.15 per diluted share on net sales of $7.7 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2023 earnings totaled $749 million or $1.02 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.7 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $219 million or $0.30 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Excluding a net after-tax benefit of $98 million for special items, we earned $121 million or $0.16 per diluted share for the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $321 million. I'll start this morning by thanking our employees for their solid execution and performance in 2023. Through their collective efforts, we delivered industry-leading operating performance, continued to serve our customers and drove meaningful advancements across our multiyear targets. As we enter 2024, we're well positioned to capitalize on improving market conditions and remain focused on driving superior long-term value for our shareholders. As highlighted on Page 19 of our earnings slides, we generated $986 million of adjusted funds available for distribution in 2023. We announced yesterday that our Board of Directors declared a supplemental cash dividend of $0.14 per share. When combined with our quarterly base dividend of $0.76 per share, we're returning total dividends to shareholders of $0.90 per share. Including $125 million of shares repurchased during the year, Weyerhaeuser is returning $783 million of total cash to shareholders based on 2023 results or approximately 80% of 2023 adjusted FAD which is at the high end of our annual target payout range. As summarized on Page 20, upon payment of the supplemental dividend, we will have returned $4.6 billion in total cash to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchase since the first full year of our new cash framework in 2021. It's worth noting that although our adjusted FAD in 2023 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate that our cash return framework is both sustainable and appropriate for the company's portfolio and the cash flow that we generate from our businesses across market cycles. Notably, we increased our base dividend by 5.6% in 2023 and returned additional cash through share repurchase in our supplemental dividend. The additional cash was fully funded within our framework and required no balance sheet or portfolio actions to cover our return commitment. And given the design of our framework, we retain 20% to 25% of our adjusted FAD annually, all of which can be utilized as we evaluate future capital allocation levers, including strategic growth opportunities. We continue to believe this framework is a powerful differentiator, one that enhances our ability to drive long-term shareholder value by returning meaningful and appropriate amounts of cash back to shareholders across a variety of market conditions and also delivers an attractive total dividend yield to our shareholders. Before moving on to business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on the purchase and sale transactions that we completed in the fourth quarter which included the acquisition of high-quality timberlands in the Carolinas and Mississippi and the divestiture of less strategic acreage in upstate South Carolina. These transactions represent a unique opportunity to further optimize our Southern Timberlands portfolio with high-quality, highly productive acreage that is well integrated with our existing operations. And these transactions were structured in a tax-efficient like-kind exchange, resulting in a net cash inflow of $7 million. The gain was recorded on the sale transaction and reported as a special item in the fourth quarter. As highlighted on Page 22, we're progressing nicely against our target to grow our timberlands portfolio through $1 billion of disciplined investments between 2022 and 2025. To date, we've deployed approximately $530 million towards our goal, including announced acquisitions in Washington, the Carolinas and Mississippi. With that, I'll now turn to fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10 of our earnings slides. Excluding special items, Timberlands contributed $77 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $143 million and results across all Timberlands regions were comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market, log demand and pricing faced downward pressure at the outset of the fourth quarter as mills adjusted to a softening lumber market and worked through elevated log inventories. As the quarter progressed, lumber takeaway improved slightly and log supply decreased seasonally. Despite lower log prices during the quarter, our average domestic sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increased mix of grade logs. Our domestic sales volumes were lower in the fourth quarter as we shifted volume to China to capture higher-margin opportunities. Per unit log and haul costs were moderately higher and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower compared to the third quarter. Moving to the Western export business. In Japan, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, inventories of European lumber imports have largely normalized and the Japanese log market returned to a more balanced state in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the third quarter. Our Japanese sales volumes were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and continued to be impacted by reduced shipments to a customer that sustained fire damage at one of its sawmills in the third quarter of last year. That said, this customer has implemented plans to recover most of the lost production and we continue to shift volume to other customers in Japan. As a result, we expect to increase our export volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. In China, log supply into the region has adjusted to lower consumption levels and the market was largely balanced in the fourth quarter. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to China were comparable to the third quarter. Given steady demand from our Chinese customers, coupled with moderating market conditions in Western domestic market, we significantly increased our sales volumes into China in the fourth quarter. Turning to the South. Southern sawlog and fiber markets softened slightly in the fourth quarter, largely in response to ample log supply, elevated mill inventories and reduced demand for finished goods. Despite these market dynamics, demand for our logs remained steady, given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations and fee harvest volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Turning now to Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 11 and 12. For the full year, Real Estate and ENR generated $320 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance. In the fourth quarter, the segment contributed $50 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $67 million, a $27 million decrease compared to the third quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of properties sold. Average price per acre increased from the prior quarter and remains elevated compared to historical levels as we continue to see stable interest from buyers for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. I'll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 23, our full year adjusted EBITDA was $47 million. This represents a 9% increase compared to 2022 and a 114% increase since the inception of this business in 2020. For 2023, we achieved solid contributions from conservation, mitigation banking and renewables and demand for these businesses continues to grow. In addition, we achieved notable milestones in our forest carbon business in 2023, including the approval of our pilot project in Maine and the monetization of the initial credits from this project. These credits were sold in the fourth quarter at a strong price and demonstrate our commitment to offering only the highest quality credits to the market. Looking forward, we expect the new issuance of credits from our Maine project later this year. Further, we're developing additional forest carbon projects within our U.S. timberlands. We anticipate receiving approval on 2 projects in the U.S. South in early '24 and intend to monetize additional credits in the voluntary market this year. Turning to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to see solid progress being made on the projects we've announced with Oxy Low Carbon Ventures and Exxon and both are expected to be online in late 2025 or 2026. Moving forward, we continue to advance discussions with high-quality CCS developers on portions of our Southern U.S. acreage and expect to announce additional agreements in the future. As we look back over the last several years, I'm extremely proud of the progress that we've made in our Natural Climate Solutions business and the leadership we've demonstrated along the way. We were the first company in our space to embark on this journey in a comprehensive manner and had delivered notable accomplishments across all of our NCS businesses. And in the process, we built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and a strong commercial focus. We've laid the foundation to develop and advance our NCS offerings in-house, allowing Weyerhaeuser to capture the vast majority of the economics associated with these opportunities. And we've quickly established a peer-leading position in emerging carbon markets. As we think about the future, we remain focused on growing our NCS business to $100 million of EBITDA by year-end 2025 and we see significant future upside as markets continue to develop, particularly in carbon and renewables. And with the work we've already completed and the prospects of advancing NCS across our expansive timberland holdings, we have a lot of conviction that there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser. So now moving on to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $105 million to earnings before special items in the fourth quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $159 million, a 52% reduction from the third quarter, largely driven by lower commodity pricing. Starting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $34 million loss. Weaker product pricing was the primary driver as the framing lumber composite posted its lowest quarterly average in a number of years. Our average sales realizations decreased 14% compared to the third quarter. This was driven by cautious buyer sentiment and ample lumber supply in the North American market. That said, buyer sentiment and product pricing started to improve toward the end of the year, following stronger-than-expected housing starts data and positive signals from the Fed on the trajectory of interest rates. Our fourth quarter performance was further impacted by a decrease in production levels which resulted in lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs. This was largely driven by a combination of taking additional holiday downtime at our Pacific Northwest mills, a period of downtime at our mill in British Columbia and operating challenges at certain facilities. Market conditions were particularly challenging in the Northwest in the fourth quarter, given the more rapid decline in lumber pricing compared to log prices. As we enter 2024, market conditions are starting to improve and we expect stronger performance from our lumber business in the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA for OSB was $73 million, a decrease of $45 million compared to the third quarter, primarily due to lower product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter on a downward trajectory but stabilized by the end of October and increased through year-end. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and a resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our OSB pricing exited the quarter at a higher level than where we entered. However, our fourth quarter average realizations decreased by 17% compared to the prior quarter. Our sales volumes and fiber costs were comparable to the third quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower. Engineered Wood Products delivered $104 million of adjusted EBITDA, a decrease of $21 million compared to the third quarter. Sales realizations for most products decreased slightly as supply and demand continue to rebalance in certain markets. I would note, however, that pricing remains quite healthy on a historical basis. Sales volumes were lower for most products compared to the third quarter, driven by seasonally lower demand and improving supply across the EWP market. Unit manufacturing costs were slightly lower in the fourth quarter and raw material costs increased primarily for OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased $15 million compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a decrease in commodity realizations and seasonally lower sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and 2024 outlook. David Wold : Thank you, Devin and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and fourth quarter financial performance before moving into our first quarter and full year 2024 outlook. I'll begin with key financial items which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $288 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to more than $1.4 billion. As Devin mentioned, we are returning $783 million to shareholders based on 2023 results which includes $125 million of share repurchases. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $15 million and we have now completed approximately $750 million of activity under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Entering 2024, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. Turning to the balance sheet. We ended the year with approximately $1.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, of which $102 million is earmarked for the supplemental dividend we announced yesterday that will be paid in February. In December, we repaid our $860 million, 5.2% private note at maturity and also closed on a 5-year $250 million variable rate term loan. This completes a series of transactions over the course of the year, along with our $750 million bond issuance in May to refinance approximately $1 billion of debt. We ended the year with gross debt of $5.1 billion, consistent with our total as of the prior year-end and we have no further debt maturities until 2025. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $8 million compared to the third quarter. This increase was primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2024 are presented on Pages 24 and 25. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady log demand in the domestic market in the first quarter as mills respond to seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. That said, we anticipate a slight decrease in our overall and our average domestic sales realizations largely driven by a lower mix of grade logs. Absent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be moderately higher in the first quarter. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be significantly lower as we make the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. And forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities. Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, we expect to deliver higher sales volumes into the Japanese market in the first quarter. This is largely in response to measures taken by one of our customers to increase production following a fire at their sawmill in the third quarter of last year. With a more balanced Japanese log market and improving conditions in the Western domestic market, we anticipate slightly higher average sales realizations for our export logs into Japan in the first quarter. In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Turning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern log markets are expected to be fairly stable in the first quarter as mills respond to a seasonal reduction in log supply and the prospect of increased demand for finished goods. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations due to mix. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2024, we expect total company fee harvest volumes to increase to approximately 35.5 million tons, with all regions delivering slightly higher volumes compared to 2023 levels. Moving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2024 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we anticipate a significant increase in EBITDA in 2024 as we continue to advance toward our $100 million target. For the segment, we expect full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $320 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be approximately 35% to 45% for the year. First quarter earnings are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2023, while adjusted EBITDA is expected to be approximately $15 million higher primarily due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. Turning to our Wood Products segment. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB have increased from lower levels in the fourth quarter but have remained fairly stable over the last several weeks. As the quarter progresses, we expect improving market conditions and demand for both products heading into the spring building season. Excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter adjusted EBITDA and earnings before special items to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2023. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs as operating conditions improve. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower, primarily in Canada. For our oriented strand board business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher compared to the fourth quarter with slightly lower unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the first quarter. As shown on Page 26, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber and OSB are slightly higher than the fourth quarter averages. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. We expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes in the first quarter, primarily for solid section products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be slightly lower for most products as previously determined price adjustments take effect in certain markets. Raw material costs are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the fourth quarter, primarily driven by an increase in commodity realizations and higher sales volumes. I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 25. Our full year 2023 interest expense was $280 million. For full year 2024, we expect interest expense will be approximately $275 million. Turning to taxes, our full year 2023 effective tax rate was approximately 12%, excluding special items. For first quarter and full year 2024, we expect our effective tax rate will be between 13% and 16% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. For cash taxes, we paid $63 million for full year 2023 which was lower than our tax expense, excluding special items due to the timing of U.S. and Canadian tax payments. We expect our 2024 cash taxes will be comparable to our overall tax expense. For pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, non-operating pension and post-employment expense was $45 million in 2023. For 2024, we expect this expense will be comparable to 2023. Cash paid for pension and post-employment plans in 2023 was $20 million. In 2024, we do not anticipate any cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan and our required cash payments for all other plans will be approximately $20 million. Turning now to capital expenditures. Our full year 2023 capital investments totaled $440 million plus $7 million of capitalized interest. We expect total capital for 2024 will be comparable at approximately $440 million which includes : $115 million for Timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs; $310 million for Wood Products; and $15 million for planned corporate IT system investments. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets and touch briefly on our multiyear targets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates for most of the year, the housing market remained resilient in 2023, particularly in the single-family segment. This was supported by a limited inventory of existing homes on the market, combined with the homebuilder's ability to offer mortgage rate buydowns and other incentives and underpinned by a strong overall demand for housing. Given the tailwinds from last year, along with improving mortgage rates and a more favorable macro environment, our outlook for single-family housing demand in 2024 is more optimistic relative to this time last year. And that aligns with what we are hearing from our homebuilder customers. We are, however, somewhat less optimistic about the multifamily segment in the near term, largely driven by the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily. All in all, we're more positive on the housing setup for 2024 and believe we should see an uptick in demand for our products. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel. Activity in the fourth quarter remained steady and barring significant weather disruptions, we expect a similar level of repair and remodel demand in the first quarter. As for 2024, we believe the underlying demand fundamentals are incrementally more positive compared to last year, supported by otherwise prospective homebuyers choosing to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home and a higher mortgage rate environment, combined with a healthier economy. And based on recent trends, we think activity will be more heavily weighted toward the Pro segment versus DIY. Looking beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. Finally, I'd like to provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced during our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made notable advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio, we've more than -- we're more than halfway to our $1 billion Timberlands growth target and we've increased Natural Climate Solutions EBITDA by 114% since the inception of that business. In terms of our operating performance, we've made progress against all of our OpEx priorities and have captured $77 million of margin improvements over the last 2 years. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2023, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products businesses and are number one in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands. On the ESG front, we're making progress on reducing our greenhouse gas emissions and have committed to net zero emissions by 2040. And finally, we continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to disciplined capital allocation by increasing our quarterly dividend by more than 5% annually and returning nearly $4.6 billion of cash to shareholders based on our results from 2021 through 2023. We're incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which have made Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, we remain committed to driving continued improvements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our strategic targets by year-end 2025. So in closing, our performance in 2023 reflects solid execution across our businesses. As we enter 2024, we're encouraged by resiliency in the housing market and maintain a favorable long-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that will drive growth for our businesses. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong and we remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unrivaled portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : Just start with the outline that you gave, framing the housing outlook for this year was helpful. And when you think about Weyerhaeuser's positioning relative to that, can you talk about the ability to ramp your production across the different product categories? Where do you think you're sort of best able to really capture the benefits of that lift, especially perhaps if some of the R&R activity comes back this year? And then any thoughts on the channel inventories across the different products and how they're positioned going into the spring? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I'll start with the first question and sort of go product by product. On the lumber side, that's the business where we have the most flexibility to increase production. And I would say just as a baseline, we would expect to see a pretty significant increase in our production levels in 2024 as we've made a lot of capital investments over the last several years that are really starting to come to fruition. But we do have some upside there. Lumber is one of those areas where you can add shifts, you can add some overtime to take advantage of strong markets when those present themselves. OSB, it's a little bit more difficult. Those operations typically run 24/7 already, so there's really not a whole lot of flex on the OSB side. I would say on the EWP side, there's a little bit of flexibility but those typically have an operating posture where you just don't have as much slack in the system. So really, for the most part, it's going to be lumber and, to a large extent, distribution as well is another area where you can take advantage of strong markets. On the inventory and the channel question, I would say lumber inventory right now is still pretty lean across the system. OSB, I would say, is more or less normal for this time of year. Before the weather events, I would say that the South maybe on the OSB side was a little leaner than normal but otherwise mostly balanced across the system. And then on EWP, I'd say it's about normal for this time of year. Susan Maklari : Okay, that's helpful. And then you mentioned the $77 million of OpEx that you have realized in the last 2 years. As you think about 2024, any thoughts on some of the initiatives you'll be focused on, perhaps areas that you are planning to do certain initiatives in? Can you just give us some color on that? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, just a quick note on that $77 million. Given the inflationary backdrop that we've been operating in over the last several years, that's really a remarkable number. And as we think about rolling into 2024, a lot of the initiatives are the same ones we've been working on. It's reliability in the Wood Products business, taking advantage of all of those capital projects and just the operating improvements. It's looking for opportunities to improve recovery, to make sure that you're capturing the full value of the raw materials entering the mill set. We're continuing to work on innovation across the system all throughout Wood Products and I think that's going to start really delivering some value. On the Timberlands side, it's continuing to look for ways to reduce our log and haul costs, improve how we build roads, really just across the whole system, looking for opportunities to take cost out of the system and improve efficiency and reliability. So it's a lot of the same things that we've been working on for a long time. I think the good news is that OpEx is deeply ingrained in the culture. We have a lot of buy-in all up and down the organization and we're going to stay really focused. And assuming that we're going to be in an environment this year with inflation where it's back to a more normalized level, I think we'll see an uptick in the OpEx that we deliver this year relative to the last couple. Susan Maklari : That's great. And good luck with everything. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos, Bank of America. George Staphos : Congratulations on the year overall. My two questions, I wanted to maybe piggyback, it's a good segue from Susan's question. So certainly, there's been a lot of progress in Wood Products and in lumber in particular, over the years through black at the bottom. Yet it was interesting that, in fact, lumber did have a bit of a loss here in the fourth quarter. Obviously, at pricing headwinds, you had some seasonality, yet there are some other issues as well in terms of maybe some additional downtime relative to normal. But tell us how you think about maybe the need to go back to black at the bottom and see if there's a need for more significant work, given what you said to Susan's question about the fact there's been more inflation. How should we think about that, Devin? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Good question. George, candidly, Q4 was a very challenging quarter in the lumber markets. The product pricing, really the key driver when you see prices going back to the lowest levels in several years, combined with log prices really not going down nearly as much, that just creates a very challenging operating environment. I think as we look at black at the bottom, we think about that not just on a quarterly basis but really over a year-long period. And even in what was a more challenging environment last year, we're obviously still profitable in lumber. That all being said, we're never satisfied. And I do think one of the things you'll see in 2024 is we're going to really ramp up the OpEx in really not just in lumber, across Wood Products as we're facing less headwinds from labor inflation, supplies and equipment inflation. Ordinarily, we can more than offset that through our OpEx work. This last year was just a little bit more challenging. So I expect to see more traction on that front. And then the other thing is we've been doing a lot of work around CapEx over the last several years. And I think in '24, you're going to see some of that result. Holden will be up and fully running this year. We've had a number of other capital projects underway that I think you're going to see the benefits of this year. So we feel pretty good about where we are, notwithstanding a difficult Q4. As we look across the industry and the cost curve, I still think we're in pretty good shape there. You've been around lumber for a long time, George. From time to time, you see these moments in time where the pricing dips below what's probably reasonable. It will eventually recover and we think we're on that path here even just as we head into Q1. But we're never satisfied. We're going to keep pushing. We want to be industry-leading from a cost standpoint, from a production standpoint, from an efficiency standpoint and we're not going to stop until we're there. George Staphos : Appreciate the thoughts on that, Devin and certainly, we'll look to mark the progress. My other question, again, is on the lumber side but in this case, EWP and Engineered Product. So can you talk about why you're seeing, I guess, realization is flat to down? I don't want to paraphrase poorly but that was my take on your commentary, looking out into 1Q. I realize it's a regional market, you get sometimes some imbalances but what's your view on the year relative to supply-demand, your operating stance and how that will translate overall into commercial realizations? Devin Stockfish : Sure, George. On the realization side, as we look at the EWP market, unlike OSB and lumber which price minute to minute, EWP pricing actions typically have a lag. And so as much as anything, Q1, the commentary on realizations is just over the course of 2023, as that market was rebalancing, there were a variety of different price actions in different geographies. And so Q1 is really when those are hitting in full. The EWP market as a whole, I think, is still pretty solid. Pricing overall, if you look back on a historical basis, is still very strong. As we look into '24, we're getting some pretty strong optimistic signals from our builder customers. And so we're expecting steady demand. Pricing is always just a reflection in each individual market of what the supply-demand dynamic looks like. But in a stronger housing environment with what we expect to be mortgage rates continuing to come down, we think the setup for EWP is good. And to the extent that, that market really develops and picks up, we'll be in good shape from an EWP standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : Looking at the market for Timberlands, when you look back at 2023, can you talk about maybe what kind of price appreciation trends you saw in the market maybe on average for good quality Southern Timberlands and the volume of transactions that you saw? And then as we start out the year here, any kind of further comments on just how you see the market in terms of availability of timberlands, who you're competing with for some of these transactions? Or has there been any sort of change there? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, when we look back at 2023, I think the year as a whole is pretty typical in terms of transaction volume, somewhere in that $2.5 billion mark. Last year was a little bit more heavily weighted to the back half of the year. We saw more activity as we got towards the end of 2023. In terms of the overall appreciation, you can look back just really over the last several years. It wasn't that long ago were $2,000 an acre for good timberlands in the South was pretty typical. Those values have increased pretty substantially. We've seen examples of really high-quality timberlands in the South going as much as $4,000 an acre and it's not atypical to see above-average properties going in the high-two\u2019s [ph]. So we've seen a pretty strong value appreciation in U.S. Southern Timberlands prices. Same thing for the West, I would say, just as an example. As we think about 2024, still very early in the year. There aren't a whole lot of transactions in the market right now. That's not unusual in January. But as we think about the year as a whole, we're expecting a pretty typical year, anywhere between $2 billion and $3 billion of transaction value for the year. I would expect those deals to continue to be very competitive. Still seems to be a lot of interest in this asset class. And in terms of who we're going to be competing for deals, it's going to, I'm sure, be the same cast of characters. The TMOs will be active, the timber REITs, I assume, will be into some of those deals, maybe not quite as much, given some of the announcements from some of our competitors but I suspect they'll still be having their toe in the water to some extent. But then I think you're also going to continue to see some of these new entrants, some of the alternative entities that are looking for carbon values or others that haven't historically been active. So we're expecting it to continue to be competitive. We'll be very active as we have been over a number of years. We'll continue to look for opportunities to improve the value of our asset but at the same time being disciplined to make sure that we pay the right price for those assets. Anthony Pettinari : Okay, that's helpful. And then just shifting gears to Wood Products. In the Pacific Northwest, I think recently, you had a competitor that closed a sawmill in Oregon. And they expressed concerns around potentially restricted policies on harvests on state forest. And I'm just curious, I mean, does that have any impact on the market or your business maybe not directly but just in terms of availability of contractors, competitive dynamics? I'm just curious if there's any read-through there. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, the reference there from that mill closure was with respect to some new regulations in Oregon that came into full implementation on January 1 of this year. And the reality is Oregon was already a very tensioned wood basket and with these new regulations which I'll say just by the way, these regulations are really just bringing Oregon closer to the regulations in Washington. So it's -- we've done business in Washington for a long time under those regulations and we'll be just fine under these new regulations. But the reality is it's going to make Oregon somewhat more tensioned than it already was. And so fiber supply will be challenged for certain participants depending on the geography. For Weyerhaeuser, we're in a beneficial position in that we have our own fee timberlands. And so I don't anticipate any issues with fiber availability for our mills. But it may ultimately push the price of logs up in that market as there's less timber supply across the stable manufacturing base. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Kurt Yinger : I just had 1 question. Can you maybe talk a little bit more about what you're seeing in terms of European lumber imports over the second half of the year? And in addition to that, we've heard at least that there's been a growing amount of imported LVL showing up as well. How are you thinking about that potentially impacting the EWP market in '24 and longer term, I guess, the potential that European competitors could try to, I guess, become bigger participants in the domestic market here? Devin Stockfish : Well, with respect to your first question on European lumber, we certainly saw that come down over the back half of 2023. I think that's a reflection of primarily lumber prices and just the all-in cost to get lumber from Europe to the U.S. relative to the pricing dynamic. It just didn't make a lot of sense. So that certainly came down over the course of '23. On a go-forward basis, as we think about lumber, European lumber coming into the market, a couple of things I would point out. First of all, one of the things that was making that trip a little easier is with all of the salvage activity in Central Europe from the beetle infestation, they were getting very, very cheap logs. That salvage activity is starting to wind down. And certainly, we've seen that in terms of the fewer logs going into China from Europe from salvage and we've heard anecdotally a lot of the salvageable -- economically salvageable wood is working through. So there won't be as much cheap fiber to compete in this market. And then over the longer term, given that beetle infestation, the loss of Russian lumber into that market, at some point, the European economy will improve and the domestic demand for European lumber will improve. And I think you'll see more of that number staying in that market over the long term. With respect to your question about LVL, I think that anecdotally, I think that's true around the margins. You are seeing more of that coming into the U.S. I still think it's more or less a rounding error at this point. For us, in the market that we participate in on the EWP space, it comes with a heavy service component and there's a customer service aspect that we're able to provide to our customers that one of the reasons is why Joist is such a respected brand. It's not just the quality but the service component. And I think that will be hard for people that are importing a small amount of LVL to compete with. So it's something we'll watch but I'm not overly concerned about it at this point. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew McKellar : First would be now that you're through monetizing your initial forest carbon credits for the pilot project in Maine, could you maybe share any key lessons learned through undertaking that first project? And talk to how you intend to apply those to the projects you're developing in the U.S. South and elsewhere over the next couple of years. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, we certainly learned some things going through that project. That's why we called it a pilot project. I think the key things from my standpoint are number one and we certainly saw this, I think, in the price that we were able to get with these initial carbon credits, quality matters. And so we put in the time upfront to build out the internal team and expertise to do these things right. And I think that will certainly serve us well. These are complicated. And so again, that expertise to be able to navigate the -- both the development but also the interactions with the third-party auditors and the ACR, that process, having people that really know what they're doing serves you well and makes it more efficient. And I think we've learned a number of things that will make that process go much more quickly going forward. I do think there's still an opportunity to build out some of the infrastructure, particularly around third-party auditors for the amount of carbon credits that we expect to be coming to market in the years to come. We're going to need more infrastructure to ensure that, that can be done efficiently. But the good news is, as we get through this project, if you bring quality projects to the market, we think there's a lot of demand. And so we're really pleased with where we are. We're building out the pipeline. Two projects we expect to get approved in the first half. We've got 2 or 3 more in the pipeline. We expect to be monetizing additional credits this year and those just continue to build. Each project you get layers on top of the prior ones and you build out a nice revenue stream over time. So I think we're really well positioned and in good shape heading into 2024. Matthew McKellar : Great. And maybe next, has there been any change at all in your confidence level or appetite around the target of acquiring that $1 billion in timberlands by 2025? It looks like you included your transaction, the Carolinas and Mississippi with FIA towards that target but that did come with a net cash inflow. So just wondering if there's any change in your thinking even at the margin around being a net acquirer of timberlands with the view that prices should rise over time. Devin Stockfish : No. We still have a high degree of conviction about the value of timberlands over time and our ability to generate strong returns off of that asset. So just a reminder, that $1 billion was really just a reflection of year-over-year through our programmatic M&A activities, we think we will, on average, bring in about $250 million of acquisitions. So there's no magic to that $1 billion. We're going to continue to buy timberlands today, tomorrow, years from now. That's just our core business. We're also always going to be optimizing. And so from time to time, you'll see us trim the portfolio here and there. I think this FIA transaction was a great example of that. We picked up some really strong mature timber that's going to generate nice cash flow close to our other operations, close to our mills, opportunities to create synergies there and divested some land which was fine land. It was just -- it was a little bit more scattered in upstate South Carolina, wasn't near other operations, so just weren't able to provide some of the synergies that we can provide in other places. So those kinds of transactions will happen from time to time. It's pretty unique to be able to do those buy-sell transactions concurrently. When you find those opportunities, we're certainly happy to entertain those. But on balance, we still expect to be a net acquirer over time because we think the value of timberlands is going up and we think we do a good job running them and continue to generate returns. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Michael Roxland : Congrats on the year. Just 1 quick question on EWP. I just want to get some color on order files and how extended they may be into 1Q, particularly as you mentioned, Devin, that those filters are actively seeking products ahead of the spring construction season. So where do order files stand at present? And can you comment on where your EWP operating rate was in 4Q? I think you called out a high 70s range in 3Q. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So you're a little fuzzy there. I think you're asking about order files. Across the different product lines, order files are pretty much in the normal range across lumber and OSB for this time of year. EWP, we have brought those down to a more normalized level last year. I think as we started off 2023, we were expecting a softer single-family housing market and so we had dialed back production. It took us a good part of the year to get caught back up. Our order file has extended out quite a bit from much of 2023. But heading into '24, I think we're in a better position which will be, I think, appreciated by our customers. As we look at operating rates in Q4 for EWP, we were in the low 80s in terms of operating rates for EWP and we'll be up somewhat as we look to Q1 2024. Michael Roxland : Appreciate that. And this even for the order files, I mean, how far do they extend in 1Q thus far? Is it February, March? I mean, how many weeks out do they extend, particularly given -- can you comment around the strong interest from the builders? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, it's product dependent but it can range anywhere from 3 weeks to 5 weeks is pretty much in that normal range and that's kind of where we're sitting right now. Michael Roxland : Perfect. And then just one quick question on Timberland, especially on pulpwood. I want to get your thoughts around mill closures, line closures that happened in terms of number of containerboard mills have closed, the number of pulp lines have been taken offline permanently. You have Enviva going through a restructuring. So would love to get your thoughts on pulpwood demand, obviously plus valuable inflection but nevertheless, it helps with shorter retention, helps with near-term cash flow. So how do you think about rotations, harvest planning and the like, given the changing end market dynamics? Devin Stockfish : Yes, that's a great question. We've seen over the last several years, generally speaking, the pulpwood market has been somewhat in decline. We've seen a lot of mill closures over the years, as you say. Just even recently, we've had a handful of either full mill closures or line closures and that's created some challenge, broadly speaking, in the pulpwood market. I would say for us, because of our scale, we generally have pretty strong relationships with the big consumers of pulpwood. That's true across the pulp and paper manufacturers. That's true across the pellet manufacturers. And so as a general matter, we're typically able to move our volume. But obviously, the pricing dynamic is impacted with less demand overall, so it's something that we're certainly watching. As we think about silviculture, one of the fundamental tenets of how we think about that over the long term is to make sure that we have optionality out into the future. And so as we think about how many trees per acre, our thinning regimes, all of those things, they contemplate a future where we either need more or less grade fiber, et cetera. So we try to preserve as much flexibility out into the future as we can. All of that being said, I would note on the pulpwood market, we're continuing to look -- we, Weyerhaeuser, are continuing to look for opportunities to move that volume. We're having conversations with parties in Asia about potential, either pellet or pulpwood type opportunities, for export. I think there may, in the not-too-distant future, be opportunities for biofuels, sustainable aviation fuels that could tension up some of those markets as well. And so our business development team is very focused on that. And we'll make sure that we, Weyerhaeuser, are able to move our pulpwood volume over time. Michael Roxland : And good luck in the year. Operator : Our final question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Ketan Mamtora : Devin or Davie, can you talk a little bit about maybe just a couple of key projects that you have in Wood Products from a CapEx standpoint? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, so I'll start with Holden. That's our latest mill rebuild brownfield project. That's coming along nicely. We started up the planer mill in Q4. We're ramping up production. We feel very good about that project. The beauty about Holden is it's going to be a phenomenal world-class mill that's completely surrounded by our fee timberlands. So a lot of synergies there and we're excited to see that fully ramp up this year. Beyond that, our program is really just, it's projects that we've already done in other places. So it's nothing super sexy. It's adding CDKs, it's adding new merchandisers, trim store stackers, gang saws. Really, the way that program is developed is every mill has a 5-year road map on how to get from where we are today to world-class. And each individual mill may have different things that are bottlenecks that they need to fix and solve to get to that point. So it's nothing really remarkable. It's just continuing to do what we have been doing, executing well and making sure we do those projects on time, on budget and that's really the essence of our capital plan and has been, for the most part, for a number of years. Ketan Mamtora : Understood. That's helpful. And then just 1 more question around capital allocation, Devin. As you sort of look to 2024 and beyond, I mean, it's been for a couple of years that you are on this sort of the new approach to capital allocation. Any sort of update around how you guys are thinking about supplemental dividend versus share repurchases? And sort of as you look at the different options, sort of how do you think about one over the other? David Wold : Sure. You bet, Ketan. I think we really have looked at that consistently over the last few years and I really don't see that changing substantially as we move forward. I would just say we're in a very fortunate position. We have a lot of levers, so that includes M&A, investing in the business, paying down debt, base, variable dividend payments, among others. We're constantly evaluating those views on capital allocation but those factors are dynamic. So it's something we always need to be watching. To your point, our capital allocation framework starts with that commitment to return 75% to 80% of our adjusted FAD back to shareholders via the base, the supplemental. And we do have the flexibility with our framework to use share repurchase as we've done over the last few years. So that portion is really earmarked for returning cash back to shareholders. And with the remaining adjusted FAD, we can allocate that across other opportunities. So as we move forward, I would expect we're likely going to be allocating most of that amount that we have on our balance sheet here in the near term to timberland acquisitions as part of our previously announced plan to purchase $1 billion of timberlands over the next few years. But that said, we do have the flexibility within our capital allocation approach to deploy those cash across the options when we see an opportunity to create value for shareholders. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : Terrific. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time and we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Weyerhaeuser First Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's first quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our press release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Davie Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported first quarter GAAP earnings of $114 million or $0.16 per diluted share on net sales of $1.8 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $352 million, a 10% increase over the fourth quarter of 2023. These are solid results, and I'm pleased with the operational and financial performance delivered by our teams. Turning now to our first quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $80 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $144 million, which was comparable to the fourth quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA increased by $3 million compared to the prior quarter. Starting with the Western domestic market. Adverse weather conditions in January temporarily impacted log supply and demand across the region. As the quarter progressed, log supply in the system increased as weather conditions improved. Several recent mill curtailments primarily in Oregon also added to log availability in the region. Despite this dynamic, the market remained fairly balanced due to healthy log demand and improvements in lumber pricing. As a result, pricing for our logs was comparable to the fourth quarter. That said, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly, largely driven by a lower percentage of grade logs in our mix. For the quarter, our domestic sales volumes were significantly higher as we strategically shifted logs to domestic customers. Fee harvest volumes were moderately higher and per unit log and haul costs were significantly lower. As we made the seasonal transition to lower elevation and lower-cost harvest operations. Forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan were stable in the first quarter. Despite ongoing consumption headwinds, demand for our logs remained steady as our customers benefited from lower volumes of competing European lumber imports. As a result, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan were comparable to the fourth quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower due to the timing of vessels. In China, log inventories at the ports grew in the first quarter as a result of reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday and increased log imports from New Zealand. However, log takeaway improved as the quarter progressed. Despite steady demand for our logs, our sales volumes into China were significantly lower in the first quarter as we intentionally flexed log sales to the domestic market. Our average sales realizations were slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands decreased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated somewhat in the first quarter largely in response to elevated mill inventories and ample log supply. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were stable in the first quarter as supply and demand trended to a more balanced state. Given these dynamics, our average sales realizations were comparable to the fourth quarter. Per unit log and haul costs were also comparable and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes decreased slightly in the first quarter. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased by $1 million compared to the fourth quarter as sales realizations increased moderately. Fee harvest volumes were moderately lower in the first quarter, largely driven by the early onset of spring breakup conditions. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $60 million to first quarter earnings and $94 million to adjusted EBITDA. First quarter EBITDA was $27 million higher than the fourth quarter primarily attributable to an increase in real estate acres sold. Average price per acre decreased compared to the fourth quarter due to the mix of properties sold but remained elevated compared to historical levels. We continue to benefit from solid demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. Now for some comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. In February, we announced an exploratory agreement with Lapis Energy to pursue carbon capture and sequestration projects across 5 potential sites in the U.S. South. The agreement represents a unique opportunity to scale our CCS offerings. To date, we've entered into 3 CCS agreements covering up to 7 sites across our Southern timber holdings. And we remain focused on developing new projects and intend to enter into additional agreements over the next few years. Turning to forest carbon. On the heels of our first approved project in Maine, we're advancing 2 projects in the U.S. South that are expected to be completed later this year. Combined, these 3 projects are expected to generate over 100,000 credits in 2024 and we intend to sell these credits into the voluntary market. Looking forward, we have several additional projects in the development pipeline and continue to see strong demand for high-quality credits. Lastly, I'll make a few comments on the progress we're making on our renewable energy business with a specific focus on solar. Given our unmatched portfolio in the U.S. South, we are uniquely positioned to drive meaningful value across our land base as demand for large-scale solar development increases. In total, we've signed over 60 agreements for potential solar projects covering more than 100,000 acres across 11 states. Notably, we recently signed sizable agreements in Georgia and Mississippi, and currently have several projects in late stages of development with one expected to be operational later this year. We've been very selective in choosing the counterparties to these agreements and have built an outstanding portfolio of projects with experienced and successful developers and utilities. Looking forward, we continue to see strong demand as this market continues to develop and we expect to sign additional agreements over the next several years. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Wood Products contributed $128 million to first quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $184 million, a 16% increase from the fourth quarter. Starting with lumber. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $5 million loss but improved by $29 million compared to the fourth quarter, largely driven by a slight increase in sales realizations. Adverse weather conditions in January and cautious buyer sentiment weighed on the lumber market at the outset of the first quarter. As the quarter progressed, demand signals improved slightly, particularly for Western SPF and Douglas fir species. This drove modest pricing improvements through mid-March. In contrast, southern lumber markets faced persistent headwinds during the quarter, given weather-related challenges, a moderation in demand and ample supply of finished products. For the quarter, our average sales realizations increased by 4% compared to the fourth quarter, largely in line with the framing lumber composite. Our sales volumes decreased slightly, partially driven by winter weather disruptions early in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs increased slightly and log costs were slightly lower. OSB adjusted EBITDA increased by $14 million compared to the fourth quarter, primarily due to an increase in product pricing. Benchmark pricing for OSB was relatively stable through February, but increased significantly in March. This improvement was largely driven by lean inventories, supply limitations and resilient demand from new home construction activity. As a result, our average sales realizations increased by 4% compared to the fourth quarter, while the average OSB composite pricing increased by 13%. This relative difference was largely due to our extended order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes were slightly higher in the first quarter and unit manufacturing costs improved. Fiber costs were slightly higher. Adjusted EBITDA for engineered wood products decreased by $18 million compared to the fourth quarter. Primarily due to a decrease in average sales realizations as previously determined price adjustments took effect in certain markets. Our sales volumes for solid section products were comparable to the fourth quarter, while I-joist volumes were lower. Both unit manufacturing and raw material costs increased for most products in the first quarter. A couple of things worth noting for context regarding our engineered wood products in Q1. First, we did ship somewhat higher EWP volumes to customers in the fourth quarter of last year after having been on allocation for most of 2023. And consequently, customer inventories were slightly elevated entering the new year. Also, while single-family construction activity remained resilient, we experienced the typical seasonal pattern in EWP demand in the first quarter. That all being said, we expect healthy demand from the single-family segment as we get further into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate higher sales volumes and stable sales realizations from our EWP business in the second quarter. In distribution, adjusted EBITDA increased by $4 million compared to the fourth quarter largely driven by an improvement in commodity realizations and margins. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our second quarter outlook. David Wold : Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and first quarter financial performance before moving into our second quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. Our balance sheet remains exceptionally strong with approximately $900 million of cash and total debt of just under $5.1 billion at the end of the quarter. In the first quarter, we generated $124 million of cash from operations. It's worth noting that the first quarter is usually our lowest operating cash flow quarter due to seasonal inventory and other working capital build. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $79 million, which is a typical level for the first quarter. We returned $146 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which we increased by 5.3% to $0.20 per share during the quarter. This is in line with our commitment to grow our sustainable base dividend by 5% annually through 2025. During the quarter, we also returned $102 million to shareholders through the payment of our supplemental dividend, which was associated with our 2023 financial results. First quarter share repurchase activity totaled approximately $50 million. And as of quarter end, we have completed nearly $800 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. First quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $22 million compared to the fourth quarter partially attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. Looking forward, key outlook items for the second quarter are presented on Page 18. In our Timberlands business, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations, we expect steady to increasing log demand in the domestic market in the second quarter as mills respond to improving lumber takeaway as we get deeper into the spring building season. That said, log supply is expected to increase as weather conditions improve seasonally. On balance, this should translate to a fairly stable domestic log market. As a result, we expect our domestic sales realizations to be comparable to the first quarter. We anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher given seasonally favorable operating conditions in the second quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be higher as we enter the spring and summer months, and per unit log and haul costs are also expected to be higher. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, we anticipate stable log markets and steady demand from our customers in the second quarter. As a result, we expect our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan to be comparable to the first quarter. Our sales volumes are expected to increase, largely due to the timing of vessels. In China, we expect a modest increase in construction activity and log consumption following the Lunar New Year holiday. And given steady log demand from our strategic customers, we expect to significantly increase our sales volumes into China in the second quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Moving to the South. Log inventories were elevated at the outset of the second quarter, and log supply is expected to increase seasonally. As the quarter progresses, we expect sawlog demand to remain relatively stable and fiber demand to soften in response to increased annual maintenance outages. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, we expect our sales realizations will be comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are expected to be higher due to drier weather conditions that are typical in the second quarter and we anticipate comparable per unit log and haul costs. In the north, our sales realizations are expected to be moderately higher than the first quarter and fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly lower given spring breakup conditions. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. As Devin mentioned, we are still seeing solid demand for our real estate properties, and we continue to expect a consistent flow of HBU transactions with significant premiums to timber value. For the second quarter, we expect adjusted EBITDA will be comparable to and earnings will be approximately $10 million lower than the first quarter of 2024 due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For the full year, we maintain our adjusted EBITDA guidance of approximately $320 million for the segment, which includes a year-over-year increase in contributions from Natural Climate Solutions as we continue to advance toward our 2025 target for that business. For our Wood Products segment, we expect second quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be slightly higher than the first quarter of 2024, excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. This is largely driven by improved sales volumes across our Wood Products businesses and favorable cost for lumber. I will note that we do expect demand for wood products to remain healthy, supported by improving housing and repair and remodel activity as we move further into the spring. As shown on Page 19, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are slightly higher than the first quarter average. That said, the framing lumber composite has trended lower over the last several weeks. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are significantly higher than the first quarter average. As Devin mentioned, our extended order files result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. As a result, most of the OSB price improvement that we saw in March will be captured in our second quarter realizations. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the second quarter and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be slightly lower. For our OSB business, we anticipate sales volumes to be moderately higher than the first quarter with comparable unit manufacturing costs. Fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the second quarter. In our Engineered Wood Products business, we anticipate higher sales volumes across all products. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the first quarter. Raw material costs are expected to be higher primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be higher compared to the first quarter due to increased sales volumes and stronger commodity realizations. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets, starting with housing. On balance, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged. Despite elevated mortgage interest rates, the single-family segment remains solid and continues to be supported by strong overall demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the large homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. In contrast, activity in the multifamily segment has moderated given the elevated interest rate environment and the recent and upcoming influx of multifamily units entering the market. As a reminder, single-family construction is a much more important demand driver for our business than multifamily. For the first quarter, housing starts averaged 1.4 million units on a seasonally adjusted basis with single-family starts holding up well. However, we do think homebuilding activity in the first quarter was impacted to some degree by various weather events across the U.S. So the spring building season has been a little slower to kick into high gear. As we move deeper into 2024, we're still expecting healthy demand for housing, particularly in the single-family segment. That's consistent with what we are hearing from our homebuilding customers. On longer term, our view on the housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbilled housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel. Activity has been a little softer to start off the year, particularly in the do-it-yourself segment. Moving forward, we expect R&R activity to pick up somewhat as weather conditions improve and continue to believe that demand will ultimately be supported by prospective homebuyers that elect to remodel in lieu of purchasing a new home in the current rate environment. And beyond 2024, most of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel demand remain intact including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. So in closing, we delivered solid results across our businesses in the first quarter. We also continue to make progress toward our multiyear targets by increasing our quarterly base dividend and signing our third CCS agreement. Looking forward, we're encouraged by the strong underlying fundamentals that will drive long-term growth for housing and repair and remodel demand and natural climate solutions. And given our unmatched portfolio of assets, we're uniquely positioned to capitalize on these opportunities well into the future. Our balance sheet is exceptionally strong, and we remain focused on driving peer-leading performance across our businesses, serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value and returns for our shareholders. With that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from George Staphos with Bank of America. George Staphos : So I want to look a little bit under the hood in terms of timber realizations in the West in the quarter and the implications into 2Q. Now it said you redirected -- you mentioned you redirected volume from export even though realizations were flat in export to domestic markets nonetheless, Western realizations were down a bit. And I guess the question would be, given that price realization, why did you direct so much timber demand domestically when it looked like export markets, at least were able to maintain flat realizations. That's question number one. Question number two, recognizing there were some timing factors in terms of EWP. There's been this steady trend lower in both solid section and I-joist and just wondering what your views are in terms of the implications going forward? And then third, given all the project activity in climate solutions, are you prepared to update your $100 million target by '25 might that number need to be raised at some point? Devin Stockfish : So I answer the third one first with respect to the $100 million. We're still working towards that run rate, $100 million by the end of 2025. As we get closer to that end date, we'll obviously work with you on updating what that longer-term number is, but we're not prepared to do that today. With respect to the first question on the timber markets in the Northwest, the lower realizations was really more a reflection just on mix and not so much on #2, Doug fir log prices, those were just fine. So we moved some, as we always do, looking for the best margin opportunity in Q1 to meet some customer demands. As we roll into Q2, as we noted, we're seeing pretty strong demand from our customers in China, not withstand all of the market dynamics there. So we have an opportunity to flex a little bit more volume to China in Q2, and that's what we're going to do. And that's typical, we'll move back and forth depending on what the best margin opportunity is. With respect to EWP, we have seen some downward price pressure here coming out of the peak of the pandemic, but I think it's important to put that in historical context. We still have very strong EWP pricing relative to pre-pandemic. We still see strong demand. I think on the I-joist side, in particular, one of the dynamics at play during the real peak of the pandemic where we saw product shortages. We did see some conversion to open web during that period. And so we're working on regaining that market share. Obviously, with lumber prices being relatively lower right now, from a cost standpoint, it may take a little bit longer to pull some of that market share back to I-Joist. But we're working on that. The team is doing a nice job of picking up customers and making that conversion. As we think about Q2, as Davie mentioned, we're expecting comparable realizations, and we'll see the volume pick up in Q2 and Q3. So still a good market. I still think there's a lot of opportunity in EWP notwithstanding pricing coming down a little bit from those pandemic peak levels. Operator : Our next question is from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question is on the solar projects that you mentioned, Devin, you gave some interesting commentary on those. Can you talk a bit about how that could potentially contribute to results in the more near to medium term perhaps. And then anything on the unit economics of those projects and how they compare to some of the others that are falling within the NCS area? Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. With respect to the specific economics at this point, we're not prepared to release that, we're really working on signing up new contracts. And I think just from a competitive positioning standpoint for not to do that at this point, we will obviously at some later date. It's going to be a growing component of NCS. The NPV uplift on doing a solar project is always going to be the right answer relative to timber multiple uplift on NPV. So you're going to sign those up as often as you can. The challenges with many of the NCS businesses is just the time line to get these things hooked into the grid. We're signing up pretty healthy number of agreements. We're building up a really nice pipeline. As I mentioned, we've been really thoughtful about the counterparties that we're engaging with, really trying to get the high-end developers to improve the conversion rate. It's important to remember, not every solar agreement you signed is necessarily going to convert into a project that comes to fruition, but I think we'll have a pretty good success rate just given the partners that we're engaging with. So as I said, that will be a growing component of our NCS and even in the $100 million, that will be a decent component of that. But obviously, it will grow over time as more of these projects come online. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful color. And then turning to Wood Products, lumber prices have been sort of softer lately despite the activity that we're seeing on the single-family side, like you mentioned, I guess what do you think that we need to see in order to get some more strength there and understanding you don't forecast lumber prices, but just generally, how important do you think an improvement in R&R is? And I guess, how do you think about that relative to the supply dynamics in that area? Devin Stockfish : Yes, Sue, I think you hit the nail on the head there. The big issue, I think, right now, given that single-family construction has been relatively strong. Although I would note even though we've seen strong housing numbers of late on a seasonally adjusted basis, you do see more actual building activity as you get into spring and summer. So there is just that natural increase in the demand for lumber and wood products as the number of actual building activity picks up. But I think the real issue, and this is particularly true for Southern Yellow Pine is R&R has been okay. It hasn't been terrible, but we just haven't seen as much of that spring R&R activity as we typically would have seen I think in the South, in particular, some of the treated market, we haven't necessarily seen as much buying activity there, which obviously Southern Yellow Pine lumber is big in that treated market. So I do think as we get deeper into the spring beyond some of these weather events, I expect that to pick up somewhat. And so we'll see some of that tensioning up as we get a little bit deeper into the year. But I think with lumber, obviously, about 40% of the ultimate demand is repair and remodel. So if that's a little bit softer, that does have a bit of an impact on pricing. For the SPF and Doug fir markets, I think maybe the outdoor market isn't quite as important, but particularly for Doug fir, the California market is very important. And it was a pretty rainy Q1, it's drying out, you're starting to see a pickup in activity, and I think that will put some upward pressure on Doug for prices as we move deeper into the spring and summer. Operator : Our next question is from Hamir Patel with CIBC Capital Markets. Hamir Patel : Devin, just given how weak the lumber prices have been of late, particularly for Southern Pine, are you surprised we haven't seen more curtailments across the industry? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, on some level, yes, because I suspect there's a good chunk of the industry that's been operating below cash breakeven. So historically, that would have caused people to make certain operating decisions. I do think, to some extent, there's still this residual concern coming out of the pandemic around labor and just to the extent people think that prices are going to turn around, kind of trying to hold out a little bit longer, so you don't jeopardize the available labor force in your mills. So perhaps that's some of it. But ultimately, you wouldn't expect people to operate indefinitely if they're below cash breakeven, which I think where our Southern Yellow Pine prices are, for some of the industry, I think that's certainly the case right now. Hamir Patel : Great that's helpful. And are you able to comment on where inventories look to you in the channel today for lumber, OSB and EWP. Devin Stockfish : I think for lumber, I would say inventory levels are adequate. We've had a few years where they were more or less operating on a pretty lean basis. I think to a large extent, buyers have built up some inventory. I mean, I wouldn't say it's excessive by any means, but at least it's enough for people to not have to be aggressive in terms of their lumber buying, which has been a headwind on price. OSB has been a little bit leaner. I'd say on balance, the channel is still pretty lean on the OSB side. And I'd say EWP is pretty typical for this time of year, not terribly low or high, just generally in normal range for this time of year. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : Maybe first, just following up on the NCS recognizing competitive reasons, you don't like to give too much in the way of details, but are you primarily looking at leasing on the solar side? Or would there be sales arrangements? Is there a strong bias? Devin Stockfish : Yes. We're focused on leasing activity. We think that provides the best long-term value. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And obviously, we've seen some other directional estimates on the types of uplift. Is there any reason to believe that your situation would be meaningfully different from what we hear from others? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean we may have minor disagreements in terms of the specific numbers, but directionally, I think what others are talking about aligned with how we're thinking about it, at least for quality projects. I think the differentiator for us, Mark, is really a couple of things. One, particularly on the forest carbon development, we are doing more of that work internally, so we get to keep more of the economics. And then just from a scale standpoint, we have the opportunity to participate maybe at a larger level. But directionally, in terms of NPV uplift, I think those are generally in the ballpark, at least in our view. Mark Weintraub : Okay. That's very helpful. And just lastly on the CCS. Can you just remind us kind of what the process is here. You got to get that permitting. And then after that, well, you don't get -- the permitting has to be gotten. And then does equipment have to be put in place, et cetera. So what type of time lines are realistic for the CCS projects? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean it is a multiyear process. So you have to go through the process of, first, we provide certain geologic information, but the counterparty is going to do their work and their analysis on that. There's a permitting process as we all know. In the U.S., permitting is very challenging. And so that's a process that has to be worked through either at the EPA level as the one in Mississippi or at the state level now that Louisiana has gotten primacy from EPA. That's a lengthy process that has to be undertaken. Then there's the process of actually building the injection facility on site and the pipeline development. So all of that work does take a bit of time and frankly, probably has taken a little bit more time than we had anticipated when we rolled out these targets initially back in 2021. But again, ultimately, we think this is going to be a healthy business for us. We think the demand is definitely there, but you just have to work through the process. But the beauty is once it's up and running, it's a recurring revenue stream for decades. Mark Weintraub : Right? So is it fair to say that that's probably not a big part of the 2025 but that there's hopefully significant upside beyond that from these projects? Devin Stockfish : Yes, that's accurate. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And then just lastly, I promise last one, on it. So I believe at one point, you talked about 500,000 acres being potentially suitable or identified for CCS. With the Lapis project, do you have an update on that number? Devin Stockfish : Yes, it's probably another 100,000, 75,000 acres over and above that just because 3 of the 5 sites that are part of that Lapis agreement were not part of our initial estimate and so I think that has expanded the potential opportunity zone. I will say just a cautionary note with respect to the acreage references, since we will continue to manage the above-ground land base on those projects outside of a very small sliver for the pipeline and the injection site. It's not necessarily the greatest proxy for how much underground space. We use that just to kind of help dimension. Ultimately, each of these sites will have their own poor space availability. But we do think that the opportunity with Lapis is a nice way to continue to expand our potential opportunities within the CCS space. Mark Weintraub : And so as you think about ratios of poor space to land base, what might be a reasonable average percentage to use? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean it's really hard to do that, Mark, because each one it's going to be different. So I'd be hard-pressed to give you sort of a rule of thumb number since each one is going to be differential. Operator : Our next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Ketan Mamtora : Perhaps the first one on OSB, I was a little bit surprised that your current realizations are up sort of $95 versus Q1 average versus kind of random length, which is up almost $200. I understand the lag impact. But beyond that, what are the other nuances that we may be missing? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean it's really just the lag effect because you're talking about a 3- to 5-week lag trailing behind random lengths. And so what you typically see when you have the tighter markets for us with OSB is we lag on the upside, but then we hold it longer on the downside. That's really it. Ketan Mamtora : So Devin, in that case if we assume that prices stay near these levels for the rest of the quarter, just hypothetically, then is it fair to say that your realizations should move higher if they were to just stay here at this level for the quarter? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Ketan Mamtora : Understood. Okay. And then just one quick one as a follow-up. What were your operating rates in lumber, OSB and engineered wood in Q1. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So lumber kind of in the high 70% operating rate; in OSB, it was the low 90s; EWP was the high 70s. And so again, I think we saw on the lumber side, that operating rate was a little lower probably than we would have anticipated, but that should move back up in Q2. Really, operating rates for all 3 businesses should move up in Q2. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Kurt Yinger : I just wanted to circle back on EWP. You talked about the extended lead times late last year. What have you done from either a labor or operating posture or capacity perspective to kind of ensure that if the single-family strength continues, you don't run into those same issues again in '24. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, a couple of things going on last year in '23. First of all, I think we are still struggling to get fully staffed up across our mill set. I think we are in a much better place today than we were a year ago. So that's number one. Number two, if you remember back at the beginning of 2023 with where mortgage rates were going, I think our view was that it was going to be a much more challenging housing environment. And so we made a decision to pull back a little bit on production to align with what we thought was going to happen in the housing market. Now obviously, that's not how things turned out. And the challenge with EWP is once you get behind the 8 ball, it's hard to get back to even. And so it took us a good chunk of the year to really get our volumes to customers back where they needed to be. We are in allocation for most of the year. So I think heading into this year, just a different view. I think we've seen that the market can operate well even in a higher mortgage rate environment. And so we were running in Q1 at normal operating levels and we'll continue to do that. So I don't expect us to have the same challenge this year. Kurt Yinger : Got it. And then since Mark had asked about CCS, I wanted to ask a similar question around the solar opportunities. Could you just maybe help us understand some of the differences between signing the agreements and the go live or when you might expect kind of any substantive kind of contributions from that? And is there a typical or general rule of thumb in terms of the time line between when you would think of signing an agreement and not ultimately materializing? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, I think historically, you would think it's a several year process. So typically, you sign up an agreement for a number of acres. Usually, that initial acreage is going to be larger. The counterparty will go in, do their work, do the assessment on just the economics of the size and scale, et cetera. And that process is pretty straightforward. I think that things really extended this time line of late is there is so much solar activity going on right now. The permitting process has become quite challenging. I think whether it's at the federal, state, local level, they just don't have the resources available to work through the level of permitting activity, that's number one. Number two, even after you get to that point, tying into the grid, we have an aging infrastructure. And so just the ability to tie new renewable projects into the grid takes a little bit longer than it probably should. You have to work through the utilities. There aren't enough energy engineers to do the balancing assessment and work as things get tied into the grid. So there's just -- the pipeline is fairly large, but there are some pinch points along the way that extends this out. So you're typically now from signing to actually having a solar project up and running, it's a multiyear process, 3, 4 years if things are working well. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Appreciate the color. Devin Stockfish : But I will just reiterate the point. That all being said, once these come on, you have a 30-year recurring revenue that just increases with every year and you've got escalators for inflation. So it's a wonderful revenue stream once they're up and running. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citibank. Anthony Pettinari : In Wood Products, you've been EBITDA negative in lumber for a couple of quarters and Random Lengths seems like it's taken another step down over the last couple of weeks. I'm just wondering, are there steps that you're taking in terms of OpEx or projects or staffing or shifts to improve profitability and kind of your own controllables within the lumber business to the extent you're able to discuss. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I mean, the good news is we've been working on OpEx and cost for a decade. So I think we're, relatively speaking, well positioned on the cost curve. When you think about the last 2 quarters, it's obviously been a tougher pricing environment. But the real challenge for us has been primarily in the Pacific Northwest and British Columbia. And the challenge there is if prices come down a lot quicker than log prices, it can create an environment that's very difficult. Now it's important to remember, even in the Pacific Northwest where lumber profitability has been challenged as a system we're still obviously profitable when you think about our Timberlands and Wood Products business together. But as we think about our system as a whole, Pacific Northwest, British Columbia, you're going to be hard-pressed to find anybody that has a lower cost -- unit cost to manufacture lumber than Weyerhaeuser. And so as the prices come up, which we believe they will, and to some extent, SPF and Green Doug fir are already coming up a little bit. I think we're going to be positioned just fine in those markets. And in the South, the vast majority of our mills are top quartile cost structure mills. So even at today's prices, where I think much of the industry is going to have a hard time driving profitability. We should as long as we run reasonably well, we should still be black at the bottom really under any circumstance in the U.S. South. So yes, it's been a little bit more challenging the last couple of quarters, but I think we're well positioned moving forward. Our relative position in the industry is still very strong, and I think we'll see that play out over the coming quarters. And obviously, at some point, we do believe that lumber prices are going to move up materially, whether that's next week, next month or some time after that. And I think we'll be very well positioned when that does happen. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And then if you look across your portfolio in Wood Products and maybe Timberlands and Real Estate as well, are there end markets or exposures or customer sets that you would view as maybe more sensitive to kind of short-term changes in interest rates and with mortgage rates above 7% now. I'm just wondering, with those exposures or customers, are you seeing any impact in terms of customer discussions or tone? Or just any color you can give there? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Maybe I'll break it down by some of the key components. From a single-family residential construction, that's particularly true for the bigger builders. I mean I think they've been remarkably nimble and resilient in managing through this environment. They're still going to build. I think they figured out how to build through this higher rate environment. So I think they're doing just fine. I do think on the multifamily segment, you have seen more interest rate sensitivity. I think that's the one I would highlight really more so than others that has been impacted by the higher interest rate environment and the inflationary dynamic at play right now. I would just point out, as you think about multifamily, one, obviously, single-family is a more important market for us than multifamily. But even within multifamily, if you look at the spike of volume that's hit the market last year and this year, I think you'd see it's primarily that increases in those higher rise multifamily projects, the -- and those don't typically use all that much wood. The lower rise, the mid-rise, those kind of 1 to 3, 4 to 6 kind of type multifamily, you haven't seen that same spike of volume coming to the market in that space. And so consequently, we don't necessarily think that's going to come down as much. And those units do typically use more wood. So I'm not sure that falloff in multifamily is going to impact us as much as you might think. And then on the repair and remodel, the Pro segment seems to be doing fine even in these higher interest rate environments. I think do-it-yourself has been impacted somewhat, whether that's inflation, whether that's interest rates. As I said earlier, I think that's probably a little bit softer this year. We'll see how that progresses as the year continues. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That's very helpful. And maybe just one follow-up for me on Wood Products. As a reminder, black at the bottom, you would define that as free cash flow positive in all quarters? Or can you just remind us kind of how you define black at the bottom. Devin Stockfish : Yes. It's cash flow positive at trough level prices. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew McKellar : I'd like to start by circling back on maybe George's earlier question around Engineered Wood Products and some of the timing issues there. And please correct me if I'm wrong, but I think you've previously talked about there being a bit of a lag in pricing actually for some components of the business. I think you've guided to comparable realizations quarter-over-quarter with higher raw material costs and how much OSB prices have increased, which I think maybe is mostly specific to Trus Joist. I was wondering if you could talk about the impact to margins there and then your ability to maybe push pricing higher to reflect the higher cost of inputs and just how to think about that sort of timing dynamic? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes, the timing lag is accurate. Typically, price actions can be anywhere from 30, 60, 90 days to come to effect depending on the specific dynamic with that customer. So you have seen -- and that's kind of the Q1 story is some of those prior actions taking full effect in Q1. With respect to the fiber cost or input costs, that's primarily an OSB web stock comment with I-joist, you're right about that. I do think as that price moves up, does that take some of the lower-cost competitors trying to take market share, that puts a little bit more pressure on them. Do remember that for us, the OSB web stock comes from our internal mills. And so to the extent you see higher web stock pricing for EWP or cost for EWP, that means you're getting it on the other side with OSB. Matthew McKellar : Maybe next, just wondering if you could just provide a bit of commentary on maybe what the latest you're seeing is on the market for Timberland acquisitions. Any significant changes in tone or sentiment in that market or any other comments you can offer on what you've seen to start '24? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Our expectation at this point is it's going to be a pretty typical year, somewhere in the $2 billion to $2.5 billion range for total transactions. We haven't seen a lot of big transactions hit the market this year. There is a larger package, I think, up in Northern Washington, Northwest Washington right now, I think that's on the market. But I do think you're still seeing a strong interest in the asset class, particularly for moderate to high-quality Timberland packages. The only thing that we've really seen, and this was true towards the end of late last year as well, maybe a little bit of less aggression on lower-quality packages. We've seen a few no sale transactions here of late. But nevertheless, I think for quality packages, you're still seeing a lot of interest and pricing has been very strong. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Michael Roxland : Devin, I just wanted to follow up with you on the EWP operating rate. You mentioned it was in the high 70s in 1Q. That's down from the low 80s in 4Q. So just wondering, did you take increased downtime in EWP? I'm just trying to reconcile the operating rate comment or the rate itself with your earlier comment that you shipped greater EWP volumes in 4Q after being on allocation for most of the year. So help me just try to reconcile what happened in the operating rate and why do you bring it down in 1Q relative to 4Q. Devin Stockfish : Yes. You're talking about really only a percentage or 2 of difference. It wasn't intentional. It was really -- we had some weather events in the January time frame that caused us to lose a little production. We had one mill that had reliability challenges for a brief moment in time. But wasn't anything intentional. It was really just some operational things. But as I said, plan to move that up as we get into Q2. Michael Roxland : Got you. And where do you think it will be in 2Q? Are you looking at bringing it back to low 80s or even accelerating that beyond the low 80s given what you pointed out as better single-family demand. Devin Stockfish : Yes, it should be in the mid- to low 80s is kind of where we're targeting. Michael Roxland : Got it. And then just one quick follow-up on EWP. One of the things I've heard in terms of why EWP is gaining demand -- gain share against lumber over the last few years. Just in terms of either construction making -- especially within the tight labor market. But when you look at EWP volumes, look at some of your peers in EWP volumes relative to single-family starts, single -- versus 2019, single-family starts are actually up, call it, 6% to 7% versus 2019 -- in 2019. And in that time, solid section volumes are down 4% and I-joist volumes are down close to 20%. So if I try to get a sense of if EWP is really gaining share against some lumber, why are the volumes down in EWP when single-family starts are up. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, without looking at the numbers next year, that's kind of hard to pinpoint the specific numbers. But what I would say is directionally, when you look at what was happening during the pandemic, really couldn't get solid section or I-joist with a certain level of building activity really once it went over 1.5 million housing starts, there just wasn't enough EWP available. And so it put homebuilders in the position where to keep building homes, they had to find alternatives. And so whether that was using lumber instead of solid section or using open web instead of Engineered Wood Solutions, people did what they had to do. And so I do think all things being equal, most builders would prefer to have Engineered Wood Products. And so as that becomes available, and obviously, there's a cost component. Lumber prices have been a little bit lower, making some of those alternatives, a slightly better cost decision. But that being said, as lumber prices ultimately materialize. I do feel very good about the ability to build market share in EWP. Operator : Our next question is from Buck Horne with Raymond James. Buck Horne : Just a quick follow-up on -- I appreciate the comments on the Timberland M&A markets. Just wondering if you could give a little extra color on valuations across the regions that you're seeing right now in terms of just directionally. And I guess I'm also curious if you think directionally carbon optionality continues to be an increasingly important driver of valuations? Or does that theme kind of moderated in more recent months? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean for quality packages, you're seeing very strong pricing. Anything in that Washington, Oregon, area, at least kind of in the key manufacturing regions within those 2 states, very, very strong pricing. I think in the South, we're continuing to see good strong pricing again in markets where you have the decent supply/demand dynamic with mill availability. I do think you're still seeing people try to get their arms around how to underwrite carbon, but there's no question that, that is playing a part in how people value Timberlands really in most key regions. And I think that will continue to be the case. I think it's important to note, as you think about underwriting that carbon optionality, we're still kind of in the early stages of pinpointing what those numbers are going to look like. If you think about the carbon sale that we did just here back in Q4 of last year at $29 a ton, I think that strong pricing. Our view is we're going to see pricing improve in the years to come. But you almost need more data points for people to really bake that hard into their underwriting process. So I think we'll continue to see that be a part of how people underwrite deals today, but probably more so into the future when you have more data points on how to price those carbon offsets. Buck Horne : Got you. Appreciate that. Yes. It's actually a good segue to my next question. I was going to ask you about the forest carbon credits and 100,000 credits you guys are expecting this year? And if you think I mean, should pricing for that be similar to the $29 a ton, you achieved earlier? Or is that improving? Or is that -- what's the trend in kind of that voluntary market? Devin Stockfish : Yes, trends in the voluntary market are a little challenging because there's such a differential in terms of the quality of those projects that are coming to market, and it's still, to a large extent based off of individual transactions. So insight into pricing can be a bit challenging. That all being said, we continue to believe that we're going to get good solid premiums for the product that we're bringing to market. And we do think that as the demand continues to grow for these high-quality projects, pricing will go up over time. Each individual project, there are going to be puts and takes depending on what's going on in the market. But directionally, we feel good about the trajectory of carbon prices over the course of this year and over the next several years. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : Okay. Well, thank you, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

    "content": "\ufeff Operator : Greetings, and welcome to the Weyerhaeuser Second Quarter 2024 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's second quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported second quarter GAAP earnings of $173 million or $0.24 per diluted share on net sales of $1.9 billion. Excluding a special item, we earned $154 million or $0.21 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $410 million, a 16% increase over the first quarter. In these are solid results, and I'd like to thank our teams for their continued focus and operational performances. Through their efforts, adjusted EBITDA improved across each of our business segments compared to the prior quarter, a notable achievement in light of numerous market-related challenges, particularly in the lumber market. Before getting into the businesses, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth opportunity within our Southern Timberlands portfolio. As we announced yesterday, we are acquiring approximately 84,000 acres of high-quality timberlands in Alabama for $244 million. The collective acreage was sourced through multiple transactions, one of which closed in the second quarter for $48 million. The remaining transactions are under contract and expected to close later this year subject to customary closing conditions. These acquisitions represent an attractive opportunity to expand our footprint in one of the strongest inland sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. These are highly productive and mature timberlands strategically positioned to demonstrate immediate synergies with existing Weyerhaeuser operations. In addition, they're expected to generate portfolio leading cash flow and harvest tons per acre within our Southern Timberlands business. As highlighted on Page 18 of our earnings slides, we've demonstrated meaningful progress toward our multiyear Timberlands growth target. Including these transactions, we will have completed approximately $775 million against our target and are on track to reach $1 billion of strategic timberlands acquisitions by the end of 2025. Turning now to our second quarter business results. I'll begin with Timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $81 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $147 million, a slight improvement compared to the first quarter, largely driven by increased sales volumes out of the West. Starting with the Western domestic market, Log prices faced downward pressure in the second quarter as mills carried elevated log inventories and continue to navigate a softening lumber market. In addition, log supply was ample given the seasonal improvement in weather conditions and recent mill curtailments reduced log takeaway in the region. As a result of these dynamics, our average domestic sales realizations decreased slightly compared to the first quarter. Given favorable operating conditions, our fee harvest volumes were moderately higher, and domestic sales volumes improved as demand for our logs remained stable despite softer end markets. Per unit log and haul costs increased and forestry and road costs were slightly higher. Moving to our Western export business. Log markets in Japan were stable in the second quarter, and demand for our logs was steady. Suppliers of European lumber into Japan continue to face shipping and cost headwinds, which has provided our customers an opportunity to pick up market share. For the second quarter, our average sales realizations for export volumes to Japan increased slightly. Sales volumes increased significantly, partially due to the timing of vessels. In China, log consumption increased modestly following the Lunar New Year holiday and log inventories at the ports declined steadily in the second quarter. That said, log takeaway waned as the quarter progressed. On balance, log demand was solid from our strategic customers in the region, and we significantly increased our sales volumes into China during the second quarter. Our average sales realizations were slightly lower compared to the first quarter. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands was comparable to the first quarter. Southern sawlog markets moderated in the second quarter, largely in response to elevated mill inventories, a seasonal increase in log supply and reduced consumption as mills adjusted to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber. In contrast, Southern Fiber markets were generally stable as supply and demand returned to a more normalized state. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the first quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs were seasonally higher and per unit log in haul costs were comparable. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the first quarter due to significantly lower sales volumes associated with seasonal spring breakup conditions. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real estate and ENR contributed $59 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $102 million, an $8 million increase compared to the first quarter, partially driven by higher royalty income from construction materials within our Energy and Natural Resources business. In our real estate business, we continue to benefit from solid demand for HBU properties, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. That said, our average price per acre declined sequentially due to the mix of acres sold in the quarter. I'll now make a few brief comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We continue to see strong demand for large-scale solar development and signed additional agreements in the second quarter. In total, we now have over 70 agreements for potential solar projects, covering more than 130,000 acres across the U.S. South. Turning to Forest Carbon. We are advancing several projects through the development pipeline and expect to have 2 new projects in the U.S. South approved later this year. These projects, in combination with our main pilot project are expected to generate over 100,000 credits in 2024. Looking forward, we're encouraged by the growing support for the voluntary carbon markets and are uniquely positioned to capitalize on increasing demand for high-quality credits. Moving to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Excluding a special item, Wood Products contributed $171 million to second quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $225 million, a 22% improvement over the first quarter, largely driven by an increase in OSB pricing as well as higher sales volumes and lower costs in lumber and EWP. Starting with lumber. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was an $8 million loss with soft pricing as the primary headwind. Average benchmark pricing for lumber decreased by 5% compared to the first quarter. Despite solid single-family housing starts thus far in 2024, and other end markets for lumber, particularly the repair and remodel and multifamily housing segments have been more muted recently. As a result, lumber supply continued to outpace demand and buyer sentiment remained cautious in the second quarter. Although this dynamic is being felt across the North American lumber market, it's been more acute in Southern Yellow Pine given softness in treater and multifamily demand, which are proportionately larger markets in the South compared to other regions. For the lumber business, our average sales realizations decreased by 2% in the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately higher, partially due to increased production following winter weather disruptions in the first quarter. Unit manufacturing costs and log costs were both lower in the second quarter. Before moving to OSB, I'll make a few comments on our recent decision to indefinitely curtail operations at our sawmill in New Bern, North Carolina. These are always difficult decisions given the impact on employees, their families and the local community. So we did not take this decision lightly. New Bern is the smallest mill in our portfolio at 100 million board feet of capacity. Unlike other facilities across our mill set for a variety of reasons, we haven't invested meaningful capital in New Bern. So its cost structure was relatively challenged, making it very difficult in the current pricing environment. Given these variables, along with New Bern's limited integration with our fee timberlands, we didn't see a clear path to achieving sufficient financial results to keep the mill running. As a result, we've commenced an orderly wind down of operations and expect the mill to be fully curtailed in the third quarter. I do want to thank our New Bern team for their contributions to the company as well as the local community for their support over the years. We're working to minimize the impact of the curtailment by providing employment opportunities in other parts of our operations or transition services to affected employees. As for the remainder of our mill set, we are very focused on running efficiently and controlling costs. Given our deeply ingrained OpEx culture and relative position on the cost curve, we firmly believe that we're better positioned to operate through the commodity cycle than most of the industry. Nevertheless, in light of current market conditions, we expect to reduce our lumber production by 5% to 10% in the third quarter. This will take place across our mill set and is inclusive of the new burn curtailment. And looking forward, we will continue to assess our performance, customer commitments and broader portfolio integration as we evaluate the need to further optimize our lumber operations. So now turning to OSP. Adjusted EBITDA [indiscernible] compared to the first quarter, primarily due to higher average sales realizations. Benchmark pricing for OSB began the quarter at elevated levels, but moved significantly lower as the quarter progressed largely in response to the softer-than-expected demand during the spring building season and elevated channel inventories. Pricing stabilized by quarter end and has remained steady into July. Notwithstanding this volatility, average OSB composite pricing was 6% higher compared to the first quarter, while our average realizations were 13% higher. This relative difference was largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our production and sales volumes and unit manufacturing costs were comparable to the first quarter and fiber costs improved slightly. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA increased by $6 million compared to the first quarter. Given solid single-family construction activity, VWP market experienced a slight seasonal improvement in demand at the outset of the second quarter before stabilizing into the summer months. As a result, our sales volumes were higher across all products in the second quarter, and sales realizations were comparable for most. Unit manufacturing costs improved sequentially and raw material costs moved lower for solid section products but higher for I-joist primarily related to OSB web stock. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $2 million compared to the first quarter as lower commodity margins offset higher sales volumes. With that, I'll turn the call over to David to discuss some financial items and our third quarter outlook. David Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll be covering key financial items and second quarter financial performance before moving into our third quarter outlook. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with $1 billion of cash with approximately $200 million earmarked for the remainder of the Timberland acquisitions we announced yesterday. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain exceptionally strong, and we are well positioned to navigate a range of market conditions. In the second quarter, we generated $432 million of cash from operations and capital expenditures were $91 million. We returned $146 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend, which was increased in the first quarter by 5.3% to $0.20 per share. In addition, we returned $50 million to shareholders through share repurchase activity in the second quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $29.96, and as of quarter end, we had completed approximately $850 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. Looking forward, we'll continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. Second quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $6 million compared to the first quarter primarily attributable to changes in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO. The outlook items for the third quarter are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect third quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $20 million to $30 million lower than the second quarter of 2024, largely driven by lower sales volumes and realizations in the West. For context, results for our Timberlands business are generally at their lowest level in the third quarter, given seasonal dynamics. Turning to our Western Timberland operations. We expect domestic log demand and pricing to face downward pressure in the third quarter as mills continue to carry elevated log inventories and navigate a challenging lumber market. As a result, our domestic sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower compared to the second quarter. Our fee harvest volumes will be slightly lower as we have made the seasonal transition into higher elevation operations, which generally have lower productivity. Forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher in the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be lower. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, we anticipate continued steady demand from our customers in the third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes are expected to be comparable to the second quarter. That said, we anticipate a moderate decrease in our average sales realizations given ongoing consumption headwinds in the Japanese log market and the effects of a strengthening yen against the dollar. In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the third quarter in response to lower consumption levels and an increase of log inventories at the ports. As a result, our sales volumes to China are expected to be lower compared to the second quarter, and our average sales realizations are expected to decrease slightly. In the South, we expect sawlog markets to moderate somewhat in the third quarter as log supply remains ample, and mills further adjust to lower pricing and takeaway of lumber. In contrast, Southern fiber markets are expected to remain stable with slight upside as the quarter progresses. On balance, takeaway for our logs is expected to remain steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, we expect our sales realizations will be comparable to the second quarter. Given favorable weather conditions in the third quarter, we anticipate our fee harvest volumes will be moderately higher. Per unit log and haul costs are expected to be comparable and forestry and road costs are expected to be seasonally higher. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be significantly higher compared to the second quarter as we have fully transitioned from spring breakup conditions, and our sales realizations are expected to be moderately lower due to mix. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. Real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we have capitalized on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to approximately $330 million, $10 million higher than prior guidance. We continue to expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 35% to 45% for the year. And we remain on track for a year-over-year increase in contributions from our Natural Climate Solutions business as we continue to advance toward our 2025 target. For the third quarter, we expect earnings will be approximately $10 million lower and adjusted EBITDA will be approximately $30 million lower than the second quarter due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For our Wood Products segment, we expect third quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA will be lower compared to the second quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for lumber and OSB have been fairly stable in July after decreasing for most of the second quarter. For lumber, buyers remain reluctant to build inventories and supply continues to outpace demand. For OSB, supply and demand are currently more balanced, yet buyer sentiment has turned more cautious as we've transitioned beyond the spring building season. As shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately lower than the second quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are significantly lower than the second quarter average. For our lumber business, as Devin mentioned, we expect to reduce lumber production by 5% to 10% in the third quarter inclusive of the New Bern curtailment. As a result, we anticipate lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs compared to the second quarter. Our log costs are expected to be slightly lower. For our OSB business, we expect lower production volumes and moderately higher unit manufacturing costs due to the planned annual maintenance outages that are typical in the third quarter. However, we anticipate our sales volumes to be comparable. Our fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher in the third quarter, primarily in Canada. In our Engineered wood products business, we continue to see steady demand for our products given solid single-family construction activity. As a result, we expect our sales volumes to be comparable to the second quarter. We anticipate moderately lower sales realizations, primarily for plywood and MDF products. Raw material costs are expected to be lower in the third quarter, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower compared to the second quarter due to a decrease in commodity realizations. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. Despite a softer-than-expected spring building season, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged from the last quarter. The single-family segment is holding up reasonably well, covering around 1 million units year-to-date, and notwithstanding elevated mortgage interest rates, single-family construction activity continues to be supported by healthy underlying demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the larger public homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. In contrast, the multifamily segment has been more challenged given the significant amount of new supply entering the market this year on top of elevated supply in 2023 and the impact of higher rates on new projects. Moving into the second half of 2024, we're still expecting solid single-family building activity with potential upside if mortgage rates come down as the year progresses. And that's consistent with what we're hearing from our homebuilding customers. In contrast, we expect multifamily to remain soft through year-end and into 2025. Longer term, our view on housing fundamentals continues to be favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel market. Activity has been softer year-to-date, particularly in the do-it-yourself segment. However, the Professional segment is still holding up relatively well. To a certain extent, persistent inflationary pressures are weighing on consumer sentiment and spending. We're also seeing some near-term headwinds from fewer people buying and selling homes in the current environment. But as we think about the back half of 2024, we are expecting fairly steady repair and remodel activity, albeit at levels below the last several years and would expect demand to increase when interest rates move lower and consumer sentiment improves. And longer term, many of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel activity remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. So in closing, our teams delivered solid operating performance in the second quarter, and we continue to make meaningful progress on multiyear growth targets to enhance our timberlands portfolio and advance our Natural Climate Solutions business. Although near-term market conditions have moderated, we maintain a constructive longer-term outlook for the demand fundamentals that support growth in housing, repair and remodel and natural climate solutions. And with our unmatched portfolio of assets, our strong balance sheet and disciplined approach to capital allocation, we're well positioned to execute against our strategy and navigate a range of market conditions. We remain relentlessly focused on operational excellence and innovation and are committed to serving our customers and delivering superior long-term value for our shareholders. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Susan Maklari : My first question is on Wood Products. You mentioned that you are taking that reduction in capacity in the third quarter. Can you talk a bit more about how you arrived at that 5% to 10% range, what would take us to the lower end of that versus the higher end of that range? And how do you think about positioning the operations just given the changes in the competitive landscape more broadly. We've been hearing smaller players have more staying power this cycle? And does that require you to take different actions than perhaps you would in the past. How do you think about positioning the business for the near term as well as the longer term? And I guess maybe what would you need to see to take more actions there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, maybe I'll answer your second question first and then get back to how we got to the 5% to 10%. As we look at the lumber business, and this is frankly true for all of our businesses. One of the things that we've really been focused on over the last several years is really aligning our businesses for the cyclical nature of our industry. And so what does that mean? Well, it means strengthening the balance sheet, which we've done a tremendous amount of work on that, very strong balance sheet. But it's really focused on making sure that your operations are low cost and can weather these dips that you see from time to time in these markets. And we've been really focused on that with all of the OpEx work that we've done. I think you can see that in our relative operating performance, industry-leading margins across all of our businesses. And we're very focused on that in good times and in more challenging times. In that way, you don't have to take as dramatic action when you see some of these more challenging markets like we're seeing in lumber. So that's what we're focused on all the time, whether lumber prices are high or low, because I think that's the way that you win in commodity markets. And as we see the market today, obviously, and particularly lumber, it's a little bit more challenged. With the pullback that we've seen on multifamily and repair and remodel, that's created an imbalance in supply and demand in the market. And so you're seeing that in the pricing environment. The 5% to 10%, that's really us looking out at the market. We're always looking to balance our supply with our customer demand. We look at the integrated nature of our model to see where -- where do we have opportunities to create value and where do we need to dial back a little bit. And so as we look into the third quarter, obviously, the New Bern mill had some unique situation there just because of the cost structure at that mill and the size. But outside of that, it's really just trying to balance the demand from our customers, maintaining the right inventory levels and really seeking to drive the most earnings that we can in this current environment. I will say, it's important to remember we're at a price right now that is essentially making most of the market underwater. That's not going to last forever. At some point, you are going to see more action taken, prices will come up and then we'll be back in a more sustainable place for lumber. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's very helpful, Devin. And then maybe turning to Timberlands. Obviously, you've got this nice deal that's coming together, part of it in the second quarter, the remaining piece in the back half of this year. As you continue to make those investments and you get closer to that $1 billion target by the end of next year, in Timberlands. How do you think about helping investors appreciate the inherent value in these deals? And the potential for the upside in returns that you can realize over time is these alternative opportunities come together and perhaps even relative to alternative uses of your cash, whether it's investing in organic growth or shareholder returns. Any thoughts around that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Maybe I'll take a crack, and Davie, you can come in if I miss anything here. First of all, I would just say we're really excited about these Alabama transactions. This is an opportunity to pick up some very high-quality Timberlands. As we mentioned, in the release. Really, when you look across the entirety of our Southern portfolio from a cash flow per acre standpoint, really it's going to be really at the top of our ownership. So really pleased to get that. As we think about demonstrating and highlighting the value of our underlying timberlands, I think you're -- you're going to look at a couple of different things. Number one, we're going to continue to get investors out into the timberlands. We did that last year. I think that was a good opportunity for people to see on the ground just the quality of the asset. I do think as we continue to get deeper into this natural climate solutions journey and you start to see some of the work that we've really been putting effort in over the last few years, this is going to start coming to fruition in the years to come. And I think that will be a great way to highlight some of this alternative value. And I'll just use solar as an example, that's been an area that's been particularly attractive. That's a nice healthy uplift over timberland values. And we've already got agreements signed up on over 130,000 acres. So we need that solar capacity to be installed and come to fruition and you're going to start seeing that cash flow hitting the P&L over time. And that will be a way that we can really demonstrate the uplift from all of this work on alternative values. But it's an important part of what we need to do to -- to really educate our investment community on the value opportunity within this portfolio. David Wold : Yes. And I would just add to that, I think this really just demonstrates the beauty of our flexible cash return framework as we think about all the options that are available to us. We're continuing to, of course, provide our base dividend to investors, but we're also able to invest in our business, complete attractive share repurchase activity through the cycle when others may not be in a position to do so. So when markets inevitably improve, we'll be well positioned to take advantage of that position. So we can continue to evaluate all the options that are available to us and will ultimately allocate our capital in the way that creates the most value for shareholders. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. George Staphos : So I guess, first of all, with Timberlands and the outlook, it sounded like the larger amount of downward pressures coming from the West. If we think about the key export markets, China, Japan and domestic markets and then think about shipments and realizations or cost for that matter, within that grid, where would you have us think about where you're seeing the most cost for that sequential downtick in timber EBITDA? Devin Stockfish : Are you talking on the cost side or the realization side, George? George Staphos : Well, I'm talking about EBITDA, we're expecting EBITDA to decline. So if I think about your markets and realizations and costs were shipments, where is most of that pressure coming from, if you get my question. Devin Stockfish : Yes, I get you. It's mostly on the price side. And the dynamic that we have at play right now in the West, I mean, it continues to be a very tensioned market. And under most circumstances, you're going to see pretty strong log pricing in the West. And we've seen that over the years. The challenge that we have at the moment is with lumber prices where they are, we're just kind of bumping up against the ceiling where mills can still make money. And frankly, I think a lot of them are not currently. And so what that's doing is it's causing the mills to run at reduced postures across the West. And so that is really reducing the amount of takeaway. Now we're still moving the volume because we have a strong customer base, but our ability to raise prices in this environment is pretty challenged. And when you look at the Japan pricing, which is kind of second most important here, that typically tracks what's going on in the domestic market. You always get a premium to domestic prices. But those 2 are correlated. And so the ability to really raise prices in Japan is somewhat limited both by the domestic dynamic. But also, as Davie mentioned in his script, the challenges with the yen right now are making that a little bit -- a little bit tougher as well. So it's really on the price side as much as anything. That's what's going on with EBITDA in the West. George Staphos : Thanks, Devin. Next question. If we think about lumber markets and we move to the south, and I forget the precise amount of board feet that was added in the industry over the last 5 years. If you had a figure that was top of mind, it would be helpful. What do you think right now, industry operating rates are within the south in lumber are recognizing it's tough to call, not a monolithic market. We're running 5 days, 7 days. But there a lot of capacity that was added in converting. That was the hope that would ultimately drive higher timber pricing over time. Right now, it doesn't look like lumber is being demanded at the rate that capacity came in. What do you think that imbalance is in the South right now in terms of lumber? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean there have been several billion board feet that have been added over the last several years. I would just note when you look at capacity across North America as a whole, it's been pretty stable over the last several years. But to your specific question around production, I think what we're seeing -- and again, it's hard to say for sure, but certainly, from our log customer standpoint, we're definitely seeing reduced production across the U.S. South. And by the way, that's true in the Northwest and this true in British Columbia, I believe, as well. Hard to dimension it just because we don't have that level of insight into our competitors' operating rates, but it's certainly down relative to where it would be in a normalized condition. I would say the 2 things from an overall supply-demand dynamic, I think, that are important to remember 2 in the South are number one, treated lumber is a pretty big market in the South for Southern Yellow Pine. That's probably been down mid- to high single digits this year from best we can tell and then multifamily just because there is a lot of multifamily activity that's been going on that uses Southern Yellow Pine, that obviously has been down quite a bit this year. So I think the combination of that incremental capacity coming in to the south as well as those 2 components being down has really put some pressure on Southern Yellow Pine. Now I will say just again, over time, what's going to happen is you're going to continue to see SPF coming out of the market. And you've seen a lot of rationalization over the last few years. And what's going on in the market today is Southern Yellow Pine is just kind of pushing into some of those markets that have historically been SPF, but that's going to take a little time to fully play out. George Staphos : No, that's helpful. Last question for me, I'll turn it over. Recognizing you're not going to make changes on capital allocation based on a quarter or 2 you shouldn't. Where you sit here today, do you still feel comfortable about the dividend growth outlook that you've talked about over the years, the 5%? And how does the acquired Timberland now help you keep up that dividend growth? Or in total, allow more optionality in your capital allocation. David Wold : Yes. Thanks, George. I mean obviously, the dividend is a Board decision, but the ability to increase that base dividend is supported by ongoing increases to our sustainable cash flow generation. So to your point, those timberland acquisitions we announced yesterday, the growth in the Natural Climate Solutions business, all of those things help support our ongoing cash flow generation. And so that's ultimately what's going to support that growth in the dividend over time. But I'd also point out, it's not just those things. We also have improvements we've made over time in our capital structure, debt paydown, refinancing, share repurchase, of course, helps contribute towards that, as does OpEx and innovation, the things that we're doing every single day to help make sure we have the right cost structure across our business. I'd say we've modeled a number of different scenarios and feel very confident in our ability to increase our base dividend even in challenging market conditions. Operator : Our next question comes from Amir Patel with CIBC Capital Markets. Amir Patel : In your recent response, you highlighted the treated market down, I think you said mid- to high single digits. So in that R&R channel, do you have a sense as to how much maybe the DIY component is down because I think you mentioned that's faring worse than the broader market. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean it's probably down in a similar range. As you know, it's hard to get really tight numbers in the repair and remodel market. So you kind of have to piece it together from our different customers and some other anecdotal. But that's kind of where we're thinking mid- to high single on the DIY side. Amir Patel : Fair enough. Then are you able to share your operating rates in the quarter for the various Wood Products businesses? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So Q2 for lumber, we were kind of in the low 80% range for OSB, call it, mid-90s and for EWP, low 80s. Amir Patel : That's helpful. And just the last question I had was for the latest timberland acquisitions in Alabama, I appreciate the disclosures there on the EBITDA you expect from timber sales, but would you see additional Natural Climate Solutions revenues of acreage you acquired? David Wold : Yes. Of course, Amir. We -- it's pretty limited in terms of what we're underwriting today in terms of that upside over time. But as we've seen in the transactions that we've acquired in the Carolinas, and Mississippi and other spots over the last few years, we continue to see a lot more opportunities than we had originally anticipated as we bring those into our portfolio. And so certainly, that's true on the Natural Climate Solutions business, but it's also true as we think about the synergies that we identify in terms of putting them into our operating footprint and really just running those timberlands over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Kurt Yinger : I just wanted to start off on Timberlands. I guess, given kind of the capital that you've deployed there and hopefully the fact that we're at kind of a bottom in terms of the lumber pricing cycle. How much confidence do you have that harvest contributions and cash flow can start to show some sustainable improvements over the next 2 to 3 years? And I guess, excluding price, what other levers do you think are going to be most important in driving that for Weyerhaeuser? Devin Stockfish : Yes, I'd say a couple of things, and I'm going to differentiate here between the West and the South. In the West right now, obviously, realizations are down relative to where they've been over the last several years. And a normalized lumber environment, I would expect higher log realizations in the West. So we still feel good about the overall dynamic for pricing in the West outside of these unique circumstances that we're in right now in the lumber market. So you should see a nice pickup in log realizations out of the west when things normalize. In the South, we have been adding timberlands here over the last several years as part of our $1 billion program, and you're going to start seeing that reflected in harvest volumes in the years to come. And so that's a component. We do think, again, outside of the situation that we're in today, where lumber markets are challenged. In those geographies where we've seen new capacity come in, we do expect to see log prices go up over time. We're also very focused, as we've talked about before, on growing our export business out of the U.S. South. And it's still a small component right now, but I'm pretty excited about some of the opportunities in India and Vietnam. And I think we're really looking to grow that over time, which is a component. And then again, just the Natural Climate Solutions piece, I think as you look out over the next 5, 10, 15 years, one of the things you're really going to see PAUSE is the alternative values that are inherent in a timber portfolio are going to start materializing in a much greater way. And whether that's solar, wind, carbon, carbon capture and storage, real estate development, mitigation banking conservation. There are a lot of different things that you can do on a land-based like ours. We've got a whole team that's really focused on identifying and capturing that value. We're still in the early stages, but you're going to really start to see that materialize in a more meaningful way in the years to come. And so that's -- when we look out into the future, obviously, we're going to continue to focus on having the lowest log and haul costs we do today, and we will, I think, in the future because we're super focused on it. I think we'll see some upside on log prices, but we're also very focused on creating alternative values off the land base. So that's what gives us confidence that this program to acquire timberlands is going to develop nicely and create a lot of value for our stakeholders over time. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. And then in terms of EWP, I mean, it was pretty encouraging to see I-joist and solid section pricing hold firm. How would you kind of describe the competitive environment out there? And how would you sort of characterize pricing risk if we were to see single-family starts kind of sequentially soften a bit further, just given what we've seen in the last couple of months. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean as you say, this is a product line that's primarily focused on single family. And so that's -- that's held up reasonably well, and that's given us the ability to continue to move product and keep prices relatively steady. And that's our expectation by and large, for Q3 as well. Look, if single-family fell off dramatically, would we see some additional price pressure for EWP, of course. But that's not our base case. We think that single-family is going to hold up reasonably well. It's a competitive marketplace. We've got some solid competitors. They make a nice product as well. But I think the Trust Choice brand does carry a premium in the market. We do a lot in terms of customer support to make sure that we are taking care of our customers. We think in a unique way that provides us with a competitive advantage. And so I think we'll fare well regardless of what's going on in the market. But as long as single-family housing holds up I think we should be just fine from an EWP standpoint. Operator : Our next question comes from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Mike Roxland : Congrats on a good quarter despite the backdrop. Devin, just one question on the weakness -- how much of the weakness that we're seeing in housing starts, do you think relates to regional and smaller builders who don't have the wherewithal of the larger builders to buy down rates or offer other incentives? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean I think that it's certainly a component. And there's no question, we have seen a bifurcated market with interest rates being where they are. The ability for the bigger builders to buy down rates is a meaningful competitive advantage in this market. So yes, I think that certainly impacted overall new home construction activity. However, I don't think it's 1 for 1 in terms of for every house that a small builder doesn't build it just doesn't get built because the big builders are just taking market share. And you can certainly see that over the last few years. Now the good news, I think, is as rates come down and as those smaller builders are again able to compete on a little bit more equal footing. I think that is another increment that can come back into the market. Mike Roxland : Got you. Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And then just on EWP. You mentioned the operating rate being the low 80s for 2Q. I think it was in the high 70s for 1Q, I think you had some mill reliability issues last quarter. Were those addressed in 2Q and where do you think the operating rate will be in EWP for 3Q? And just last in EWP, if trends continue the way they are in terms of single-family holding its own, when do you think an inflection point can be reached in EWP pricing? Could that be 3Q, it's late 3Q, 4Q? What do you think needs to get us over the hurdle to actually see prices inflect higher? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, in terms of operating rates, in Q1, it was -- there was a little bit of a reliability issue. Some of that was weather related. It was pretty minor in the grand scheme of things. Right now, we are operating at kind of that low 80%. That's more or less what we're expecting for Q3 as well. We can dial that up a little bit if markets improve, but we're really just trying to kind of keep that production in line with what we see as customer demand. So this is the rate we're going to be running at here until we see a meaningful pickup in activity. In terms of what's the inflection point, we're going to need to see a little bit more housing activity. If we can get up to 1.1 or north of that on the single-family side, I think -- it doesn't take a whole lot to see the EWP market tension up. So you don't need all that much more. But again, even in this current environment, we can, I think, do pretty well on the CWP business. It's important to remember, obviously, we've seen prices come down a little bit from the pandemic highs, but when you look at where EWP pricing is relative to history, it's still very strong. Mike Roxland : Yes, I would agree with that. And good luck in the second half. Operator : Our next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Ketan Mamtora : I want to start with lumber. And look, I mean, clearly, Weyerhaeuser has made a lot of progress towards it [indiscernible] at the bottom efforts. But EBITDA in the last three quarters has been kind of negative. So I'm just curious, as we look at sort of back half and to your comments around demand being on the software side, especially for R&R, I'm just curious why do you think a more decisive kind of action towards production curtailments is not warranted given the market backdrop? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Well, a couple of things. Good question. So a couple of things I'd note. First of all, when we talk about black at the bottom, it is important to note that our Wood Products segment as a whole certainly has been black at the bottom. But with respect to lumber specifically, no question. This has been a very challenging pricing environment. Recently, we've seen lumber prices at multiyear lows, and this has been a challenge for the lumber industry as a whole. I would say that's particularly true for our Northwest and British Columbia operations where even though we do have low-cost mills, the log costs have remained elevated relative to the lower lumber prices. But just a few things for context when we think about what's going on. So first, our mill set overall is positioned very well on the cost curve. And you can see that, I think, in our relative performance. even, obviously, we're not pleased with where EBITDA has been in lumber, but relative to the rest of the industry, I think we've demonstrated where we sit on the cost curve. Second, I think we can and should be black at the bottom, even at these prices in our southern operations and in Alberta. And I think, look, it's important to remember that pricing is not going to stay at levels where much of the industry is underwater forever. And so we're ultimately going to see a pickup in pricing for lumber, at which point, certainly, we'll be back in the bottom -- back in the black as a system. But in the interim, we're going to keep focusing on costs and OpEx and running our operations efficiencies to navigate efficiently to navigate the market dip and overcome some of these headwinds. In terms of our operating posture as we said, we're going to be down 5% to 10%. That's where we think just with our cost structure, our customer base, where we think that makes sense. And look, others will make the decisions based on their operations and their cost structure. But ultimately, you're not going to sit in a place where prices are below cash breakeven for most of the industry. Operator : Our next question is from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets. Matthew McKellar : Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. Paul, just a couple of good products. Maybe first, can you talk about your expectations for the U.S. The market for the rest of the year as far as new capacity coming on from a couple of your peers and ramping up as cautious buyer sentiment? And you noted, I think you all for all related somewhat elevated inventory levels. Devin Stockfish : Yes. So a couple of things on that. As we think about Q3 for us, we're expecting, you know, essentially comparable to Q2 from a volume standpoint, sales volume standpoint, from a realization standpoint, we'll see kind of how the quarter progresses, but things feel reasonably steady right now. When you look into Q4, as you mentioned, there is going to be some new capacity coming on. And so we'll see what that does to the market. It is important to remember when new capacity really comes on, it does take a while for them to get really fully into production. So the ramp-up period will take some time. I would also note PAUSE historically, Q3 and Q4 are times where much of the industry takes some of their annual maintenance downtime. So that may mitigate some of that new volume coming to market just from a Q4 standpoint, but overall, if we have more volume hitting the market unless demand picks up, that is going to put some downward pressure on pricing. Now the good news, at least from my standpoint, is our base case is that rates are going to come down at some point. And when you look pretty much everywhere in the U.S. and North America, there are housing shortages everywhere. And so it's really just -- and I can't tell you exactly what the mortgage rate needs to be to kind of unleash that level of building activity, but it's going to come at some point, at which point, I think the OSB market is going to need that extra supply. So we'll see there may be a moment in time where it gets a little out of balance. But over the longer term, I think OSB should be a pretty strong business. Matthew McKellar : That's helpful. And then just switching over to lumber business. Can you talk about your expectations around the impact of softwood lumber duty cash deposit rates moving higher in August for the Canadian industry. Do you expect that pricing can be higher to offset some of that? Or do you have any expectations around capacity that could come out? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, obviously, we don't have visibility into our competitors' cost structure, but if you raise the duty from 8% to 14%, that's just yet another headwind for producers that are moving lumber into the U.S. market. So we'll see what happens in terms of whether that triggers additional capacity decisions or not. But directionally, that could ultimately be helpful. But we'll see. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Mark Weintraub : Just maybe a little bit more on Natural Climate Solutions. So you mentioned 70 solar projects, 130,000 acres. When do those -- can you give a sense when those options expire when you might expect you to start seeing more cash coming in related to those deals. Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean the nice thing about solar is there's a tremendous amount of demand. The flip side is it takes these solar projects a while to work through the system. So -- we're going to have solar development start coming online this year. First 1 is back half of this year and then you add, call it, several year and they just continue to build. And so the pipeline will grow over time, and you're going to start seeing that cash flow hit our income statement. But it's -- unfortunately, it's slow going just the process to move these things through the pipeline. Mark Weintraub : Okay. And so now we're kind of a couple of years into -- after you're having provided that $100 million EBITDA target for Natural Climate Solutions, how things played out differently, better, worse than you expected? And maybe start there. Devin Stockfish : Yes. That's a good question. I think when we look at the overall market, I think the opportunity that we see in the future is probably larger than back when we first set out that target, which is natural to some extent as these things continue to mature. I think the time line on several of these different businesses has probably been a little longer than we expected. And that's particularly true around carbon capture and storage. I think that's going to be a big business. But the process to get through all of the permitting, that's just taken a little bit longer than we would have expected. I still have a lot of confidence that ultimately, those are going to be a nice revenue generator. Solar, probably there's been more demand than we had expected. I think the time line, unfortunately, hasn't dramatically shortened relative to when we kick this off. And I do think just from an overall public policy standpoint, we do need to figure out a way to get these solar projects through the pipeline quicker. But the demand level is extremely high. So we feel good about that. I think mitigation banking is another area where we've seen probably a little bit more demand than we had originally anticipated. So that might be a bigger component of that initial $100 million than we originally anticipated. And I think Forest Carbon is we're seeing growing levels of support. We had the Biden administration that came out in support of voluntary carbon markets, SBTI came out talking about voluntary credits for Scope 3 emissions. You've seen a variety of commentary from the environmental community and support. So I feel like that's -- that's growing in momentum. And when we talk to customers for forest carbon, there's a significant amount of demand as long as you can get over that credibility hurdle. And I feel like we're making good progress there. So I think that's another market that we're pretty excited about. And you're going to really start to see that hit in a more material way next year in terms of the income stream coming off of Forest Carbon. So overall So that flows through typically at a little bit higher price and just kind of commodity OSB. And then lastly, we typically have a higher mix of high-value product relative to sheeting, which helps our overall realizations relative to at random links. And it's really those three things typically. Mark Weintraub : That's helpful. Maybe just relatedly, so when we think about the EWP business, we've got OSB prices coming down, at least the commodity price is coming down very substantially. Does that flow through into higher margins for your EWP business or not necessarily as much as you would think. Devin Stockfish : Yes, absolutely. I mean that OSB web stock, I mean it typically because it is all supplied internally, it's on a 13-week rolling average. So it does roll through. But absolutely, that is a tailwind for margins as you see OSB prices come down for the EWP business. Operator : Our last question is from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Anthony Pettinari : I just wonder, is there any way to quantify the fixed cost reduction you might see from New Bern? And then with the outlook for PAUSE lumber for 3Q. I guess there's a few moving pieces with lower volumes, a little lower log costs, higher unit manufacturing costs. I mean if prices kind of stay where they are now through would your lumber EBITDA maybe be kind of directionally similar to 2Q? Or do you think that you could break even with some of the actions you've taken? Or just any color you can give there? David Wold : Yes, Anthony, just starting on the New Bern, again, I'd remind you that, that's relatively small mill, 100 million board feet and capacity. So there are some fixed costs coming out, but it's going to be relatively immaterial in the broader context. So that's what I would say there. In regard to lumber as a whole, I think that's probably a fair statement in terms of if pricing holds where it's at today, probably relatively comparable, But of course, I do think that there's some reason to think that prices could come up as the quarter progresses. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. And we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor. You may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser\u2019s third quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements, as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and David Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported third quarter GAAP earnings of $28 million or $0.04 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion Excluding a special item, we earned $35 million or $0.05 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $236 million for the quarter. Our teams delivered solid operating performance in the third quarter against a challenging market backdrop. Notwithstanding recent headwinds, we remain well-positioned in the current environment given our deeply ingrained OpEx culture and relative position on the cost curve. Our balance sheet is strong and we continue to demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and capital allocation framework across market cycles. Looking forward, we\u2019re optimistic that market conditions will improve into 2025 and maintain a constructive outlook for the longer-term demand fundamentals that support growth for our businesses. Before moving on to our business results, I\u2019d like to provide an update on the Alabama timberland acquisitions that we announced in July. As a reminder, the acquisitions totaled approximately 84,000 acres or $244 million, and were sourced through multiple transactions, the first of which closed in the second quarter. I\u2019m pleased to report that we completed the remaining transactions in the third quarter and earlier this month. These acquisitions represent an attractive opportunity to enhance our portfolio with high-quality, well-managed timberlands that generate solid returns for our shareholders. In addition, they demonstrate meaningful progress toward our multiyear timberlands growth target. Including these transactions, we\u2019ve deployed approximately $775 million against our target and are on track to reach $1 billion of strategic timberland acquisitions by the end of 2025. Turning now to our third quarter business results. I\u2019ll begin with timberlands on Pages 6 through 9 of our earnings slides. Timberlands contributed $57 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $122 million a $25 million decrease compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower sales realizations and volumes in the West. Starting with the western domestic market. Log pricing faced downward pressure in the third quarter as log supply remained ample and mills carried elevated log inventories and continued to navigate a very challenging lumber market. As a result, our average domestic sales realizations decreased compared to the second quarter. Our fee harvest volumes were moderately lower as we made the seasonal transition into higher elevation and lower productivity harvest operations. Additionally, although wildfire activity was limited in our timberlands, dry conditions across the Pacific Northwest resulted in additional operating restrictions in certain areas, further reducing our harvest volumes in the third quarter. Per unit log and haul costs and forestry and road costs decreased compared to the second quarter. Moving to our western export business, starting with Japan. Log markets softened in the third quarter given ongoing consumption headwinds in the Japanese housing market and elevated inventories of finished products for our customers. In addition, there was a significant increase in European lumber imports into Japan following the resolution of a labor strike in Finland earlier this year. This led to increased competition in the Japanese market. Given this dynamic, demand from our strategic customers moderated in the third quarter. As a result, our sales volumes and average realizations for export logs to Japan were lower compared to the second quarter. In China, log market showed signs of moderation at the outset of the third quarter in response to lower consumption levels and elevated log inventories at the ports. As the quarter progressed, consumption improved steadily and inventories fell to their lowest levels since January. On balance, log demand was solid from our strategic customers, and we shipped more volume to China than our initial plan for the quarter. That said, our sales volumes and average realizations were lower compared to the second quarter. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for southern timberlands increased slightly compared to the second quarter. Southern sawlog markets continued to soften as log supply remained ample and mills further adjusted the lower pricing and takeaway of lumber. In contrast, southern fiber markets were generally stable. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region. As a result, our average sales realizations were comparable to the second quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs were lower as multiple tropical weather systems impacted the region in the third quarter. It\u2019s worth noting that while our timberlands were largely undamaged by these storms, wetter than normal conditions limited our operating activities in certain geographies. Per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the prior quarter. In the North, adjusted EBITDA decreased slightly compared to the second quarter, sales realizations were moderately lower due to mix and fee harvest volumes were significantly higher resulting from the seasonal increase in harvest activity that\u2019s typical in the third quarter. Turning now to Real Estate, Energy & Natural Resources on Pages 10 and 11. Real Estate & ENR contributed $51 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $77 million a $25 million decrease compared to the second quarter, largely driven by the timing and mix of real estate sales. It\u2019s worth noting that real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we continue to capitalize on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties with significant premiums to timber value. I\u2019ll now make a few comments on our Natural Climate Solutions business. We remain on-track to receive approval for two forest carbon projects in the U.S. south in the coming months. Between the initial credits from these projects and the next issuance from our main pilot project, we expect to generate over 100,000 credits. Looking forward, we have several additional projects in the development pipeline and are encouraged by the increasing demand for high-quality credits and growing support for voluntary carbon markets. Turning to Renewables, we continue to see strong demand for large scale solar development and are well-positioned to capitalize on this opportunity as markets continue to expand. In total, we signed approximately 70 agreements for potential solar projects. Notably, we have three solar developments currently under construction, one of which is expected to be operational by year-end. Additionally, we\u2019re expecting two new wind projects to come online in the coming months, which will increase our wind portfolio from six active sites to eight active sites. Moving now to Wood Products on Pages 12 through 14. Excluding a special item, Wood Products contributed $37 million to third quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $91 million, a $134 million decrease compared to the second quarter, largely driven by lower product pricing, particularly in OSB, as well as lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs across our Wood Products segment. Starting with lumber, Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was a $29 million loss as significant headwinds persisted across the North American market. Benchmark pricing for lumber reached historically low levels at the outset of the third quarter, particularly in the U.S. south. This was driven by several ongoing dynamics, including cautious buyer sentiment, ample supply and soft end market demand. As the quarter progressed, supply and demand began trending towards a more balanced state and benchmark pricing improved slightly. It\u2019s worth noting that lumber prices in the U.S. south have steadily increased in October, as inventories remain lean and buyers navigate supply constraints following recent tropical weather events and in response to a series of mill curtailments and closures across the region. In addition, we\u2019ve started to see an improvement in repair and remodel demand in the U.S. south, particularly from the treater segment. For our lumber business, production volumes decreased in the third quarter as we reduced our operating posture in response to a softer demand environment. This took place across our mill set and included the previously announced curtailment of our New Bern sawmill. As a result, our sales volumes were moderately lower in the third quarter and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher. Our average sales realizations decreased by 4% compared to the second quarter and log costs were slightly lower. For the fourth quarter, we plan to return our lumber business to a more normal operating posture. We\u2019re encouraged by recent improvements in the southern lumber market and given our OpEx focus and relative position on the cost curve, we\u2019re better positioned to operate through the commodity cycle compared to much of the industry. Turning to OSB. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $39 million, an $83 million decrease compared to the second quarter, primarily due to lower product pricing. Supply and demand were relatively balanced across the North American OSB market in the third quarter, and benchmark pricing was stable, albeit at a much lower level than the second quarter average. For our OSB business, average sales realizations decreased by 25% compared to the second quarter. Our sales volumes were moderately lower and unit manufacturing costs were moderately higher due to planned annual maintenance outages that are typical in the third quarter. Fiber costs were slightly lower in the quarter. I would note that we\u2019ve seen OSB prices trend up in recent weeks and our order files are now extended out through November. Engineered Wood Products adjusted EBITDA was $61 million, a $31 million decrease compared to the second quarter. This was largely driven by lower sales volumes and higher unit manufacturing costs as we aligned our production to match customer demand and to keep inventories at appropriate levels in light of weaker July housing activity. Notably, our average sales realizations for solid section and I-joist products were comparable to the second quarter. Looking forward, demand for EWP products will remain closely aligned with new home construction activity, particularly in the single-family segment. Given this dynamic, we expect a slightly softer demand environment in the fourth quarter as housing activity typically decreases into the winter months. That being said, we do have a favorable outlook for housing and EWP demand as we transition into next year\u2019s spring building season. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the second quarter, largely due to a decrease in sales volumes and commodity margins. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Davie, to discuss some financial items and our fourth quarter outlook. David M. Wold: Thanks, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I\u2019ll be covering key financial items and third quarter financial performance before moving into our fourth quarter outlook. I\u2019ll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 16. We ended the quarter with just under $900 million of cash, of which $114 million was earmarked for the final tranche of the Alabama timberland acquisitions we closed earlier this month. Our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remain strong. In the third quarter, we generated $234 million of cash from operations and capital expenditures were $97 million. We now expect approximately $420 million of capital expenditures in 2024, which is at the lower-end of our multi-year targeted range of $420 million to $440 million. It\u2019s worth noting that we\u2019re always evaluating our capital allocation levers and have the flexibility within our framework to make adjustments in response to market conditions, alternative uses of cash and the capacity to successfully execute on our annual CapEx program. Importantly, we are committed to investing in our businesses across market cycles and are pleased to remain within our multi-year CapEx range despite the challenging market conditions in 2024. We returned $145 million to shareholders through the payment of our quarterly base dividend and approximately $25 million through share repurchase activity in the third quarter. These shares were repurchased at an average price of $30.64, and as of quarter end, we had completed approximately $875 million of repurchase under our $1 billion authorization. As demonstrated by the recent timberland transactions, the increases to our base dividend, our continued share repurchase activity and our commitment to investing in our businesses, we remain well-positioned to navigate a range of market conditions and take advantage of compelling capital allocation opportunities that generate solid returns for shareholders. Third quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 15. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment increased by $10 million compared to the second quarter, partially attributable to lower corporate function and variable compensation expenses. Looking forward, key outlook items for the fourth quarter are presented on Page 18 and updates to several full-year outlook items are presented on Page 19. In our Timberlands business, we expect fourth quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be comparable to the third quarter of 2024. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations. We expect the domestic log market to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter and anticipate steady demand for our logs. As a result, pricing for our grade logs is expected to be comparable to the third quarter. That said, we anticipate a slight decrease in our average domestic sales realizations, largely driven by a lower mix of grade logs. Our sales volumes to domestic customers are expected to increase in the fourth quarter as we reduce shipments to our customers in China. Forestry and Road Costs and Per Unit Log and Haul Costs are expected to be slightly lower, and we anticipate moderately lower fee harvest volumes given fewer working days in the fourth quarter. Moving to the export markets. In Japan, we expect log markets to remain soft in the fourth quarter due to ongoing consumption headwinds and elevated inventories of finished products. As a result, we anticipate slightly lower sales volumes compared to the third quarter. That said, our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable. Turning to China. Despite ongoing consumption challenges, Chinese log markets are expected to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter, and we anticipate steady demand from our strategic customers. That said, we anticipate a decrease in sales volumes to China compared to the third quarter as we flex logs to domestic customers. Our average sales realizations are expected to increase slightly. In the South, we expect stable sawlog demand in the fourth quarter as mills increase operating rates in response to the recent improvement in lumber pricing. Regarding fiber logs, supply and demand were relatively balanced at the outset of the fourth quarter. That said, we could see an increase in regional supply as logging capacity shifts to fiber salvage activity following Hurricane Helene. As Devin mentioned, although our timberland sustained minimal damage from the tropical weather systems in the third quarter, wet conditions limited our operating activities in certain geographies. As a result, we now expect our full-year fee harvest volumes in the south to be slightly lower than 2023, and we plan to make these volumes up over the next several quarters. On that note, we anticipate slightly higher fee harvest volumes in the fourth quarter. Our forestry and road costs are also expected to increase as some of this activity shifted from the third quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the third quarter and per unit log and haul costs are expected to increase slightly. In the North, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be moderately higher compared to the third quarter, and our sales realizations are expected to be slightly higher due to mix. Turning to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources Segment. Real estate markets have remained solid year-to-date, and we have capitalized on steady demand and pricing for HBU properties. As a result, we are increasing our guidance for full-year 2024 adjusted EBITDA to approximately $340 million an increase of $10 million from our prior guidance and a $20 million increase from our initial outlook for the segment. We now expect basis as a percentage of real estate sales to be 40% to 45% for the year, and we remain on-track for a sizable increase in contributions from our Natural Climate Solutions business as we continue to advance toward our $100 million EBITDA target by year-end 2025. For the fourth quarter, we expect earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $10 million lower compared to the third quarter due to the timing and mix of real estate sales. For our Wood Products segment, we expect fourth quarter earnings before special items and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the third quarter, excluding the effects of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB. Benchmark prices for lumber entered the fourth quarter on an upward trajectory as supply and demand have approached a more balanced state. For OSB, benchmark prices were stable for the entire third quarter, but have increased into October. As shown on Page 20, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the third quarter average. For OSB, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations are slightly lower than the third quarter average, largely due to the length of our order files, which result in a lag effect for OSB realizations. For our lumber business, as Devin mentioned, we plan to return to a more normal operating posture in the fourth quarter. As a result, we anticipate higher sales volumes and lower unit manufacturing costs. Our log costs are expected to be slightly lower than the third quarter. For our OSB business, we expect moderately higher sales volumes and moderately lower unit manufacturing costs compared to the third quarter, given less downtime for planned annual maintenance. Our fiber costs are expected to be slightly higher. In our Engineered Wood Products business, we continue to anticipate close alignment between product demand and single-family homebuilding activity. And as Devin mentioned, we expect a slightly softer housing environment in the fourth quarter given seasonal dynamics over the winter months. As a result, we anticipate lower sales volumes and realizations compared to the third quarter, and raw material costs are expected to decrease. For our Distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly lower compared to the third quarter, largely driven by seasonally lower sales volumes. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call back to Devin, and look forward to your questions. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks, Davie. Before wrapping up this morning, I\u2019ll make a few brief comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets, starting with housing. On balance, our macro view on the housing market is largely unchanged. Despite softer than expected activity in July, the single-family homebuilding segment has held up reasonably well this year and continues to be supported by healthy underlying demand for housing, limited inventory of existing homes on the market and actions taken by the larger public homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. In contrast, the multi-family segment remains challenged given excess supply and the impact of higher interest rates on new projects, and we expect this dynamic to remain in place into 2025. In the near-term, we expect single-family construction activity to follow a typical seasonal pattern through the winter months. And assuming the macro environment and consumer sentiment remain healthy, we\u2019d expect a stronger single-family building activity in 2025 compared to this year. That said, although mortgage rates have come down from recent highs, the housing market could face some near-term choppiness as certain buyers remain on the sidelines in anticipation of lower mortgage rates and improving affordability. Regardless, our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly under-built housing stock. Turning to the repair and remodel market. While activity was generally stable in the third quarter, repair and remodel demand has been softer this year compared to the last several years, largely driven by cautious consumer sentiment in response to inflationary pressures and fewer existing home sales in an elevated rate environment. In general, the Pro segment has outperformed the Do-It-Yourself segment in 2024. As we enter the fourth quarter, we\u2019re encouraged by a recent uptick in demand from our home improvement Weyerhaeuser customers and from the treater segment. While we do expect a seasonal moderation in repair and remodel activity around the holidays, we\u2019re optimistic that demand will recover as interest rates move lower and consumer sentiment improves. And longer-term, many of the key drivers supporting solid repair and remodel activity remain intact, including favorable home equity levels and an aging housing stock. So in closing, despite a challenging third quarter, we continue to execute against our strategy and demonstrate the resilience of our people and our portfolio. Our financial position is strong and our capital allocation framework is both sustainable and appropriate for the cash flows that we generate across market cycles. Looking forward, we remain focused on achieving our multi-year growth targets, delivering peer leading performance, serving our customers and driving long-term value for our shareholders. And finally, we are encouraged by recent improvements in the lumber market, and we\u2019re optimistic that we\u2019re going to see a stronger demand environment for our products in 2025. So with that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : Good morning, everyone. Devin W. Stockfish: Good morning. David M. Wold: Good morning. Susan Maklari : My first question is on lumber and focusing in on the improving supply demand dynamics that you talked to in your comments. Can you just give us some more color on how you\u2019re seeing that building as we think about not just the fourth quarter but then going into 2025? And, how are you thinking about the ability for yourselves and for the industry in general to respond if we do see that demand recovery coming through over the next couple of quarters? How quickly do you think you\u2019ll ramp production and what will that look like across the next several quarters? Devin W. Stockfish: Sure. Good question, Sue. I mean, when we look at what\u2019s happening in the lumber market right now, it\u2019s really a combination of two things. There\u2019s a supply dynamic and there is a demand dynamic. I think on the supply side, obviously, this year, we\u2019ve seen a fairly significant amount of capacity come out of the system. Much of that, maybe 3.5 billion board feet or somewhere in that realm, that\u2019s coming out either permanently or indefinite curtailments, which suggests it\u2019s not coming back in the near-term. There\u2019s also been a lot of softer supply reductions in terms of people dialing back production within their existing mill set. So, a fairly significant amount of supply has come out of the system. It usually takes a little while from the time an announcement is made until the time that the lumber starts shipping from that mill. And, I think we\u2019re starting to really see the impacts from some of those closures. So, that\u2019s a component and that comes on top of by the way some mill closures that we saw last year in 2023. So, it\u2019s been a pretty significant period of reduction in capacity. On the demand side, as we mentioned, single-family housing is holding up reasonably well. We expect that to continue. We\u2019re encouraged that we\u2019re seeing some pickup in demand from the R&R side. We\u2019re seeing treater buying activity picking up and even a little increased activity from the big box stores. So, that\u2019s positive. As we roll into 2025, our expectation is that we\u2019re going to see a better housing environment, particularly on the single-family side, and we expect R&R to pick up as well. And, the challenge there from an industry standpoint is, there\u2019s a little bit of latent capacity in terms of maybe people could operate at a slightly higher operating rate. But, all of that capacity that\u2019s come out of the system is really not going to come back, I think, in the near-term, if at all. So, if you get a meaningful uptick in demand, I think that puts some upward pressure on pricing as we roll into the spring building season next year. Susan Maklari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful color. And, then maybe focusing on the other side of that which is the cost piece of it, can you talk a little bit about the OpEx has obviously been very effective here. How are you seeing that coming through over the course of 2025, the opportunities there and what that could mean for your margins as things do tighten up? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, clearly, the last few years have been challenging with the inflationary pressures that we\u2019ve seen and that\u2019s not unique to us by the way. That\u2019s pretty much every industry. So, that\u2019s been a headwind, no question. I think we\u2019re going to continue to stay focused on cost as we always do. We\u2019ve got a lot of initiatives underway, whether it\u2019s reliability, whether it\u2019s automation, whether it\u2019s just pulling controllable costs out of the system. That\u2019s something we\u2019re working on every day, every week, every year. I think the big opportunity for us as we roll into next year, if we\u2019re in a more normalized demand environment and we can ramp our production up to the capacity levels, get the higher operating rates, we get a lot of benefit to unit cost. And so, that could be a pretty significant tailwind for us next year in our production environment from an OpEx standpoint and a margin standpoint. Susan Maklari : Thank you for the color and good luck with everything. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks, Sue. Operator : Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Hi, thank you. Good morning. Thanks for all the details. Devin W. Stockfish: Good morning. George Staphos : Hope you can hear me okay. Good morning, Devin. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes, we can. George Staphos : Perfect. First question and recognizing the color you gave on the fourth quarter for timberlands in the West and in particular export markets and there are no guarantees in life, we get it. But, what are your contacts in the field saying, what are your partners saying about the outlook for exports in the first half of \u201825? As we mix the macro, I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s any trade policy consideration we need to have, but what\u2019s your view on western exports in particular first half? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. So, I\u2019ll speak to Japan first. One of the dynamics that\u2019s at play right now in Japan is, as we mentioned, there was a pretty significant amount of volume that came into Europe in Q3, and so that put some competitive pressures in that market. I do think a lot of that would at current pricing in Japan is probably margin negative. So, my expectation is you\u2019re going to see some of that European flow into Japan dial back as we get into next year and work through some of the existing inventory. Our customers are very competitive, and I expect that they will go out and regain that market share. So, I think next year, as we think about the first half into Japan, that should be solid demand environment. There\u2019s some correlation on the pricing side to what happens with western domestic log markets. Those things typically move in tandem. George Staphos : Yes. Devin W. Stockfish: But, our expectation is Japan should be fine as we move into next year. I think China is a little bit of a wildcard. I mean, there\u2019s always demand from our customers for Pacific Northwest logs into China. And generally speaking, we have the ability to move more volume into China if we so desire. It\u2019s usually just a question of what does the margin opportunity look like. And, I think there are some real unknowns as we head into next year. We\u2019ve obviously seen fiscal policy in China try to spur the economy. They\u2019re making some strides to try to, repair the real estate market in China. If that gets legs, you could see some upside there. And, there\u2019s always the question about volume flowing in from New Zealand and Australia and some of these other supply regions. I will say, in China, one thing that I do expect to continue to be a tailwind is we\u2019ve seen the volumes of logs coming in from Europe drop off dramatically as they work through that salvage volume. So, I don\u2019t think it takes a whole lot of pickup in demand for us to see that China market improve. But, as I say, a lot of variables that go into that market. George Staphos : Okay. Appreciate it. So, it sounds with that proviso, it sounds like it\u2019s probably getting better from second half of the year. Devin W. Stockfish: Into Japan, certainly. George Staphos : I want to, okay. Thank you for that. For Wood, and this is up there with what have you done for me lately, right, in quotes and Weyerhaeuser has done a tremendous job on margins in the lumber business with OpEx with black at the bottom. It\u2019s a question that comes up periodically. Will you be able to, if you hold the market constant, can you get to breakeven at EBITDA with whatever program you have in place for OpEx in 2025, recognizing it\u2019s a very challenging market and the like, or if there\u2019s no improvement, hopefully there will be, but assuming there\u2019s no improvement, do we need to resign ourselves to moderate, modest EBITDA losses in lumber, for the foreseeable future? How would you have us think about that? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, I\u2019m certainly a lot more optimistic about 2025 for a couple of reasons. First of all, I do think the demand environment is going to pick up. So, that\u2019s our house view. But, putting that aside, when you look at our lumber portfolio, we are well-positioned on the cost curve, notwithstanding that this has been one of the most challenging lumber markets we\u2019ve seen in a very long time. On an inflation adjusted basis, these lumber prices are kind of great recession type dynamic. George Staphos : Right. Devin W. Stockfish: And certainly, we\u2019re not pleased. We\u2019re not satisfied with losing money in lumber. We\u2019ve got a whole lot of work in place to make sure that we continue to take cost out of the system, and we\u2019re doing that. But, what I would say is, it\u2019s just not sustainable as an industry to have everybody cash flow negative across the market. And, so we\u2019ve seen the result of that with a significant amount of capacity coming out of the system. You\u2019ve seen that just even here very recently. That\u2019s tightened things up. You\u2019re seeing prices come up. So, over the long-term, we will make money in lumber. I think, again, we got to put this in context. The challenging market we\u2019ve been in, it\u2019s been difficult. But, I think brighter days are ahead and we will certainly navigate it better than most. And, I expect our businesses to make money and frankly earn a profit well above our cost of capital in all of our manufacturing businesses. So, that would be my expectations for 2025. David M. Wold: Hey, George, and I\u2019d just add -- George Staphos : Go ahead, Davie. Yes. David M. Wold: George, I\u2019d just add, this is Davie. At current lumber prices, we would expect to be EBITDA positive. Where prices have gone over the last. George Staphos : Understood. And should we expect OSB kind of flat to up based on current prices and EWP to be down sequentially 3Q to 4Q? Thank you and I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, obviously, we\u2019ve seen a pickup in OSB prices here over the last few weeks. When you look at our earnings materials, that\u2019s not fully reflected in quarter-to-date just because there\u2019s a time lag with the length of our order files. But if you project that out over the course of the quarter and like I said, our order files have now pushed out little bit, further than normal for this time of year. So, I think directionally, that\u2019s positive. We\u2019re expecting more volume in OSB since we don\u2019t have annual maintenance outages. So, I think directionally you\u2019re right there, and similarly on EWP given our expectations around pricing and volume. George Staphos : Thank you so much. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Kurt Yinger with D.A. Davidson. Please proceed with your question. Kurt Yinger : Great. Thanks and good morning everyone. Devin W. Stockfish: Good morning. Kurt Yinger : Devin, you touched a couple of times on kind of the improved demand in the South, specifically from the treaters. Does that improvement buck typical seasonal trends at this stage and maybe even seeing a positive inflection on a year-over-year basis? And I guess secondarily, do you think that\u2019s an indication of better takeaway from the end consumer or perhaps an inventory positioning at what looks like attractive price levels? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, the historical buying patterns for the treaters, it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for them to build a little inventory in Q4 if they saw prices hit a point where they thought that could be advantageous. Over the last several years, I would say buying patterns from treaters has been a little different than prior history. And so they\u2019ve been more opportunistic throughout the year. In terms of is this building inventory for next year or a pickup in customer demand? I suspect it\u2019s probably a little bit of both. I do think that we\u2019ve just because we\u2019ve seen that in a couple of different channels, I think we\u2019re seeing a little bit of a pickup in R&R activity right now, and so I think that\u2019s a component as well. It\u2019s hard to say exactly how much of one versus the other, but I think it\u2019s a little of both. Kurt Yinger : Got it. Okay. That makes sense. And moving to EWP, a lot of discussion in the past couple of years around shifts in floor systems, I-Joist versus open web trust. Part of that certainly seemed to stem from availability. But if I look at I-Joist volumes this year, it looks like they\u2019re going to be down about 25% from peak. Starts will be down maybe mid-teens percentage. Curious how you would reconcile that difference and how you think about EWP demand relative to starts going forward and the potential for maybe some share recapture. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, I think you\u2019re exactly right. During the peak of the pandemic years, the availability of I-Joists and engineered wood products in general was pretty stretched. And so builders had to switch over to whatever products that they could find to keep building homes. My expectation is that, ultimately, we will be able to recapture most of that market from open web. The challenge at present just has been that lumber prices have been so low. That\u2019s been a little bit more difficult in today\u2019s pricing environment. I do think as pricing for lumber hits a more normalized level, that will be a little easier to recapture share and certainly that\u2019s our expectation over time. Kurt Yinger : Okay. And then just one more quick one on capital returns. Year-to-date base dividends and share repurchases have outpaced FAD and I\u2019m curious how that factors into the thought process or potential for a supplemental dividend in Q1 and how important having at least some level of supplemental dividend is kind of within that variable returns framework that you have. David M. Wold: Yes. You bet, Kurt. I mean, I\u2019d just say we\u2019ve still got some time left in the year to see how commodity pricing plays out. As we\u2019ve mentioned, pricing has ticked up here over the past several weeks, particularly Southern Alpine. So, at this point, I\u2019d expect we\u2019ll be in the ballpark of covering the base dividend with adjusted FAD even if that pricing momentum doesn\u2019t continue. And so, yeah, it\u2019s possible that we wouldn\u2019t have a substantial amount under our framework above and beyond that, but there\u2019s nothing in our framework that would preclude us from doing a supplemental dividend above and beyond that $75 million to $80 million or even thinking about share repurchase above and beyond that $75 million to $80 million as we\u2019ve talked about in the past. But regardless of all that, I\u2019d point out that despite the challenging markets, this is exactly the type of year we had in mind when we designed this framework. We\u2019ve been able to be active in share repurchase. We\u2019ve been able to continue to invest in the growth of our business, both through the Timberland acquisitions, organic CapEx. We\u2019ve increased the base dividend, and ultimately, all of those things are going to leave us very well positioned when markets inevitably improve. So really, to us, it just demonstrates the power of our flexible cash return framework in action and allows us to allocate our cash in the way that creates the most value for shareholders over time. Kurt Yinger : Right. Okay. Makes sense. Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Anthony Pettinari with Citi. Please proceed with your question. Anthony Pettinari : Good morning. Devin W. Stockfish: Good morning. Anthony Pettinari : Just following up on George\u2019s question on Timberlands. Looking at the outlook for 4Q suggests \u201824 might end up being kind of one of the lowest EBITDA years for Timberlands since Plum Creek merger. And I\u2019m just wondering, you talked about kind of potential improvement drivers next year in the West and export markets. I\u2019m just wondering if you could talk about what you\u2019re seeing potentially driving improvement in the U.S. south? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, so as we think about the Timberlands business as a whole, it\u2019s really mostly a function of what\u2019s happened with Western log prices. And it\u2019s a really challenging market to drive log prices up even in a tension wood basket when lumber prices are at the levels that they\u2019ve been most of this year. So, I would just say as an outset Timberlands as a whole, as lumber prices on the West Coast improve, which we believe they will and they have to some extent already, you\u2019ll see log prices follow that. In the south, we\u2019ve had a little less volume this year than we had expected. That\u2019s largely a function of some weather events. The thing about Timberlands volume is if you don\u2019t get it now, you will always get it later, and so we\u2019ll roll that volume into future quarters. We do think that over time in a more normalized environment, many of those markets that have seen additional capacity come in will get some pricing pressure, and we\u2019ve seen that over the years as the new capacities rolled into the south. We\u2019re continuing to look for export opportunities, out of the US south that should help tension some of those markets as well. So, we\u2019re going to continue working at that, and, ultimately, we think over the long-term, you\u2019ll see price improvement in the south. Obviously, that\u2019s been slow to come. But as a Timberlands business more holistically, I think as you see lumber prices in the west pick up, you\u2019re going to see log prices in the west return to a more normalized level, which has a pretty meaningful impact on our overall earnings, in the Timberland segment. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. And then for the hurricanes, and I\u2019m sorry if I missed this, but is there sort of an all in estimate on the impact of the hurricanes in terms of tons or EBITDA or however you\u2019d kind of measure it? And then just piggybacking on that, when you see the kind of these hurricanes typically, is demand for lumber or OSB or EWP, is it sort of destroyed, deferred, or maybe some incremental demand is created? Just how you kind of characterize the impact? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, so first and foremost, we were very fortunate because the path of the hurricane really travelled in between a lot of our timberlands. So, we didn\u2019t really have any meaningful impact in terms of damage to our timberlands. So, the real impact was we weren\u2019t able to move as much volume in the south as we had planned. And so call it maybe 1%, 2% in terms of volume impact in the quarter, in the south. Much of that, frankly, was on the fiber side, so not as much of a margin impact as if it was impacting grade. The impact on overall market dynamics, it really it depends on the specific storm, right? Because as it moves through, it\u2019s going to have some impact on mill operations. So, on the demand side, it typically hurts. And obviously, people are not out building houses during the storm and have to work through some of the wet weather there. Now the flip side of that is you also oftentimes see a pickup in wood demand as the reconstruction happens. And so it really just depends. There are puts and takes on both the demand and the supply side. I think in this one, at least for us, it didn\u2019t have a meaningful impact on the markets. You\u2019ll see in certain geographies, you\u2019ll see a little bit of excess fiber flowing into the market as people that did have damage to their timberlands go out and start that salvage activity. That usually hits the fiber markets a little bit heavier than the grade markets. So we may see a little bit of that in Q4, but I\u2019m not sure that\u2019s going to be material on the whole to us. Anthony Pettinari : Okay. That\u2019s very helpful. I\u2019ll turn it over. Devin W. Stockfish: Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Mark Weintraub from Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Thank you. Since we\u2019ve covered a lot on wood products and timber, I thought I\u2019d ask some NCS questions. Maybe starting with can you give us a sense of how much acreage are tied to the three solar development projects that are under construction? Devin W. Stockfish: Mark, I don\u2019t have that at the tip of my fingers. I mean, the total acreage covered by our solar agreements is about 130,000 acres. I don\u2019t have the specifics on these individual projects at my fingertips, but we can follow-up with you if you need to. Mark Weintraub : Great. And I really was trying to get to what type of economics might be forthcoming with the projects under development. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s something you can speak to off the cuff. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, I\u2019ll tell you, we\u2019re intentionally not getting into the economics of these projects, Mark. And the reason is we\u2019re out signing up new deals every day and we\u2019re always trying to improve the economics for new deals. And so we\u2019re trying to be pretty thoughtful about how much specific information we give on these projects. I mean, I think overall, if you kind of step back, we had in the neighborhood of $10 million of EBITDA coming from our renewables program and that was primarily just the lease payments as people assess these deals and the wind projects. We\u2019ve got two new wind projects coming online next year. We\u2019ve got three solar projects that will be online over the next, call it one of them will be online here shortly and the other two in the next six to nine months with a whole wave behind that. So, I mean, on balance, it\u2019s going to pick up over time and it will become a more material component of our overall NCS business. Mark Weintraub : Right. And any color you can give us on maybe the number of contracts that or options that are expiring in 2025? And does that heighten the possibility that those start moving forward or is that not necessarily the way to think about in solar specifically? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, in solar, typically, you\u2019ll have a few that expire every year and we replace those in the pipeline. So, what you\u2019ve seen is really over the last several years, the number of new agreements that we\u2019re signing and putting in the pipeline far exceeds the numbers that are expiring. And so right now, we\u2019re somewhere in the neighbourhood of 70. You\u2019ll see a few roll off, but we\u2019ve got a whole bunch of them in the pipeline for new agreements. So, I would expect that number to increase over time. Just a lot of demand, a lot of activity on the solar side. Mark Weintraub : Right. So, it sounds like though that the hit ratio recognizing you are refilling isn\u2019t necessarily super high yet in terms of people actually moving forward as the projects are expiring. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I wouldn\u2019t necessarily characterize it in that way just because these projects typically take four to five years from the time you sign up an agreement to the time that it ultimately comes to fruition. The industry conversion rates are somewhere around 35% in that general vicinity. I think we\u2019re going to be meaningfully higher than that. But certainly, not every agreement that you sign up will result in a solar project coming to fruition, but I think we will be on the high end because we\u2019re choosing to coordinate with partners that have a higher success rate and are a little bigger and more sophisticated in general. Mark Weintraub : That\u2019s helpful color. And then lastly just on CCS, any progress on permits, any update on the timeframe for how that might be moving forward? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I\u2019d say broadly speaking with the carbon capture and sequestration, the timelines on these are just they\u2019re shockingly slow. And frankly, the permitting process is just taking a lot longer than anyone had initially expected. So, as we think about how this is progressing, I\u2019m thinking at this point, we\u2019re probably looking now at delays between one to two years versus what we had previously thought. Where we had originally anticipated seeing injections in \u201825 or \u201826, that\u2019s probably going to be pushed out a bit. We really need to get permitting reform, in place to get these projects through the pipeline more quickly. But it is going much slower than we expected. That being said, still think the opportunity set there is fairly large, and ultimately still have a lot of confidence that these things ultimately come to fruition, but just the timeline is extended relative to where we had initially thought they would be. David M. Wold: And Mark, I\u2019d just add more broadly speaking across these NCS spaces. I mean, while we have had some expanded time frames in some circumstances, we\u2019re really pleased with the overall progress we\u2019re making towards that $100 million target by the end of 2025, continuing to work towards that. We may see a little bit more in some of the legacy businesses like mitigation banking and conservation, but really pleased with the longer term trends here in this space. Mark Weintraub : Great. And you\u2019ve mentioned you got approval on the two additional forest carbon projects. Anything else that sort of we should be thinking about in terms of the details in NCF that are meaningful and impactful? David M. Wold: Yes. I would just say on the forest carbon specifically, I\u2019m really encouraged by the trajectory that we\u2019re seeing there. The demand for these projects, the high quality projects in particular, is really seeing a meaningful uptick. And so we\u2019ve got projects, the three projects, the Maine and the two in the south that should have approval here shortly. We\u2019ve got three or four that are in the pipeline behind that and then a whole bunch more that are in the earlier stages of development. So, we\u2019re building out a nice pipeline. It\u2019s important to remember that obviously with each of these projects, there will be an incremental issuance year after year. So, like the solar, like the wind, they build. And I think the pricing that we\u2019re expecting should be pretty solid. And we\u2019re seeing a good level of demand from some high quality customer. So, we\u2019re feeling pretty good. And I think next year, you\u2019ll see a pretty meaningful uptick in the forest carbon revenues and EBITDA that we\u2019ll be generating. Mark Weintraub : Great. And obviously, it\u2019s got magnificent cash conversion, so that\u2019s all good too. Thanks so much. Devin W. Stockfish: That\u2019s right. David M. Wold: Yes, thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew McKellar from RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matthew McKellar : Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. First, what role do you think European lumber imports play if we see an uptick in lumber demand and pricing in 2025, particularly if European demand remains soft? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, I think that\u2019s always a variable you have to take into consideration. We\u2019ve seen that come down pretty meaningfully here over the last, call it, 18 months. That\u2019s largely, I think, a function just of the pricing dynamic that we\u2019ve seen in the U.S. If you have continued softness in Europe, to the extent that there\u2019s a meaningful margin to be achieved, that could see an uptick in European supply. The one thing though I would say is, if you look at Europe as a whole, there are a couple of dynamics that will remain in play. First of which is you\u2019re certainly not going to see that Russian lumber coming into Europe in the near-term. So, there\u2019s a component of supply that\u2019s just going to be gone for the foreseeable future. And then the other dynamic is with all of the salvage activity, from the beetle infestation in Central Europe, I mean, that salvage wood is really dialing back pretty significantly. So, it\u2019s not as though they\u2019re going to have really, really cheap fiber to convert and send over here. So even in an improved pricing environment in the U.S., I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re necessarily going to see the magnitude of European volume coming into the U.S. that maybe we saw during the pandemic years. But around the margins, it\u2019s certainly possible you could see a pickup there, and we\u2019ll see if that\u2019s offset by lower volumes coming in from Canada given the duty situation. Matthew McKellar : Thanks. That\u2019s helpful. And then just last for me. Are you seeing a potential longer term revenue stream opportunity related to lithium mining as it relates to your land in the U.S. South, maybe around Texas, Arkansas, maybe Louisiana in particular? And if so, how would you just think have us think about the potential size and timeline of those opportunities? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, I think at this point, the timing and magnitude, it\u2019s a little early to quantify that. But if you look at where those big lithium deposits are and you overlay that against our land base, I think you can see there\u2019s some pretty significant overlap. So, we do think that is an opportunity, and I can say we\u2019ve had some conversations around that, but beyond that probably not much else that I think we should share at this point. Matthew McKellar : Okay, fair enough. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Ketan Mamtora from BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ketan Mamtora : Good morning and thanks for taking my question. Devin, maybe to start with on the engineered wood side, can you just help me understand a little better in terms of just the sequential pressure in the engineered wood business? Given that prices were sort of flat quarter over quarter and I would imagine some modest benefit on the cost side from lower OSB prices, what are the two or three key challenges in the quarter? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, it\u2019s really volume. I mean, if you sort of just at a very high level, we rolled into the quarter with certain expectations around what was going to happen in the summer building. So, I would say inventories were maybe a little bit above normal, not significant, but a little bit above normal. And then you saw a July housing market that was pretty weak. And so we dialed back our production. We have a general philosophy that if there\u2019s not a market for the wood, you want to be really thoughtful about keeping production levels up and building up significant inventories because you\u2019re going to have to move that, which typically comes at a price. So, we were thoughtful to matching our production to the demand environment. And obviously, housing picked up as the quarter went on. But as you look about look at the quarter-over-quarter impact, it was primarily related to just we lowered our production volume 19% in solid section, 25% in I-Joists over the quarter, which obviously comes with some lost volume, but you also have with the lower volume, you have higher unit cost because you\u2019re spreading your fixed cost across a lower volume. And so really it comes down to just we produce less volume, given the dynamic in the market. Now as that picks up, we can ramp up production fairly easily to match the demand environment. Obviously, at this point in the year, typically, you see a little bit of a slowdown in building activity as you get into the colder months, and so we\u2019re mindful of that. But as we think about 2025 and what we think is going to happen with housing in the spring building season, I would fully expect that business to be back on track and reflect kind of what you\u2019ve seen in prior years. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. That\u2019s helpful, Devin. And then so very quickly, what were your operating rates in EWP, lumber and OSB in Q3? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. So in lumber, you were talking somewhere in the mid to high 70s, in OSB, high 80s, in EWP, kind of mid-60s. Ketan Mamtora : Got it. Okay. And then just one last one for me. Devin, anything going on, in terms of log exports out of U.S. south at this point? Is anything happening on that front? Devin W. Stockfish: It is. Yes. As a matter of fact, we\u2019re excited about some of the opportunities. I mean, it\u2019s still, for context, relatively small compared to the overall harvest volumes. But the silver lining with what\u2019s happened with China, and obviously, we would like that China market to open up again at some point, But the silver lining with the challenges that we\u2019ve seen there is it\u2019s given us the time and latitude to really focus on some other market opportunities. And so we\u2019ve been growing our export business into India. I think there is a lot more demand for our logs in India than we\u2019re able to ship currently. And so we\u2019re looking at building out additional export facilities in the U.S. south to serve that market. We are growing our volumes into Vietnam. We\u2019ve come across some really interesting customers there that value the high quality logs that we can send out of the south, so we\u2019re looking at that as well. And I think there are a host of other opportunities in Turkey and Pakistan and some other markets as well. And so, that\u2019s a focus area for us. And certainly, at some point, we still believe that the China opportunity will come back. And so, we\u2019re focused on that. It\u2019s something I think with our supply chain expertise and our low cost business. It\u2019s a market that we can serve from our U.S. holdings in the south, and so we\u2019re pretty excited about how that\u2019s going to grow over time. Ketan Mamtora : That\u2019s very helpful. Thank you, Devin. I\u2019ll turn it over. Good luck. Devin W. Stockfish: Thank you. Operator : Our next question is from Michael Roxland with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, guys. This is [Nick Capucini] (ph) on for Mike. Thanks for taking my questions. Really just one follow-up to that EWP operating rate question. I thought I heard mid-60s. I guess just going forward in 4Q in light of seasonally lower demand and maybe matching your production to that demand, do you expect that to stay the same or seasonally maybe to go lower? And then before we enter the spring season next year, is that kind of the rate we\u2019re looking at? Could it maybe uptick in 1Q? Thanks. Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, I think as we think about Q4, it\u2019s going to be up slightly. But as we think about the posture as we roll into next year, I think that would be more typical of what you see for us in Q1 normally. So, and to some extent, you\u2019re going to see in normal years, you\u2019re going to see the Q4 volumes come down just a little bit given the dynamic at play and seasonality, but I would expect that to ramp back up in Q1 for our normal operating posture. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. I think and then just that normal operating in 1Q, like 70s? Or what are we thinking? Devin W. Stockfish: Yes. I mean, in EWP, I think ordinarily, you\u2019d see high 70s, low 80s would be a good way to think about that under normal conditions. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. I will turn it over. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin W. Stockfish: All right. Terrific. Well, thanks everyone for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a great day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",

After the speakers\u2019 remarks, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, this conference is being recorded It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Andy Taylor, Vice President of Investor Relations. Thank you, Mr. Taylor, you may begin. Andy Taylor : Thank you, Rob. Good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today to discuss Weyerhaeuser's fourth quarter 2024 earnings. This call is being webcast at www.weyerhaeuser.com. Our earnings release and presentation materials can also be found on our website. Please review the warning statements in our earnings release and on the presentation slides concerning the risks associated with forward-looking statements as forward-looking statements will be made during this conference call. We will discuss non-GAAP financial measures, and a reconciliation of GAAP can be found in the earnings materials on our website. On the call this morning are Devin Stockfish, Chief Executive Officer; and Dave Wold, Chief Financial Officer. I will now turn the call over to Devin Stockfish. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Andy. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. Yesterday, Weyerhaeuser reported full year GAAP earnings of $396 million or $0.54 per diluted share on net sales of $7.1 billion. Excluding special items, full year 2024 earnings totaled $384 million or $0.53 per diluted share. Adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.3 billion for the year. For the fourth quarter, we reported GAAP earnings of $81 million or $0.11 per diluted share on net sales of $1.7 billion. Adjusted EBITDA was $294 million, a 25% increase over the third quarter. I'll start this morning by expressing my sincere gratitude to our Weyerhaeuser employees for their solid execution and dedication in 2024 in what was a very challenging market backdrop. Through their collective efforts, we continue to serve our customers, delivered industry-leading operating performance and drove meaningful improvements across each of our value levers in the investment thesis. Notably, we grew our timberlands through acquisitions in Alabama, announced plans to expand our engineered wood products portfolio, advanced our Natural Climate Solutions business and captured additional operational excellence improvements. We also increased our base dividend by more than 5% and returned $735 million of cash to shareholders based on our 2024 results, including $153 million of share repurchase. I'm incredibly proud of these accomplishments, all of which support our growth strategy and drive long-term value for our shareholders. Before moving into the business segment results, I'd like to comment briefly on an exciting growth initiative within our EWP business, which is summarized on Page 24 of our earnings slides. As we announced in the fourth quarter, we plan to invest approximately $500 million to build a state-of-the-art TimberStrand facility in Arkansas. TimberStrand is a proprietary and versatile engineered wood product with applications in residential, industrial and mass timber end markets. The new facility will address an underserved and growing market for the product in the U.S. South and showcases Weyerhaeuser's innovation in Wood Products. Notably, we combined institutional expertise from our existing TimberStrand facility in Canada with extensive research and development to enable manufacturing of the product with southern yellow pine as the primary feedstock. Given its location in Arkansas, the new facility will deliver seamless integration with our existing timberlands and distribution network. In fact, approximately 80% of the raw material sourcing for the facility will come from Weyerhaeuser of the timberlands, resulting in an excellent new outlet for our southern fiber logs in the region. Construction of the facility will begin this year with startup expected in 2027. Once fully operational, the facility will add 10 million cubic feet of production, doubling Weyerhaeuser's TimberStrand offering and increasing total company EWP capacity by approximately 24%. In addition, the facility is expected to generate over $100 million of annual adjusted EBITDA, with additional upside from portfolio integration benefits. We're excited to bring this new facility online and look forward to expanding our footprint and workforce in Arkansas. With that, I'll now turn to our fourth quarter business results, starting with Timberlands on Pages 7 through 10. Timberlands contributed $62 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $126 million, a slight increase compared to the third quarter. In the West, adjusted EBITDA was comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the Western domestic market. Log demand improved in the fourth quarter as mills responded to strengthening lumber prices and a seasonal reduction in log supply across the system. As a result, pricing for grade logs increased as the quarter progressed and moved substantially higher in December. That said, our average domestic sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter due to mix. Our sales volumes to domestic customers increased moderately as we reduced shipments to our customers increase, moderately as we reduce shipments to customers in China. Per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter and forestry and road costs were seasonally lower. Our fee harvest volumes were slightly lower, largely due to fewer working days in the fourth quarter. Moving to our Western export business. In Japan, log markets remained soft in the fourth quarter due to ongoing consumption headwinds and elevated inventories of finished products for our customers. As a result, our sales volumes and average realizations for export logs to Japan were slightly lower compared to the third quarter. However, inventories and shipments of European lumber imports decreased as the quarter progressed, allowing our customers to pick up market share. As a result, we expect stronger demand for our Japanese export logs in the first quarter. In China, despite ongoing consumption headwinds, log markets remained relatively stable in the fourth quarter and demand from our strategic customers was steady. That said, our sales volumes into China were significantly lower as we intentionally flex logs to our domestic customers. Our average sales realizations were comparable to the third quarter. Turning to the South. Adjusted EBITDA for Southern Timberlands increased by $2 million compared to the third quarter. Southern sawlog markets remained muted in the fourth quarter as log supply was ample and mills continued to align capacity with lower takeaway of finished goods. This was partially driven by the seasonal reduction in lumber demand around the holidays. In contrast, Southern fiber markets were generally stable. On balance, takeaway for our logs remained steady given our delivered programs across the region, and our average sales realizations increased slightly compared to the third quarter, largely driven by a higher mix of grade logs. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs increased in the fourth quarter as operating activities in certain regions shifted from the prior quarter due to wet weather conditions. Per unit log and haul costs were comparable to the third quarter. In the North, adjusted EBITDA increased slightly compared to the third quarter, largely driven by higher fee harvest and sales volumes given favorable weather conditions. Turning now to real estate, energy and natural resources on Pages 11 and 12. In the fourth quarter, Real Estate and ENR contributed $46 million to earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $76 million, and largely in line with third quarter results. For the full year, the segment generated $349 million of adjusted EBITDA, slightly higher than our revised full year guidance and $29 million higher than our initial outlook. These results were largely driven by solid demand and pricing for HBU properties in our real estate business, resulting in high-value transactions with significant premiums to timber value. They also reflect a significant year-over-year increase in contributions from our Natural Climate Solutions business. As shown on Page 23, full year adjusted EBITDA for NCS was $84 million, a 79% increase compared to 2023, primarily driven by strong contributions from our conservation, mitigation banking and renewables business, where we continue to see solid demand. In Forest Carbon, we achieved notable milestones in 2024, including the approval and credit issuance from our second project located in the U.S. South and a new issuance of credits from our project in Maine. In the fourth quarter, we sold approximately 50,000 credits in the voluntary market. We continue to see strong demand and premium pricing for our credits given our commitment to developing projects that meet high standards for quality and integrity. Looking forward, our Forest Carbon pipeline is developing rapidly, and we currently have seven additional projects in progress. For 2025, we expect a significant increase in credit generation and sales relative to the last couple of years. In renewables, demand continues to increase for large-scale solar development and we're well positioned to capitalize on opportunities as markets continue to expand. We've signed approximately 70 agreements for potential solar projects across our portfolio and our first solar site commenced operations in the fourth quarter, and we have two additional sites currently under construction. With respect to wind, operations commenced on our seventh site in December and we expect an additional project to come online in the coming months. Turning briefly to our carbon capture and sequestration business. We continue to work closely with the developers on our three announced agreements and are in discussions with new counterparties for additional projects. While the time line for CCS and the permitting queue in particular has extended beyond our initial expectations, we remain confident that projects will ultimately be developed and continue to expect CCS to be a meaningful contributor to our NCS growth strategy over time. So, in summary, we continue to make excellent progress in our Natural Climate Solutions business, and we remain on track to reach $100 million of adjusted EBITDA by the end of this year. As we've said all along, early growth has largely been supported by our existing businesses. That said, we expect 2025 NCS results to include a meaningful increase in contributions from Forest Carbon credits. As we look beyond 2025, we see additional upside across the carbon and renewables businesses as those markets continue to develop. We built a world-class team with deep technical expertise and strong commercial focus, and we continue to believe there is no company in this space with the capabilities or asset base to deliver on this value creation opportunity at scale like Weyerhaeuser. Now moving to Wood Products on Pages 13 through 15. Wood Products contributed $106 million to fourth quarter earnings. Adjusted EBITDA was $161 million, a 77% increase compared to the third quarter, largely driven by an increase in lumber and OSB pricing. Starting with lumber. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $21 million, a $50 million improvement compared to the third quarter. Benchmark prices entered the fourth quarter on an upward trajectory, largely driven by supply constraints from recent curtailments and closures across the North American market, combined with a slight increase in demand as buyers replenish lean inventories. As the quarter progressed, demand signals moderated given typical seasonal slowdowns in building activity over the winter months. As a result, benchmark pricing declined slightly through year-end and has remained relatively stable in January. For our lumber business, production volumes were moderately higher in the fourth quarter as we returned to a more normal operating posture following market-related production adjustments in the prior quarter. Our sales volumes were comparable to the third quarter. Our average sales realizations increased by 9% in the quarter. Unit manufacturing costs were comparable and log costs were slightly lower. Turning to OSB. Fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA was $63 million, $24 million increase compared to the third quarter. Average benchmark pricing for OSB increased by 16% in the fourth quarter, primarily driven by resilient demand from single-family construction activity and limited open market supply. Our average sales realizations increased by 5% compared to the prior quarter, with the relative difference largely due to the length of our order files, which results in a lag effect for OSB realizations. Our sales volumes were moderately higher and unit manufacturing costs were moderately lower as production levels increased given less downtime for planned annual maintenance. Fiber costs were comparable to the prior quarter. Engineered Wood Products delivered $69 million of adjusted EBITDA, an increase of $8 million compared to the third quarter. Demand for EWP products was steady at the outset of the fourth quarter, given favorable weather conditions for homebuilding activity but softened seasonally as the quarter progressed. On balance, our sales volumes increased slightly compared to the third quarter, largely attributable to solid section products. Our average sales realizations decreased for most products as previously determined price adjustments took effect in certain markets. Our unit manufacturing costs improved compared to the third quarter and raw material costs were slightly lower for most products. In Distribution, adjusted EBITDA decreased by $4 million compared to the third quarter, largely due to seasonally lower sales volumes, primarily in December. With that, I'll turn the call over to Davie to discuss some financial items and our first quarter and full year 2025 outlook. Dave Wold : Thank you, Devin, and good morning, everyone. I'll begin with key financial items, which are summarized on Page 17. We generated $218 million of cash from operations in the fourth quarter, bringing our total for the year to $1 billion. We ended the year with just under $700 million of cash and gross debt of $5.1 billion. Adjusted funds available for distribution totaled $567 million in 2024. And as summarized on Page 19, we returned $735 million back to shareholders based on 2024 results and actions. This includes our quarterly base dividends, which we increased by 5.3% in 2024 and $153 million of share repurchase activity during the year. Fourth quarter share repurchase activity totaled $28 million, and we have now completed approximately $900 million under our $1 billion share repurchase authorization. Entering 2025, we will continue to leverage our flexible cash return framework and look to repurchase shares opportunistically when we believe it will create shareholder value. It's worth noting that although our cash generation in 2024 was lower than the last couple of years due to challenging market conditions, we continue to demonstrate the durability of our portfolio and the flexibility of our capital allocation framework across market cycles. In addition to returning a meaningful amount of cash back to shareholders in 2024, we continued investing in our businesses and deployed capital towards strategic growth opportunities. These are notable achievements given the headwinds our industry faced in 2024 and a direct result of the actions we've taken over the last several years to make Weyerhaeuser a stronger and more valuable company. Looking forward, our balance sheet, liquidity position and financial flexibility remains strong, and we are well positioned to drive further advancements across all of our capital allocation levers. Fourth quarter results for our unallocated items are summarized on Page 16. Adjusted EBITDA for this segment decreased by $15 million compared to the third quarter. This was primarily attributable to an increase in variable compensation expense and a charge in intersegment profit elimination and LIFO, partially offset by a slight benefit in liability classified share-based compensation. Key outlook items for the first quarter and full year 2025 are presented on Pages 25 and 26. In our Timberlands business, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be approximately $20 million higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2024, largely driven by higher sales volumes and realizations in the West. Turning to our Western Timberlands operations. As Devin mentioned, pricing for domestic grade logs increased substantially in December, and we've seen additional upward momentum in January. This is being driven by healthy demand for logs in the domestic markets as mills navigate seasonally lower log supply and the prospect of improving lumber takeaway ahead of the spring building season. Given this dynamic, we expect higher domestic sales volumes and realizations compared to the fourth quarter. Absent weather-related disruptions, we expect our fee harvest volumes to be slightly higher in the first quarter. Forestry and road costs are expected to be moderately lower due to the seasonal nature of these activities, and per unit log and haul costs are expected to be slightly higher. Moving to the export markets, starting with Japan. As Devin mentioned, inventories and shipments of imported European lumber have decreased, allowing our customers to take market share. We expect this dynamic to continue through the first quarter. As a result, demand for our logs is expected to improve, and we anticipate higher sales volumes and realizations compared to the fourth quarter. In China, log demand is expected to moderate in the first quarter in response to reduced consumption during the Lunar New Year holiday. Given this dynamic, coupled with improving Western domestic market conditions, we expect to significantly decrease our sales volumes into China during the quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Turning to the South. Despite ample log inventories, Southern sawlog demand is expected to improve slightly as mills navigate the risk of log availability challenges resulting from wet weather conditions that are typical in the first quarter. In contrast, we expect fiber markets to remain fairly stable. On balance, we expect our average sales realizations to be comparable to the fourth quarter. Our fee harvest volumes and forestry and road costs are also expected to be comparable, and we anticipate slightly higher per unit log and haul costs. In the north, our fee harvest volumes are expected to be slightly lower compared to the fourth quarter, and we anticipate moderately higher sales realizations. Turning to our full year harvest plan. For 2025, we expect total company fee harvest volumes of approximately 35.5 million tons, which is slightly higher than 2024. From a regional perspective, we anticipate the South and North will be slightly higher than last year, and the West will be comparable. Moving to our Real Estate, Energy and Natural Resources segment. We anticipate steady demand for our real estate properties in 2025 and continue to expect a consistent flow of transactions with significant premiums to timber value. In our Natural Climate Solutions business, we expect to reach $100 million of adjusted EBITDA by year-end. And as Devin mentioned, we anticipate a meaningful increase in contributions from forest carbon credit sales in 2025. For the segment, we expect full year 2025 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $350 million. Basis as a percentage of real estate sales is expected to be between 35% and 45% for the year. First quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA are expected to be comparable to the fourth quarter of 2024. Turning to our Wood Products segment. Excluding the effect of changes in average sales realizations for lumber and OSB, we expect first quarter earnings and adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter of 2024. It's worth noting that adverse weather conditions in January resulted in temporary downtime at several of our wood products facilities. We have since resumed normal operations and expect to capture affected volumes as the quarter progresses. As Devin mentioned, demand for wood products has softened into the winter months, which is typical for this time of year. That said, we expect market conditions and demand to improve from current levels as we head into the spring building season. Benchmark prices for lumber have been fairly stable since early December as supply and demand have approached a more balanced state. As for OSB, benchmark pricing entered the first quarter on a downward trajectory largely due to elevated channel inventories and seasonally softer demand. As shown on Page 27, our current and quarter-to-date average sales realizations for lumber are moderately higher than the fourth quarter average. For OSB, our current realizations are comparable to the fourth quarter average, while quarter-to-date realizations are moderately higher. For our lumber business, we expect higher production and sales volumes in the first quarter and lower unit manufacturing costs. Log costs are expected to be slightly higher, primarily for Western and Southern logs. For our Oriented Strand Board business, we anticipate moderately higher sales volumes compared to the fourth quarter. Fiber costs and unit manufacturing costs are expected to be slightly higher. Turning to our Engineered Wood Products business. we expect improving demand heading into the spring building season. As a result, we anticipate slightly higher sales volumes for most products in the first quarter. Our average sales realizations are expected to be comparable to the prior quarter and raw material costs are expected to be slightly higher, primarily for OSB web stock. For our distribution business, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be slightly higher compared to the fourth quarter as demand improves into the building season. I'll wrap up with some additional full year outlook items highlighted on Page 26. In 2025, we expect our interest expense to be approximately $270 million. For taxes, we expect our first quarter and full year effective tax rate to be between 16% and 19% before special items based on the forecasted mix of earnings between our REIT and taxable REIT subsidiary. Additionally, we anticipate moderately lower cash taxes relative to our overall tax expense. For pension and post-employment plans, our noncash, nonoperating pension and post-employment expense is expected to be approximately $75 million. We do not anticipate any required cash contributions to our U.S. qualified pension plan in 2025 but expect approximately $20 million of required cash payments for all other plans. As for capital expenditures, we expect our typical CapEx program to be approximately $440 million in 2025, which includes $120 million for timberlands, inclusive of reforestation costs, $310 million for Wood Products and $10 million for planned corporate IT system investments. This excludes the investment required in 2025 for the construction of our new EWP facility in Arkansas. The total investment for this facility is expected to be approximately $500 million and will be incurred between 2025 and 2027. As we've previously communicated, capital expenditures associated with this project will be excluded for purposes of calculating the Company's annual adjusted FAD as used in our flexible cash return framework. With that, I'll now turn the call back to Devin and look forward to your questions. Devin Stockfish : Thanks, Davie. I'll make a few comments on the housing and repair and remodel markets. Starting with housing. Despite elevated mortgage rates for most of the year, single-family construction activity remained resilient in 2024 with starts increasing by 7% over the prior year. This was supported by healthy, underlying demand for housing, a limited inventory of existing homes on the market and incentives used by the homebuilders to offset affordability challenges. In contrast, multifamily starts decreased by approximately 25% in 2024, largely driven by higher interest rates and the wave of new units that came to market over the last 18 months. As we enter 2025, mortgage rates remain elevated, we'll likely continue to see some volatility with rates as the markets weigh potential impacts from policy decisions from the new administration as well as future Fed decisions on rates. Notwithstanding the rate environment, we're expecting new home construction to improve somewhat compared to last year. For the single-family segment, there are a few underlying dynamics that support our view. First, from a buyer psychology perspective, mortgage rates in the 6% to 7% range are increasingly being viewed as the new normal, which is a different mindset from a few years ago. Single-family starts reached 1 million units in 2024, a respectable level given the rate environment. We expect this positive trend for single family to continue into 2025, given solid underlying demand for housing with upside potential, if mortgage rates move meaningfully lower. Second, while we do expect to see more sales activity in the existing home market, the lock-in effect will largely remain in place, which will continue to support steady demand for new home construction. And finally, we believe the larger, public builders will continue to navigate buyer affordability challenges and are well positioned to increase production to meet pent-up demand. With respect to multifamily construction, we expect headwinds to persist in the near term as the market digests the latest wave of supply. But we could see a modest increase in activity in the back half of the year, which would be a tailwind for total housing starts. So, in summary, we should see some improvement in the housing market for 2025, assuming the economy and consumer remain healthy. And our longer-term view on housing fundamentals continues to be very favorable, supported by strong demographic trends and a vastly underbuilt housing stock. Turning to repair and remodel, activity was softer in 2024 compared to the last couple of years. This was largely driven by a significant reduction in the buying and selling of existing homes, which is normally a catalyst for R&R activity. In addition, inflationary pressures and elevated interest rates weighed on the consumer sentiment, particularly for lower end do-it-yourself projects. As for 2025, we're expecting repair and remodel activity to improve slightly compared to last year. That's based on our view that we'll see an uptick in existing home sales, which should increase demand for repair and remodel projects over the course of 2025. In addition, I think we've now worked our way through the pull forward of projects that occurred during the pandemic so this should be less of a headwind for R&R going forward. Looking further out, many of the key drivers supporting healthy repair and remodel demand remain firmly intact, including an aging housing stock. And I'd also note, there is a fairly significant amount of home equity that can be tapped for repair and remodel projects. As rates come down, this could be a meaningful tailwind for the segment. Finally, I'll provide an update on the progress we've made against the multiyear targets we announced at our Investor Day in September of 2021. As highlighted on Slide 21, we've made meaningful advancements on all fronts. Starting with our portfolio. Following our recent acquisitions in Alabama, we're now more than 3/4 of the way through our $1 billion Timberlands growth target. We've grown our Natural Climate Solutions business to $84 million of adjusted EBITDA. In terms of our operating performance, we've captured $117 million of margin improvements over the last few years, a notable achievement given the inflationary and market-related headwinds we faced during this period. Additionally, through the third quarter of 2024, we delivered peer-leading EBITDA margins across all of our Wood Products manufacturing business, and maintain the number one position in EBITDA per acre in Western Timberlands. On the ESG front, we remain committed to net zero by 2040 and have showcased leadership in carbon integrity by publishing our carbon credit and greenhouse gas inventory principles. And finally, we continue to demonstrate our commitment to returning meaningful amounts of cash back to shareholders, by increasing our quarterly base dividend by more than 5% annually and returning more than $5.3 billion of cash back to shareholders from 2021 through 2024. I'm extremely proud of the progress we've made against our strategic targets. Looking forward, we're committed to further advancements across each of these areas and are well positioned to achieve our multiyear goals by year-end. So, in closing, while 2024 was an extremely challenging year in many of our key markets, particularly lumber, I'm pleased with how the organization navigated this environment and executed well across our businesses. I believe this is a testament to our people and our strategy. Entering 2025, our balance sheet is strong, and we are well positioned to capitalize as market conditions improve. We remain focused on serving our customers and driving long-term value for shareholders through our unmatched portfolio, industry-leading performance, strong ESG foundation and disciplined capital allocation. With that, I think we can open it up for questions. Operator : Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Susan Maklari with Goldman Sachs. Please proceed with your question. Susan Maklari : My first question is maybe digging in a bit to the commentary on demand around housing. I think Devin, it was good to hear that you see a path to some growth there for both new homes and R&R. I guess could you just give some more details on how you're thinking about inventories heading into the spring and the busy season there. And especially, any thoughts on retailers and how they're approaching this market given the potential for some inflation in commodity prices against a more uncertain macro backdrop? Devin Stockfish : Yes. Sue, are you talking about inventories at the product level or housing specific? Susan Maklari : Well, inventories at the product level, more than the housing side of things, yes. Devin Stockfish : Sure. Yes. So, it's differential by product. I'd say on the lumber side, generally, inventories in the channel are relatively lean. That's certainly true for southern yellow pine and doug fir, maybe a little less so with SPF. I think there's some angst about what's going to happen with tariffs there, and that may be impacting things. On the OSB side, inventories are a little heavy. I think you saw a little bit of a backup in the channel around the holidays and so dealers and the home improvement warehouse customers are working through a little of that. On EWP, pretty normal for this time of year. As we think about heading into the spring building season in general, I think there's just more optimism in general across the board that we're going to see some level of improvement. That's certainly what we're hearing from most of our big builder customers. On the retail side, again, I think for that part of our customer base, there is some optimism that you're going to see some improvement in R&R this year. Last year was a pretty tough year on that front, and I think we're seeing just a little bit more optimism for how that's going to play out this year. It's always hard to tell when you're in the January time frame. Particularly, we saw a lot of weather, cold weather across the U.S. South here recently. That's not atypical. You see a little bit of tick down in demand in the colder months. But ultimately, I think the general view is we're going to see a better year this year. Susan Maklari : Okay. That's helpful. And then following up, there's been obviously a lot of talk on tariffs or the potential for tariffs that could come through with the new administration. Can you talk about the implications across the various wood products and how that could potentially come in? And what it could mean for your margins and business? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, Sue, look, at a high level, I'll just note that it's still somewhat unclear if the tariffs are going to happen, when they're going to be put in place, how they're going to be affected. And so, there's still, I would say, a lot of unknown about how that's going to play out. But if you were to have a 25% blanket tariff on products coming in from Canada, there will be some puts and takes. Obviously, we do have operations in Canada, but the majority of our manufacturing is in the U.S. And so, on balance, I would expect you'd see prices go up somewhat, at least to the point where the Canadians and Canadian manufacturing send their product into the U.S. would be margin positive. Otherwise, you would expect capacity to come out of the system. So, I think it would have some upward pricing pressure. Obviously, lots of variables that go into that, including on the demand side. But directionally, I think you would see that go up. I would just note for us on the lumber side, about 80% of our lumber manufacturing is in the U.S. and our Canadian lumber relatively small percentage of that does go into the U.S., probably 20% to 30%. So not a terribly high percentage of our lumber production in Canada comes into the U.S. On the OSB and EWP side, the majority of the volume we produce in Canada does come in the U.S., so that would obviously be subject. But again, the vast majority of our production is in the U.S. Operator : Our next question is from Ketan Mamtora with BMO Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Ketan Mamtora : Devin, to start with, on the EWP side, can you talk a little bit about the progress you guys are making in recapturing share from open web floor trusses and this sort of dynamic this year when -- and it's been going on for a little while where sort of builders are providing more incentives to customers. So how is the competitive dynamics there on the pricing side? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, so as we've said previously, during the pandemic, when EWP supply was difficult for many of the builders out of necessity, there was some conversion to open web trusses. We've seen that a little bit slower to convert back to EWP, largely as a result just of the low lumber prices that we've seen here recently. So, from a pricing standpoint, that's been a little bit more challenging. Ultimately, we still expect the majority of that to come back to EWP over time, and that will certainly be supported as lumber prices get back to what we would consider a more normalized level. But ultimately, there are a lot of advantages in using in the home. And so, we would expect to recapture that market share over time. Ketan Mamtora : Understood. And then on the NCS side, Devin, you talked about a pretty nice uptick coming in 2025 in Forest Carbon. Can you give us some sense as to kind of -- how much did you -- credits did you sell in '24? And what do you expect in 2025 and roughly sort of the price expectation there? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So, in 2024, we sold right around 15,000 credits. Those were also at a premium price, slightly up from what we sold last year. When we think about 2025, the pipeline is filling up. So, as we mentioned, we have seven additional projects that are working their way through the process. The timing on some of those is always a little challenging to predict. We've got our ducks in a row, but you still have to go through third-party audits and there's a whole process that you have to go through. But I would expect a pretty material uptick something in the neighborhood of 5x to 10x year-over-year increase in our carbon sales for 2025. And obviously, we have more coming behind those seven that we're currently in development. So, we're just continuing to build out the pipeline and that will continue to grow over time, and we're just -- we're really pleased with the work our team is doing and I think we're starting to see that progress come to fruition. Ketan Mamtora : That is a big jump, Devin. Congrats on all the progress you've made there. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Operator : Thank you. Our next question is from George Staphos with Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Congrats on the progress during the year. I guess I want to come back to lumber. And Devin, you were saying that from your vantage point, inventories are relatively lean in the channel. We also read and hear that there's uncertainty about the tariffs. But as you were commenting a few minutes ago, certainly, the tariff does go in place is probably more inflationary than deflationary, right? And so, why are we not seeing in your view or what you're hearing from the field more uplift in lumber pricing right now? It seems like we have some supply constraints. We have inventories lean, we have the potential optionality, but that's probably more up and down in terms of the optionality from tariffs. Why aren't we seeing more of an uplift? Does it give us any worry, perhaps, about the overall demand outlook for this year? How would you have us think about that? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I think there are two things that I would highlight, George. First of all, is I do think the weather here recently, particularly the cold stretch across the U.S. South did impact demand to some degree. So that's a portion of it. But I think with respect to the tariffs, on balance, there has been skepticism in the market that the tariffs are, in fact, going to go into effect. And so, we haven't seen people that are putting a lot of pre-buy orders out to get ahead of the tariffs. And I just -- I think that there has been a disbelief that, that will actually happen or if it does come into effect, maybe there's some delay in the effective date, so people will still have time. I mean I think that's the answer. The latest that we've heard is we'll get a little bit more clarity on that tomorrow. And so perhaps that will provide a little bit more insight into how this is going to come in effect in the time line how quickly it will come into effect. George Staphos : Okay. Next question is really around capital allocation. Certainly, the Company going back to its goals that have set out back in 2020 has been hitting or exceeding its capital return goals and the value return. The last year the value return to shareholders has been in excess of FAD. How should we think about your priorities in the next couple of years in terms of the dividend, should we continue to expect it grows at 5% or better? You certainly have the maturities coming up in 2026. Not that Weyerhaeuser can't handle that given its asset based. But nonetheless, should we expect a little bit more focus on deleveraging relative to dividend relative to value return to shareholders, given that construct? Dave Wold : Yes. Well, George, there's a lot in there, so I'll try to take them component by component. I think on the base dividend, obviously, that's a Board decision, but the ability to increase that base dividend is supported by all the work we've been doing over the last few years to increase sustainable cash flow generation. So, all the work we've been doing on Timberlands acquisitions, the growth in the Natural Climate Solutions space, improvements in OpEx, all of those things that give us confidence that no matter the scenario, we feel confident in our ability to increase the base dividend amidst challenging market conditions. So as we think about the debt maturities, yes, we do have $1 billion of maturities coming due in 2026. We feel really good about our ability to refinance those. I don't think anything changes from our overall capital allocation approach as we look at that. The biggest component of that is a three-year maturity that we refinanced back in 2023. There's also some smaller maturities that are a lot older that have a much higher rate. So, all in, we're looking at a rate average in the mid-5s on all the debt coming due next year. So, we should be able to refinance those at comparable rates. But I think just reflecting on what we've accomplished over the course of 2024. This is exactly what the cash return framework was designed to accomplish. We essentially covered our base dividend through adjusted FAD, even in what was probably the most challenging lumber market in about 15 years or so. So, we're quite pleased about how this played out over the course of the year, being able to continue to have that exceptionally strong balance sheet, making progress towards our strategic growth initiatives such as the Alabama acquisitions, the announcement on the new TimberStrand facility while also being able to maintain our programmatic CapEx at meaningful levels and being active in share repurchase. So again, looking at all of those things, I think it demonstrates the power of our cash return framework, why it works so well for us, and it's going to allow us to create that value through the cycle for our shareholders. Operator : Our next question comes from Hamir Patel with CIBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Hamir Patel : Devin, can you speak to your operating rates in lumber and OSB in the quarter? And how would that compare between the U.S. and Canadian operations? Devin Stockfish : Yes. So operating rates in Q4, kind of in the low 80% range for lumber, high 90s in OSB and somewhere in the low to mid-70s for EWP. In terms of the breakout between the U.S. and Canada, really no material difference. We didn't have a different operating posture north or south of the border? Hamir Patel : Okay. Great. And just the last question I had. If we do end up seeing tariffs driving maybe a larger uplift in U.S. industry production, how much flexibility do you have to increase your harvest levels in the South and West to meet perhaps a window of higher U.S. output? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean we do have some flexibility in harvest levels. I'll just give you the context that we, as a general matter, don't flex that significantly just because we're always trying to manage within a sustainable harvest range. And so, you're not going to see dramatic changes. That being said, we do have a little bit of flexibility. And certainly, I think in the South, there is adequate fiber availability to support increased manufacturing across the U.S. South at present. So, I don't think that is going to be the bottleneck for ramping up production in the south, if that needs to happen. Operator : Our next question is from Mark Weintraub with Seaport Research Partners. Please proceed with your question. Mark Weintraub : Devin, thanks for the color on both potential impact from tariffs. And then also, when you're talking about the operating rates in the different businesses. So, I sort of want to put those two things together. I mean, it sounds like in lumber, you actually have a fair bit of flexibility maybe you could make a little more wood in the U.S. if need be? And as you noted, you're actually not making that much in Canada that you're shipping to the U.S. to begin with. And it sounds like OSB, though, you wouldn't necessarily have that type of flexibility. And then I guess in EWP, it might be more complicated. You've got the -- if you look at operating rates, it sounds like you have flexibility, but they're different products, and they're made in different places. So, to the extent that you could provide us a little bit more thinking on how it might within the business that -- where you'd have flexibility to adjust versus not so much? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean I would just point out on OSB, so we'll talk about EWP as well. On OSB, I mean, certainly, we don't have a whole lot of upside potential because you typically are running full out in the OSB operating posture. And so, it's not as though you can really flex up meaningfully with your U.S. OSB production. But I would also keep in mind, however, ultimately, OSB is going to come in from Canada. The industry needs it. And so, there's going to be OSB coming into the U.S. And that's where our focus on having low-cost manufacturing comes into play. In almost any environment, low-cost wins, and we've been focused on that for a very long time. So regardless of what happens with tariffs, we're still going to be, I think, well positioned relative to most of the industry with low-cost production. On EWP, you're right. We have some different products. So TimberStrand and Parallam are up in Canada. And so, to the extent that there are tariffs that are applied to those products, we'll have to manage that. But the good news is both of those products are products that are very well received in the market. Our customers like those products and need them, and so we'll just have to work with our customers to navigate it. But ultimately, I don't see the demand for either of those products being meaningfully impacted. It will likely have some impact on price over time. Mark Weintraub : Got you. And then maybe just a quick follow-up on harvest. I mean it looks like you're probably up 3% to 4% in the U.S. South in 2025 versus 2024? Maybe tell me that's about right? Devin Stockfish : Yes, that's about right? Mark Weintraub : Yes. And then is that just a function of the acquisitions that you've made? And is this fairly reflective of what we should think about as the sustainable harvest level? Devin Stockfish : Yes. We're within the range of sustainable harvest. Part of it is acquisitions that we've made. Part of it is we were down a little bit in '24 versus our original plan, largely just due to some weather events in Q3, which we would normally be able to make up in Q4. But just given the dynamic with lumber last year, that was a little bit more challenging. So, some of that volume will roll into '25. But that's, generally speaking, within the range of what we consider our sustainable harvest levels with the caveat that we're obviously continuing to grow the business. And so, as we continue to buy more timber, that will move the harvest levels up over time. Operator : Our next question comes from Matthew McKellar with RBC Capital Markets. Please proceed with your question. Matthew McKellar : Looking at OSB, you're expecting moderately higher sales volume in Q1 but also slightly higher unit manufacturing costs. So, I was wondering if you could just please expand on what's driving your expectations on cost there? Dave Wold : Sure, Matt. Yes, we had a really nice quarter in the fourth quarter from a cost perspective and the OSB business ran really well, increase that production volume. As we look out in the first quarter, we think we'll have another good quarter from a production perspective, but we are seeing a little bit of an uptick in some of the other costs, things like energy and resins that are going to go into that. So, on the whole, that's going to be up slightly, but we continue to be very pleased with the overall operating performance in that business and the continued focus on maintaining the right cost structure. Matthew McKellar : Okay. Mostly [indiscernible] then. Okay. And then just on the LSL facility, you talked about $100 million in EBITDA there before portfolio integration benefits. How do you think about those portfolio integration benefits look like? Is that mostly, I mean, tightening that pulpwood market in the area, which benefits Timberland's business, being able to serve that demand in a more freight logical way? Or are there other potential considerations as well? And is it possible to quantify all this. I mean, if we're thinking about the economics more holistically, is this more like a 4x build multiples and a 5x multiple? Devin Stockfish : Yes. I mean, so without giving you a specific number, you got the main ones right. So, when you're talking about a market that could use a little bit more fiber demand to tension up that market. That's exactly right. That is a component. And as we said, 80% of the feedstock is going to be from our timberland. So that will be a nice uplift just in demand for pulpwood in that region. Also, you're exactly right, the logistics savings on having that right in the middle of a significant fee timberland ownership provides benefits as well. So, it really just gives us the opportunity within that particular wood basket to optimize the log flow, which comes with OpEx savings and synergies between those two businesses. So exactly what we're trying to do with the business everywhere we have manufacturing in Timberlands. Operator : Our next question is from Mike Roxland with Truist Securities. Please proceed with your question. Mike Roxland : Congrats on all the progress. First question I had, just Devin, I'd love to get your thoughts on what the new administration and what they're doing in terms of suspending the Inflation Reduction Act funding, suspending funding for the infrastructure and investment in Jobs Act. So long story short, the new administration is cutting funding for, let's say, offshore wind power, trying to minimize wind, there probably are negative read-throughs for CCS, if they continue along this track. So, would love to get your thoughts about what the -- anything you're hearing from your contacts, from your involvement in the industry in terms of risks to Natural Climate Solutions, particularly given the new administration? Devin Stockfish : Sure. Well, I'll answer this by first saying a lot of this is still very much in flux as they think about how they're going to put some of these policies into effect, how this is going to run through the budget, the reconciliation bill. I think there's still a lot of unknowns. But I'll tell you, from our perspective, how we think about it. We're obviously not in offshore wind. Certainly, that does seem to be an area where there is some risk. For us, as we've said, we've got a number of operating wind sites. We've got another one that's pretty close to being done. I don't think any of this impacts the existing or soon to be existing wind sites. On solar, the economics for solar feel pretty good. I don't know that you necessarily need significant government expenditures to make that economically competitive. There are obviously tax incentives that are built into the code. And I think you'd have to, by and large, see the IRA fully amended to adjust those tax incentives, which I am skeptical that you're going to see the IRA repeal or meaningfully amended. And that's really based on a couple of things. First of all, a lot of the money from that program and from the IRA in general, is flowing into Southern red states. And so certainly, I think as the administration and Congress try to dial in how this is going to play out that will be a factor. And so, we'll see how this all progresses. But look, in any event, these things, ultimately, we believe, are all going to happen. The trajectory points towards the need for all of these things over time. Maybe we'll see less outward vocal support for some of these things here in the near term. But our view is that the ultimate trajectory and the momentum behind these things is going to carry these projects and these businesses forward, and we still believe there's plenty of growth left across these sub-businesses. Mike Roxland : Got it. I appreciate the color. And then just for my second question, in terms of the new EWP capacity in Arkansas, obviously, you currently produce TimberStrand in Canada using hardwood, you're going to be using southern yellow pine in the South. Can you just comment about how the testing has gone, using that furnish? How has it performed? Do you anticipate any issues as you roll it out on a larger scale because assuming that the testing was done on a smaller scale? And then lastly, just your expectations for EWP operating rate in 1Q. Devin Stockfish : Yes, sure. Well, we've been working on this for a couple of years. We have some of the best wood scientists in all of North America in-house. And so, they've been doing a lot of testing. We are fortunate because we do have an existing mill that we can use to help facilitate some of the testing to get everything dialed in. But we obviously have a lot of confidence that this is going to work well and provide a product that the market wants. So, we feel very good about it. And as we've done a lot of testing, as you would expect, before we roll out an investment of this side. So, feel very good, should be well received in the market. And again, I think that's just a testament to some of the resources that we have internally. That's not as easy as one might think, turning this product to go off of a softwood furnish. So, feel very good about that. In terms of operating rates for EWP in Q1, we're expecting those to be up relative to Q4. And again, Q4, we were kind of in that low 70s rates. So, you'll see that move up in Q1. Operator : Our last question will come from George Staphos at Bank of America. Please proceed with your question. George Staphos : Just a quick follow-on on the TimberStrand project. And piggybacking on what Mike was talking about. Recognizing that you've produced these products in the past, EWP TimberStrand is different perhaps than panels different than dimensional lumber. How do you feel about your ability to ultimately hire to run the facility, how do you feel about your ability to staff on R&D and the like related to what you're going to need to build the facility? And then separately, perhaps you've mentioned this before, if you have apologies, do you have a figure that we should pencil in for the CapEx related to that project in 2025, what the cadence might look like, recognizing it's $500 million? And then maybe philosophically, just why not include that CapEx in your FAD. And good luck in the quarter and the year. Devin Stockfish : Yes. Maybe I'll take the first part and then Davie can cover off on the CapEx component. Obviously, as you would expect, we looked at a lot of different sites as we were thinking about where to put this facility and workforce availability was a key component of that. We are fortunate that the mill manager from our Kenora facility is going to move down to Arkansas and manage the startup. So, we have good resources in place. We're going to be putting some of our top people on getting this mill built and started up. We have a really strong internal R&D resources already. So, there's nothing we need to do incremental to where we are on that front. So, look, I'm not underestimating, you still have to go out and hire quite a few people, and so that's a process. But I feel very good about our plan and how we've got this lined out to make that happen. So, we'll be on track, and I'm sure we'll have this started up and it will go well like our other recent big capital projects. Dave Wold : Yes. George, from a CapEx perspective on TimberStrand, we've said it's going to be $500 million over the course of the construction period through 2027. It's a little bit fluid on the timing of all of that. I think how I would think about it is this year, we're going to start to ramp up, go through the permitting, initial construction phases as we get towards the end of this year and into 2026, we'll start to receive more substantial pieces of equipment and get deeper into the construction process. So, we'd expect spending to ramp up in 2026 compared to 2025 and then taper off as we get to completion in 2027. And so, as we think about that spend as it relates to our cash return framework and adjusted FAD, our intention, again, is to exclude that CapEx from the programmatic CapEx. The reason being we're going to treat this like we would our other strategic investments like investments in timberlands and other things of that nature. If we included it alongside our programmatic CapEx, we'd otherwise be reducing the amount of cash we're going to return to shareholders. And so that's not our intention. So, as you'd expect, over the course of this year, we'll report out on the CapEx that we're expanding for this project separately, and you'll be able to see that track along the way as well. Operator : There are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the floor back over to Devin Stockfish for closing comments. Devin Stockfish : All right. Well, thanks, everyone, for joining us this morning, and thank you for your continued interest in Weyerhaeuser. Have a wonderful day. Operator : This concludes today's conference. You may disconnect your lines at this time, and we thank you for your participation.",
