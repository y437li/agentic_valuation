Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the First Quarter 2014 ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' first quarter 2014 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements, and are covered by the Safe Harbor Provisions of the Security Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from the project -- from -- for those projected in these forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Starting our earnings conference call is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry K. Spencer: Thanks, T.D. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Joining me on the conference call today is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results. Also with me and available to answer your questions are : Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Wes Christiansen, our Senior Vice President of Operations. On this morning's call, we will review our first quarter 2014 financial and operating results, we'll discuss the repositioning of ONEOK as a pure-play general partner, we'll discuss our increased project backlog and bring you up-to-date on our completed capital-growth projects, and then we'll review the NGL markets. Let's start with our first quarter performance. ONEOK's income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK was up more than 60%, and reflects higher operating results at ONEOK Partners from higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, wider natural gas liquids location and product price differentials, primarily related to increased seasonal demand for NGLs, and higher natural gas transportation and storage revenues due to increased park-and-loan services due to strong seasonal demand for natural gas in the Midwest. Today, we are reaffirming our 2014 financial guidance, both at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but as is our practice, we will continue to review our expected performance as the year progresses and make any adjustments as appropriate. We also expect our natural gas liquids volumes to continue to increase during the year. I'll provide more color on that in a few minutes. This is our first quarter during which ONEOK operated as a pure-play general partner. Our primary purpose now is to provide the management and resources to ONEOK Partners to execute on its growth strategies, so that the Partnership can increase its distributions to unitholders, including ONEOK, enabling ONEOK to maximize its dividend payout to shareholders. In April, the Board approved a 40% increase, clearly demonstrating our commitment to pay out the majority of our cash in the form of dividends. We plan additional dividend increases in 2014, and expect an average dividend increase of 20% to 25% between 2013 and 2016. Derek now will review ONEOK Partners' and -- ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' financial highlights, including the one-time expenses and charges that we mentioned in our news release. And then I'll review our operating performance. Derek? Derek S. Reiners: Thanks, Terry, and good morning. First quarter of 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $94 million, or $0.45 per diluted share. Both the former natural gas distribution and energy services segments have been reclassified as discontinued operations for all periods presented. Income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK was approximately $92 million, or $0.44 per diluted share, compared with first quarter of 2013 income from continuing operations of approximately $57 million, or $0.27 per diluted share. First quarter 2014 net income was affected by onetime items reflected in continuing operations and discontinued operations, related to the separation of ONE Gas and the wind-down of the energy services segments as follows : Income from continuing operations includes net onetime benefits of $4 million, or $0.02 per diluted share, which includes a net increase in deferred income tax expense of $26 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, associated primarily with a reduction in ONEOK's estimated effective state income tax rate; and an after-tax expense of $22 million, or $0.11 per diluted share, as a result of the early retirement of debt. Income from discontinued operations includes net onetime benefits of $2 million, or $0.01 per diluted share, which includes $48 million of operating income from the former natural gas distribution segment in January; $15 million operating loss from energy services segment; $22 million in costs associated with the ONE Gas separation; and $9 million in other expenses, primarily interest and income taxes. As a reminder, our 2014 guidance assumed a January 1, 2014 effective date for the separation of the natural gas distribution segment into ONE Gas versus the actual January 31 date. We received approximately $61 million of cash flow from that segment in January and funded ONE Gas with $60 million on January 31. So the impact of the later separation date on our guidance for cash flow available for dividends was insignificant. In the first quarter of 2014, ONEOK received $141 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners, an 8% increase over the first quarter of 2013. First quarter 2014 cash flow available for dividends was $211 million, providing 1.82x coverage. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend, $0.16 per share to $0.56 per share, effective for the first quarter 2014, resulting in an annual -- an annualized cash dividend of $2.24 per share. During the first quarter, we deleveraged our balance sheet and reduced our credit facility to $300 million, supporting our pure-play general partner strategy. We used a one-time cash payment of approximately $1.13 billion received from ONE Gas in January to repay $600 million of commercial paper borrowings and repay early $552 million of senior notes. We do not anticipate any short-term borrowings going forward, and now have $1.1 billion of long-term debt, with the next scheduled maturity in 2022. And a clarification in our news release. A word was inadvertently dropped from the initial release in one paragraph regarding our 2014 dividend guidance. Our dividend declared in April of $0.56 per share represented a 40% increase, rather than a $0.40 increase. Now let's move on to ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners' first quarter net income was approximately $265 million, or $0.81 per unit, compared with $157 million, or $0.42 per unit in the first quarter of 2013. In the first quarter, distributable cash flow was $298 million, a 54% increase compared with the previous period, resulting in a coverage ratio of 1.28x for the quarter. We increased our first quarter 2014 distribution to $0.745 per unit, an increase of 4% from our first quarter 2013 distribution of $0.715 per unit. In the news release, we provided some updates on our hedges, as we continue to hedge commodity risk when appropriate. At the end of the first quarter, the Partnership had $115 million in cash and cash equivalents; $125 million of commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility; a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 55%; and a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7x. During the quarter, we issued $57 million, or 1.1 million common units, through our at-the-market equity program, compared with 680,000 common units issued all of last year. We expect to continue to utilize this program to manage our equity issuances over time. We have ample liquidity to support the Partnership's ongoing capital growth program, including access to nearly $1.6 billion under our credit facility as of March 31. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, Derek. At ONEOK Partners, the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment's first quarter operating income was up 78% due to higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, and higher natural gas liquids volumes sold as a result of recently completed capital-growth projects and higher realized natural gas liquids prices. The segment continues to grow natural gas volumes in the Williston and add well connections. Growth volume in the first quarter 2014 compared with the fourth quarter 2013 did increase slightly. However, natural gas volumes were affected by well freeze offs across our system due to severe cold weather. We have already seen a significant ramp-up in natural gas volumes across our system as the weather has improved since February. Our 2014 natural gas gathered and processed volume growth is heavily weighted towards the second half of 2014. As you know, we proactively hedge to mitigate our commodity exposure, created by our percent-of-proceeds contracts. Since we were approximately 70% hedged in the first quarter 2014, prices were less of a factor. The Natural Gas Liquid segment's first quarter results were 65% higher, due to significantly wider natural gas liquids location price differentials, related primarily to weather-related increased seasonal demand for propane. Midwest propane demand increased in the first quarter 2014 due to much colder-than-normal temperatures. And propane demand and prices were higher at the Mid-Continent market center in Conway, Kansas than they were in the Gulf Coast market center in Mont Belvieu, Texas. We were able to benefit from these market conditions because of the operational flexibility of our integrated assets, which enabled us to quickly respond to the needs of our customers. The severe cold weather temporarily affected our natural gas liquids supply deliveries into our systems. Natural gas liquids volumes gathered and fractionated were sequentially down for a second consecutive quarter, as a result of severely cold weather and the termination of a contract. While our natural gas liquids volumes were down sequentially, our fee-based exchange services revenue has increased each year, as our customers secure more capacity under long-term firm contracts. As I mentioned earlier, our natural gas liquids volume guidance is weighted more toward the second half of the year. We expect natural gas liquids volumes to increase during the remainder of the year, as weather-related conditions continue to improve, along with the continued ramp-up of previously connected natural gas processing plants. Also, 5 of the 10 connections to new processing plants we plan for 2014 have been completed through April, with the balance occurring between now and the end of the year. The Natural Gas Pipeline segment's first quarter 2014 results were significantly higher, up 53% due to increased rates and park-and-loan services as a result of strong weather-related seasonal demand. This level of park-and-loan activity was driven by strong Midwest weather-related demand, and clearly demonstrates the value of our market-connected natural gas pipeline assets, particularly during periods of peak demand. These assets primarily serve on-system customers, such as local natural gas distribution companies, electric generation facilities and large industrial customers -- or consumers, that is, that require natural gas to operate their business. In general, ONEOK Partners' natural gas pipeline customers need natural gas supply to run their businesses, regardless of location price differentials. As oil and liquids-rich natural gas development continues within our core areas, the need for midstream infrastructure grows. We are increasing our unannounced capital project backlog estimate to a range of $3 billion to $4 billion, from the previous range of $2 billion to $3 billion. This updated backlog does not include any potential acquisitions or the multibillion dollar crude oil pipeline project that we continue to discuss with producers in the Williston Basin. The backlog represents more of the same type of midstream projects that we continue to successfully develop and execute. This capital backlog reflects our continued commitment to serve our customers' needs in the Mid-Continent, Midwest and Gulf Coast regions and in particular, the Williston and Powder River Basins, where the majority of this incremental capital increase is targeted, and where producers continue to successfully develop acreage positions within our asset footprint. As we said previously, once we receive sufficient contractual commitments, we will announce these projects. Now an update on our announced capital growth program. In March, we completed approximately $1 billion of capital-growth projects on top of the almost $4 billion in previously completed projects and acquisitions since 2010. The recently completed projects include : The 550-mile Sterling III NGL pipeline that has the ability to transport up to 193,000 barrels per day of either unfractionated NGLs or NGL purity products from the Mid-Continent to the Texas Gulf Coast; the Canadian Valley plant, a 200 million cubic feet per day natural gas processing facility in the Cana-Woodford Shale of Oklahoma; and the Mont Belvieu ethane/propane spitter, a 40,000-barrel per day deethanizer. All of these completed projects will contribute to earnings during the remainder of 2014. Now a brief review of our outlook on the NGL markets. We still believe that ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our natural gas liquids system will continue through at least 2016, after which new worldscale ethylene production capacity is expected to begin coming online. We believe the propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu will continue to widen, as Midwest inventories have been increasing more rapidly than Gulf Coast inventories. Current Midwest inventories are down 9% compared with last year, and 11% lower than the 5-year average, while current Gulf Coast inventories are down 36% compared with last year, and 14% below the 5-year average. The industry has experienced deep ethane rejection since late 2012, and has experienced some market disruption due to the extreme weather conditions. Our integrated assets have performed well in these extreme conditions, further demonstrating their value. In closing, I'd like to thank the employees of the new ONEOK, whose skills, experience, commitment and dedication allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day, and create exceptional value for our investors and customers. Our management team and Board appreciate their hard work and commitment to make our company successful. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Ethan Bellamy with Baird. Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Do you guys want to be in the ethane export business? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Ethan, we do. And for us, it's still a bit early. We obviously have been listening to the enterprise's project updates, with respect to ethane exports. We've always been supportive of it. We've always believed that ethane exports in this industry will happen. The right time for us will be a function of our relationships with customers, developing international markets. But it's still a bit early for us. Certainly, it's something that we're -- that we consider, along with other export opportunities, particularly as it relates to propane and LPGs. But I guess, the short answer is yes. Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. With respect -- something a little bit more granular. With respect to potential incremental restrictions on gas flaring in the Bakken, Williston, is that a risk or an opportunity for you guys? And is it changing your strategy at all there? Or are you just pedal to the metal in terms of construction activity? Terry K. Spencer: Well, the flaring certainly creates a very high sense of urgency from our producers. And that in and of itself creates the opportunity. We are absolutely committed to reducing the flaring, building the infrastructure necessary to allow these producers to not only reduce their impact to the environment, but also enhance their sales revenues. So certainly, as the flaring continues in the Bakken, it is clearly creating opportunity for us. Ethan, let me just make one comment, going back to the ethane question, which, I think was a great question. With respect to ethane exports, our role does not necessarily have to be operating or managing export docks, okay? Our role could be on the upstream side, and most likely will be on the upstream side, providing that infrastructure -- transportation infrastructure, storage and fractionation infrastructure necessary to get that ethane to those facilities. So I just wanted to add that comment. Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Okay. From a perspective of OKE tax rate, can you give us any guidance over long-term, what we should expect there, current thinking? Derek S. Reiners: Sure, Ethan. That -- I think what we have guided there is a 15% to 25% cash tax rate. As we look at 2014, we haven't -- a net operating loss it would be working off. But we expect to pay cash taxes beginning in 2015. Of course, that's all subject to any legislation that may come down, particularly as it relates to bonus depreciation. Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Could you elaborate a little bit on that? I just want to make sure I understand that. Derek S. Reiners: Sure. If bonus depreciation were enacted for 2014, say, then that would generate additional deductions for the unitholders. ONEOK, of course, being a large unit holder. And so that would provide those additional deductions, would push out further the cash taxes that we'd have to pay. Ethan H. Bellamy - Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Research Division : Can you quantify that? Is that low end of that range or... Derek S. Reiners: No, I really can't. We've provided that 15% to 25%. It's a fairly difficult number to get to, as you think about the timing of projects coming on and capital spend and that sort of thing. That -- all those things influence the depreciation deduction at the unitholders. So I think we'll stick with that 15% to 25%. Operator : Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Terry, can we get a little more color, if possible, on the sequential drop in the NGL volumes? And I guess, what I'm trying to get at is, is how much of the impact came from the contract termination versus, perhaps, the well freeze-offs? Was that contract termination something that you had envisioned in the 2014 guidance? And I guess, do you still think the numbers that, perhaps, we discussed in December are still feasible to get to for the year? Terry K. Spencer: Well, first of all, the impact from weather, as it relates to the Natural Gas, Liquids business, is about 5% to 10%, roughly. The contract that we've referenced, the termination of the contract, we're not going to talk and provide any details. We typically don't, as it relates to our relationships with our -- contractual relationships with the customers. So I can't comment on that. But what I can tell you about that contract is that it was a sizable contract, and that it was one of our very thin margin arrangements. So it was, I would say, out of the market. So that was the reason why that contract was terminated. As far as the last, I think... Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada : It's just as far as being able to still make the guidance as far as the NGLs fractionated, gathered, et cetera for the year? Terry K. Spencer: Absolutely. We have a number of things going on in that segment, supplies from new process and plant connections. We've got the Sterling III Pipeline, and that we're going to have 9 months of that. We got the impact from NGL supplies coming from our own affiliated processing plants. So we got a lot of things -- a lot of things happening, ramping up, back-end loading that financial performance. So that's kind of how we fill that gap. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Understood. And maybe then last question, if I could. Just shifting gears. Certainly, nice to see the growth in the unannounced backlog. I didn't know really, 2 things off of that. One, as you see more products going into the development evaluation, perhaps, even competitive bid phase, do you see any changes in the returns, perhaps, as more competition has come into the Williston Basin, for instance? So that's one question. And the second is, is there any sense of -- notwithstanding whatever shippers will find, but any sense of timing, if we're looking at things that are possible over the next 12, 18 months, or if these are much more back-end, 2-, 3-year type of baking horizons? Terry K. Spencer: Well, first of all, from an economic performance perspective, these projects, we're still seeing these things come in, and at 5x to 7x. So we really don't -- because of the strength of our footprint, and in particular, in the Bakken, we haven't seen much pressure on the economics. From a timing standpoint, it runs the whole gambit [sic] [gamut]. I mean, we -- certainly, the projects that are more infrastructure-related, it is projects that are gathering upstream of our processing facilities in the Bakken. Those projects are going to happen faster. That is well-connect type projects. But the ones that will be longer lead time will be processing plants, large trunk lines, compression facilities. That type of thing will take more time. Infrastructure projects, like fractionators, will take longer time. Those will -- certainly, the construction period for fractionator's a couple of years. But -- so I hope that maybe that gives you a sense. We've not been real specific on the timing of our growth -- capital growth backlog, but hopefully, that gives you a sense. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Question on the nat gas pipelines. Given the strength that you guys saw in the segment, and given the low levels of supply out there in storage, did you guys have an opportunity to lengthen out average contract duration on the pipes or on the storage? Did that -- did market conditions tightening up and helping you on that front? Robert F. Martinovich: Jeremy, hi. This is Rob. With regards to the -- our contract term, it's about -- it's pretty similar to what we talked about the last quarter, in that approximately 7- to 7.5-year timeframe. So, I mean, as renewals -- obviously, as renewals come up, they -- coming up all throughout the year, and so, well you certainly had some come up at, in the first quarter, but I -- it wasn't markedly different because at end of the day, as we stated in the release, and as Terry did, we don't see this as sustainable. And people recognize that. Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Got you. Okay. And then, just going back to the unannounced project backlog. I was wondering if you might be able to provide a little bit of color as far as which segments might seeing more of this backlog increase? And also, could this potentially include LPG exports or just any updated thoughts on that? Robert F. Martinovich: Sure. I guess, Jeremy, with regards to the kind of the incremental, where Terry kind of focused in on was specifically in the Williston Basin and the Powder River Basin. So that would be the gathering, processing plant's infrastructure, and then appropriate connects from a standpoint -- of a liquids standpoint. But certainly, as you broaden out that, and look at the overall, kind of the $3 billion to $4 billion, excluding that incremental increase over the 2 to 3, those are exactly the type of things that we're talking about, that from G&P, but also get into the NGL functions, with regards to fracs, pipelines. And certainly, we're still evaluating export opportunities, both from a supply, as well as facilities themselves. Operator : Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I just want to dig in a little bit more on this $73 million pick up in the optimization revenues here. And it looks like -- can you guys talk a bit more about the -- I think it was propane location differentials versus ethane, and then maybe come back to some of your comments around the differences and where the -- we're seeing in storage for Gulf Coast versus Mid-Con, and how that impacts how you're thinking about the optimization opportunity going forward? Terry K. Spencer: Sheridan? Sheridan C. Swords: On the -- as we said, the $71 million as it relates a lot to propane, just by using our infrastructure, everything we're have, we were able to capture a portion of that Conway to Belvieu spread on some volume that helped us going forward. On the propane spreads between Conway and Belvieu going forward, we do believe that as export demand continues to be strong, and as we get -- as we're in the fill season in Conway that, that spread will widen out from where it is today. And on the ethane side, it's more crackers, more demand comes on this summer with Geismar and La Porte coming on that, that will also increase the demand in Belvieu for ethane, which will allow ethane spreads to widen as well. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : I see. So you're thinking that spread -- because we obviously, had it reversed in the first quarter on propane, where Conway was higher. You're just thinking the Gulf Coast is going be higher-priced for both products? And just sure -- making sure I understand? John K. Tysseland - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Yes. From here forth, not from an average for the year, but from here forth, that, that will be there and it will widen a little bit from where it is today. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Fair enough. And then, I was going to ask just about the -- any shifts that you're seeing and coming back to sort of the question on flaring on the contracts that you're going to sign in the Williston here for potential new processing plants, moving beyond maybe just acreage dedication, given that some minimum volumes, do you want to stick with sort of that POP contracts, would you rather do some more fee-based, given that you're probably going to see high demand, I would imagine, from your producer customers? Sheridan C. Swords: Ted, we're going to stick with the current structure. I mean, what's that the market -- that's what the market wants. Those POP structures, with the fee-based flavor to them are what's working for us, what has worked for us. And we expect will continue to work for us, as we go on in the future. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Okay. And then a last one for me. Just -- you've increased the backlog, it sounds like, for OKS. And then, presumably that would then push through to higher cash flows and distributions, and then up to OKE. I'm just wondering if we can talk about, as you look out to '15 and '16, and your dividend growth guidance, maybe just focusing on OKE of 10%. Could we see that number notch higher as we bring these projects in? Terry K. Spencer: Yes. I mean, potentially, you could. Certainly we -- as far as the -- our dividend strategy is certainly to be in line with our peer group. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then, sorry, I did have one more, if I could ask. Just on the balance sheet for OKE. Any thoughts -- updated thoughts, now that you've closed the ONE Gas spend, in terms of where you want to target the leveraged metrics? Do you want to be investment grade there? Derek S. Reiners: Yes, Ted. We'd sure like to be investment grade there. Of course, Moody's does have us there. S&P's got us a notch below. It's not critical to our strategy to be investment grade at OKE. But I think it'd be nice to have a differentiator for us to be there. Our leverage is going to be sub 2x, I think, as you look out. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I wanted to circle back on basis. I mean, I probably ask you this every quarter, seemingly. But on the gas side, it did seem like the price realizations, given the level of hedging and the price of the hedging, suffered some basis disconnect again. I know we saw this in the third quarter, and you mentioned some Bakken issues that were resolved. And we saw them resolve in the fourth quarter. But curious with the first quarter, if that was weather-driven, if there was something else going on, if you could sort of help me understand how it might resolve itself as we move through the year? Terry K. Spencer: Well, I would say that certainly on the spot side or cash side of the business, the unhedged side, certainly, there were some realizations due to the weather -- some impacts due to weather, rather. But Rob, did you get -- anything you can add to... Robert F. Martinovich: I don't think there's any -- any additional color on that, Terry. Terry K. Spencer: I mean we've -- the prices -- the net realized prices stay pretty close to the same in-line, quarter-over-quarter. It's a function, Chris, of where you set the hedge prices at. And we set them at a price that -- that, I mean, we've got that clearly in our hedge tables. We set it at a low $4 price. That's reflected in this net realized price. It's -- as we -- our hedging policy, we target a 75% hedging level, okay? We don't try to pick prices as we move throughout the year, because we're not very good at picking prices. We try to exercise discipline and systematically hedge ourselves as we move through the year, regardless of where the prices trade. And so, they fall out where they fall out. I hope that helps. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. Yes, just, I guess, given the hedge level, the price and then sort of what happened, certainly with gas pricing in the quarter, I would've thought -- we would've maybe seen a better aggregate realization. But I'll just dig in a little bit deeper on that off-line, Terry. I guess, switching real quick to Sterling III. Congrats on having that come in. I did notice in last night's release there were some very minor adjustments to some of these specs listed there, in terms of capacity -- expandable capacity, CapEx link, things like that. I was just wondering, if you could talk a little bit about those amendments, the implementation was a little bit delayed over the winter. Was it tied to that? And did you get any additional commitment to carry for that line? I think we were at about 75% before. Terry K. Spencer: Rob? Take that one? Robert F. Martinovich: Sure. With regards to the timing, it was weather. Weather got us at the tail end of the fourth quarter, and then the severe weather that we saw in the first quarter was the reason for the delay. With regards to the cost, we're still feeling good with regards to the -- where we've got that bracketed, where we just have. Obviously, there are some invoices still coming in on that, as we wrap up the payment. But at the end of the day, I don't think we're concerned with regards to where that CapEx is going. Terry K. Spencer: Wes, do you have anything you want to add to that? Wesley John Christensen : No, I agree with Rob's comments. I believe we're confident in our range. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. I guess, just -- there was like an extra 10,000 barrels a day of sort of the expandable capacity. So is that just -- I -- and I realized it's very minor, but I was just curious, is that just better understanding of the project itself, or what would sort of change the scope on that upper end? Terry K. Spencer: Sure. We can -- as we continue to look at that pipeline and where we position boosters and everything else like that, there's a potential that we can move the expandable capacity higher, as we continue to go forward. That's what you're seeing in that number. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay, great. Final question for me, guys. Just realize 1Q was seemingly all about propane and propane spread. But we've seen consistently strong deltas on isobutane. And just wondering, Terry, if you can offer any commentary about the, sort of the ability to capture. I know you have an isom unit in the Mid-Con. And we're still seeing some nice premiums up there. Terry K. Spencer: Yes. And I can assure you, it's running flat out. Sheridan, you got anything to add? Sheridan C. Swords: I mean, yes, obviously we capture the spread in the isom unit, but also that demand up in Conway allows us to increase throughput on our door system as we deliver ISO into the refineries in the upper Midwest as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division : [indiscernible] talked to today on their earnings release about an upsized frac, on new completion technology in the Cana-Woodford. Do you guys have exposure to them there as they ramp up drilling? Terry K. Spencer: Yes, we have lots of exposure to that. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: So picking up on Ted's question on spreads and Sheridan's comments about Geismer, and I think, a Lyondell plant expansion coming online in the summer. And Terry, your comments around changes in propane supply and demand creating some permanently expanding basis differentials. Can you put some more color on what exactly you all expect to see in terms of the Conway to Belvieu spreads? Are you still thinking the high single-digits? And how do you see ethane exports impacting this, going out a couple of years? Terry K. Spencer: Yes. Well, let me -- I'll take this, and then Sheridan can kind of follow up with it. Yes, as we look -- as we move into the balance of the year, we see spreads widening out from where they currently are, particularly for ethane and propane. Both spreads, we expect to be in that $0.08 to $0.10 a gallon range, as we move through the balance of the year, driven by those very things that Sheridan mentioned earlier, stronger petrochemical demand, lower inventories. Inventories for ethane are coming down, and of course, the strong export demand for propane. So Sheridan, you got anything else to add to that? Sheridan C. Swords: The only thing I'd add is your other question was on exports. That exports, obviously, that -- it's just like bringing on more demand in '16 that we didn't see. And it's not as dependent upon the big buildout of the crackers. So that's -- and in long-term helped ethane prices. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Right. No one has been modeling that up until now in their supply and demand picture. All right, and digging more into the expanded growth CapEx pipeline line of sight, can you elaborate on the capacity to expand into the Niobrara and specifically, to break into oil opportunities? Terry K. Spencer: Yes, we can, Craig. That footprint was a natural extension of our existing footprint. And it's connected by our NGL position. It's a great platform for us to get into a new basin, to participate in gathering and processing, as well as liquids. I think the opportunity for us to invest in the crude oil side of the business up there as well is there. So, yes. I mean, it's a great extension, and it is going to afford us lots of opportunity. I think the drilling results have been very good, and we're continuing to see a lot of development. We're having success at signing up new acreage packages to our facilities, and our expectation is for this asset footprint to be a big part of our business. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Sounds good. And last question I've got, on the credit side. The credit agencies kind of take a jaundiced view of assets that -- as cash flows trickle down, or in this case, trickle up to support debt, that's not at the entity that actually directly owns the asset. If it's just too tough to run up and down the escalator here, and you're just not going to get an S&P investment-grade credit, at a certain point, do you say to yourselves, \"Well, given that we have such a strong balance sheet, should we think about this as dry powder?\" And instead of worrying about keeping the, or achieving investment-grade, should we just think about maybe levering up, up to a comfortable point, to support a very economic ongoing expansion, be it acquisition or organic growth at OKS, or even temporarily at OKE? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Craig, certainty, that's something you could consider. But certainly not high on our list. Our strategy is very clear, to operate ONEOK as the, a pure-play holding company. We really don't have any plans on the horizon to make investments or to lever up OKE. The strategy of maximizing the cash dividend to our shareholders is top priority. And we won't operate with blinders on. We'll always be aware of opportunities that are out there. We'll have -- we'll be flexible. But as we sit today, this is our priority. Operator : Our next question comes from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Just one more follow-up on the increase in the backlog. What kind of changes to the mix of those projects are you seeing? Terry K. Spencer: Rob? Robert F. Martinovich: Hey John. Well, with regard to that incremental, it's going to be more weighted towards GNP, as Terry mentioned, from a processing opportunity, in both the Bakken and the Powder River basins. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay. That's something incremental. And are you seeing any changes to that underlying? Robert F. Martinovich: The underlying? No. I mean, there's little things that float around, but pretty much that's staying within what we've previously thought the backlog would turn out. Operator : Our next question comes from Helen Ryoo with Barclays. Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division : The -- on the optimization margin, the -- was there a change in the capacity you've allocated to the optimization business this quarter versus a year ago? Terry K. Spencer: Sheridan, let me take this first part, and you can follow up with it. But we've -- Helen, we don't, and have not historically talked about our optimization capacity and optimization throughputs. So we won't change that now. Sheridan, have you got anything you want to say? Sheridan C. Swords: The only thing I can say is that actually, we continue to try to turn that into fee-based. Return our optimization capacity into fee-based revenue. Terry K. Spencer: And you certainly see that in the exchange revenue portion of our business as it continues to grow. So Helen, for competitive reasons, that's why. Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, I understand. I -- Just directionally, I was wondering, I know you don't give out the actual capacity number, but just directionally, this quarter versus a year ago, whether there has been a significant change in how much optimization volume you were running or not. But I understand. And then just, I guess, related to this and maybe you won't be able to answer this, but I'll just throw it out. You just talked about how you expect the ethane and propane spread to widen going forward. And I guess, Sheridan kind of answered just now that despite sort of your outlook, you expect to have sort of more capacity allocated to the third-party business, rather than trying to keep a bit more optimization capacity than before. Am I understanding you correctly? Terry K. Spencer: Absolutely. I mean, that's a well-defined strategy that we've employed for those -- for several years, and we'll continue to do so. We'll have some level of optimization capacity, I'm confident. But it will be greatly diminished from where it has been in the past. Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay, got it. And then just last one. Your Canadian Valley plant just came online in March. What do you see in terms of your volume ramp-up expectation there? Terry K. Spencer: Rob? Robert F. Martinovich: Hey Helen, this is Rob. It's doing very well. We're pushing capacity as we speak. We had a large tranche of gas that we had -- that we're offloading to several other facilities that we're bringing back on to our system, as well as we balanced our overall system. So we've got that benefit, plus just the continued strong growth that we've seen from our producers over the last couple of months. So it's doing very well, a very quick ramp-up. Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division : In terms of when you see that plant filling up, is there sort of a rule of thumb we should think about? Robert F. Martinovich: It's going to vary by area. I mean, this one ramped up -- we thought it would ramp up within 45 days, or be full effectively within 45 days. And we're there. Plants that we have in the Bakken, Garden Creek II that comes on in the third quarter, we expect also a very quick ramp-up on that because it's going to be waiting for processing capacity. When you get to Garden Creek III in the first quarter of next year, that's going to be a little bit slower ramp-up, just because of the short interval between those 2 plants coming online. So it really depends on the area and the volume. Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Did you say full in 45 days after coming into service? I mean, the plants that fill up quickly, would fill up that quickly? Robert F. Martinovich: If the gas is there, and we can bring it on, it definitely can. And that means both infrastructure-wise, as well as the gas available. And like I said, for Canadian Valley, we knew that was -- we had the opportunity to ramp it up very quickly because of the amount of gas that we were offloading to third-party processing facilities, as well as the pent up demand that we had on our system itself. Operator : Our next question comes from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Just a quick follow-up. I noticed in the first quarter, on the G&P side, the equity NGL volumes at 18,000 a day seemed a little bit stronger than we were expecting, I guess, in part because of, some of the well freeze-offs. And I'm not sure if I'm looking at apples and oranges, but when we look, for instance, on a go-forward basis and the hedging profile and how much is sort of expected to be hedged, if you will, it kind of backs into sort of a go-forward number, close to the 13,000 to 15,000 barrels. I just didn't know if anything was going on in the first quarter that we should be aware of. Robert F. Martinovich: No, there's really not, Carl. I mean, that just, I think is showing the growth that we've seen with regards to the Bakken plants coming online, Stateline II coming online last April, the 30% of Maysville that we now have, as well as just your continued ramp-up of volumes in each of our existing facilities, both in the Bakken and the Mid-Continent. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Canada : Rob, perhaps maybe a better way I should asked that question is, is as we look forward, is there any reason why those equity NGL volumes would be going back down? Robert F. Martinovich: As we go forward, did they go back down? I guess, as you -- as Canadian Valley comes on, and you're rejecting more ethane, then that would tend to drive those volumes down. Operator : And that concludes the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to our speaker, T.D. Eureste, for any additional or closing remarks. T.D. Eureste: Thank you for joining us. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends until earnings are released after the market closes on August 5, followed by a conference call on August 6. We'll provide details in the conference call at a later date. I'll be available throughout the day to answer your follow-up questions. Thank you, and -- for joining us today, and have a great day. Thank you. Operator : And that concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation.",

Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division Operator : Good day, and welcome to the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, Shannon. And welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' Second Quarter 2014 Earnings Conference Call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements, and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, T.D. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. On this conference call is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer, who will review our financial results. Also with me and available to answer your questions are : Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President of Commercial; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Wes Christiansen, our Senior Vice President of Operations. On this morning's call, we will review our second quarter 2014 financial and operating results. I will expand on sequential variances comparing first quarter 2014 results, which were impacted by strong seasonal demand with the second quarter 2014 at the partnership. I will discuss our recently announced capital projects, which increased our capital growth program to a range of $7 billion to $7.5 billion. I'll expand on what I consider an incredible capital growth days we are entering. And then, we'll discuss our commitment to reducing natural gas flaring in North Dakota plus an NGL market and Conway-to-Mont Belvieu price differential update. Before we review our second quarter performance, I would like to briefly discuss our 2014 financial guidance. We remain confident that we will meet our 2014 financial guidance expectations and reaffirm guidance that both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. We will continue to review our expected performance as the year progresses and make any adjustments as appropriate. Now our second quarter performance. Operating income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK reflects higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold. And higher natural gas liquids volumes sold in the natural gas gathering and processing segment as a result of recently completed capital growth projects. Second quarter 2014 results reflect the first quarter that ONEOK has operated as the pure-play general partner of ONEOK Partners. We remain committed to providing management and resources to ONEOK Partners to execute its growth strategies. Derek now will review ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' financial highlights, and then I'll review our operating performance. Derek? Derek S. Reiners: Thanks, Terry, and good morning. Second quarter 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $62 million or $0.29 per diluted share. Income from continuing operations attributable to ONEOK was approximately $70 million or $0.33 per diluted share compared with second quarter of 2013 income from continuing operations of approximately $75 million or $0.36 per diluted share. ONEOK is benefiting from its pure-play general partnership strategy, receiving $287 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners in the 6 months of 2014, a 9% increase from the same period last year. Cash flow available for dividends for the first 6 months was $341 million providing 1.45x coverage. We're reaffirming ONEOK's cash flow available for dividends guidance range of $560 million to $640 million. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend $0.015 per share to $0.575 per share, effective for the second quarter of 2014, resulting in an annualized cash dividend of $2.36 -- excuse me, $2.30 per share. Moving onto ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners' second quarter income was approximately $214 million or $0.54 per unit compared with $202 million or $0.62 per unit in the second quarter of 2013. Distributable cash flow was $272 million for the second quarter, providing coverage of 1.02x. For the first 6 months of 2014, distributable cash flow was $570 million, providing 1.14x coverage compared with $445 million for the same period last year, providing coverage of 0.99x. Our long-term annual coverage ratio target still remains at 1.05x to 1.15x. We increased our second quarter 2014 distribution to $0.76 per unit, an increase of approximately 6% from our second quarter 2013 distribution of $0.72 per unit. We also reaffirmed ONEOK Partners' 2014 net income guidance range of $975 million to $1.075 billion. Its adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $1.565 billion to $1.665 billion, and its Bcf guidance range of $1.15 billion to $1.25 billion. The partnerships slightly increased its 2014 capital spending guidance by $85 million to $2.1 billion, primarily as a result of our recently announced Demicks Lake and Knox capital growth projects. In the gathering and processing segment, we've updated the margin estimate web model that can be found on the ONEOK Partners' website. This update improves the accuracy of estimating the net margin by adding an electric compression charge, which has become more significant with our Canadian Valley plant coming online and our growth in the Williston Basin. In the news release, you'll notice changes in our hedge percentages reflecting expected ramp-up of volumes in the second half of 2014. During the quarter, we issued 1.9 million common units through our aftermarket equity program and a total of $3 million common units in the first 6 months of 2014 compared with 681,000 common units issued in all of last year through the program. Additionally, in May, we completed a public offering of 13.9 million common units, which generated net proceeds of $730 million. We used the proceeds to repay commercial paper, fund our capital expenditures and for general partnership purposes. With this offering and excluding any potential acquisitions at the partnership, we don't expect to return to the overnight equity market again this year, based on our planned 2014 capital expenditure guidance. We have ample liquidity to support the partnership's ongoing capital growth program, including access to nearly $1.7 billion under our commercial paper program or credit facility as of June 30. At the end of the second quarter, the partnership had $278 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility, a long term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 51% and a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.4x. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, Derek. At ONEOK Partners, the natural gas gathering and processing segment second quarter 2014 operating income was up 19% compared with the second quarter 2013, due to higher natural gas volumes gathered, processed and sold, and higher natural gas liquids volumes sold, as a result of recently completed capital growth projects and higher net realized commodity prices. From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income for the second quarter 2014 compared with the first quarter 2014 was up 10%, due to a $17 million increase, due to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and Western Oklahoma, offset partially by a $9 million decrease in lower net realized prices and a $7 million decrease due to changes in contract mix. The segment's operating cost decreased $6 million sequentially, primarily due to the timing of materials and supplies costs. Volumes increased sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Natural gas gathered increased 10% and natural gas processed increased 14%. We have continued to see a significant ramp-up in natural gas volumes across our systems since February, and we expect to see this strong growth continue in the second half of 2014, especially in the Williston Basin as we connect more wells to our system and as we bring our Garden Creek II and III facilities into service. Natural gas liquids segment's second quarter 2014 income was up 11% compared with the second quarter 2013, due to higher margin volumes delivered from the Bakken NGL pipeline and from new plants connected in the Mid-Continent region. From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income following strong seasonal demand of the first quarter was down 10%, due to a $40 million decrease in optimization margins, primarily from narrower Conway-to-Mont Belvieu propane location price differentials. And a $15 million decrease in marketing margins due to lower propane margins, offset by a $34 million increase in exchange services margins, which resulted primarily from higher margin natural gas liquids volumes delivered from the Bakken NGL pipeline and increased volumes from new plants connected in the Midcontinent region, a $16 million increase in isomerization volumes due to wider iso-to-normal price differentials, and a $7 million increase in operational measurement gains. The segment's operating cost increased $11 million sequentially, primarily due to outside services and property taxes due to capital growth projects. Volume growth increased sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Natural gas liquids gathered increased 9% and natural gas liquids fractionated increased 10%. We expect natural gas liquids volumes to increase during the second half of the year as previously connected natural gas processing plants continue to ramp-up. Also, 6 of the 10 plus connections to new processing plants we planned for 2014 have been completed through July with the balance occurring by year end. During the fourth quarter, we expect to reach approximately 575,000 barrels per day, both for natural gas liquids gathered and fractionated. The segment's natural gas liquids volume was impacted in the first quarter of 2014 due to severe cold weather, which reduced supply deliveries to our systems. Ethane rejection also continues to impact volumes. The lower volume impact to the exchange services financial performance is partially offset by minimum volume commitments. Additionally, our Bakken NGL pipeline is now gathering approximately 40,000 barrels per day and will increase as our Garden Creek II and III plants come online. The Bakken barrel is our highest margin volume in the entire NGL system. The natural gas pipelines segment's second quarter 2014 income was up 14% compared with the second quarter 2013, due to higher natural gas transportation revenues related to increased rates on intrastate pipelines, and the higher contracted capacity and natural gas volumes transported in the natural gas pipelines segment. Sequentially, quarter-over-quarter, operating income following the strong seasonal demand over the first quarter was down 32%, due to a $6 million decrease in short-term natural gas storage services from reduced weather-driven demand in the second quarter of 2014. A $5 million decrease in park-and-loan services, also, as a result of reduced weather-driven demand in the second quarter of 2014. And a $9 million decrease related to lower net retained fuel, lower natural gas prices and lower contracted storage capacity. Equity earnings decreased $8 million sequentially, primarily due to decreased park-and-loan services on northern border pipeline compared with the higher weather-related demand in the first quarter 2014. On July 1, 2014, the North Dakota industrial commission, or NDIC, adopted an order drafted by the Department of Mineral Resources, which revised the state's rules for natural gas flaring. Earlier in the year, the NDIC also approved an industry goal to reduce natural gas flaring to 5% to 10% of total production by the fourth quarter 2020. We remain committed to being part of the solution to reduce natural gas flaring in North Dakota as we continue to invest in critical natural gas and the NGL infrastructure. This commitment was demonstrated by last week's joint announcement with North Dakota Governor, Jack Dalrymple, on the Demicks Lake Natural Gas Processing Facility and related infrastructure in North Dakota, which will bring the partnerships natural gas processing in the Williston basin to 1.1 billion cubic feet per day by the end of 2016, 10x the natural gas processing capacity we had in the region compared with 2010. Additionally, we expect to announce additional Williston Basin natural gas processing capacity by the end of this year, pending board approval. We are accelerating our capital growth program in the region as improved completion techniques and increased density drilling continues to drive higher production forecast. We also recently announced the Knox natural gas processing plant and related infrastructure in the crude oil and NGL-rich SCOOP play in South Central Oklahoma. This 200 million cubic feet per day plant will accommodate increased production at NGL-rich natural gas in the emerging SCOOP, where we have substantial acreage dedications. This will increase our Oklahoma natural gas processing capacity to 900 million cubic feet per day by the end of 2016. Now an update on our announced capital growth program. The Garden Creek II natural gas processing plant is mechanically complete and on budget, and we expect Garden Creek II to be operational and full by the end of August. As mentioned in last week's announcement, the Garden Creek III natural gas processing plant is ahead of schedule and expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2014 versus the first quarter 2015. And by constructing additional fuel compression, we will be able to take advantage of additional processing capacity at our existing and planned Garden Creek and Stateline natural gas processing plants by a total of 100 million cubic feet per day by the fourth quarter 2015. The Sterling I and II pipeline reconfiguration was completed in July. And finally, our MB-3 fractionator and the Sage Creek NGL pipeline infrastructure are expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2014. The news release incorrectly stated the Sage Creek NGL pipeline infrastructure completion was fourth quarter 2015. Our capital growth program is now at $7 billion to $7.5 billion, and we are entering into another incredible capital growth phase at the partnership, with the announcements of the Knox and Demicks Lake natural gas processing plants and related infrastructure, and the expected announcement of additional processing capacity in the Williston Basin pending board approval. Our announced capital growth program has approximately $3.2 billion to $3.7 billion remaining to spend between now and year end 2016 and our backlog remains at $3 billion to $4 billion. We are well-positioned in the Bakken Shale and the Williston Basin. The NGL-rich area of the Niobrara Shale and the Powder River Basin with our Sage Creek acquisition, which is progressing as planned. And in the Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays in the Mid-Continent. Now a brief review of our outlook on the NGL markets and Conway-to-Mont Belvieu location price differential environment. Planned and unplanned ethylene plant outages plus expansion delays continue to constrain ethane frac-ing due to the decreased ethane demand and increased ethane rejection, estimated to be approximately 300,000 barrels per day industry-wide. Ethane inventories continue to build and could reach approximately 40 million barrels by the end of August. As a result, we expect Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane location price differentials will be in the $0.03 to $0.05 per gallon range in favor of Mont Belvieu for the balance of the year. Gulf Coast propane inventories are up approximately 24% over the 5-year average and Midwest inventories are 8% under the 5-year average. Propane exports continue to be strong, and we are seeing more propane buying in Conway in preparation for the fall and winter. And as a result, we expect propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu to be in the minus $0.02 to plus $0.02 per gallon range for the balance of the year. Even in this narrow location price differential environment, our integrated assets have performed well, and we remain committed to our strategy of converting optimization margins to fee-based exchange services, which will continue to provide long-term value for our unitholders. Normally, I close by thanking all of the ONEOK employees whose professionalism and dedication allows us to create exceptional value for our investors and customers for which I am truly grateful. Today, I would like to focus on my friend and one of ONEOK's most valued employees, Dan Harrison. As most of you know, Dan passed away last week following courageous and tough battle with cancer with his family by his side. Throughout his fight, he was surrounded by his beloved wife and daughter, extended family, friends and his ONEOK and ONE Gas family. The outpouring of support for him and his family has been truly amazing. His dedication and passion for ONEOK, its employees and its stakeholders cannot be put into words. His contributions to this company and our employees are numerous. Dan led several functions for us, among which were Communications and Investor Relations, for which he had tremendous passion. How Dan was able to tell the ONEOK story to the investment community was truly best-in-class. I remember when Dan joined ONEOK in 2005, he immediately recognized that our employees and integrated assets and their history of creating exceptional value, he said \"Made for a story that needed to be told.\" So under Dan's guidance, we traveled east and west and wherever he wanted to take us. Our stakeholders benefited from those efforts and this did not go unrecognized through our share in unit price. And by Dan's colleagues, as he was named to institutional Investor Relations Magazine's 2011 All-American Executive team. Even as Dan was battling cancer, he was instrumental in leading us through the separation from ONE Gas that we announced a little over a year ago. He provided me invaluable counsel and leadership, especially as I entered my new role as CEO. I and the entire ONEOK family will be forever grateful for Dan's leadership, tenacity, kindness, professionalism, passion and dedication to this organization. Dan leaves behind a wonderful legacy, in the way he was able to tell the ONEOK story to the investment community, and we will always honor this and all of his many contributions. Operator, we're ready for questions now. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll first go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe just starting off in the G&P business here, and if you can just talk a little bit about the returns profile that we should be looking for. I guess, and if you look at kind of the, whether it's your guidance or where the numbers are coming for the first half of the year, at least when we do the math, it looks like the returns are not up to 5 to 7x that you've been guiding us to. So, I guess, the ramp as the capital is deployed, as the volumes of ramp-up maybe just a little more help there in terms of how we should be thinking about that. Terry K. Spencer: Sure, Ted. We still, in our view, still, the economic returns on these projects are still within that 5 to 7x in our view. But certainly, you do have to think about the impact of commodity prices over the course of the last 2 or 3 years, we have seen private prices come down, already has impacted returns somewhat, but we're still within that 5 to 7x range. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : And is it -- should we expect that in a year or a couple of years? Or what's the timing of when we think we hit the full run rate? Terry K. Spencer: When we hit the full run rate? Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Yes, exactly. Terry K. Spencer: I mean, Ted, most of these plants, when we turn them on particularly Garden Creek II, Garden Creek III, and then the new process capacity that we've announced over the course of the last several months, we expect those to be full, pretty darn quick. Almost, as we start them up, they will be essentially full, day 1. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. Okay, great. And then if you can just talk about, again, sticking with the G&P business, it looks like you had a little bit of a sequential drop if I look at first quarter, second quarter versus first quarter in your equity NGL barrels. Is there anything behind that? Or was it kind of -- what was the driver there? Terry K. Spencer: Yes, Ted. Rob will take... Robert F. Martinovich: We started the Canadian Valley sort of that process in April, so as you're going through the startup there or you're going -- you're not running at full efficiencies, quite frankly, as volumes are coming on, and you're getting plants lined up, so that was the primary factor. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Got it. And then last one for me. On the 2 new plants for Demicks Lake and Knox. I guess, are these contracts going to be similar to the other ones you've had where we should consider them mostly acreage dedications? Or you started bidding at minimum volume commitments or any sort of other financial backstops on any of these projects? Terry K. Spencer: They'll be very similar to contracts in the past, the acreage dedications, DOP percentage plus deed [ph] components. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Maybe just to start, if I could, with the projects in the queue, you guys obviously continue to be active, continue to point to more projects coming in the Bakken, yet you're still kind of looking at this $3 billion to $4 billion of unannounced. So I assume new projects are kind of coming into sort of help backfill. And what I wonder is has there been any shift in characteristic as you're adding new projects to that potential backlog, is the first question. And the second is as you look at that $3 billion to $4 billion, is it possible to break down from just a rough zip code of percentage, how much of that is coming from either processing or commodity exposed infrastructure versus more fee-based infrastructure? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Carl, I'll take part of this question and then I'll have to let Rob follow up with it. But yes, the characterization of the projects that are coming in to the backlog as we continue to announce are not really no different than in the past. It's all gathering and processing, it's liquids-related infrastructure. And it's in, of course, our core regions, the Bakken. We have expectations for the Niobrara or the Powder River Basin as well. But really, it's more of the same I think, the mix of the projects too from a spending standpoint have been pretty well, in the past, have been pretty well, 50-50 gathering and processing and NGLs. And I'll let Rob speak to kind of to go -- to going forward his assessment. Robert F. Martinovich: Sure, Carl. Step back and the only thing I'll add to what Terry said is certainly, what we're seeing in the Bakken, in the Mid-Continent Shale or some or the other shales is the newer wells are stronger than probably they were a few years ago. And so, with that, kind of, as an overall backdrop, certainly, what we're seeing is the opportunity for additional gathering and processing infrastructure in the areas be it the Bakken, the Niobrara, Oklahoma as we've demonstrated and then going forward, continuing in the Bakken. And then, from an NGL infrastructure, to support those liquids. So I'd say it's going to be, at the end of the day, maybe a little bit tilted towards the gathering and processing initially, but I think over time, it will works its way down to that 50-50. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Okay, that's helpful. And then, also, if I could ask a question on the NGL volumes and this maybe more sort of geared towards the distribution lines, but noting that second quarter was relatively flat with first quarter, despite Sterling III having come online. And so I just want to get a better sense of the nuance there. Is that from more of the fact that just kind of the narrowed differential? Or was Sterling I and II, for all intents and purposes, down for the count for second quarter as it was finishing its reconfiguration work? Terry K. Spencer: Well, I'm going to let Sheridan handle that question, but the only comment I will make, my contribution is that our business is a very complicated business in terms of the way we operate it. And when Sheridan gets done talking to you about that, you'll have an even better appreciation of the complexity. Sheridan, take it away, please. Sheridan C. Swords: Carl, you kind of hit it on the nose. Narrow spread differential is overall, that's what's driving it. As we see spreads or prices are more in favor of the Conway market, we are moving more of the barrels up through our system to Conway, which has taken barrels away from Sterling system, than we had seen in the previous quarter. So that's really overall what's driving our system, driving the flatness in the 2 quarters that paces that -- more is just going north to the higher Conway markets. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then last question, if I could. And this is really more on the NGL volumes gathered. And Terry, correct me if I'm wrong, I think you indicated that you guys were targeting a fourth quarter run rate in the $575 million range, did I hear that correct? Terry K. Spencer: That's correct. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And so that number seems to be a little bit lower than what we were looking for initially back last December, and I just wanted to make sure I knew exactly what was driving that Delta. It was primarily just a timing of gas plants coming on? But also, I wanted to ask to the extent that you have any contract renewals at the tailgate of any of these plants, do you see any headwinds of any of those plants going a different direction and or they -- is there basically a volume at risk that we should be aware of? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Carl, I'm going to take the last part of that question. I'll let Sheridan handle the first part. But the last part of the question, no. We don't have concerns, but we do remain very sensitive to the market and extremely aware of our competitions out there. And so we've been very successful competing in our area and really don't see any vulnerabilities. The one contract that you've heard us talk about a number of times in the past calls is -- we had a contract at the beginning of the year that we terminated and that was a below market, very, very low margin contract that have been in place for a number of years. And so we terminated that contract. And that's, of course, has impacted our year-over-year volumes. We haven't forgotten the question already. I think Sheridan will handle the first part of it. Sheridan C. Swords: Carl, as we look into the fourth quarter of this year and why we've changed our volume, it kind of comes down to a couple of things. And one is we are seeing more ethane rejection across our system and so that's having an impact on us as well. We're also seeing, as plants ramp-up, they're not ramping up quite as fast as we thought they would in certain parts of our system. But also, we are seeing some -- the volume that's not coming on is more weighted towards our lower margin volume and the volume that is coming on is more of a higher margin volume. So that's a little bit unfortunate for us that we're kind of having that mix, that there are higher-margin volumes are doing well, if not exceeding our expectations. Operator : And we'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : A couple of questions. Just kind of maybe this is somewhat big picture, but just trying to think about fractionation utilization across your system, both in Mont Belvieu and in the MidCon. And you continue to add a lot of processing capacity in and around your system, of course, a lot of it up in the Bakken. Now I'm just wondering, does that -- should we expect that, at some point, you'll need to add another fractionator to handle all that incremental volume coming off of all those plants? Terry K. Spencer: Okay, Michael, I'm going to give you the short answer and then Sheridan may give you a much longer answer, but the short answer is, yes. Do you have anything to add to that, Sheridan? Robert F. Martinovich: Michael, you hit it. As we bring more of these plants on, not just from our own plants or from other plants, we are looking forward to having more fractionation capacity coming online, trying to make sure we understand where the right place to put it in our system is to maximize utilization of the capacity that we have now and in the future on both our pipelines and our existing fracs. So yes, you will see if everything continues to progress, you will see more fracs come out. Terry K. Spencer: Michael, one other tidbit of information, I think may be helpful is that when we look at frac utilization in an ethane rejection environment like we're in right now, you may see the total utilization percentage be well below 100%. And I'm talking about anybody that operates fracs here in the industry. It's a little bit misleading because what's not being utilized in an ethane rejection scenario is the front end of the frac. The back end of the frac may be very full, okay? And so that's one little phenomenon or a characteristic that you need to be aware of that I think will be helpful to you to take you, particularly as we're in this ethane rejection environment. Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay, that's helpful. I appreciate it. And then back on the Sterling pipeline. Just sort of -- if you don't mind going over it again, so now that you've got I and II configured and III up and running, I mean, what's the best way for us to think about what's contracted versus what's available for optimization. Is III fully contracted or now you're using I and II for optimization, or just trying to get a feel for how those 3 lines now are going to interact. Terry K. Spencer: Michael, I think the first thing you got to look at those 3 lines is working as one system. And so you have 3 different capacities that you can put the right mix of product on those lines. And with how we've configured today, we're also going to use one of those lines for raw feeds to move raw feed between the Mid-Continent and Mont Belvieu. So like when we're in certain situations where we have an ethane rejection, we don't have as much FEEP [ph] coming out of the Mid-Continent, we can put that on a smaller line and use one of the other lines for purity products or raw feed if that's what it dictates. So we'll be able to move product in between those lines to maximize capacities that we have going from Conway to Belvieu. So you kind of got to think them -- you got to think of them as a complete system, not as individual pipelines. Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. My last question, just any updated thoughts you have on establishing a bigger footprint in the crude markets? Obviously, you've seen one Bakken crude line get that project -- get announced. Just not necessarily asking about that particular project, but just generally your thoughts in terms of getting into the crude side of the business more? Terry K. Spencer: Yes, Michael. We still are engaged in that process and still would like to establish a footprint, where it makes good sense and where it makes economic sense. The Bakken continues to be an area that we're continually prospecting for opportunity. The fact of the matter is though as you look at the crude oil landscapes, not many people want to sell or divest their crude oil assets. So those are very valuable -- they're very valuable assets to the most midstream companies. So we continue to look for logistical opportunities, storage, terminalling, pipelines, that type of thing. But of course, we, again, have to continue to weigh those investments against our alternative investments in our core areas like our Bakken gathering and processing, our Mid-Continent gathering and processing, our Mont Belvieu, Gulf Coast NGL position. So we want to be in the crude business. We are very aggressively looking for those opportunities, but certainly, we're not going to do them at the expense of economic discipline. And in particular, at the expense of investments we're making in our core areas. Operator : We'll take our next question from John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I just wanted to make sure I understood. You mentioned about reducing flaring in the Bakken down to, I think you said to 5% or maybe 5% to 10% level by 2020, and I'm just curious, your thoughts on how much capital do you think will be required to accomplish that in -- up in the Williston Basin there? Terry K. Spencer: Well, certainly, we're going to -- it's going to take a lot of capital, as you can see. We have already announced our Demicks Lake processing plant and now we're telling you that we're going to announce, yet more capacity between now and the end of the year, pending board approval. Every time we announce these plants, they're now much larger plants than we built in the past. They're in that 200 million -- they're 200 million a day capacity range. And now, we've announced 2 of them in the last several months and you got -- from that, you've got a pretty good sense of what the capital is and the frequency associated therewith. We don't know exactly when the capacity is going to stop. That is what's happening that's making this challenging for us is that the increased density, the increased number of wells per spacing unit is increasing dramatically, seemingly quarter-by-quarter. And when you look at current density levels being at about 14, roughly 14 wells per spacing unit, that's compared to maybe 3, 4, 5 or 6 several months ago, that has a tremendous impact on your volume forecast. It makes it difficult to figure out where the top side of this thing can be. We have also heard, increased density to as many as 30-plus wells per spacing unit. Although, we've not assumed that in our economics. And certainly, we have a very large acreage dedication inventory, if you will. That is we got a lot of acres under dedication there. They're continuing to grow. So it makes that really challenging, John, I wish I could tell you an exact figure of what it's going to take to get to that point, because it may take more. If I gave you a number, I might determine 3 months from now, it's going to take a lot more. And certainly, that's a good problem to have for a midstream company. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : So it sounds like you're capturing a very large share in this regard. I mean, would it fair -- and you've just announced these recent projects yet, and this is to Carl's question, you've not expanded your backlog under consideration, the $3 billion to $4 billion at all, but it sounds like potentially, there's upward pressure on that. Is that the right way to think about it? Terry K. Spencer: Absolutely. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's really helpful. So I guess, would it be safe to say this whole flaring issue you're talking many billions of dollars, and is it fair to say, you expect to get maybe half of that business, or just -- if you can just give us an idea share-wise how you think about it? Terry K. Spencer: Sure. At least half, okay? When you look at the -- you look at our footprint within our footprint, we've got 5 million to 6 million acres that our asset footprint touches. We've got 3 million acres under dedication. When you look at kind of our share of the field within our reach, 50% is a pretty good number right now. And as we continue to put these larger processing plants in, that percentage will likely grow. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, that's really helpful. All right, just -- and then just switching gears. I wanted to make sure I understood your comment about, what the optimization margin expectation is now. I mean, I think back at your Analyst Day, I think you're projecting for '14, I think it was something like $0.07 and... Terry K. Spencer: That's correct. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : And what's the expectation now? Terry K. Spencer: Well, for the balance of the year, about $0.03 to $0.05 a gallon, on the ethane differential. As we look out further into 2015, 2016 timeframe, we're thinking $0.05 to $0.06, so we're tampering our thoughts on that a bit. So did that help you? John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes, that's really helpful. And then just lastly, you're speaking, and again, I think this was Carl's question, but as far as, I guess, kind of the ramp on your volumes offset by margin, how -- in terms of the return on those -- on your projects, given how I think you said you're getting more at the heavy end of the barrel where the margin is higher, so is your overall return relatively unchanged? How should we think about that? Terry K. Spencer: Well, as I said earlier, in the earlier question, our returns are still within that 5 to 7x. Commodity prices have affected that particularly with these POP contracts to some extent, but they're still within that -- they're still comfortably within that range. What's happening -- what effects returns as well as margin is volume, okay? And the volumes continued to perform. We continue to build incremental gathering facilities in addition to these plants at lower cost. So I think to some extent, we've offset some of that impact from commodity pricing, lower commodity pricing. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Okay, so you're -- just because the volumes are ramping a little slower because of the mix, you're not really seeing significant return erosion? You're still within your... Terry K. Spencer: We're still within that range. The other thing -- the other comment I'll make, John, is when we look at the returns on these gathering and processing investments in the Bakken, you got to remember too that we're bringing NGLs down, our NGL infrastructure, okay? And what happens is sometimes, we require -- it requires incremental capital to get those NGLs to market. And sometimes, for some periods of time, it won't. So the returns that you earn collectively when you combine the gathering and processing operation with the NGL investments, you get great returns. Do you follow me? Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : I wanted to follow-up on some of the volumetric questions you made during prepared remarks. Carl asked about the fourth quarter expectation on the frac side. I wanted to touch base really quickly on your hedge percentages for NGLs came down in the last update with no real change to the absolute hedge position, so obviously, it implies some higher numbers in the back half. Just wondering how that sort of dovetails with the full year guidance that you gave for gathering and process volumes. Did you take those, did I miss it or did those figures go up? Terry K. Spencer: Chris, I'm going to let Rob take that question. Robert F. Martinovich: Chris, yes, we are expecting, at this point, a stronger second half than we had a couple of months ago. We expect to, from a processing volume standpoint, beat our guidance. At this point in time. And so as a result, you did see the percentage hedge reduce. Terry K. Spencer: And Chris, of course, obviously that percentage hedged is now in that 57% range on the NGLs, we will look for opportunities to hedge as we move through the back half of the year. Robert F. Martinovich: Exactly. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Well, that also brings me to the next question, Terry. Which is how do you guys think given the NGL market today across all the products, clearly taking into account what you guys have said about the light end products in the past, but how do you think about sort of the window in the '15 or even beginning to look into '16, on any of that hedging behavior. Is that -- are you finding any opportunities that are attractive at this moment in time? Or is it just going to be sort of a real-time opportunistic behavior? Terry K. Spencer: Chris, it'll be opportunistic. We don't have anything right now at this 10 seconds, but yes, certainly we're looking at it every day. Hard. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. And so, historically, Terry, thinking about how much you guys were hedging, is the general goal going forward is still sort of get up to those levels as we enter any given period of time? Or are you comfortable running a little bit less hedged now given your internal view of the market? Terry K. Spencer: Well, we -- actually this -- as you move into the later part of the year, we get a little more comfortable with our volumes. And then so we -- so as we move into the year, our tendency -- or as we move through the year, our tendency would be to get more hedged, okay? But we're -- the market today has limited opportunities for us. And like I said -- but it can change in a hurry. And we'll continue to use this opportunistic strategy, which gravitates around a 75% hedged across the board strategy, okay? So -- and it's not -- that's not real prescriptive and hard and fast. We have at times gotten above the 75%. Like I said, as we move later into the year and get more confident in our volumes, so I hope that helps. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Yes, it does, it does. I want to switch gears, really quickly, Terry, a lot of questions on infrastructure opportunities. And obviously, we've seen additional build-out in the Bakken. You alluded to some more potentially coming with board approval by the end of the year. And so I'm just curious how we think about NGL take away capacity from the basin? Clearly, you have the NGL line today and you're doing expansion on it, but as we think out beyond that, just remind me, does that system have the capacity be expanded further? Or would we -- would additional takeaway above this expansions entail an entirely new system? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Chris, the short answer is, yes. It is expandable. We've done some expansion and some expansion projects are underway. And if necessary, more to come. I'll let Sheridan talk, give you a little more color on how we would expand those facilities. Sheridan C. Swords: Basically, the last expansion that we did--let me back up--the first expansion, you saw we put intermediate pump stations in. The next expansion, we started loops on the pipeline, so any further expansions of the pipeline will continue to extend a loop, meaning that we're laying a line right next to the original line and tying it in, that we need more capacity, we'll continue to extend those loops to be able to get the right amount of capacity on the Bakken Pipeline. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Okay. So those adds sharing to be smaller in size, or just more incremental? Sheridan C. Swords: Yes. The investment will be smaller in size than building a brand-new system. Now eventually, as you extend loops, you'll have a new system when you finish them all, but you do it incrementally, a little bit at a time. Robert F. Martinovich: Just for -- from a numbers standpoint, were the pumps that Sheridan talked about gives us up to 135,000 barrels a day and that initial looping, up to 160,000. Christopher P. Sighinolfi - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : All right, okay. And then the final question, Sheridan, you have talked about reconfiguration of the Sterling systems. And I just want to confirm, I think, it was my belief Sterling I was the only one capable of going south to north. Is that accurate? Sheridan C. Swords: That's correct. Operator : We next move to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Just looking at your guidance for the year. There seems to be a strong ramp-up in second half '14 EBITDA. And I was wondering, if you could provide just a bit more granularity on what's driving the ramp on an asset basis, if that's possible with which projects? And what's the shape of that ramp could look like between 3Q and 4Q? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Jeremy, I'm just going to just tell you, the short answer, it's all about volume. And Rob will give you a whole lot more color than that, I'm sure. Robert F. Martinovich: Let's start, I guess with -- from a pipe standpoint and just kind of go segment by segment, I mean, obviously, we had a great first quarter with regards to the maximizing our assets during the severe winter with regards to park-and-loan, as did our equity interest in northern border. And so we've been able to keep that and that segment has continued to perform well as noted in the second quarter, and we expect that to continue going forward the balance of the year. So we certainly expect to keep those gains. While G&P--while the rest of the industry got stung a little bit on the outset side of that severe weather from a volumetric standpoint, again, we're emphasizing on what we said earlier, the second half of the year with those facilities coming on early with the continued strong volumes that we're seeing in the Mid-Continent, that facilities coming on earlier in the Bakken, that's giving us pretty strong indications that overall, volumes for the year are going to be stronger than what we guided to. And as a result, that's where we're going to see the benefits in the second half of the year. And as -- so that's the G&P. So obviously, expecting both those to continue to perform strongly for the year. From an NGL standpoint, while volumes are down where we thought we would be at the beginning of the year, certainly, we don't want anyone lose sight of the great first quarter with regards to, again, maximizing our assets to get propane to the Midwest market and the other opportunities have to continue to come along. Isomerization spreads, certainly were strong this quarter. The guys are doing all the, as Terry alluded, very complicated business, but they're doing a lot of things, maximizing our system, again, to take us the opportunity where spreads are. So while volumes, overall are down, we do have some better margins that are accounted for in that volume being off, as well as some additional volumes are mitigated with take-or-pay or ship-or-pay contracts as well. So net-net, that kind of where we see the 3 segments with GMP and pipes being up and then NGL being slightly down, but overall, that's the reason that Terry commented that we are reaffirming guidance for the year. Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : That's helpful. When thinking about future growth, CapEx potential, I was wondering how much of the opportunity set resides, kind of in your existing footprint in particular, the Bakken, the mid Conway, you keep having lots of nice projects materializing. And how much of a focus is there on expanding the platform into new basins or growing a position there such as the Niobrara or entering the Permian, just wondering if you could share your thoughts on that trade-off. Terry K. Spencer: Well, we -- as we said before, we're continually looking for opportunity to expand our footprint work where it makes sense and where we can utilize, in particular, our existing assets to enhance any competitive advantage getting into those areas. So yes, we continued to look. The Permian, certainly, as I've said many times in the past, is an area of focus for us. It\u2019s a target-rich environment in terms of production and it's underserved in some areas. So yes, we're going to continue to expand or at least look to expand outside our footprint. The Niobrara, of course, is one as you've mentioned, one that where things are going very well for us. We continue to contract more and more acreage dedications and enhance our contractual footprint there and the capital spending is coming. So yes, that's kind of the -- that's kind of how we look at it. Yes, we really would like to have another platform, well it be like -- whether it's for crude oil as I've mentioned before or perhaps it's gathering and processing and NGLs and in another region, perhaps the Permian, certainly, that'd be very attractive to us. Operator : Next we'll take Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: So piggybacking a little on Carl's initial growth CapEx question and a number of the others, despite the $1.1 billion of incremental growth CapEx announced in recent weeks and the implicit increase in unannounced backlog, you're not getting much respect this morning at OKS in the market. Can you give some color around the pace of the timing of this $3 billion to $4 billion of incremental announcements, besides, the Bakken processing that will likely be disclosed by year end? Terry K. Spencer: Sure. I mean, I think, what we can tell you as far as that capital backlog, we haven't provided specific timing associated with it, but generally speaking, it takes a couple of years to build these -- most of these projects, these plants and these pipelines. So I think if I were trying to make a swag at it, in terms of timing associated with that capital, certainly most of it would be spent over the next couple of years. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. So you think most of that $3 billion to $4 billion would be announced in the next 6 to 9 months? Terry K. Spencer: Yes. It would actually be announced -- well, yes, if you -- if it's going to spend -- if the spend rate is a couple of years, it takes you a couple of years to spend it, you're probably going to announce most of these projects in the next 12 months or so. But yes, I think that's fair. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay, that's very helpful. And Terry, expanding on your ethane commentary and John's optimization question, the roughly $0.05 spread in outlook for '15 and '16 seems much more sober than I think what you all were talking about just last quarter. I don't know if Sheridan wants to respond to this more, but while delays in downstream projects like isomer are, obviously, having a near-term impact, what exactly are the catalyst you're seeing out 1 to 2 years that are making it a little more sober? Terry K. Spencer: Well, certainly, I just at a high-level, what I can tell you is supply. Growth continues to be very strong and it's coming actually from a lot of different areas like the Eagle Ford and the Marcellus. And of course, in our core areas, the supply continues to grow. So I can -- I'll let Sheridan provide you, perhaps a bit more color, at least his thoughts on that. Sheridan C. Swords: Well, the other thing is, you have as is within '15, '16, you get in the end of '16 '17s, when the new big crackers come online. So you're kind of in this -- we think you're kind of in the situation you are today through those next 2 months -- next 2 years. Obviously, guys have heard some other plants that have been down longer than anticipated for both planned and unplanned outages have built ethane inventories higher than we anticipated at this time, and we think that's going to have a little bit of a drag into the next 2 years. Terry K. Spencer: I think, its correct too, the other comments that I'll make is, there's been a lot of talk about ethane export facilities. And so, that the timing associated with those is not immediate. So they're still a year plus away. I think the other thing that you have working against you is the view, maybe that natural gas prices are going to stay fairly weak over this time frame, as well. So that will have a -- that will kind of have a drag down effect on your ethane prices. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. That makes some sense. And, Rob, I think you mentioned how the isomerization volumes were pretty good in the quarter, obviously, in the press release, there was some nice uptick in that margin. Do you see this as a seasonal optimization benefit or something that's really kind of a sustainable trend that we can see each year? Robert F. Martinovich: I mean, historically, it's you would call it seasonal, Craig. I think there is some things as far as where that supply was coming from this year versus in past years, where it's been more focused on a Mid-Continent supply, so that's where we got the benefit from that standpoint. Terry K. Spencer: Sheridan, you got anything to add? Sheridan C. Swords: Yes, we're seeing a little bit more demand this year during the, what we call the driving season in the unleaded market. That is continuing over a period of time that we haven't seen in the past. Our customers are demanding more from us out of the Mid-Continent than they have in the past. And that could continue to go forward, but we don't -- it's still a seasonal spread opportunity asset. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Fair enough. And last question, I don't know if this is just beating Bakken growth into the ground, but the implicit guidance on well-connects, I think, is like 710 in the second half versus 590 in the first half and 560 last year for the second half, if I'm doing my math right. Do you see, I mean, when you talk to your producer customers, if you're able to stay ahead of their activity, do you see this growth trend continuing without any interruption? Is there a steady-state at some point in terms of total number per quarter that we should think about? Robert F. Martinovich: Craig, I guess, certainly, we're into the period now where from a overall construction and specifically well-connects, July and August have historically been our industry's high watermarks. I mean, you're making a lot of hate now from that perspective. So those typically peak. And as you get into the fourth quarter and early in the first quarter, depending on whether, that tends to slow you down. So again, somewhere to the overall volume standpoint with the first quarter, severe weather that puts you a little bit behind where you thought, where you thought you might be. But at the end of the day, our well-connects aren't really ratable over the year because of just the seasons that we have. But overall, from a growth standpoint, again, when you, again, step-back from a growth, to support those volumes, they're going to be continued number of connects. Now obviously, as we go to the multi-well pads, you're laying one well in and as Terry said, as those number of wells per spacing unit continue to increase, you're going to benefit from that. But at the end of the day, the number of wells ultimately, that you're able to handle is going to continue to grow because that's supporting this ultimate volume growth that you're seeing from third parties that's just continuing to ramp up to the right pretty strong. Operator : We'll take our next question from Helen Ryoo with Barclays. Heejung Ryoo - Barclays Capital, Research Division : A couple of questions. Starting with the new Bakken project. It looks like the cost is like 80% of the plant is 80% higher than the Knox plant, although the related infrastructure cost is pretty much consistent and just wondering the higher construction cost for the plant, does this reflect maybe cost inflation in that area? And then as a follow-up to that is, if it's more expensive to build a G&P system up in Bakken versus other region, are midstream operators in general, able to charge more to compensate for the sort of the high-cost up there? Terry K. Spencer: Helen, I'm going to let Wesley Christensen answer that question. Wesley John Christensen : We have seen some upward pressure for cost for building plants and infrastructure in the Bakken area. It's primarily related to labor cost, that's have escalated in the area. As far as it goes with the equipment and supply associated with it, we're not seeing upward pressure as much on that, but we are seeing some scheduled impacts. Robert F. Martinovich: And then, Helen, from a standpoint of margins, I mean, margins in the Bakken are stronger than the Mid-Continent. I don't want to say that, that's necessarily the reason for the cost that you charge more, but I mean, historically, they have been stronger. Terry K. Spencer: I guess, one thing I'll add to this, Wes, you could add to it if you don't hear -- if you don't agree with what I'm saying. If you look at a plant, you build a 200 million a day plant in the Bakken versus a 200 million a day plant in Oklahoma, those are not the same plants, okay? The processing plant in the Bakken is designed to operate in extremely hostile conditions. And so, a lot of measures have to be taken in the design of that plant, okay? So I mean, that's a factor in the difference of some of these costs. And, of course, the richness of the gas is hugely significant in the design of these plants. It's basically, the NGL content sets the size of many of these towers that are used in the processing and facilities, so -- and the size of liquid pumps and what have you. Whether it's getting near to that. Wesley John Christensen : That's true, Terry, that's true. And they're also -- there is additional infrastructure related to stabilizers and handling the inlet condensate because of the richness as well. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, it appears that does conclude today's question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference over back to Mr. Eureste, for closing remarks. T.D. Eureste: Thanks for joining us. Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October and extends until earnings are released after market closes on November 4, followed by a conference call on November 5. We'll provide details in the conference call at a later date. I'll be available throughout the day to answer your follow-up questions. Thank you for joining us and have a great day. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today's conference. We do thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect. Have a great rest of your day.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to your host, Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners third quarter 2014 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, T.D. Good morning, and thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Rob Martinovich, our Executive Vice President, Commercial; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; and Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer. Also with us and available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. On this morning's call, Derek will start with a review of our financial results. Rob will review our operating results, including sequential quarter variances, give a brief NGL market update and touch on the drilling economics in the basins we operate. Wes will give an update on our capital growth projects. And finally, I'll elaborate on last week's announced acquisition of the West Texas LPG and Mesquite NGL pipelines from Chevron, and I'll have a few closing remarks. During our previous conference calls, we have shared our plans and progress for growing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. While execution of these plans has not been without challenges, we have and will continue to execute on our key growth strategies and create value for our shareholders, unitholders and stakeholders. So in the midst of weaker commodity prices and other market uncertainties, it is important to provide some perspective on how we will approach the future by acknowledging our actions and successes of the past. As we begin our call this morning, I'd like to touch on some of our accomplishments. ONEOK Partners' 2014 adjusted EBITDA exceeded $1.14 billion in only 9 months, which is the quickest the partnership has exceeded $1 billion in its history. And we are on track to grow our distributable cash flow in 2014 by over 20% since 2013. At ONEOK, we are clearly benefiting from this growth. We completed approximately $4.7 billion in capital investments since 2010 and expect to exceed $5 billion with the completion of the MB-3 fractionator by the end of the year. Including these capital investments, we will have invested nearly $7 billion when combined with our $2 billion capital growth program we completed between 2006 and 2009. And we have entered into yet another incredible capital growth phase of the partnership with the backlog of unannounced projects of between $4 billion and $5 billion. These completed projects are providing predominantly fee-based earnings and have contributed to record volume growth in the gathering and processing segment. The natural gas liquids segment has seen strong sequential volume growth despite increased ethane rejection and the recent announcement of the West Texas LPG pipeline and the Mesquite NGL pipeline, which will establish the partnership as a significant, fully integrated natural gas liquids service provider in the Permian Basin generating additional fee-based earnings and increasing the segment's gathered NGL volumes nearly 40%. While NGL location price differentials remain narrow in this lower commodity price environment, let's not lose sight of the fact that the assets we built and are building and acquired increased our ability to add volumes to our systems, natural gas and natural gas liquids, and collect the fee together, process, fractionate, store and transport these commodities for producers, processors and customers. These services provide us and our customers and investors with sustainable long-term value regardless of location price differentials and commodity prices. Our integrated and extensive network of midstream assets in key basins, combined with our strong liquidity at ONEOK Partners, leaves us well positioned for the future. As we outlined in the earnings release last night, we revised our 2014 guidance at ONEOK Partners due mainly to the noncash impairment charge in the natural gas gathering and processing segment and continued narrow Conway-to-Mont Belvieu ethane differentials. We also narrowed ONEOK's financial guidance ranges. We'll provide more color later in the call. Please reference the releases for the updated ranges and midpoints. To conclude my opening remarks, we remain confident in the partnership's estimated annual distribution increase of 6% to 8% between 2013 and 2016, and we continue to expect EBITDA to increase by an average of 15% to 20% annually between 2015 and 2016. The distribution growth, driven by the ongoing capital program at ONEOK Partners, will continue to benefit ONEOK. While our current ONEOK dividend growth rate guidance remains at 10% in 2015 and 2016, we continue to look for opportunities to support a higher dividend growth rate. At our upcoming investor conference on December 3, as is our normal practice, we will provide updated financial guidance that will include 2016 and 2017, as well as 2015 at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Derek will now review ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' financial highlights. Derek? Derek S. Reiners: Thank you, Terry, and good morning. Third quarter 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $65 million or $0.31 per diluted share, which includes a noncash impairment charge of $76.4 million or $0.09 per diluted share attributable to ONEOK in the gathering and processing segment of ONEOK Partners. I will discuss the impairment charge of the partnership in a few moments. ONEOK is benefiting from its pure-play general partnership strategy receiving $443 million in distributions from ONEOK Partners in the 9 months of 2014, a 12% increase from the same period last year. Cash flow available for dividends for the first 9 months was $478 million, providing 1.33x coverage of the ONEOK dividend. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend for the third quarter of 2014 by $0.015 per share to $0.59 per share, 55% higher than a year ago. Now moving on to ONEOK Partners. ONEOK Partners' third quarter net income was approximately $167 million or $0.32 per unit, which includes a noncash impairment charge of $76 million or $0.31 per unit in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the third quarter 2013, net income attributable the ONEOK Partners was $216 million or $0.64 per unit. In the second quarter 2013, the noncash impairment charge, which is included in equity earnings from investments resulted from the partnership's 49% equity investment in Big Horn gas gathering, a natural gas gathering system located in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin in Wyoming, where dry natural gas volumes continue to decline. Distributable cash flow was $293 million for the third quarter providing coverage of 1.05x. For the first 9 months of 2014, distributable cash flow was $863 million, providing 1.11x coverage compared with $704 million for the same period last year, providing coverage of 1.04x. Our long-term annual coverage ratio target remains at 1.05x to 1.15x. The partnership's third quarter 2014 distribution increased to $0.775 per unit, an increase of approximately 7% from our third quarter 2013 distribution of $0.725 per unit. During the quarter, we issued 1.4 million common units through our aftermarket equity program for a total of 4.4 million common units in the first 9 months of 2014 compared with 681 common units issued all of last year through the program. We have ample liquidity to support the partnership's ongoing capital growth program and the recently announced acquisition, including access to nearly $1.7 billion in our commercial paper program or under our credit facility as of September 30. At the end of the third quarter, the partnership had $54 million in cash and cash equivalents, no commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility, a long-term debt-to-capitalization ratio of 51% and a debt-to-adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.4x. Our current capital structure metrics are in line with our long-term targets of 50-50 capitalization, and debt-to-EBITDA ratio of less than 4x. As we've done previously, we expect to utilize our commercial paper program and cash on hand to initially finance our capital investments, and we'll be disciplined and balanced in our approach to obtaining permanent financing as opportunities arise in the debt or equity markets. Rob, that concludes my remarks. Robert F. Martinovich: Thank you, Derek. Starting at ONEOK Partners, the natural gas gathering and processing segment's third quarter 2014 operating income was up 42%, compared with the third quarter 2013, due primarily to higher natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford Shale as a result of recently completed capital growth projects. From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income for the third quarter 2014 compared with the second quarter 2014 was up 25% due to a $21 million increase, due primarily to natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and Cana-Woodford Shale and a $4 million increase due to changes in contract mix, offset partially by a $3 million decrease in lower net realized prices and a $5 million increase in operating cost, primarily due to timing of materials and supplies. Volumes increased sequentially quarter-over-quarter. Natural gas gathered increased 12% and natural gas processed increased 15%. We have continued to see a significant ramp-up in natural gas volumes across our system, and we expect to see the strong growth continue through remainder of the year and into 2015, especially in the Williston Basin as improved producer drilling and recovery techniques have resulted in increased natural gas volumes from new wells with Garden Creek II operating at full capacity and Garden Creek III volumes ramping up. We have updated our hedging tables in the release. We expect to execute on more natural gas and natural gas liquids hedges for 2015 during the winter heating season. As always, we will continue to monitor the market and execute hedges when opportunities are presented. The natural gas liquids segment's third quarter 2014 operating income was up 19% compared with the third quarter 2013 due to higher margin volumes delivered to the Bakken NGL Pipeline and from new plants connected in the Mid-Continent region. From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income was up 9% due to a $25 million increase in fee-based exchange service margins, which resulted primarily from higher margin volumes delivered to the Bakken NGL Pipeline. A $13 million increase in optimization and marketing margins, which resulted from a more than $6 million increase from marketing, truck and rail activities, and $6 million from wider NGL product price differentials, partially offset by a $13 million decrease from narrower, normal butane to isobutane product price differentials. A $5 million decrease from lower NGL volumes as a result of increased ethane rejection and a $4 million decrease from lower operational measurement gains. Our Bakken NGL Pipeline is now gathering nearly 60,000 barrels per day and almost 50% increase from the previous update in the second quarter. We expect to see higher margin fee-based volume continue to increase with our Garden Creek III plant coming online 3 months early for the remainder of the year and through 2015. The recently completed Bakken NGL Pipeline expansion gives us additional capacity to transport up to 135,000 barrels per day. The natural gas pipeline segment's third quarter 2014 operating income was up 3% compared with the third quarter 2013 due to higher natural gas transportation revenues related to increased rates on intrastate pipelines, higher contracted capacity and higher natural gas volumes transported. From a sequential quarter comparison, operating income and equity earnings was relatively flat. Now brief outlook on the NGL markets. The ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our NGL system is approximately 150,000 barrels per day. We expect ethane rejection will continue at least through 2016 after which, new ethylene production capacity is forecasted to begin coming online. Ethane exports will also have an impact on ethane rejection levels. Current ethane demand is approximately 1.1 million barrels per day and is expected to increase to approximately 1.2 million barrels per day during the first quarter of 2015 due to decreased ethylene facility downtime. In recent weeks, we have seen Conway-to-Mont Belvieu location price differentials for ethane under $0.03 per gallon in favor of Mont Belvieu, and we expect these narrow differentials to continue for the rest of this year and during 2015. Propane exports are steady, and we are seeing more propane buying in Conway for crop drying and winter demand. As a result, we expect propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu to be in the minus $0.03 per gallon to plus $0.02 per gallon range for the remainder of 2014. While we recognize the continued near-term challenges regarding excess ethane supply, the partnership remains well positioned through its integrated network of assets in the NGL-rich basins to provide essential services to its customers for the long term. We expect the lower commodity price environment to continue through 2015, which will impact our net realized prices for natural gas, NGLs and condensate. However, we do not anticipate that the lower commodity prices will result in reduced drilling activity in the basins in which we operate. In our view, drilling continues to be economical in the basins where we operate at West Texas Intermediate crude oil prices of approximately $45 to $60 a barrel in the Bakken, $50 to $65 a barrel in Powder River and $60 to $70 a barrel in the SCOOP. In addition, the key noncommodity price variables that impact drilling economics, including well productivity and well cost, should also be factored into the breakeven analysis. That concludes my comments. Wes? Wesley John Christensen : Thank you, Rob. A quick update on our announced capital growth program. We have revised our capital growth for 2014 to $1.7 billion from $2.1 billion. This change is a result of the timing of expenditures and has no impact on the projected capital growth, project cost or scheduled completion dates. As mentioned in last week's announcement, the Garden Creek III natural gas processing plant was completed in October, 3 months ahead of schedule and on budget. We were able to utilize construction synergies with Garden Creek II to complete the facility ahead of schedule. The expansion of Bakken NGL Pipeline was completed in September and increased the pipeline's capacity to 135,000 barrels per day from 60,000 barrels per day, and the Niobrara NGL level connecting ONEOK Partners' Sage Creek natural gas processing facility to the Bakken NGL Pipeline was also completed in September. The MB-3 fractionator is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2014. I would like to point out we increased capital expenditures on Sterling III Pipeline and the reconfiguration of Sterling I and Sterling II Pipelines to approximately $800 million from $767 million due to higher inspection costs during winter construction and post-commissioning activities. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, Wes. Let's discuss the strategic acquisition we announced last week, which substantially increased our operating presence in the Permian as we already have a significant position with our natural gas pipeline segment's ownership of the West Texas transmission intrastate natural gas pipeline system. With the acquisition of the West Texas LPG pipeline and the Mesquite NGL pipeline, the partnership's presence in the Permian Basin will be significantly stronger, and this acquisition will establish a new region for natural gas liquids growth. These assets will give us access to a major new NGL supply basin and increases our gathered NGL volumes by nearly 40%, pushing our total systemwide NGL gathered volumes to approximate 800,000 barrels per day. Our expectation is to significantly grow these assets and enhance their service capability and flexibility. Our current plans call for investing approximately $500 million between 2015 and 2019 with even more potential projects to come. ONEOK Partners expects to generate an adjusted EBITDA multiple of 6x to 8x between 2017 and 2020 through enhanced customer services and volume increases from pipeline capacity expansions. I should further emphasize that potential margins realized downstream from fee-based fractionation and storage services at our Mont Belvieu facilities could further enhance these multiples. Our extensive NGL operating experience and the valuable knowledge of the approximately 75 soon-to-be-new employees joining us from Chevron will enable us to realize and maximize the true potential of these assets. We'd like to welcome these employees to the ONEOK team. From a commercial standpoint, we have positive, long-term relationships with the customers served by these assets. Many are our current customers in other basins where we operate. Our existing NGL asset position in Mont Belvieu provides us the ability to offer these customers enhanced services, including fractionation and storage and opportunity that wasn't available to them under the previous ownership. Although we intend to provide more detail on the call regarding our NGL growth plans in the Permian, we will be limited in certain of our discussions due to the existence of a confidentiality agreement and for the competitive nature of information relating to rate structures and strategies. Our current and future growth with the partnership has never looked stronger. We have completed approximately $2 billion in capital growth projects this year and expect to add $550 million to the complete list with the completion of the MB-3 fractionator later in the fourth quarter so that the partnership will have the full benefit of these completed projects in 2015. The partnership's growth is not slowing. $2.5 billion in capital investments have been announced in 2014, including our recent acquisition. Additionally, as I mentioned earlier, we increased our unannounced backlog range to $4 billion to $5 billion from the previous range of $3 billion to $4 billion in yesterday's earnings release. Earlier this year, our unannounced backlog was $2 billion to $3 billion. Our internal capital growth program continues to provide solid visibility into future earnings growth, with assets that are well positioned in multiple producing formation, high-growth, liquids rich areas, such as the Williston Basin, Powder River Basin, Cana-Woodford, Stack and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma and the Permian Basin. We continue to remain focused on our strategy to meet our customers' infrastructure needs quickly and cost-effectively. To put this year in perspective, our 2014 versus 2013 year-over-year distributable cash flow growth rate is over 20% even with ethane rejection and narrow location price differentials. Despite the ethane-related headwinds we've been facing this year, this has been a strong year of the partnership, and we are very excited for the future. We expect to continue to deliver solid returns to our unitholders and shareholders through volume growth and, predominantly, fee-based earnings. ONEOK, as a pure-play general partner, continues to provide the management and resources the ONEOK Partners to execute on these growth strategies so that the partnership can increase its distributions to unitholders, including ONEOK, enabling ONEOK to maximize its dividend payout to shareholders. In closing, I'd like to again thank our employees whose dedication and commitment allow us to operate our assets safely, reliably and environmentally responsibly every day and create exceptional value for investors and customers. Our entire management team appreciates their efforts to make our company successful. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll take our first question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Just on clarification on the acquisition. In yesterday's release, you say you expect the asset to eventually generate 60x, which you reiterated on the call. If I take the $800 million purchase price and the $500 million of subsequent CapEx to get to the $1.3 billion and tack on a 7x multiple, I get $185 million of EBITDA, which my common sense tells me I'm interpreting this incorrectly. So if I were to take into consideration your acquisition press release, where you say you expect to double the current EBITDA of, I'm estimating, $32 million, that's net to you guys, is that what the $500 million of CapEx will get you to? And you're expecting to spend probably a considerable amount in fractionation, processing, distribution, all things related downstream to get you to that all in 6x to 8x number by 2017, 2020? Is that -- am I thinking about that correctly? Terry K. Spencer: You are partially, okay? So let me try this, and here's the piece that you're missing. When we look at the growth opportunities associated with this business or with this pipeline asset, it's going to come from primarily 3 things. We've got an existing base business that's going to have some inherent growth that is volumes behind existing plants, and new plants are going to increase as drilling continues in the Permian. Considerable portion of that volume growth does not have much capital associated with it, okay? You've got another bucket of enhanced services, and I can go into some detail about that, but basically providing more flexibility, more delivery capability and, in particular, across regions providing some packaging opportunities across regions for these customers. We expect to generate enhanced revenues from that. There's not a whole lot of capital that goes with that bucket, okay? So then that leaves you with the system expansions, where we are planning to build and construct pipeline facilities to handle new volumes, incremental volumes for shippers that need to -- that need the increased capacity. That will come at a very low multiple, okay? So when you add all these up and you look at the final result, you come to a total 6x to 8x multiple on a roughly $1.3 billion capital that's going to be spent, okay? That means, so your multiple on that -- on the total incremental revenue that's being generated here looks very, very low. And it is very low because you have a lot of revenue coming that's not going to require capital investment. I hope that helps. Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Yes, that was very helpful. Can you give us a -- yes? Terry K. Spencer: The last one I'm going to make is that in these numbers, there's no downstream revenue coming from fractionation and storage services, okay? Just to make that clear. That will be additive and can help that 6x to 8x multiple go even lower. Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division : I see. Okay. That's very helpful. Can you give us a ballpark estimate on maybe a percentage of the barrels that's already going to your downstream assets tied to the volumes from the acquisition? And how much is potentially \"up for grabs\" at some point I'd like to see contracts roll off? Also, if you could provide average length in terms of contract. That would be helpful, too. Terry K. Spencer: So I'll handle this at a high level. And what I can tell you is there's basically no volume from the system that's coming to our fractionators, okay? Very -- actually, 0, okay? So it's all up there for grabs. We don't know though what the contractual terms are from a fractionation standpoint. Certainly, by owning this pipeline asset, we're now in a position to compete for that business. And certainly, I think it'd be impractical to think we could get all of it. I'm going to say we have a good chance to get a substantial portion to that volume in our fracs, okay? Christine Cho - Barclays Capital, Research Division : Okay. Great, that's very helpful. And then I think in the past, there has been talks about potentially converting the West Texas pipe to crude service. Is -- was this on the table for you guys at all? Or do the customer contracts on the pipe prohibit you from abandoning NGL takeaway service? Or do you see the value in keeping NGL service due to all of the other opportunities that bring to the table for you guys? Is it more valuable in keeping an NGL service versus if you were to convert it and just collect the toll on crude service? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Christine, today, it certainly has more value as an NGL pipeline. However, in this day and time, you better be thinking about repurposing, okay? So it should always be in the back of your mind, is there a better application for this pipeline assets considering how valuable they are these days in the midstream space. So well, I couldn't rule that crude for a portion of the pipeline system. It is certainly something we have to be thinking about, and we do think about. But right now, we intend to operate this pipeline system as an NGL facility, primarily because of those integration and downstream opportunities. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll hear from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: Terry, appreciate all the color on the Permian. Maybe just came off Christine's question, though. Just trying to get a better sense, I guess, perhaps as you look at the 3 different buckets. Perhaps a bit of the ramp profile of how ultimately the 40 becomes 80 becomes 175 plus. And I ask in a sense that if the $500 million is primarily system expansions and there is ability to increase revenue and EBITDA without the expansion of capital, is that something that could potentially come in the earlier years? Or is it basically a leverage effect on the extra volume from the system expansions? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Carl, what I'll tell you is, yes, we do see a potential by the time we get to 2017, of course, to have a substantial increase in EBITDA along the lines of what we initially indicated. But particularly, as you -- as we make these capital investments, which began in the 2017 time frame and moved through the 2019 time frame, we're going to see significant ramp-up in EBITDA during that period. So basically, what -- how this will look is your -- without including any downstream frac or storage synergies, your multiple is going to look about like this. In that 2017 time frame, you'll get to that 8 multiple range. And then as you move through that 2019 time frame, you'll drop to that 7 range and then move into about 2020 into that 6 range. Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: That's very helpful. And then maybe just sort of last question off that. Of the $500 million, is that coming from pumping expansion? Or I guess, I'm trying to kind of get a better sense of is this something where you guys are looking at the drilling and the, ultimately, the volume needs and so you go ahead and effect you, you prebuild in order to handle that capacity? Or is the $500 million something that will be associated, for instance, with new incremental contracts as a gating factor, if you will? Terry K. Spencer: Well I think the last part of your question, the answer to that is yes, but I'm going to let Sheridan Swords take that question. Sheridan C. Swords: I think on your first part of the question, yes, we see the expansion of the pipeline will be predominantly looping of sections of the pipeline to increase its capacity, which we'll -- also we'll have to increase our pumping capacity as well. But as Terry said, we anticipate through our integrated services that we'll be contracting under long-term contracts with customers for our expanded capacity through the products. Terry K. Spencer: Did that help you, Carl? Carl L. Kirst - BMO Capital Markets U.S.: And then maybe one last question if I can, for Rob just because you were talking about the view of the NGL markets and then ethane rejection at least through 2016. And perhaps my nuance in the question is in understanding that you all will give perhaps, roll your guidance through to 2017 in December. I didn't know if the ethane rejection of that comment through 2016 was just a -- we weren't ready to look out beyond 2016. Or if that was actually a sort of a call where you expect perhaps a positive ethane frac spread in 2017? Robert F. Martinovich: Carl, I guess, from our standpoint, what we're tying that onto is, obviously, the beginning of those crackers coming on online in that '17 time frame. And I think, as we've said before, it's going to be lumpy as those come on and as ethane supply/demand start to balance out along with the ethane export. So our -- really, our view hasn't changed per se from that, and so that's really where we've kind of focused on. Operator : Moving on, next, we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: I've got to tell you the additional color on that Permian acquisition now sounds extremely attractive. Terry K. Spencer: Yes, we think so. We're glad we got it. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: A couple ones here. Rob, can you discuss the contract changes that increased the G&P contributions sequentially? And also, it looks like 2015 NGL hedges didn't change from 2Q guidance, but the percent hedged fell. Is that a reflection of moderating ethane rejection expectation into next year or increased propane plus volumes versus prior assumptions? Robert F. Martinovich: Yes, increased propane plus, well I'm through your second question. With regards to the first question, could you repeat that real quick? On -- your first part was... Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Changes in G&P contracts. Robert F. Martinovich: Yes, that was in the Williston Basin, Craig, where we had some more fee-based business come on online between the second and third quarter. That was predominantly the full amount. Craig Shere - Tuohy Brothers Investment Research, Inc.: Okay. And so that being fee-based, and you think that's more sustainable and growing? Robert F. Martinovich: We do. It is. It's -- that particular volumes coming from our Divide County system, and so as those volumes continue to ramp up and then sustain, we'll be able to maintain that benefit. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : This is Corey filling in for Chris. Just a quick question on the gathering and processing revised volume guidance. It looks as though you're expecting a pretty flat run rate sequentially, but a pretty good step-up in terms of op income. Just wondering if you can kind of reconcile that for us and how should we think about that going forward? Robert F. Martinovich: Sure. And certainly, you can get in there and look at the -- do your own calculations kind of for our fourth quarter average and come up -- you'll see volumes are up a tick overall in the fourth quarter over third quarter. But the -- it depends on where those volumes are coming from. So we're seeing a little bit more of an increase in the Williston Basin volumes and, as a result, higher margin per unit there is leading to that increase in income. Corey Goldman - Jefferies LLC, Research Division : Got it. That's helpful. And then one really quick one, if I can follow up. That asset sale you're expecting to book a $16 million gain on the pipelines, can you talk about how big that total sales size is and what type of assets you're selling there? Robert F. Martinovich: What we're doing, it's really 2-part. We've got some nonstrategic pad gas that we're selling, so pretty low basis there. And then we've also got a small nonstrategic piece of pipe that, again, is from the sales to value is not much more than what we're showing there. So in total, it's not like you've got a 5x of sales value going on to get that gain. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Moving on, we'll go to John Edwards with Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : I'm just curious if you could just talk a little bit about in terms of the inventory of project backlog. It's obviously risen quite a bit this year. I mean, in light of the sort of volatile commodity price environment, do you think it would've been -- it would be even higher? Or maybe you could talk a little bit about that? And then my other question is what was the impact on the narrowing price differential Conway-Belvieu on the quarter and perhaps on the guidance, if you could talk about those things? Terry K. Spencer: Well, John, so as we look at the backlog, okay, and I think we've provided this -- some of this color before, we look at the breakdown of that $4 billion to $5 billion backlog. Roughly 2/3 of it actually is going to be coming from the NGL segment. The rest of it coming from gathering and processing and the natural gas pipes. And, of course, much of that -- most of that NGL business is all fee-based, okay? So as I think from a broad perspective of the inflow of projects into that $4.5 billion backlog, and as we think about the $4.5 billion backlog itself, right now, we're seeing no indications and no impact on this lower commodity price environment on those plants, okay? We're seeing none, okay? So that's all still intact and still looks really good. Your second question's on the op -- did that help you? John D. Edwards - Cr\u00e9dit Suisse AG, Research Division : Yes, that's really helpful. Terry K. Spencer: Okay, your second question on the optimization margins. It's -- when you look at the impact relative to what we guided to for the NGL segment, you have to note that ethane spreads have gone from about $0.07 a gallon in our guidance. So we actually experienced ethane spread to $0.025, $0.03, okay, for the quarter. So the impacts of the quarter relative to the quarter we guided for the NGL segments, is about -- that delta was a negative $14 million or $15 million roughly, okay? So it's pretty significant impact or pretty significant hole we have to come out off in order to have a pretty good quarter. And that's an indication of the strength of the volume growth that we're seeing in not just the NGL business, but the gathering and processing business as well. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division : First question is on the volume on West Texas LPG. If, hypothetically, you were able to get a significant amount of volumes to your own fracs, would you need to construct another frac? Terry K. Spencer: We would be able to handle some of that volume in capacity from these new fracs that have been built and that are in the process of being built. For a period of time, there'll be a substantial portion of that we could handle. But then as those volumes in those fracs continue to ramp up, we would likely have to build more frac capacity. In theory, if we -- let's say we contracted all of it, certainly, we would have to build more frac capacity. And some of that incidentally is in our backlog of future growth -- unannounced backlog of future growth. [indiscernible]? Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division : Yes, that answers it. And then on the SCOOP system that comes with that, it looks like that really doesn't really generate much EBITDA right now. Can you talk about what you see in that asset? What potentially it could do for you? Terry K. Spencer: Yes, well, I mean, the first thing I could -- would tell you that's integral to the operation to that business, but I'm going to let Sheridan provide you a little more color on your question. Sheridan C. Swords: Becca, basically, the Mesquite pipeline's capacity is leased to the partnership, to West Texas pipeline's capacity. So it collects, say, a small lease fee from the partnership, but it is integral to the whole operation of that. If you take Mesquite away, you would drop your throughput by quite a bit. Does that answer your question? Rebecca Followill - U.S. Capital Advisors LLC, Research Division : Yes. Operator : And next, we'll go to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Just 2 more questions on the acquisition. One, just to clarify, so currently, is -- or I guess, post the closing of the deal, would you guys be a shipper on the line or is it all third-party shippers on that line? And then when you think about expanding the capacity, would you contemplate, for example, your marketing business taking some of that capacity? Terry K. Spencer: Great question, Michael. And because it's such a great question, I'm going to pitch a great answer from Sheridan Swords. Sheridan C. Swords: Michael, currently, we do ship on this pipeline. It's not currently tied into our frac, but it is tied into Mont Belvieu fracs. But we ship out small amount, less than 10,000 barrels a day on that pipeline into our fracs. As we go forward and we're looking to the moving more volume on that, we do anticipate that our marketing affiliate will move barrels on that, especially as we offer the bundled service integration services of both transportation and fractionation and storage. That will be done through the marketing piece. Michael J. Blum - Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Research Division : Okay. And then second question is, to get to that 6 to 8 multiple, is it strictly -- are we strictly talking about expansions and increased volumes? Or you're also assuming an increase in the tariff? Sheridan C. Swords: We do anticipate there'll be increased volumes on that piece. As we start talking about tariffs and rates, due to some existing confidentiality agreements and just think of the competitive nature of that question, we really can't dive into the rate structures at this time. Operator : And our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : Terry, I want to go back to some of the comments you had at the beginning of the call. And I think you're talking about opportunities that could increase the 10% growth at OKE, and I was wondering if you might be willing to share some more color on the topic in general, and if that might involve lower-than-expected taxes now that the spinoff of OGS has been completed sometime. I don't know if you have better color onto what that can look like. Terry K. Spencer: Well, certainly, Jeremy, I'd make a couple of comments and Derek can follow up. But yes, we do see potentially an opportunity to increase the dividend growth rate at OKE. You've got to understand, we're spending a lot of capital at OKS and certainly, that could equate to more IDR opportunity for OKE. So certainly, we'll look at that. This pure-play structure that we have in place really sets the tone and does put us in a position to maximize the cash flow to the shareholders. So certainly, as we go forward, we're going to look at that. And Derek, you got anything to add? Derek S. Reiners: Well I think that's exactly right. It'll be driven primarily from OKS as OKS grows, and that will also grow distributions, particularly the IDRs at OKE. It will also provide additional depreciation deductions at OKE. So those 2 things in concert could provide some upside opportunity there. Terry K. Spencer: And Jeremy, from a tax perspective, certainly, if we get some good news on bonus depreciation, for example, that could help us further increase the dividend. And you know how the process works. Our Board of Directors determines our dividend policy, and we sit down and we look at all of these factors and make that determination. And our expectations by the time we get to the December 3 Investor Day, if we have anything new to share with you at that point in time, which I suspect we will about our business in total, we will share our dividend outlook, particularly the dividend growth outlook for OKE with you. Jeremy B. Tonet - JP Morgan Chase & Co, Research Division : That all makes sense. That was all very helpful. Just one last one for me. I was wondering, as far as the M&A market is concerned, are you guys still active in looking at other incremental bolt-ons as well that potentially could expand the platform or kind of full with this [indiscernible]? Terry K. Spencer: Yes, we're looking at both, Jeremy. We're looking at asset, bolt-on projects across the midstream space. Certainly, as we said before, not all of them make any sense at all and some of them are so small in scale they don't -- won't move the needle. But we are looking at those on the M&A front. It's -- there's a lot of chat around in the marketplace right now. A lot of people are thinking about consolidation. A lot of people looking at their structure. However, as we kind of sit today, the weakening in the equities markets I'm sure has got some folks, who are considering M&A opportunities, kind of perhaps pausing a bit and thinking hard about their strategies. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : Maybe can you just talk a little bit more about, is there a broader strategy in the Permian here after the acquisition? Is this a precursor to investments in gathering, processing or even storage? Just talk about a broader Permian strategy, if there is one? Terry K. Spencer: Sure, Ted, there definitely is. I mean, we -- certainly with that NGL position, it could create great synergies with upstream gathering and processing assets. So yes, to the extent that there are gathering and processing opportunities and in particular, those that fit well with these assets, we're going to be very interested. However -- and here's the however part, the valuations that we're seeing for certain of these gathering and processing assets in the Permian are astronomical. And so that gives us pause, and we're not going to acquire gathering and processing assets at the expense of economic discipline, okay? We're just not going to do that. I think another opportunity for us is crude. We have not only the 2,600 miles of the NGL pipelines we just acquired, but we've got hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of miles of natural gas pipelines, too, that potentially could have some other purposes, in particular, for crude. So that strategy is as a result of these assets and result of us having now kind of a wider footprint in the Permian is really going to have us looking hard at crude opportunities. Theodore Durbin - Goldman Sachs Group Inc., Research Division : That's very helpful. Maybe if we can just come to the Bakken here. I feel like we haven't talked about that much on this call, but as you've seen the regulators turning the screws on the -- the [indiscernible] are up there to hit flaring targets, can you just give us a sense of what the outlook is for the number of new processing plants we're going to need as you look at your supply curves went up for the next few years? Terry K. Spencer: Well, Ted, the short answer is we're going to need a lot more, a lot more than we have today. We have in the works enough plants to get us up to 1.2 Bcf a day. And the analysts are indicating gas production could be easily 2 Bcf a day or more. What that tells me, we need more processing plants. We've got about a 50% -- as we sit today, about a 50% market share up there, so I would expect a lot of those plants to come right underneath and right well within our footprint. So -- and we have some of that in, of course, our unannounced backlog -- and some in our unannounced backlog, okay? So yes, we see a lot of runway there and visibility into a lot more growth. Operator : Next we'll go to Eric Genco with Citi. Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : I just had a quick question, maybe a clarification. I think you said earlier on the Permian acquisition that you're looking at sort of returns in the 27 time frame -- 2017 time frame of 8x; 2019, 7x. And I think you said that the bulk of the $500 million of incremental capital will be spent 2017 to 2020? But I just want to make sure I understood better. Is basically -- associated with those numbers, are you saying that -- what sort of the gross cash invested at those times? Terry K. Spencer: You'll see -- of the $500 million, you'll see -- the $500 million, you'll see $200 million to $300 million spent net '17 to '19 time frame. And the balance of it spent earlier prior to 2017, okay? So that's kind of how the shape of the CapEx spend will look. Eric C. Genco - Citigroup Inc, Research Division : Okay. And then, I guess, just trying to understand and maybe just a point of clarification, you mentioned -- you talked about the impact of ethane rejection in the quarter. And then you mentioned sort of demand likely going up next quarter as certain plants maybe come back online. How do you really -- I mean, from a GPM perspective, I mean, how do you think about things kind of over the next year and evolving? We're still in ethane rejection, but should we think about this as being maybe one of the worst quarters for ethane rejection? Should it get a little better gradually? And how do you think about that as you figure -- the Williston Basin is a greater share of the volumes and it's richer gas. So I'm just trying to think about those dynamics. Terry K. Spencer: That's kind of a mouthful in terms of question, but what I'll tell you is that I'll try to give you the kind of condensed answer. And that is, throughout 2015, we expect prices to stay relatively low. You'll see ethane prices at Belvieu probably in that low $0.20 a gallon range. So fundamentally, we're still going to be oversupplied, we're still going to reject ethane at pretty high levels. So we're going to continue to see this in the 2015 time frame, and we'll see it continue in the 2016. So we'll see this narrow spread environment. We're not going to be making a whole lot of money in terms of ethane optimization for the next 18 to 24 months. And certainly, we don't have that -- we don't -- we're not counting on it in our forward view. So ethane fundamentals, while we're seeing peak demand or strong demand of 1.2 -- 1.1 million to 1.2 million barrels per day, we're balancing the market with about 350,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection as an industry, okay? So it's all well and good, and you'll hear all these good things about the spread counts. But quite frankly, we're awash in ethane and having to reject it to balance it up. I see that -- those fundamentals continuing throughout 2015. Operator : And gentlemen, it appears there are no further questions. I'd like to turn it back to you for any additional or closing comments. T.D. Eureste: Thank you for joining us. As Terry mentioned, the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Analyst Conference is scheduled for Wednesday, December 3, in New York. An invitation was sent out in October. Please contact me if you've not received the invitation. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until earnings are released after the market closes on February 23, followed by our conference call on February 24. We'll provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And once again, that will conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.",

Carl Kirst - BMO Capital Markets Elvira Scotto - RBC Capital Markets Jeremy Tonet - J.P. Morgan Andy Gupta - HITE Hedge Operator : Good day, and welcome to the Fourth Quarter and Year End 2014 ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and year end 2014 earnings call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning, and many thanks for joining us today and for your continued interest in investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer. Also with us and available to answer your questions are Rob Martinovich, who is recently appointed Executive Vice President and Chief Administrative Officer, responsible for Human Resources, Corporate Services, and Information Technology. During his years with the company, Rob has served in a number of key leadership roles, and without exception performed at a high level. Once again, Rob will step in to provide needed leadership in another important role for our company. I along with our employees will continue to rely upon his deep industry experience and leadership in his new role. Also on the call is Wes Christensen, our Senior Vice President of Operations; Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids; and Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. On this morning's call, Derek will start with a review of our 2014 financial results, and then I will elaborate on our 2015 outlook and discuss ONEOK and ONEOK Partners revised financial guidance. Before I hand the call over to Derek, I would like to discuss ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accomplishments in 2014, and more importantly, review our 2015 outlook and financial guidance. At ONEOK Partners, our 36,000 mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline network generated record EBITDA of 1.56 billion in 2014, which is a result of completing a significant number of capital growth projects and acquisitions since 2006. Additionally, all three of our segments experienced double-digit operating income growth compared with 2013. Our most recent fourth quarter 2014 distribution declared represents a 98% increase since April 2006 when ONEOK became the sole general partner of ONEOK Partners. Since that time, our industry has experienced a wide range of market conditions, both headwinds and tailwinds. And regardless of the conditions the partnership is facing, we continue to believe it's in the partnerships and our unitholders' best interest to manage responsibly every dollar that comes in and goes out of the business. As we leave 2014, I believe the partnership with its significant platform of fee-based business in growing basins and major market areas is well positioned to weather the current uncertain commodity price environment. At ONEOK, we successfully completed the separation of our natural gas distribution assets and became a pure-play general partner and provided ONEOK Partners management and resources to execute on its growth strategies. In April 2014, the Board approved a 40% dividend increase, clearly demonstrating the benefit of becoming a pure-play general partner. We remain committed to paying out the majority of our cash in the form of dividends, but we also intend to continue making prudent financial decisions that are in the long-term interest of ONEOK and its shareholders. Derek now will review ONEOK'S and ONEOK Partners financial highlights. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thanks, Terry, and good morning. Fourth quarter 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $95 million or $0.45 per diluted share. 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately -- I'm sorry, 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK was approximately $314 million or $1.49 per diluted share, which includes a loss of $5.6 million or $0.03 per diluted share from discontinued operations. ONEOK continues to benefit from its pure-play general partnership strategy with $2633 million in distributions declared by ONEOK Partners in 2014, a 16% increase from the same period last year. Cash flow available for dividends for the fourth quarter was $142 million, providing 1.13 times coverage of the ONEOK dividend. 2014 cash flow available for dividends was $621 million providing 1.28 times coverage. ONEOK increased its quarterly 2014 dividend for the fourth quarter 2014 by $1.5 per share to $60.05 per share, 51% higher than the fourth quarter of 2013. Moving onto ONEOK Partners, fourth quarter net income attributable to ONEOK Partners was approximately $263 million or $0.67 per unit. A full year 2014 net income attributable to ONEOK Partners was $910 million or $2.33 per unit. As Terry mentioned, all three of our business segments experienced significant operating income growth in 2014 compared with 2013. Operating increased in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment by nearly 40%, benefiting from higher natural gas gathering and processing volumes. Natural Gas Liquids increased 26%, benefiting from higher margin NGL volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections, and natural gas pipelines increased 19%, benefiting from increased natural gas volumes transported. Distributable cash flow was $306 million for the fourth quarter, providing coverage of 1.06 times, and approximately $1.17 billion for the full year, an increase of 23%, providing coverage of 1.10 times. The Partnership's fourth quarter distribution increased to $0.79 per unit, an increase of approximately 8% from the fourth quarter of 2013. In the fourth quarter, approximately 3.5 million units were issued through our at-the-market equity program, generating net proceeds of $157 million. For the year, approximately 21.8 million common units were issued generating net proceeds of approximately $1.1 billion, including approximately 7.9 million units issued though the at-the-market program. The Partnership has a strong balance sheet and we're increasing our liquidity and financial flexibility, as we notified our lenders of our intent to exercise the option to increase the size of the Partnership's revolving credit facility to $2.4 billion from $1.7 billion, pending lenders' approval which we expect to finalize in the next few weeks. At the end of 2014, the Partnership had $1.1 billion of commercial paper outstanding and no borrowings outstanding on our credit facility; total debt to capitalization ratio of 54%, and a debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 3.7 times as calculated under the terms of our credit facility. As discussed in yesterday's earnings release, we significantly reduced our debt and equity financing needs in 2015 by reducing planned capital expenditures to approximately $1.2 billion from our previous estimate of $2.8 billion. Terry will provide more color in a moment, but this reduction in capital expenditure reflects slower production growth outlook by our producer customers than originally planned. We expect to continue financing our capital expenditures with debt and equity through the use of our at-the-market equity program overnight equity offerings, long and short-term debt, while targeting a 50-50 debt-to-equity capital structure over the long-term. These multiple sources of liquidity enable us to be prudent and opportunistic from a timing perspective as we look to access the equity and debt markets. We continue to remain confident in our ability to raise the necessary capital to fund the capital needs of ONEOK Partners. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. That's a good set-up to begin discussing our 2015 outlook and guidance. Our previous 2015 financial forecast and guidance was developed in November, leading into our investor conference in early December. Since then, natural gas liquids prices are lower by nearly 40%, natural gas is down 13%, and crude oil was down nearly 38%. This reduced commodity price environment has significantly impacted our producer customers' 2015 capital expenditure programs and has created less clarity into 2016 and beyond. Additionally, the lower natural gas and natural gas liquids prices have impacted the partnership. Accordingly, we have lowered our ONEOK Partners 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance approximately 14% to a range of $1.15 billion to $1.73 billion. Our updated 2015 financial guidance is based on a $0.54 per gallon NGL composite price, a $3.50 per MMBtu for natural gas, and $50 per barrel for WTI crude oil. We expect ONEOK Partners earnings to grow significantly in the second half of the year relative to the first half, due to continued volume growth in the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquid segments. A significant ramp up in natural gas gathered volumes across our systems is expected to occur, especially in the Williston Basin as we connect additional wells and complete field compression projects, and in the Mid Continent as a key Oklahoma producer drills wells in the first half of the year and completes those wells in the second half of the year. We also revised our expected partnership distribution growth rate to 3%, to 5%, or a range of $3.16 per unit to $3.22 per unit in 2015 from the previous 8% with an expected coverage ratio of 0.87 to 0.97 times in 2015. Although the partnership has slowed the expected distribution growth rate in 2015 to reflect the current market conditions, we will continue to closely monitor market conditions and our operating performance and reevaluate our distribution growth outlook each quarter. Additionally, while our prospects for volume growth continue to look favorable, due to the current uncertain commodity price environment, we will not be providing financial forecasts beyond 2015. While we continue to have a long-term view and perspective, we believe it's prudent to shorten our time horizon and communicate our financial forecast distributions and guidance only for the current year until stability returns to the commodity markets. We will discuss our longer term thoughts on volumes in a moment. Our track record of disciplined growth continues, and we are adjusting our capital spending to reflect our producer customers' needs and their reduced volume growth expectations. We've suspended our Demicks Lake, Bronco, and Knox natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin in North Dakota, Powder River Basin in Wyoming, and the Mid Continent region of Oklahoma respectively. We expect no more spending on these capital growth projects until market conditions improve. And when they do, we will quickly re-establish completion dates. As a reminder, all three of those plants were originally scheduled to be completed at the end of 2016. Our completed growth projects and our capital projects in progress will allow us to meet the current growth expectations of our producer customers in the basins where we operate, and continue to ride us with growth opportunities. In the Williston, as we outlined at our Investor Day, our producer customers are focusing their drilling in their most economic areas. In addition, December production statistics showed statewide flaring with approximately 360 million cubic feet per day, and there was an estimated 750 wells waiting on completion services. We expect 2015 Williston Basin natural gas gathered volumes to increase 39% over 2014, only 3% lower than our pervious expectation. In the Williston Basin, we have 3 million acres dedicated to us with approximately 1 million acres in Northeast McKenzie, North Dunn and Southern Williams counties, which are considered core areas for many producers in the Williston. We expect to complete our 200 million cubic feet per day, Lonesome Creek processing plant and the additional fuel compression needed to take advantage of increased processing capacity at our Stateline I and II plants and the Garden Creek I, II and III plants in the fourth quarter of 2015. This additional 300 million cubic feet per day in processing capacity is expected to help meet the flaring targets of 23% by January 1, 2015, and 15% by January 1, 2016. The Powder River Basin is a more challenged basin in this lower commodity price environment, but some of our producers are incentivized to drill to avoid losing their leases. While the Powder River Basin development is in the early stages and not currently providing significant natural gas or natural gas liquid volumes to our systems, we remain excited about the potential of this integrated opportunity. Similar to the Bakken producers in the Mid Continent are concentrating their drilling in their most economic acreage. We expect natural gas gathered volumes to be down approximately 4% in 2015 compared with our previous volume guidance with well completions weighted more heavily toward the back half of the year. Producers are concentrating drilling in the best performing areas of the Cana-Woodford, Stack, and SCOOP plays. Additionally, improved well performance and better well completion results are positively impacting producer drilling economic. Now, for our longer term thoughts on volume; in the Williston, based on dialog we are having with our producers we're expecting natural gas gathered volume growth of 27% in 2016 over 2015. For the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, we expect natural gas gathered volume growth of 16% in 2016 over 2015. Now, for a quick update on our recently acquired West Texas LPG pipeline system; while it has only been a few months since we closed the acquisition, we are making progress with our shipper customers in the development of future system expansions. As a reminder, this pipeline was essentially full when it was acquired. Based upon discussions with our shipper customers, our expectations have not changed to reach a six to eight times EBITDA multiple between 2017 and 2020. Now, a brief outlook on the NGL market; the current ethane rejection by natural gas processing plants connected to our NGL system is approximately 155,000 barrels per day. Current ethane demand is nearly 1.1 million barrels per day, and is expected to push ethane inventories lower through June. The Conway-to-Mont Belvieu location price differentials per ethane is under $0.02 per gallon in favor of Mont Belvieu, and we expect these narrow differentials to continue for the rest of this year. Propane exports are steady and we are seeing more propane buying in Conway for winter demand. As a result, we expect propane location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu to be in the minus $0.02 per gallon to plus $0.06 per gallon range for the remainder of 2015. At ONEOK, we revised our expected dividend growth rate to 4% to 8% in 2015 or $2.42 per share to $2.52 per share from the previous 14%, and slightly lowered guidance to midpoint for cash flow available for dividends to 610 million from 620 million. In these uncertain times, we believe it is prudent to retain additional cash. I'd like to briefly touch on cost reductions. Regardless of the environment we maybe operating in, we are always focused on managing our cost and operating safely and efficiently. On an ongoing basis, our employees are constantly challenging themselves to find new ways to be more efficient and reduce cost while maintaining safety, reliability, and environmental responsibility. While the current market condition creates challenges, it also presents opportunity. Recently, we have seen decreases in service rates, reduced chemical costs, lower fuel prices, reductions in third-party contractor costs and other lower service rates. Before I close, I'd like to welcome and introduce Walt Hulse. Walt, who I have known and worked with for many years, brings a tremendous amount of investment banking in the energy industry experience to our company. As Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs, he will add tremendous value as we identify and assess strategic opportunities, as well as enhance our relationships with the investor community. Walt is very familiar to the ONEOK story and has provided counsel to us on a number of strategic acquisitions. The most recent was the separation of the distribution business into ONE Gas. Walt and his family will soon be relocating to Tulsa from New Jersey. We'd like to welcome Walt to the ONEOK family. In closing, this is not the first time that our experienced management team and skilled employees have faced a challenging and uncertain market environment. We've been here before with our assets, experienced people, financial flexibility, and discipline, and our legacy of doing the right things to create value for our customers, we're confident that we'll emerge as better and stronger company continuing to delivering value to our shareholders and unitholders. And finally, I'd like to thank our many dedicated and hardworking employees for delivering on the many accomplishments achieved throughout 2014, and in particular many thanks for conducting our business in a safe, reliable, and environmentally responsible manner each and every day. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Timm Schneider. Timm Schneider : Hey, good morning. It's Timm Schneider with Evercore ISI. A quick question for you guys, and appreciate the color on some of the 2016 volumes; in terms of thinking about the integrated nature of your system, should we think of this processing volume increase as running through on the NGL side as well? What I am basically saying is does that show up NGL volumes and fractionation volumes? Terry Spencer : Tim, that's exactly the way to think about it. As we increase volumes, particularly from our gathering and processing segment, that will positively impact volumes that we fractionate and volumes that we transport through our NGL network. Timm Schneider : Okay. Can you talk a little bit about the contract structure of that? Is that mostly under the bundled contracts that you have had in the past? Terry Spencer : Yes, most of those are contracted under the NGLs that we transport out of our affiliated plants as well as third-party plants. They're fee-based contracts. They're bundled. We refer to them as exchange contracts, and in those contracts we provide the fractionation gathering and transportation services to the market, to the market hubs. Timm Schneider : Got it. Last question for me is just on with respect to coverage, obviously dominant OKS, incrementally higher on OKE, I was just wondering what the thoughts were around that that you are running negative coverage at OKS and why not, maybe get support OKS with bringing the coverage down a little bit at the OKE level? Terry Spencer : Timm, we do -- we think about those things. I mean as we think about 2015 from a coverage standpoint at OKS, we are going to be a below one or expect to be below one in the early part of the year. But as we actually move through the year, we expect the coverage to be well above the line. Okay. The reason why we are carrying a -- reported a negative coverage is that we don't think we are going to be in a below one coverage for an extended period of time. Timm Schneider : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : We will hear next from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets. Carl Kirst : Thank you and good morning, everybody. I think Terry, you actually hit kind of on the question that I was going to get to and I think you perhaps answered it and so -- but I guess as you look at sort of philosophically longer term if headwinds were to continue, the tension between resetting distributions, running sort of sub one times coverage versus perhaps using OKE and IDR waivers, should we basically just think of it that you are willing to go under one times coverage but really only for very short periods of time? Terry Spencer : Yes, I think that's fair. That's been in the past. We've been comfortable keeping our coverage below one at the Partnership really for relatively short period of time. I think that's fair. Carl Kirst : Okay, thank you. And a couple of other questions just from a base case standpoint; with respect to OKS and equity requirements with a much lower CapEx, should we still be expecting sort of a use of the ATM or is it down to where you think you don't even need equity for 2015 or any more color there would be helpful. Terry Spencer : Carl, I'll let Derek take that question. Derek Reiners : Yes, Timm, this is Derek. Sorry, Carl, this is Derek. We do expect to continue to use the ATM program as we've done in the past, certainly been a program that has worked well for us in the last year. And as we still do have $1.2 billion or so of capital in 2015 plan, we do expect to need to issue some equity. Carl Kirst : Derek, did you have a target range with respect to that $1.2 billion or should we think of it as roughly on par with 2014 as far as the ATM equivalents? Derek Reiners : Well, I think we will continue to look at our credit metrics much as the way we have in the past, of course, maintaining investment rate, credit ratings is extremely important to us at OKS. So that really will be our guide as to how much we would plan to issue either under the ATM or in an overnight for that matter. Carl Kirst : Okay. That is helpful. Maybe last question if I could, just with respect to -- and I think these are smaller numbers but still want to make sure I have a sense of the colors. If we look at the maintenance capital spend for OKS, there is a 20% reduction. Is that something that is more reflective of the lower service costs you are seeing and thus is a new baseline or is that more sort of project deferrals that will just be done at a later date? Derek Reiners : Well, I'll make a couple of comments and then, Wes Christensen, if he has anything to add, will chime in. But in our maintenance capital, yes, first, the short answer is yes, we are seeing some impact from the lower cost environment. But also there is always a tranche of projects in our maintenance that are more discretionary. Okay. So I think you are seeing some of those projects that are not really related to the asset integrity. We will -- from time-to-time, particularly in an environment like this, we've got those discretionary projects that we can dial out the maintenance capital on. I think that's what you're seeing. Wes, you got anything to add there? Wes Christensen : No. I think that took care of everything. Derek Reiners : Okay. Carl Kirst : Great, thank you guys. Derek Reiners : You bet. Thanks, Carl. Operator : And next we will hear from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning, guys Derek Reiners : Hey,Craig. Craig Shere : Terry, in your prepared comments you said that you thought it was prudent to retain cash at the OKE level with more conservative dividend coverage ratio. I know you have already had a question or two on this but wonder what purposes you might foresee cash and available balance sheet capacity at OKE; is it simply a backstop if necessary in worst-case scenario to support OKS or are you keeping your mind open for other things? Terry Spencer : Well, Craig, yes, to what you inferred as far as OKS, but yes we're keeping our minds open to other things. Obviously we could -- we'll have that cash available to issue dividends n the future potentially. So we have a cash tax load that could be coming down the road that cash could be used for OKE share repurchases is a possibility. The OKS supporters, you inferred, and you may have opportunities -- it seems like in towns like these there's always opportunity that presents itself, there maybe some very compelling asset acquisitions that might present themselves, and certainly that would provide with some liquidity for that. And of course obviously you could reduce -- you could potentially reduce some debt. So those are all the things you could conceivably do and all the leverage that we could potentially pull at OKE with that cash. Craig Shere : Great. And assuming full capacity utilization, I understand there is a question as to how quickly the growth CapEx portfolio when online will ramp up given the flaring in market conditions. But assuming full capacity utilization at current commodity pricing, what kind of updated EBITDA to CapEx multiples do you -- or CapEx to EBITDA multiples do you see for the ongoing projects? Terry Spencer : Yes, in this environment, from -- the stated multiple range that we've -- for all these projects that we've historically indicate was the 5X to 7X. And we're probably now north if you looked at kind of what the average multiple would be on these projects in this environment, you'd be a little -- a bit north of the six times. So still very viable projects, but that from a multiple basis, they have been affected somehow. Craig Shere : Okay, that's good to hear. Are there any specific sign posts or market changes you would be looking for before restarting the three deferred projects? Terry Spencer : Yes, probably a bit more fundamental as I -- we would really like to see some meaningful industry crude oil supply reductions. Okay. And if we -- if and when we really start to see that and I think we could feel like that the foundation for higher crude prices is much more viable, if we see prices popping at $65, $70, $75 a barrel range here, as we move into the 2016 timeframe, it's very possible we could fire those projects back up. But I think if we see those kind of markers out there, our confidence is going to be much improved, and certainly that will drive more communications with the producers and certainly -- and hopefully increase drilling activity over and above what we're already doing. Craig Shere : Great, and last question; obviously suspending the long-term guidance probably makes some sense given the uncertainty. But the market always hates to not have a good roadmap. If things do recover in that range you said, the mid-$60 to $70 oil and CapEx spending in the industry kind of gets back to more of a steady state, from this reduced 2015 level, can you provide some color as to what we could see in terms of rolling back towards or close to the prior 2017 targets? Terry Spencer : Yes. Craig, I think if we could see prices in that $70 to $80 a barrel range, and consistently in that range, we could very well head back toward that and get back toward that dividend and distribution guide rates, kind of get back on that old growth -- dividend growth and distribution growth target range. Craig Shere : Great, I appreciate it. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Craig. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Good morning, everyone. Thanks for all the color. Terry Spencer : Hi, Christine. Christine Cho : So if I look at your operating income guidance for the NGL segment, it looks like it went down $60 million from original guidance. Would you be able to give us an idea of roughly how much of that is from your own equity volumes being revised down at the G&P segment and flowing through your NGL assets versus how much is from third-parties? And also, how did you guys determine how much to reduce third-party volumes? Are you going by customer forecast or have you haircut it further? Any color there would be helpful. Terry Spencer : Christine, I'm going to let Sheridan take that question. Sheridan Swords : On the answer about how much of the 63 million is attributable to our own equity volumes, I would say it's a little bit more than half. And then as we look at volumes going forward, that is multiple ways that we look at it, a lot is talking to the producers and the gathering of processing segments out there determine what they're seeing and we also look like at what we're seeing through our own plants in the same region to be able to determine what we think is a fair volume forecast for those plants. Christine Cho : Okay, thank you. And then, just continuing on the NGL segment, you guys previously expected about 12% of your margin to come from marketing and optimization. Is that still what you're expecting with the revised guidance? Terry Spencer : Christine, I think it's closer to 15%. Christine Cho : If you include the isomerization I think. Terry Spencer : Oh, if you include -- yes, if you include the isomerisation adds, it's sure -- Sheridan you want to\u2026 Sheridan Swords : Yes, its marketing and optimization is still around 4%. Terry Spencer : Okay. Christine Cho : Okay. Terry Spencer : So if you include the isomerisation where does that put you? Sheridan Swords : 14%. Terry Spencer : There you go. Christine Cho : Okay. Perfect. And then \u2026 Terry Spencer : That's the number I was trying to say. Christine Cho : And then, so I understand why processing plants in the Scoop and Powder River would get pushed out, but I was a little surprised that Demicks Lake was also in there just given McKenzie County has the lowest breakevens in the Bakken. Can you talk about the slowdown you are seeing and even the sweet spots and what are the utilizations at Garden Creek and State Line plants? Are they full or is there some capacity left there to accommodate any volumes that would have gone to Demicks Lake? Terry Spencer : Well, Christine, clearly it's a function of the drilling plants of the producers in that Demicks Lake area and some of those wells are out on the edge and not quite in the sweet spot of the play. And I'll let Kevin add some color to\u2026 Kevin Burdick : Yes, Christine, we definitely have seen a movement of rigs into the core as we promised back in at our Analyst Day. As far as capacities and utilizations, we still have available capacity in our existing plants. And then as we add like Terry referenced traditional compression throughout 2015, and then Lonesome Creek coming on at the end of the year, that provides us with an additional $300 million a day of capacity that we'll be able to handle to continue drilling and the completions that are being worked in the first half of 2015 and will give some headroom for growth on into 2016 as well. Christine Cho : Okay, great. Thanks. And then last question for me; can you remind us if you have any minimum volume commitments on any of your assets? If so, are you expecting any payments tied to that this year? Terry Spencer : Christine, we do have some -- and we refer to them as MVAs in the gathering and processing segment. Most of those I think have run their term. Then of course in the NGL business we've got those -- we don't refer to those as minimum volume agreements, we refer to those as just firm shipper pay or from fracker pay agreements. And we have certainly those in the NGL segments. Most of those contracts were entered into to support many of the capital investments that we've made, the new fractionation, this new Sterling pipeline and what have you. Christine Cho : And are you guys expecting any payments tied to that this year? Terry Spencer : Yes, we are. And I don't know how granular we're going to be able to get on that. Christine Cho : Thank you. Terry Spencer : Okay. Operator : And next we'll hear from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : Hey, guys. Terry Spencer : Hey, Becca. Becca Followill : Just wanted to clarify the change in guidance on gathering and processing volumes, I think it was up 17% and now it is up 10% and 8% respectively. Yet you said that Williston basin was only down 3%. Can you reconcile that change; where that is coming from? Terry Spencer : Most of that's -- Kevin? I'd like Kevin\u2026 Kevin Burdick : Yes. I think that is coming from obviously the other -- the other basins both Mid Continent, we saw some additional pull back there, the ongoing forecast and then also some coming out of Powder. Becca Followill : Okay, I will follow-up to get some more specifics. And then in the guidance for volumes up 16% in 2016, it just seems kind of contrary to the rig count reductions that we are seeing. Can you help us get to how you get to that increase of 16% in 2016? Terry Spencer : Well, Becca just at a high level I'll let some of these other guys address your question as well, but when we think about what's happening, the producers are pooling into these much higher and much more productive areas. Certainly you're seeing the impact of that. I think the other thing which you don't always hear about is the fact that they're enhancing these, they're continuing to enhance their completion techniques and getting more production per well. So I think that's got to be a key. Any of you guys got anything else you want to add to that? I mean that's\u2026 Derek Reiners : No. I mean that pretty well covers it. Kevin Burdick : That covers it pretty well. Terry Spencer : Okay. Becca Followill : Okay. And I've got three more quick ones. You talked about the flow-through of gathering to the frac; yet I think you guys are looking at basically flat frac volumes in '15 versus '14 versus the gathering and processing volumes up 8% to 10%. So do we look at it as a multiple or are you looking for some uptick in frac volumes in '16 that may be different than the pattern in '15? Derek Reiners : Becca, the reason you're seeing your frac volumes flat between '14 and '15 is that we had quite a few spot frac contracts that we did in '14 that we're not predicting we will do again in '15. So they were just frac-only contracts, and so a lot of the gathering volumes they will now reflect a gathering fee plus a frac figure as we continue to go forward. That's why you're seeing in the black volume there. Becca Followill : Okay. And then the second half pickup that you are looking at, where the coverage ratio is going to get thicker, are you assuming a pickup in commodity prices? Terry Spencer : No, pretty flat prices throughout the year; that %50 scenario. Becca Followill : Got you. Probably into the last question; is the $0.54 composite NGL barrel -- I know in the wording it just seemed ethane rejection but you've got a portion of your barrel of roughly 10% that is ethane. So built into that $0.54, does that include some ethane in there? Terry Spencer : Yes, there would be a small amount of ethane. Kevin, do you have anything else, you could add to that? Kevin Burdick : No, it should be a small amount of ethane that includes in there as well. Terry Spencer : Less than 10%? Kevin Burdick : Around 10-ish. Terry Spencer : Yes. Becca Followill : Wonderful. Thank you, guys. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Becca. Operator : Our next question comes from Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Ted Durbin : Thank you. A question on the OKE cash tax rate down in '15, but as you look forward to '16 with the lower CapEx at OKS plus maybe the impact of bonus depreciation, I am just wondering if you can give us some help on where the '16 cash tax rate is shaping up especially I think guidance before was around 20% to 25%. Terry Spencer : That's right. We actually I think had got it kind of 18% to 24% in the future years but since we're not forecasting out the OKS distributions, providing financial guidance, we really can't give you anymore color beyond that. Of course bonus depreciation as you know was passed for 2014, which rolled into 2015 and for us as we carried over our net operating loss. So we don't expect to be a cash tax payer in 2015 if bonus depreciation were to be enacted again that would certainly favorably impact 2016's cash taxes. Ted Durbin : Got it. Next one for me, just coming back to these three plants that are being suspended, I guess were there contracts associated with those? What was the old versus the new that changed such that you are no longer moving forward with those plans? What are you may be giving up in case a competitor tries to come in and build over top of you? Terry Spencer : Well, Ted, first of all we don't believe we're giving up anything by suspending these projects until market conditions improve. Okay. And from a contractual standpoint if the same contracts that have been out there for some time these large acreage dedications they're part of this 3 million acreage dedication that we continually talk about. So those contracts are in place. It's just now a matter of when is the drilling going to occur? When are they going to get this production out of the ground? So it's a timing issue. And so, how you have to think about the suspension of these projects is not a cancellation, but a push to the right, a shift to the right of the curve if you will. It's really all about timing. We all believe that the commodity price environment is going to improve. And as it improves and these producers provide more clarity about their drilling activity, we're not giving up really anything but suspending these projects. Okay? Tedd Durbin : Got it. The percentage of fee-based margins now that you are looking at in '15, I think before you had said 66%. Where does that shake out now with new guidance? Terry Spencer : They're going to be more in the 75% range fee-based. Tedd Durbin : Got it. Thank you. And then last one from me is just really kind of the same question in terms of the backlog. You had the on and off backlog of $4 billion to $5 billion. Should we assume that is the similar size but just takes longer to implement or does that actual backlog come down? Terry Spencer : That's exactly right. Those projects are all still viable projects, and it really did as you indicate, it's more function of timing. Okay. The curve being shifted to the right as these producers get more confident in their drilling and provide more clarity on their forecast, these projects will come back into the fray. Tedd Durbin : Perfect. I'll leave it at that. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : [Operator instructions] We'll hear from Carl Kirst with BMO Capital Markets. Carl Kirst : Thank you, sorry guys, just two quick follow-ups; one, I didn't know if there were any G&P price hedges for 2016 we should be aware of. And I also just wanted to confirm if we just let the current slate of projects play out, what does that imply 2016 growth CapEx to be? Terry Spencer : Well, I guess to both of those questions, Carl; first of all, on the hedging no updates for '16. And as far as CapEx for 2016, we've not guided in the out years as far as capital spent. We provide pretty much when we do guide, we guide in the current year, and we're going to remain with that policy. Carl Kirst : Is there a way to ask just what is left to be spent at the end of this year on just those projects? Terry Spencer : Well, I don't know if we can give. Carl Kirst : Okay, fair enough. Derek Reiners : I don't that number in front of me. And I don't think we really guide to that at this point. Carl Kirst : Okay, appreciate it. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Carl. Operator : And next we'll hear from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets. Elvira Scotto : Hi, good morning. On the three plants that have been suspended, have you spent any capital on those plants yet? And if you did want to kind of bring them back, how quickly could you kind of turn them on I guess? Terry Spencer : Elvira, I'm going to let Wes Christensen take that question. Wes Christensen : Yes, each one of the plants were in different phases, but as we put them into a part position, we have spent some money for long lead time items for Demick's and for Knox, but we will have them all positioned so that when the timing is right for them to be restarted, they will be well prepared to do that. Elvira Scotto : Okay, great. Thanks a lot. Operator : And next we'll hear from Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning Terry Spencer : Good morning. Derek Reiners : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Thanks for all of the color this morning, very helpful. I was just curious if you might be able to comment at all, you have seen a competitor out there that collapsed the GP and LP structure for different reasons. I was just wondering if that is something that you guys had looked at all and if you see any benefit or how you think about the give and take on that type of a transaction. Terry Spencer : Well, Jeremy, this company as we saw last year it was willing to entertain and execute on structural changes and no different here. We're certainly thinking about structural alternatives, and we'll continue to think about it. From a timing standpoint, we're not ready to do anything like that yet, so we'll just continue to look at it. It definitely has some merit. It makes sense for that party to do it and certainly we have to determine if it make sense for us. We're not at that point yet. Jeremy Tonet : Great, thank you for the color. Terry Spencer : Yes. Operator : And next we'll hear from Andy Gupta with HITE Hedge. Andy Gupta : Good morning. Just wanted to follow-up on the previous question; Have you guys run any numbers on the taxes if you were to consolidate the GPLP and particularly with the OKS unit sell at OKE, how does that play into your thinking? Terry Spencer : Well, we have our numbers, but as far as trying to provide you some indication numbers probably would not be a good thing at this point in time. Andy Gupta : I understood. Okay, thank you. Operator : Next, we will hear from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Hi, on the last two questions picking up on that, I think that industry competitor that was referred to, was paying a very high tax even on distributions from the retained LP units of at least one of their large MLPs. Are you still in a position for the foreseeable future that almost all of the OKS LP distributions up to OKE are tax deferred for still some years to go? Terry Spencer : Yes, Craig, there is still a fair amount of shield there. We've been pretty well 100% shielded for a number of years, and given that large capital that you've seen us imply over the last several years that carries forward for a while. Of course the GP, the IDRs are fully taxable to corporate rate, but the LPs do have that shield. Craig Shere : Right. I understand that, but a lot of your peers pay a lot more than zero on their LP distributions under retained units. Terry Spencer : Sure. Craig Shere : And since this particular industry competitor was brought up, they also happened to make a $3 billion acquisition in the Bakken right in your territory, perhaps a little more spread out than what you have got in terms of those concentrated three core county areas and it is also a little more focused on oil. So the fact that somebody was willing to make an acquisition in this troubled market in your home turf or backyard kind of speaks to some value. But could you talk about your competitive strength and maybe the advantages of being in gas processing and gathering in the Bakken versus primarily oil if volumes were to fall off from even the current levels? Terry Spencer : Yes. From a natural gas perspective, we have a lot of backlog, okay? And that's one of the advantages, one thing that provides us energy through this downturn or momentum, if you will, through this downturn. So you don't have quite that same phenomenon with the oil, okay? This flaring backlog is inventory. Its well connect inventory, now you got all these -- in addition to that, you got all these uncompleted wells. So it just gives us a lot of energy and momentum as we move into 2016. With our size, we've got tremendous scale, and so we cover a wide area and certainly there are others in the G&P business, and indicated one; there are others there, most of the asset footprints though has their own core acreage dedication that they are very focused on. And so, we do have some overlap, but when you look at the dense part of each one of our systems, we have our own areas, so to speak; our own backyards, if you will. We actually tend to collectively actually work together to take advantage of capacity on our gathering systems that might be available at certain times of the month where we will off-load gas between companies to help reduce the players. So we actually work together solving problems. So it's really worked well. I don't see the landscape changing significantly as a result of the acquisition that you indicated, and primarily because I think that with those assets we've had a pretty darn good relationship. Craig Shere : And last question, I am sorry for taking so much time. But you had mentioned, Terry, the possibility which is I think the first in a while at least since separation of the utility business of buying back shares at OKE. There's a lot of M&A and people talking about M&A in the market now and some deep pocketed people out there. If somebody came along and offered an immediate 20% bump in the value to OKE off current market, would you see that as attractive? How do you view value for the Company right now? Terry Spencer : Well, I think if somebody came in and offered an attractive value, we certainly would have to -- the prudent thing is to consider. So certainly we would have to be open-minded, okay. Our focus remains for organic growth in this company, and the best way to create value is to continue to prudently and appropriately deploy this capital and earn as high return on invested capital as we possibly can, structure the business, and manage the business with reduced commodity price exposure, and what have you. So those are the ways in which we really -- those are the things we can control, and those are the things we remain focused on, but I mean if somebody were to come in here and put an attractive number on the table, the prudent thing is we would have to look at it. Craig Shere : Great, thank you. Operator : And our final question today comes from Timm Schneider with Evercore ISI. Timm Schneider : Hey, guys; just one quick follow-up. In terms of the margin guidance, the lowered margin guidance, how much of that is from volume declines versus are you baking in any reductions in tariffs or any renegotiations with your E&P customers? Are they pushing back on you guys a little bit? Terry Spencer : At high level, I'll say, Tim, we are really not having any pushback. If anything we're thinking about restructuring our contracts with certain of our customers, there are some customers who want to go more to fee-based types of structures, and so yes, we are having some discussions. Timm Schneider : Yes. And then lastly for me, did you guys take a look at Highland? Terry Spencer : I can't really comment, and we generally, Tim, don't comment about our participation or non-participation in processes. Timm Schneider : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : And there are no additional questions at this time. I will turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. T.D. Eureste: Thank you for joining us. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extends until earnings are released after market closes on May 5, followed by conference call on May 6. We'll provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude our conference for today. We thank you for your participation.",

Please go ahead. T.D. Eureste: Thank you and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 first quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning and many thanks for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer. Also with us are Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. As you know, our first quarter financial results were released yesterday afternoon. For all first quarter financial information and year-over-year variants explanations please refer to our ONEOK and ONEOK Partners earnings news releases. In our remarks today, Derek will focus primarily on the sequential quarter variances. I\u2019ll focus my remarks on ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectation to achieve its 2015 financial guidance ranges, which we reaffirmed in last night\u2019s earnings release. And I will give some insight into 2016. Before I hand the call over to Derek, I would like to reiterate that our financial guidance expectations have not changed for 2015. The first quarter was challenging, largely due to the anticipated step change in our realized commodity prices from 2014 into 2015 which significantly impacted our first quarter results. However, we do not expect first quarter results to have a material impact on our year-end projections for ONEOK or ONEOK Partners. There are still challenges and opportunities that will unfold as the year progresses. And one of our goals today is to provide insight into our expected path forward to meet our financial objectives. I will now turn the call over to Derek for a brief discussion of ONEOK Partners\u2019 first quarter results compared with the fourth quarter of 2014. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thanks, Terry, and good morning. At ONEOK Partners, the natural gas gathering and processing segment\u2019s first quarter 2015 operating income was down compared to the fourth quarter of 2014 primarily due to a decrease of $46 million in lower net realized NGL prices, and a decrease of $8 million due primarily to lower natural gas volumes in the Mid-Continent. We were predominantly un-hedged in the first quarter 2015, as the majority of our hedges are timed for the remaining three quarters. The natural gas liquids segment\u2019s first quarter 2015 operating income was down compared to the fourth quarter 2014 primarily due to a decrease of $18 million due primarily to narrower realized NGL product price differentials and significantly narrower NGL location price differentials. A decrease of $6 million in exchange services margins, which resulted primarily from lower volumes from customers in the Mid-Continent region, caused primarily by customer freeze-offs and gas plant outages, offset partially by increased volumes from recently connected plants in the Williston Basin and lower cost associated with these services, partially offset by an increase of $7 million in transportation margins primarily from new volumes from the Permian Basin transported on the West Texas LPG pipeline system, which were lower than expected due to the impact of well freeze-offs on the system from severely cold weather in the first quarter of 2015. Operating costs increased $4 million, and depreciation and amortization increased $5 million related to the completion of growth projects and the West Texas LPG pipeline system acquisition. The natural gas pipeline segment\u2019s first quarter 2015 operating income was down compared to the fourth quarter of 2014, primarily due to a decrease of $21 million from lower short-term storage services, due to milder weather-related demand and a $5 million gain on the sale of natural gas and storage in the fourth quarter 2014. In March, ONEOK Partners completed an $800 million public offering of senior notes, generating net proceeds of approximately $792 million. It increased the credit facility and commercial paper program to $2.4 billion each from $1.7 billion, and issued approximately 1.7 million units through our aftermarket equity program, generating net proceeds of $71.6 million. At March 31, we had approximately $443 million of common units available for issuance under the $650 million program. We will continue to take a balanced approach and remain disciplined on how we determine our debt and equity needs. Our investment-grade credit rating at the partnership remains very important to us. At ONEOK, $169 million in distributions were declared by ONEOK Partners in the first quarter of 2015, a 16% increase from the same period last year. Cash flow available for dividends for the first quarter was $152 million, providing 1.2 times coverage of the ONEOK dividend. We will continue to make prudent financial decisions that are in the long-term interest of ONEOK and its shareholders. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. I would now like to take this opportunity to provide visibility into our volume projections, capacity expansions, and operational execution, which we expect to enable ONEOK and ONEOK Partners to achieve its 2015 financial guidance and provide some further insight into our 2016 volume outlook. Starting with our natural gas pipelines business, with primarily fee-based revenue and long-term firm contracts we expect this segment to contribute $225 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2015. In the short-term, we will continue to provide quality transportation services to end-use markets and producers; provide short-term flexible storage and loan services to meet market needs; and grow long-term fee-based storage revenues. This segment\u2019s long-term growth opportunities include continuing the expansion of our natural gas pipelines asset footprint by leveraging the Permian, Mid-Continent, and Upper Midwest platforms. Our recently announced RoadRunner Gas Transmission pipeline joint venture serving growing markets in Mexico is a great example of fee-based growth opportunities we are planning to take advantage of, as this project is expected to result in additional upstream-related capital projects at attractive returns. Additionally, we are expanding our Midwest gas transmission, or MGT, pipelines, bidirectional pipeline to increase deliveries into the Chicago markets from the Marcellus and Utica basins. Demand for capacity on this bidirectional pipeline continues to grow, and the flexibility and connectivity of MGT is key to meeting producer end-market needs. The low natural gas pricing environment and mandates related to air emission standards are providing many opportunities to generate incremental fee-based earnings as we expand our assets to meet the growing electric generation needs as coal-to-gas conversions continue. Phill and his team continue to develop the fee-based projects such as pipeline expansions and compression facilities to support these opportunities. In our natural gas gathering and processing segment, we expect $180 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2015. As we have mentioned previously, the timing of earnings for this segment is expected to be significantly weighted towards the second-half of the year, which follows the growth of our natural gas gathered and processed volumes in 2015. We expect this segment in total to reach approximately 2,080 billion Btus per day or 1,625 million cubic feet per day of natural gas gathered and 1,860 billion Btus per day, or 1,425 million cubic feet per day of natural gas processed in the fourth quarter 2015. Additionally, we expect this segment\u2019s gathered volume to increase 10% in 2015 over 2014, and 16% in 2016 over 2015. This segment\u2019s 2015 and 2016 natural gas gathered volume will be led by continued growth in the Williston Basin, where we expect gathered volumes to increase 39% and 27% in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Williston natural gas gathered volume in 2014 was approximately 440 million cubic feet per day, compared to current estimated volumes of approximately 570 million cubic feet per day early in the second quarter of 2015. Our confidence in these Williston Basin volume projections is driven by key operational statistics, including rig locations, new well connections, the current flared gas inventory, and additional natural gas processing in capacity. Let\u2019s discuss each of these in more detail, beginning with rigs and well connections. As expected, producers have moved rigs into the highest-return areas of the basin, where we have more than 1 million acres of dedicated production. These areas typically yield higher initial production rates per well of 800 Mcf to 1,200 Mcf per day, which is roughly two to three times greater than the wells producing from the fringe areas of the Basin. Since October, we have seen a reduction of approximately 50% of the rigs on our acreage dedications compared with approximately 60% reduction in the rest of the basin. In the first quarter 2015, we connected 300 new wells to our system compared with 200 wells in the fourth quarter 2014. And we expect to connect more than 700 new wells to our system in 2015, which was the assumption used in developing our volume guidance. This will provide approximately 160 million cubic feet per day of new natural gas production dedicated to us in 2015. And with approximately 50 rigs continuing to drill on our acreage we expect more than 600 new well connects in 2016 given the high horsepower rig efficiencies and pad drilling approach. These wells are expected to provide an additional 140 million cubic feet per day of new natural gas dedicated to us in 2016. Moving on to flare gas, even gas capture percentage is increasing in the basin, there are still approximately 150 million cubic feet per day of gas flaring from wells dedicated to the partnership. It is important that I note that we are already connected to the majority of wells that are currently flaring, but still compression constraints are limiting our ability to capture the gas. To alleviate these constraints, we are constructing 6 new compressor stations in 2015 with a total of nearly 77,000 horsepower, which will add an additional 300 million cubic feet per day of gathering capacity to our system. This compression will deliver volumes from flare gas and new well connects to fill our plants at approximately 685 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter of 2015. The compression infrastructure will also provide incremental volumes by the second quarter of 2016 of approximately 100 million cubic feet per day, to our Lonesome Creek plant, which is expected to be complete by the end of 2015, boosting our total Williston Basin processing capacity to nearly 900 million cubic feet per day. Our 80 million cubic feet per day, Bear Creek facility expected to be complete in the third quarter 2016, is expected to capture approximately 40 million cubic per day of natural gas, that is expected to be flaring in Dunn County. By the end of 2016, we expect our approximately 980 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Williston Basin to be more than 80% utilized. Moving on to the increased well inventory in the Williston, supporting our well connect expectations in 2015 and 2016, there are now more than 900 uncompleted wells in the basin. This increased inventory is largely due to multi-well pad drilling, where producers typically don\u2019t complete the wells until after the last well is drilled. And, in some cases, producers manage well completions to ensure they meet the NDIC gas capture targets. Of the total basin inventory, we estimate approximately one-half of the uncompleted wells are on our acreage dedications. So there is a healthy inventory of wells available to us to connect once they are completed. And of those that are completed, we continue to see 20% to 30% improvements in well performance on average, compared with a year ago as a result of continuing improvements in completion techniques. Also the large producers are managing to their own growth guidance expectations. Indications are that they will manage the completion of wells and inventory to accomplish their production growth objectives. With the improved well performance, rigs drilling in the most economic areas, well inventory, and the inventory of flared gas, we are confident in our 2015 volumes and we\u2019ll have significant momentum going into 2016. Moving to the Mid-Continent, we expect volumes to decline due to a key producer drilling wells in the first half of the year and completing them in the second half of the year. We expect Mid-Continent natural gas gathered volume to reach approximately 1,050 billion Btus per day or 900 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter 2015 and increased 6% in 2016 over 2015. Current Mid-Continent natural gas gathered volumes are estimated to be in the range of 840 million cubic feet per day early in the second quarter of 2015. And finally, to help you dial in the NGL composite price, our equity barrel that ties to our guided NGL composite price of $0.54 per gallon consists of 13% ethane, 58% propane, 7% isobutene, 21% normal butane, and 1% natural gasoline. This is the estimated average equity barrel for 2015. In our natural gas liquids segment, we expect $864 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2015. We expect to reach approximately 820,000 barrels per day of NGLs gathered 550,000 barrels per day of NGLs fractionated during the fourth quarter of 2015. We do expect to be under our NGL gathered volume guidance of 830,000 barrels per day for the year, mainly due to lower low-margin, short-haul volumes on our West Texas LPG pipeline system. Being under our full-year NGL gathered volume guidance is not expected to materially impact our financial guidance for this segment. As we said before, not all barrels are created equally. For example, in the fourth quarter 2014, the average NGL gathered volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline was approximately 50,000 barrels per. In April 2015, we reached over 70,000 barrels per day, and we expect to reach nearly 85,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2015. Our bundled service average rate on the Bakken NGL pipeline is more than $0.30 per gallon. In the fourth quarter 2014, the average NGL gathered volume in the Mid-Continent was approximately 470,000 barrels per day. We expect the Mid-Continent NGL gathered volume to reach 480,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our average bundled service transportation and frac rate on the Mid-Continent volume is nearly $0.09 per gallon. And in the first quarter 2015, the average NGL volume gathered on the West Texas pipeline system was approximately 220,000 barrels per day. In April 2015, we reached nearly 245,000 barrels per day, and we expect to reach nearly 260,000 barrels per day on the West Texas pipeline system in the fourth quarter of 2015. Our average transportation rate on the system is less than $0.03per gallon. This week, we reached a significant milestone related to the West Texas LPG pipeline system, as we completed the transition of operation to ONEOK Partners from Chevron. We remain excited about the opportunities these assets offer and our increased NGL presence in the Permian Basin. Since closing on the assets in late November, we had held many conversations with customers regarding their expected future - current and future volumes, capacity availability, and the partnership\u2019s willingness to expand. As we enhance the services offered to our customers and integrate these assets into our system, we expect to remain a competitively value transportation provider as we bring tariff rates in line with market rates. Our expectations for the performance of these assets has not changed, as we target to reach an expected six to eight times adjusted EBITDA multiple between 2017 and 2020. Potentially or rather additionally, potential margins realized downstream from fee-based fractionation and storage services at our Mont Belvieu facilities could further enhance these multiples. As you can see, our highest-margin NGL barrel comes from the Bakken, but we have a significant base of NGL-gathered volume coming from the Mid-Continent and West Texas LPG pipeline assets. We are connected to 17 of our own natural gas processing plants and are connected to more than 160 third-party plants throughout our system. Additionally, we connected four new third-party natural gas processing plants in late first quarter of this year, one each in the Williston and Powder River Basins, and two in the Mid-Continent. Two third-party plants were connected in April, and we expect to connect Lonesome Creek at the end of 2015. Similar to the gathering and processing segment, our volume ramp is weighted towards the second half of the year. Moving on to our fractionation volume, in the fourth quarter 2014, the average NGL fractionated volume was approximately 542,000 barrels per, which includes over 15,000 barrels per day of short-term spot barrels. As a reminder, spot barrel volume opportunities are excluded from our guidance. In April 2015, we fractionated over 530,000 barrels per day and we expect to reach 550,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter of 2015. Including our contracted minimum volume commitments, we expect our fractionated volume to effectively reach 610,000 barrels per day. If you consider the impact of ethane rejection on our fractionation volume, our fractionators are highly utilized. To wrap up, while the first quarter was challenging mainly due to lower commodity prices and NGL differentials based upon the volume outlook we just described in detail, we are maintaining our 2015 financial guidance ranges at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. An inventory of natural gas remains to be captured in the Williston Basin in the form of flared gas, uncompleted wells, and capacity constraints. I have addressed how we expect to capture it. Since the first quarter, we\u2019ve already seen an increase in volumes on our Bakken NGL pipeline, our highest-margin NGL barrel, and our fractionation utilization is nearly full. And our natural gas pipeline segment continues to provide stable earnings with primarily fee-based revenue and long-term firm contracts. While we have devoted a significant portion of this call around our Williston Basin assets, we\u2019re not just about the Williston. We continue to develop and execute on our strategies to expand and enhance our position across our entire footprint, including new strategic projects and partnerships. A great example of our recently announced, excuse me, a great example is our recently announced RoadRunner gas transmission pipeline joint venture. This strategic pipeline will enhance our already extensive 36,000-mile integrated network of natural gas and natural gas liquids pipelines, and we expect it will create a platform for future cross-border development opportunities. This is just one example of how even through industry challenges, we are looking ahead to long-term projects that make sense for our company in any environment. So while there are still challenges ahead for our industry, we see many opportunities as well. We continue to remain focused on making prudent financial decisions and creating value for our shareholders. And finally, I would like to thank our many dedicated employees for your hard work and commitment to our companies and for all that you do every day behind the scenes to provide reliable services to our customers, and, in particular, for conducting our business in a safe and environmentally responsible manner. Operator, now we are ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Matt Niblack with HITE Capital. Matt Niblack : Thank you, and congratulations on continuing to maneuver through a tough environment here. Just one thought, given the sharp decline in your equity price here, which might view really as a trough evaluation and one that will hopefully improve over time as you see some of the benefits of capturing some of those flared volumes and some of the completions that require you to some of the mandatory regulations of their North Dakota. Do you have the flexibility to put off equity offerings both overnight and in your ATM until, at least, the second-half of the year in order to hopefully see some of those reflected in your business and then transparently your equity price? Terry Spencer : Yes, Matt, I think, that\u2019s a good question, and it\u2019s certainly something we have to balance. We\u2019ve got stakeholders kind of on both sides of this with debt holders. We mentioned that our investment-grade credit rating is very important to us. Obviously that helps us fuel or finance the growth that we\u2019ve got ahead. But we do have to balance the equity, and we have some flexibility, but we have said many times that our targets are to be 50-50. And so we do expect issue equity along the way. Matt Niblack : Okay. Derek Reiners : Yes, Matt, the only thing I would add to is, and we have said this in the past that it is likely that in 2015, we will be issuing some equity, we just haven\u2019t provided specific timing on that. Matt Niblack : Okay. And then turning back to North Dakota, so how impactful is this regulation that they have in the state that you need to complete wells within 12 months of drilling them? Is that really going to create an uptick in the volumes coming out of the Bakken, at least, temporarily and consequently onto your system, or do you see that as less meaningful? Terry Spencer : Yes, Matt, I\u2019ll let Kevin Burdick take that. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Matt, we - the way we view that is we talk our producers. Yes, there is that year requirement where they complete the wells from when they drill it. There is an extension process, though, that is relatively easy to get from the standpoint. So we have had some producers say, yes, they will complete within a year, but then others, if they do need to get an extension, they can do that. Matt Niblack : So overall, the magnitude of that phenomenon though, do you see that as significant or not that significant? Kevin Burdick : No, we - I don\u2019t - we don\u2019t see that as significant when we - as we look at our volume forecast over 2015. Matt Niblack : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo. Ross Payne : How are you doing, guys? Terry Spencer : Good, Ross. How are you? Ross Payne : Good. Good. Currently, you guys are mid-triple by Moody\u2019s or on negative outlook. But given your CT paper program and what have you, do you - is it your objective to keep that particular rating? S&P has you at BBB-, but is it important for you to keep the mid-triple by Moody\u2019s? Derek Reiners : Yes, Ross, this is Derek. And I think both Moody\u2019s and S&P have us at a stable outlook at the moment. Mid-BBB is where we would like to stay. We\u2019ve done some things - obviously, we scaled back capital spending and reduced our distribution growth rate in February, we announced that. So we\u2019ve clearly indicated that we expect to continue to issue some equity along the way to support these investments. So we think all those things are supportive of the credit rating and hopeful that that will allow us to build through this. We see significant volume increase in the back-half of 2015, which we expect will drive our earnings higher and help reduce that leverage as well. So from our point of view, it\u2019s a relatively short-term stretch here, and we think that we get back on top of it later this year. Ross Payne : Okay. Thank you. And yes, it is stable, my apologies on the mistake in that. And then finally, kind of follow-up to the earlier question, given the extension capabilities by producers, how are they thinking about doing extensions? What pushes them to do that in a low price environment, and how do you gain comfort that they won\u2019t overuse that extension to potentially hurt you meeting your volume objectives? Thanks. Derek Reiners : Well, Ross, again, that\u2019s just the capability they have. In our discussions with producers, there\u2019s not a lot of them that are delaying completions due to price. The primary reason that we believe that the backlog is growing as it is like Terry referenced the multi-well pads and waiting until the summer as costs go down as they can drive costs out in their completion process. So, again, we don\u2019t necessarily see that that extension process or that year-long timeframe where they can drill the - or complete the wells is material as we look at our volumes. Ross Payne : Okay, great. That\u2019s very helpful, guys. Thank you. Derek Reiners : Thanks, Ross. Terry Spencer : We\u2019ll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone. Thanks for all the color. Terry Spencer : Hi, Christine. Christine Cho : You guys gave a lot of numbers and I tried to jot everything down. But when we think about the sequential volume decline in the NGL segment, can you give us an idea of how much came from your equity volumes versus third parties and how much came from Voss Bakken versus Mid-Con? Then going forward between now and the 4Q 2015 number exit rate that you gave us, when we think about the growth of the volumes in the second-half of this year for the NGL segment, whether it\u2019s through well connect or just capturing the gas that\u2019s being flared, can you break down maybe percentagewise how much of it\u2019s coming from the Bakken versus Mid-Continent/Rockies? Terry Spencer : Christine, I\u2019m going to let Sheridan take a crack at that. Sheridan Swords : Your first question on equity volumes that we have is actually from fourth quarter to first quarter, the volumes that we received from our affiliate GMP processing plants was flat. We were up in the Bakken quarter-over-quarter, but we were down in the Mid-Continent. A lot of in the first quarter, the sub-sequential change in the first quarter on our legacy volumes - on gathering, our legacy volumes were down quarter-over-quarter. But that was mostly in the Mid-Continent and mostly due to freeze-offs and we had some plants that went into some deeper ethane rejection. As we said and as Terry said earlier, as we look forward, going from now into the fourth quarter, today the Bakken pipeline is moving over 70,000 barrels a day and we expect that to ramp up through the rest of the year to get to 85,000 barrels a day coming out of that. The Mid-Continent is averaging - which is I would take - that\u2019s everything besides the Bakken and the West Texas pipeline. The Mid-Continent is averaging about 457,000 barrels a day, and it will go up to 482,000 barrels a day by the end of the year. And in the West Texas pipeline, we think we\u2019ll be around 260,000 barrels a day by the end of the year, and we were at - in April, we reached over 240,000 barrels a day on that pipeline. Christine Cho : I see. So when I look at kind of I guess like percentage increases in each of the three areas, the biggest year-over-year or - I\u2019m sorry, the biggest increases - percentage increases are coming from the Bakken, which is where you are collecting more feed? Sheridan Swords : That\u2019s correct. Christine Cho : Okay. And then I guess last quarter, Terry, you had told us, you were still assuming 15% of your NGL margins to come from optimization, isomerization, and marketing. Those margins were down big over the prior-year period, which was to be expected. However, I remember in the middle of 2013, you guys telling me that you were expecting propane supplies to be tight and speculating propane with our premium and Conway relative to Bellevue months before it happened. And so it seems like you guys had great line of sight into that. Is there anything you are seeing for the rest of this year to make you feel good about your expectations for guidance on spread-based margins this year, or am I pressing my luck, because disclosing it would give away your competitive advantage? Terry Spencer : Well, okay, Christine. We are seeing spreads widen as we speak, so we are seeing a pretty good trend here getting established over the last couple of months. We are watching the supply inventory in Conway, particularly for propane. And propane is building quickly there, and obviously, we are at historically high levels. And we are seeing demand for propane continued to be robust down on the export side down on the Gulf Coast. So that\u2019s all contributing to wider spreads. So I don\u2019t know how magical that visibility is, but a lot of that information is readily available. But it\u2019s telling us that spreads are going to go wider. So we do have a view for the balance of the year that we could see propane spreads in that $0.07 to $0.10 of gallon range, which is significantly wider than what we\u2019ve seen in the last couple of quarters. Christine Cho : Okay. Terry Spencer : Sheridan, do you have anything to add to that? Sheridan Swords : No, that\u2019s exactly right. I mean, as you can see, Conway is - it\u2019s not only we are increasing inventory up there, but you see our numbers, our production and propane in the Mid-Continent will also increase, as we go forward throughout the year. Christine Cho : Okay. I guess also lastly, can you give us an estimate of what the impact of well freeze-offs were from the Permian Basin as well as your other service territories during the quarter? Sheridan Swords : Yes, in the Permian Basin there was quite a bit of time that we had 40,000 to 60,000 barrels a day off our system. In the Mid-Continent, we probably had 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day for extended periods of time throughout the first quarter due to the well freeze-offs. Christine Cho : I\u2019m sorry, one more question. Can you give some more color on these changes in your contract mix in the G&P segment? And should we expect to see more that going forward? Kevin Burdick : Yes, we\u2019ve been - Christine, this is Kevin. We have been pretty open about trying to shift over time some of our commodity exposure to fee-based. In our conversations with our producers, we\u2019ve been working that hard as contracts come up for renewal. And, yes, I would expect to see that trend continue. Christine Cho : Okay. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Christine, the only thing I would add to that is that we\u2019ve had some considerable success in restructuring these contracts to more of a fee-based component that is reducing the commodity-sensitive sharing part of the contract and expanding on the fee-based. But we\u2019re also providing added services and flexibility and additional features to those contracts to benefit the customer. So they have been pretty well received. It\u2019s probably not going to be a one size fits all. They all have little - each contract has little nuances and differences depending upon the specific needs of the producer. So we\u2019ve had some good success and expect to continue to have success as we go forward. Christine Cho : Great. Thank you so much for the color. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy. Craig Shere : Good morning. Thank you, Terry, so much for that incredibly detailed guidance. Terry Spencer : Glad, you appreciate it, Craig. We did it just for you. Craig Shere : Well, apparently, the markets don\u2019t appreciate it enough, you rallied off the low today on ONEOK even now you are back down 6.5% I guess people just don\u2019t get it. Terry Spencer : Yes, hopefully they\u2019ll digest it and feel better, actually digest it. Craig Shere : Well, on that note picking up a little on Matt\u2019s question about the equity performance, given the well-supported outlook. I believe in the last quarterly call you expressed, Terry, that you were keeping minds open about the use of excess cash at the C Corp. level for M&A, future dividends, and share repurchases, and possible OKS support. In light of the equity performance, in light of the need to issue some more equity down the road this year at OKS, are you leaning at all towards OKE share buybacks or just directly supporting OKS from the parent? Terry Spencer : Well, certainly, Craig, we look at all those things. And what you just mentioned are a number of great levers that we can pull if we feel like we need to. The fact of the matter is this low-coverage environment is not an environment that we expect to persist long-term. So as we have provided plenty of color on this call and how we expect our volumes to increase and our margins to improve and coverages to get better, we expect to grow out of this weak coverage environment. So we are able to do what we need to do at OKS in the immediate future. So really no need for OKE to step in and provide some support at this point in time, although we look at it. Our individual boards - our boards at OKS and our boards at OKE look at their needs separately and make their determinations. And right now, what we\u2019re doing at OKE with our cash, retaining excess cash in this very uncertain environment, we think is prudent and it makes good sense. Craig Shere : You know, often when people talk about parent support, they are talking about IDR forgiveness. I was thinking more along the lines of using your cash to buy the equity rather than selling it to the market. Derek Reiners : Yes, and we do look at that, and have, and continue to. Craig Shere : Okay. And one more question. Look if any of us knew where commodity prices would be in six months, none of us would have to work for a living. So obviously hedging is a problematic effort at best and just a method of smoothing things out. Can you kind of update around your targets and the drivers behind hedging, given the fact you kind of entered this year a little bit under-hedged and we\u2019ve already started hedging out into 2016? Terry Spencer : Yes. Sure, Craig. We have some guidelines that we go by, obviously. We\u2019d like to be at least 75% hedged for a particular year. And in the past, the strategy that we\u2019ve employed was pretty much holding off doing that hedging until we got into the winter season where we could typically find higher prices to hedge. And clearly, that strategy this past year didn\u2019t work very well. And so as we go forward, we think it\u2019s prudent - regardless of what our point of view on pricing may be, it\u2019s prudent to take some of this risk off the table. In particular for 2016, we are already pretty well hedged for 2015. But in particular for 2016, we think it\u2019s prudent to systematically take some off as we go forward. Did that help you? Craig Shere : That certainly does. I mean, it\u2019s worked in prior years, as you say, but no strategy works forever. So I appreciate the feedback. Terry Spencer : Candidly, there\u2019s still downside in commodity prices. Craig Shere : You think from this point with prompt oil at $60 and oil next year like $65-ish that we could take another dive? Terry Spencer : Craig, nothing surprises me in terms of what commodity prices could or couldn\u2019t do. Craig Shere : All right. Well, it\u2019s a good thing you have a lot of organic known growth with flared gas backing out. Terry Spencer : You bet. We\u2019ve got a unique situation up there in the Williston, and we are working hard to take care of our customers. Craig Shere : Thank you. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey, Terry. How are you? Terry Spencer : Hey, Chris. How are you? Chris Sighinolfi : I\u2019m well. I just wanted to follow up - maybe this is a question for Sheridan but I really appreciate you sort of detailing the NGL barrel composition the way you did. I was just curious to know if I look at that relative to what the EIA might have reported let\u2019s say year-to-date for pad 2, for example, where a lot of your assets are located. It\u2019s quite a bit different, particularly as I think about ethane and then C5+. And so I\u2019m just wondering, ethane rejection aside, if your barrel would have always reflected this type of composition, or has something changed? And then, as it relates to that, is there anything that you guys see on a go forward outside of ethane rejection that would materially change the composition as you described it? Terry Spencer : I will make a couple comments, and then Kevin can chime in here. Obviously with a 50% plus propane percentage, that barrel excludes a lot of ethane. The C5 component down to about 1% by inspection would seem very low. And that\u2019s driven in part by the fact that we\u2019ve got a lot of condensate that falls out in our system. So a lot of that C5 winds up falling out of the NGL barrel we recovered in our pipeline system, recovered in our atmosphere tankage across our entire gathering systems, and sell those barrels primarily by truck sales. So that\u2019s why you get that strange looking breakdown and why in the past it\u2019s probably been challenging for you and others to calculate that composite because it doesn\u2019t look exactly the same as what the EIA puts out. Kevin, do you have anything else to add to that? Yes. That help Chris? Chris Sighinolfi : Yes - no, it does. So we are seeing when you report the separate condensate figure, that\u2019s effectively capturing the heavy end of your barrel in part. Terry Spencer : Exactly. And I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve had a single contributor to a change in any past molecular breakdown. I think it stayed fairly consistent. If you normalize for the condensate, you normalize for the ethane rejection, I think our core volumes have stayed fairly constant. And you guys, correct me if I\u2019m wrong. Sheridan Swords : No, I think that\u2019s right. Terry Spencer : Okay. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. That\u2019s really helpful, Terry. And then I guess as it relates to the barrel and pricing expectations, as we think about your hedge profile for the balance of the year, can we think about that as being somewhat equally distributed over the three remaining quarters, or is there something from a mix shift that would weight it more heavily towards the back end - realizing that your volumetric projection is a contangoed ramp into the end of the year? Terry Spencer : Actually, I think, Chris, it actually ramps up as you move through the last three quarters. Okay, so you will have increasing hedged positions as move throughout the balance of the year. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay, great. Thanks for the added color. Appreciate it. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you, Chris. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hi, good morning, guys. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Michael. Michael Blum : Just a couple of quick questions. One, where are you seeing ethane rejection these days? I guess both - either your number, or if you have a stab at what industry looks like. Has that changed at all? Terry Spencer : It has, actually. We\u2019ve seen ethane rejection volumes in the first quarter. We were about 160,000, 165,000 barrels a day. And today, as we speak in April, if we took a snapshot, we\u2019d see about 190,000 barrels per day. So we have seen it increase though. Michael Blum : And is that in any particular region? Terry Spencer : Primarily, it would be Mid-Continent and West Texas. I mean - Sheridan, you got anything? Go ahead and add something. Sheridan Swords : My point is across our system. I mean obviously, the Bakken has been up forever, and the Mid-Continent, we still - we\u2019ve seen a little bit more plants going to ethane rejection there that weren\u2019t in last year. And also another increase - the reason that we are increasing from the 165,000, you said this first quarter to 190,000, it\u2019s also because we have more volume on as well. More volume coming on, and that volume is coming on - it doesn\u2019t have any ethane in it. Michael Blum : Got it. That makes sense. And then just on your earlier comments on the MGT pipeline and the bidirectional service you\u2019re offering, can you just talk a little bit about that in terms of what type of capacity you have to offer. Is that signed up? And what sort of capital is associated with that? Terry Spencer : Sure, I would go let Phill May take that question. Phillip May : Sure, Michael. Yes, MGT is in the upper Midwest, and the facility connects with the Chicago hub, and it is bidirectional. You have 600 million a day going south and then 500 million a day going north. The facility has been very strategic for some of the Utica and Marcellus producers to access movement of their molecules into Chicago via some of the other pipelines that interconnect with MGT. We are looking at a couple of expansions. One is announced that will move 125 million a day into Chicago from the Rockies express interconnect, and that is under construction currently. And we are also evaluating additional expansions and visiting with the same producer community in the Utica and Marcellus to access more capacity on that facility. Michael Blum : Got it. Thank you very much, guys. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thanks, Michael. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Eric Genco : Just a quick I guess clarification question. I appreciate all the help you\u2019ve kind of given us on the NGL barrel and trying to get to the realize prices. I was curious as to what assumptions we should make in terms of transportation or basis on top of sort of whatever we have for the barrel components. Because it looked to me - and maybe I need to go back and look at the numbers as you kind of given some new numbers on NGL barrel composition that the unhedged barrel should have been around $0.60 last quarter assuming no basis. And I\u2019m trying to figure out maybe there\u2019s about $0.20 of basis in there. Is that correct? Because I guess the Bakken NGL pipeline has gone from being maybe about $0.21 to $0.13 depending on how you look at it per gallon. And then I guess you would add Oberland Pass in there, about $0.05 per gallon, for the Bakken NGL - I guess the Bakken volumes. Is that a fair way to look at it? And what kind of help could you give us there? Terry Spencer : Eric, I\u2019m not sure that it is. I\u2019m not sure that I followed all of those - you put all those pieces together. Kevin, you got a comment? Kevin Burdick : Well, I mean, the concept of getting to the TNF is correct. But, again, I\u2019m like Terry, I\u2019m not sure I\u2019m following your tracking the individual components you\u2019re looking at there. Eric Genco : Well, maybe if we step back, is there a way to give us a sense based on the way you think the volumes come in to certain percent from the Bakken, a certain percent from the Mid-Con, what type of basis would you take out of there? Terry Spencer : Well, actually, I think - from a NGL perspective, Eric, we provided some transparency in my remarks, and that will help you a lot in terms of that basis. And we provided specific transportation and fractionation rates from the Bakken, from the Mid-Continent, and West Texas. That can help you allocate that basis, if you will, back to the NGL barrel. Eric Genco : Okay, I\u2019ll take a look at that and come back to you if I have questions. Thank you. Terry Spencer : You bet. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Ross Payne with Wells Fargo. Ross Payne : Yes, just a quick follow-up question. Propane prices obviously have been fairly depressed in here. I just wanted to know if you guys had any thoughts on what might drive that north alongside with what we\u2019re seeing with the crude. Thanks. Sheridan Swords : I think, obviously, we need some more increased demand, and we see that coming on later this year as more export capacity is brought online. That will help lift that up. Also if it goes too much deeper, we think there\u2019s probably some more that the crackers could consume if propane prices go a little bit lower than they are today. So they\u2019re consuming a lot today, but they consume a little bit more. So that\u2019s why we think that it will ramp up. We will see a little bit of strength in propane, but it will be later this year. Ross Payne : Okay, and finally on your hedges, you are obviously doing a decent amount given a substantial portion of the barrel is propane for you guys. Is that fair to say? Terry Spencer : Yes. Ross Payne : Great. Okay, thank you. Terry Spencer : Thanks Ross. Operator : With no further questions in the queue at this time, I would like to turn the conference back over to our speakers for any additional or closing remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you for joining us. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends into earnings are released after the market closes on August 4, followed by our conference call on August 5. We will provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s conference. We appreciate your participation.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead. T.D. Eureste: Thank you and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning and many thank you for joining today and for your continued interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. As noted in our second quarter earnings results release yesterday afternoon, key financial and operational information discussed during our first quarter earnings call has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 Web site. Please refer to this presentation and to the earnings releases for various explanation and key metrics. With the information that has already been provided, I intend to keep my remarks brief today and focus on a few key areas. We\u2019ll spend the majority of our time answering your questions. To begin, even in this continued weak commodity price environment, we expect that both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will end the year within our 2015 financial guidance ranges. And as we exit 2015, we expect 2016 to continue to benefit from the completed and soon to be completed capital growth projects in the natural gas liquids, natural gas pipelines and natural gas gathering and processing segments. We are seeing volume growth through the first half of the year as anticipated, particularly regarding natural gas liquids gathered and fractionated and natural gas gathered and processed. We expect these volume increases to continue into 2016. Overall, the Partnerships\u2019 year-to-date performance positions us to achieve our natural gas gathering volume and financial objectives for the year. I will now turn the call over to Derek for a brief discussion of ONEOK Partners\u2019 and ONEOK\u2019s financials. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thank you, Terry. Starting on partnership, 2015 EBITDA contribution continues to ramp up as strong volume growth is shaking up as we anticipated. We expect to grow our EBITDA in the second half of 2015 and be within our 2015 financial guidance EBITDA range of $1.51 billion to $1.73 billion. Our EBITDA growth follows the volume growth. Even in this lower commodity price environment, the Partnership\u2019s year-to-date EBITDA of $712 million is only $40 million less than in the same period in 2014, which was a record in environment with much higher commodity prices. Our coverage ratio has improved to a 0.88 times coverage in the second quarter of 2015 and we expect continued improvement in our coverage the balance of the year. The partnership has a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our current capital program including access to our commercial paper program and credit facility. As of June 30, ONEOK Partners had an adjusted debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.5 times.  As we said, investment grade credit ratings of ONEOK Partners remain very important to us. Through the first half of 2015 our ATM program was a very effective tool for issuing equity and we continue to evaluate the overnight equity markets and other sources of capital. We will continue to take a balanced approach and remain disciplined when issuing debt and equity. Additional equity is needed to continue to support our capital projects.  We continue to remain confident in our ability to raise necessary capital to fund our capital projects at ONEOK Partners. At ONEOK our liquidity remains strong with a $150 million in cash and undrawn $300 million credit facility, and a debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 2 times at June 30. We continue to retain access cash at ONEOK as we navigate these uncertain times. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Now let's take a closer look at each of our business segments, starting with our natural gas liquids segment. The segment's 2015 year-to-date results were supported by solid second quarter performance. The segment's year-to-date operating income exceeds year-to-date 2014 operating income. This becomes a more useful statistic when you consider that first quarter 2014 results rightly benefited from a historically high demand for propane and that in 2015 the segment has experienced lower realized NGL product price differentials and narrower NGL location price differentials. So even though year-over-year the segment was competing with the 2014 propane benefit, operating income so far in 2015 has exceeded first half 2014 totals because of the continued strong growth of fee based revenues and volumes. Our integrated NGL system continues to benefit from providing non-discretionary fee-based services to NGL producers by connecting growing natural gas liquids supply in the Rocky Mountain, Mid-Continent and Permian regions with key market centers. The natural gas liquids gathered volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline reached approximately 100,000 barrels per day in July and is expected to reach approximately 105,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2015. This is an increase of approximately 20,000 barrels per day from what we expected in the first quarter as a result of decreased ethane rejection in the Rocky Mountain region. We will talk more about the reduced ethane rejection in a moment. The average bundle gathering and fractionation rate on the Bakken NGL pipeline is more than $0.30 per gallon. Moving to our fractionated volume. In addition to the increased ethane fractionated due to the decreased ethane rejection, we also saw more than 20,000 barrels per day of incremental interruptible volumes on our system in the second quarter as we were able to utilize our fractionation assets to meet market demand. We expect to continue to see approximately that level of incremental interruptible volume from our system into the fourth quarter. As a reminder, we do not include interruptible volumes in our fractionation volume guidance. And finally, in recent weeks, we have seen Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials range from $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon and we expect this range to continue for the rest of this year. As you know our natural gas pipelines business is primarily fee-based with long-term firm demand charge contracts. We continue to develop new projects and opportunities to grow our fee-based earnings. Just last week we announced plans to expand our ONEOK WesTex Intrastate Natural Gas Pipeline System in the Texas Panhandle and Permian Basin. The expansion which will complement our previously announced Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline joint venture is already 90% subscribed with 25 years firm demand charge agreements. These projects and the expansion of our Mid-Western Gas Transmission Pipeline System are continued examples of our committeemen to stable long-term fee-based earnings growth. The natural gas gathering and processing segment's second quarter results were significantly improved over the first quarter. Earnings for this segment are still expected to be significantly weighted towards the second half of the year which is in line with the expected growth of our 2015 natural gas gathered and processed volumes. We have greater confidence in our Williston Basin volume projections with six months of operating performance under our belt and good visibility into the remainder of 2015. The segment is seeing the benefit of rigs concentrated in the most productive areas, new well connections, two compressor stations completed, and the current flared gas inventory. We expect Williston Basin volume in the third quarter to reach approximately 650 million cubic feet per day as we continue to bring on additional field infrastructure. Additionally, our new well connections continue to exceed our expectations as we completed nearly as many in the first half of 2015 as we did in the first half of 2014. We remain on track to fill our plans to approximately 685 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter as we complete gathering system and compression projects through the second half of the year. These new compressor stations will not only fill our existing plants but also will provide capacity to ramp up volumes at our Lonesome Creek plant, which is expected to be completed late in the fourth quarter 2015. In the Mid-Continent our volumes increased quarter-over-quarter due to incremental interruptible gathering and processing services we provide to third parties from time to time as demand dictates. In addition, a key producer in the Cana-Woodford as expect has now started the process of completing wells drilled in the first half of the year. Our commercial team continues to make progress with customers on its recontracting efforts and has same positive results in increasing our fee based margin while providing enhanced services to our customers. Additionally, we reduced the level of ethane rejection in the Rocky Mountain region in June 2015 to maintain downstream NGL product quality specifications to ensure continued reliable delivery of high quality NGL products to meet the needs of our downstream markets. We expect the decreased level of ethane rejections to continue. Our producer customers are continuing to find ways to reduce drilling cost, and are doing more with less. Said another way, our producer customers are increasing volume with fewer but more efficient rigs and advanced completion technologies are increasing well production rates to levels the industry has never seen before. Our positive operating performance through the first half of the year, combined with what our producer customers are communicating to us, has given us greater confidence in our 2015 natural gas gathering and processing volumes and momentum into 2016. Much like 2015, our 2016 volume growth is expected to be led by growth in the Williston Basin. In the Williston we connected more than 260 new wells in the second quarter 2015, bringing our year-to-date total to more than 560 new well connections. We still expect to reach our 2015 new well connection goal of more than 700 wells and our 2016 goal of more than 600 new wells. That continues to be an inventory of flared gas in the Williston Basin and we estimate approximately 145 million cubic feet per day is dedicated to the Partnership with the majority of the wells flaring already connected to our system. As I touched on earlier, our producer customers are doing more with less. There\u2019re approximately 40 rigs drilling in the most productive areas at any given time on our acreage dedication in Northeast McKenzie, North Dunn and Southern Williams Counties. Additionally wells in the high producing areas continue to exhibit significant performance improvements; producing two to three times more natural gas than lower producing areas. Additionally, more than 900 wells, which have been drilled but not completed, remain in the basin. The continued drilling flared natural gas inventory, improved well performance and significant backlog of uncompleted wells is expected to continue and help contribute to the Partnership reaching its 2016 natural gas gathered volume expectations. Our strong natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth in the second quarter support the volume outlook we\u2019ve been communicating and provide our stakeholders additional visibility to support our volume growth outlook for the second half of the year; and most importantly, our financial guidance expectations for 2015 and the momentum into 2016. As always, thank you for your continued support in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and thank you to our dedicated employees for your hard work and continued commitment to our Company. Operator, we\u2019re ready for the questions. Operator : Thank you [Operator Instructions]. And we will take the first question today from Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead. Christine Cho : I just wanted to start with the reduced ethane in the Rockies. When you say to maintain downstream product quality specifications, are you talking about meeting natural gas pipeline specs? Terry Spencer : No Christine we\u2019re talking about natural liquids specifications\u2026. Christine Cho : So\u2026Yes, more color would be helpful. Terry Spencer : Sure, and Sheridan, I\u2019ll let you talk about it. Sheridan Swords : The NGLs coming out of the Bakken have a high oxygen content, and as we fractionate that oxygen, it\u2019s been driven into the propane, and the butane and to be able to get that by bringing more ethane on, we can driven it into the EP or we can treat it and we continue to make sure that the propane is on spec for delivery into the end use market. Christine Cho : And then I guess a molecule [ph] from the Rockies. How much does that generate? I am assuming it's not the full $0.30 that we usually look at for Bakken. Terry Spencer : It is -- we are having, it's close to that number but there is some offset versus that current ship wrecker pays are demand charges that we have. So this is going to offset, it gives demand charges as well. So it's not the full $0.30. Christine Cho : Okay, but not something for off '15? Terry Spencer : It's close, yes. Christine Cho : Okay. I guess one of your competitors is in the process of connecting two of their NGL pipelines that would bring 50,000 barrels per day of propane from the Marcellus into the Midwest. Do you have any thoughts that you could share with us about what that level of supply could potentially use to the spread between Belvieu, Conway. Is that kind of supply going over along Conway or is that already enough excess capacity between Conway and Belvieu that it could easily go to Gulf Coast without any problems or does it just pretty prevent Conway from ever trading at a premium, again like it did last year. Any color would be helpful? Terry Spencer : Christine what I would say is that obviously more volume into the Mid-Continent has nothing but improved spreads. We do think there is the ability to move some propane from Conway down to Mont Belvieu, especially if you displaced out a product. So these are all back spot ones that you may move more propane than butane and more propane than the EP or ethane that you have. But we do think there is capacity to move incrementally more volume between the two. But I think it will normally have a widening effect on the spread and it will have a dampening effect on Conway ever trading over Belvieu, you are correct. Christine Cho : Okay. And then I guess last question from me. You guys have done a sizable amount of equity on the ATM year-to-date but like you said you are going to have to do more and because I think the market has somewhat of a wide range out there and what that number is, it kind of puts a bigger overhang on OKS. So that\u2019s EBITDA you guys report is always different than what I calculate and I suspect it's because of the project credit that\u2019s in there but how far does the credit rating agencies go in giving you that credit, is it year, 18 months, two years, any color on how they have used your balance sheet would be helpful? Derek Reiners : Sure Christine, this is Derek. On an unadjusted basis, our debt-to-EBITDA has shown a 5.1 and we reported 4.5 on an adjusted basis, you are correct. The principal difference there is the material projects that we have on our way that we receive some credit for in our covenants so that's that delta. On a run rate basis, you are probably 1 or 2 basis points lower than that if you just took four quarter -- or excuse me second quarter and multiply that by 4. The agencies I think give us some credit for that, I am not exactly sure to what extent, they don\u2019t exactly share all their calculations with us. But they certainly understand that as we're in construction mode, we will be issuing equity and debt for that matter ahead of the realization of the earnings from those projects. And so I think there is some benefit afforded to us in that regard. Cleary agencies look forward and think about the nature of those projects and the earnings from those projects going forward as they think about, how does our leverage looks going forward. Christine Cho : Thank you for the color. Derek Reiners : You bet. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thanks Christine. Operator : And we will now go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey good morning Terry. Terry Spencer : Hey good morning Chris. Chris Sighinolfi : Thanks for the added color this morning also thanks to Walt and T. D. for the slide presentation and the added disclosure, it's very helpful to us. So I just want to say thanks. Terry Spencer : You are quite welcome. Chris Sighinolfi : Couple of questions, I guess the follow on with where the screen going originally, the slide 4 where you have the volumetric data since the April update, clearly the Bakken NGL volumes are up materially from April end of July and you expected peak rates for the fourth quarter. You mentioned Terry the effects of reduced ethane rejection and interruptible volumes on 2Q and the guidance. But the wondering sort of those factors 2Q with an upside price for you on those fronts. So what are you seeing in the Bakken and I guess what gives you confidence with the forecast and could we see further upside from the products that you mentioned as we move into the back half? Terry Spencer : Well Chris I mean we have increased confidence because our producers are performing and we continue to have lots of discussions to get a better understanding of where they are and what their plans are and they are executing those plans and as we said they are continuing to improve their cost structure and improve their technology and really significantly outperformed even in the midst of slight rig reductions in some cases. So we've got good visibility into the quarter and that's the reason why we feel so confident about the volumes. That plays right into the natural gas liquids segment particularly as we produced more natural gas liquids out of the Rocky's and we produced more natural gas liquids out of the Mid-Continent that benefits the NGL segment. So it's about visibility, it's about continued communication with these producers. Chris Sighinolfi : And so on the, I guess the downstream spec element, the Sheridan\u2019s comments. Is there further upside on that element, what you saw in Q2 and thus far in 3Q? Or are we fairly comfortable with their specs look like given base level and production volumes on is different? Sheridan Swords : Well, one thing I would say is that in 2Q we discovered that we stated the ethane recovery or decreased ethane rejection in June, so you would have a full three months in the third quarter and full three months in the fourth quarter. So we think the level of ethane, or close to the level ethane that we were extracting today, is enough to bring these products into the spec and we can handle and get into the end use market. Chris Sighinolfi : Sticking with that slide, slide number four, for a moment, it seems like the steepest projected ramp in July volumes to year end is on the West Texas system. So I just had a couple questions there. First, what is driving the ramp? Two, it looks also like the blended tariff rate on the system maybe came up a penny from the April update. I'm wondering if that was due to any recontracting if I am over-reading or reading too much and it\u2019s something like there is something else going on. And then three, Terry you had mentioned when you bought that asset the potential to fractionate barrels coming off gathering Permian volumes. So just wondering when we might expect to see the approach of that effort or if you could give us something on it? Terry Spencer : The first thing I\u2019d say is July is down a little bit, the 2 15 is down a little bit from the fact that we had some outages on the system that caused the volume to be down. Also the reason the $0.04 we\u2019ve gone from $0.03 to $0.04 just because we have increased the tariff rates on the pipeline closer to market than from what it was. So you\u2019re seeing an increase in rates on the existing volume there. We continue to think that we\u2019ll have ramp up there as we talk to more producers out there and we think there is opportunity for that to grow. As you point out that the West Texas pipeline has the lowest margin on our system, so it doesn\u2019t have the biggest impact. Chris Sighinolfi : And then on the fractionation side of it longer-term, just give an update on where we stand. Terry Spencer : We continue to talk to producers and processors out in the Permian who are looking for a bundled service, not just transportation to fractionation and delivery into the end use market. So as we stated when we bought this pipeline, we think the ability to bring that bundled service to customers of the West Texas pipeline greatly enhance our ability to bring product to the line. And so we are in negotiations with various people on the line to be able to do that. Chris Sighinolfi : Sheridan, anything to talk about? Sheridan Swords : No, I didn\u2019t have anything to add, Chris. Chris Sighinolfi : I guess one final thing on the asset side, it looks like Stateline de-ethanizer was moved out a little bit. Given the comments around reduced ethane rejection, I'm just wondering what drove that and any and that that movement in time would have on cost or return. Kevin Burdick : The de-ethanizer was pushed back is regarding to the details of the design and it was really two drivers. One was as we work with our contractor. There was some long lead time equipment that got in and pushed the dates out a little bit. And then as we recast the dates when we apply for winter construction and looked at the efficiency we have when we run our projects through the winter, that cost us some time to -- don't think it will have a material impact on our \u201916 what we\u2019re thinking there. Chris Sighinolfi : One final thing for me, just, Derek, the 4.5 times debt to EBITDA leverage metric that you quoted, that is consistent with how we interpret the covenants on the credit facilities, is that right? Kevin Burdick : Yes, that\u2019s correct. It is exactly the way that we file with our banks for covenant compliance. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay, perfect. Thanks a lot for the added color today, guys, and congrats on a great quarter. Kevin Burdick : You bet. Thanks Chris. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Kristina Kazarian : Quick follow-up, first on leverage levels, can you talk -- I note you guys talked about this a little bit in two of the previous questions. But can you talk a little bit more about what I should be thinking on in terms of where the rating agencies want you guys to go on like a year-end run rate basis to keep an IG rating, and what that would mean for the use of the ATM or maybe even a block, and how you think about that given where the different currencies are trading right now? Derek Reiners : The agencies I think have put out some guidance for us in their most recent updates. I think Moody's talks about a 4.5 times and S&P talks about 4.25 to be in those ranges. So certainly we think about that as we consider our equity needs during the year. We\u2019ve said many times the ATM has been a good tool for us and certainly would expect to continue to use that in the future. But again, we have to kind of balance the balance sheet needs, the leverage with the issuing equity at a higher yield certainly than we would like to see. And of course as to additional you pay distributions on those units and so that impacts your coverage. So it's a balance and certainly we have regular communications with the agencies and let them know what our plans are. Kristina Kazarian : And then bigger picture, I know we often talk about the desire to move more from POP to fee-based and to kind to get the business and at some in time you said you guys have sustained like the one-time coverage just off fee-based. I know you mentioned, again say in the press release but can we talk about progress that's been made there and time frame to that actually occurring in your mind? Terry Spencer : Yes, I will just make a high level comment. It's going very well. Producers are engaged with us. We've had success. We've had some contracts. We are converted more to a fee-based structure than POP. So we are expanding the fee-based component and shrinking the commodity sensitive component that's gone -- it's gone well. Producers, they want additional services, other things added to their contracts with us, other features and we are working with them on those. So it's going well. When you think about the regions in which we operate and particularly in the Williston Basin, it's not like hundreds of contracts we're having to address, its key producers and just it's not a whole bunch of contracts, okay? So we expect to have some success as we continue to move forward, have success fairly quickly. Kristina Kazarian : And so when we think about that, is it like a '16, '17, '18, how just roughly frame enough maybe? Terry Spencer : Yes, it's going to be more of 2016 benefit to us. Kristina Kazarian : Perfect. Thanks guys. That was it from me today. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we will go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning and congratulations. Terry Spencer : Thanks Craig. Craig Shere : So when you -- in the last questioning when you were saying Terry 2016 benefit and some of the conversion to more fee-based from POP processing and contracting, is that to suggest that the vast majority if not all of the distribution could be covered by fee-base by then or is that more a longer term? Terry Spencer : Now that's Craig -- that would be a longer term proposition for us, okay. I think it's a practical goal, I think it makes more sense than perhaps trying to target a percentage of fee and percentage of commodity exposure but definitely it's a longer term goal. Craig Shere : Okay. And Derek expressed the balance between topping ATM and keeping in mind the practical yields these units are trading at in the public market. Even with today's gains I think we are at stair step of lower price point than what you got on the ATM issuances in the second quarter. Is there a point at which you are just not interested in public issuances and at which without considering major structural changes that the OKE free cash flow and balance sheet strength could be used to bridge funding needs for few quarters? Derek Reiners : Yes, Craig this is Derek. I think that's a good point. Certainly OKE has some additional cash on its balance sheet today and it has certainly got capacity to raise capital there at more attractive yields today. I think it is important to step back and think about the underlying assets of the Partnership and the types of projects that we have, even at these higher yields those projects make sense. And so it's something we certainly think about very often but and we could consider other types of securities other than just a common unit, we could consider -- OKE might consider participation in some form or fashion as well to help that need as well. Craig Shere : And Terry as we think about bottlenecks in infrastructure in terms of actually filling out the Bakken Express Pipeline, I know that right now at the $45 oil that's not what people are thinking about. But thinking overtime, filling up that pipeline at $0.30 plus pricing that\u2019s bundled pricing including all downstream infrastructure. Is the bottleneck there fractionation that would need to be added and how we should think about how much more fractionation is needed to fill up that pipe in terms of the full issue of ethane rejection? Terry Spencer : Well Craig it's a combination of both pipe and fractionation capacity. We are certainly not anywhere near to that point yet but if you think about it very broadly and longer term, if need to get to that kind of next stair step level of production assuming the prices stabilize and rebound, when we think about expanding that whole infrastructure it's got to be pipes, it's a combination of lubs, it's pumps and it's fractionation capacity you got potentially in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast. So you have to think about it broadly, I wouldn\u2019t characterize it as just one particular component. Craig Shere : And is there a bookmark you can give in terms of -- or book-ins you can give in terms of how billions of dollars of infrastructure we are talking about? Terry Spencer : I\u2019ll let Sheridan. Sheridan Swords : Well, what I would say, Craig, the other thing to realize is that fracs are not exclusive to one basin. Our system is we can move Y grade around. So would we have to add more fracs if we add more volume out of the Bakken? Possibly if we bring more volume as we\u2019re seeing more volume come out at the Scoop, the Stack and some of those areas, as that comes on that fills up our existing frac capacity as well, so it\u2019s go in there. But right now we think we have enough frac capacity for the volume on the Bakken today as it grows even in a C3 plus rejected volume. We do see a great opportunity out at the Central Oklahoma with the Stack and what\u2019s going on down there in the Scoop that we think -- we do think in the future we will be building more fracs. Craig Shere : On a separate note, I was a bit surprise the optimization margins weren't more robust in the quarter, because propane spreads actually got pretty decent even though ethane was pretty anemic still. Can you update us on your ability to capture specific propane differentials even amidst the anemic ethane margins? Sheridan Swords : Well, I think the biggest thing you have to look at is when you look at the propane differential through the second quarter -- you have to realize if you are going to the LONESTAR facility, which had the highest spread there\u2019s restrictions in getting to that facility. So a lot of what we were able to capture was between Conway and the non-TET or enterprise mark. So that was down cents per gallon from that. We continue to, on the propane side, we continue to convert a lot of our optimization capacity to fee-based. So when we do that that reduces our ability to get a wider spread on margins on what we do ship down there, because we have to ship more and more volume for our third-party people that have, we\u2019ve given them Belvieu access. Craig Shere : And just one more, the Bakken gathered NGL volumes are only forecast to rise 5% from July to the fourth quarter. But gathered volumes are guided to rise 14% from 2Q to 4Q. Can you elaborate on that? Sheridan Swords : The reason that gathered volumes are continuing to go up, it is definitely a growth out of our Bakken, but we also see growth coming out of the Mid-Continent as we continue to go forward on that. So I think that may be where you are seeing some of that growth happen. Craig Shere : I guess -- I am sorry, the first number was the NGL volumes and second was the guest gathered volumes all out of Bakken. Sheridan Swords : Okay. Kevin Burdick : Craig, this is Kevin. On the gathered volumes when you look at the information we provided in the quarter, that is not necessarily a quarterly average that\u2019s saying we will reach that capacity at some point. So, if you just do that math, that\u2019s not saying that there is a, what your number was that\u2019s the average growth, quarter-over-quarter, that just taking look at kind of a peak volume in the third quarter and a peak volume in the fourth quarter. Craig Shere : So the numbers are a bit apples and oranges. That helps. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Jeremy Tonet with J.P. Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is actually Chris on for Jeremy. I guess as noted earlier, I appreciate the color, extra color on the slide deck. When you look at the volume outlook for the second half of 2015 you noted that captured flare gas was one of the key drivers and you also have an inventory of about 145 million cubic feet a day in ONEOK's dedicated area. And so, we were wondering whether there would be -- whether that would be more weighted towards the second half of 2015 or how much of that goes into 2016? Terry Spencer : Well, yes, there is a considerable amount in the second half, but it certainly gives you considerable momentum going into 2016. So, it is going to carry you well into 2016 along with the newly completed wells and the backlog of uncompleted wells. So it is all kind of working together. Kevin, you got anything to add to that? Kevin Burdick : No, I would just -- the one statistic that I think is very interesting to kind of describe some of the improved performance is, if you look at the numbers provided by the state from January to May, oil production when up I think it was around 10,000 barrels a day. But gas production, which was basically flat or maybe a 1% increase, gas production actually went up about 150 million cubic feet a day during that same timeframe. So that demonstrates that as oil states flat with the improved gas to oil ratios, the improved performance gas oil ratios, the improved performance, the gas volumes have continued to go up. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, that's helpful. I guess moving to West Texas LPG, your JV partner there noted some pretty big expectations in terms of increased pipeline distributions. And so we\u2019re wondering, relative to your plans with that at the time of the acquisition, how are things trending? And with the recent tariff developments and your expectations for I guess returns going forward? Terry Spencer : Well, it is going very well. With the tariff increases as well as the volume prospects that we continue to develop, we\u2019ve got high expectations for the pipeline, it\u2019s a great fit with our existing infrastructure, it is of course putting in this premiere basin that we wanted to be in for some time and sets ourselves for continued growth. The performance from a financial perspective is going to improve significantly with these tariff increases and as the volumes continue to be added it's going to be -- it is and it is going to continue to be a major contributor to the segment's profit. Unidentified Analyst : So relative to your planned into time of the acquisition, would you say that's higher or? Terry Spencer : I think the -- what our expectations when we had the acquisition we're progressing right along those expectations. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks, it's helpful. And then I guess lastly from me. On the re-contracting front in terms of your percentage of proceed contracts. For 2016, would you expect any kind of lower returns from those contract negotiations or what kind of give and take do you have with producer customers in that regard. Anything there would be helpful? Terry Spencer : Well the strategy is to enhance our returns and obviously these contracts have been affected by the lower commodity price environment and certainly at these price levels and the resulting margins it makes it difficult to realize an acceptable return. So we are not going to sacrifice return and as we continue to work with these producers and provide enhanced services and we have demonstrated that we have been able to put contracts together that make sense and get our returns to an acceptable level. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. Appreciate the color. Terry Spencer : You bet. Operator : And we will go to John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Yes, good morning everybody and congrats on a nice quarter. Just coming back to the financing questions, you have indicated you are open to alternative approaches here. So I take it that you would also include things like subordinating yields, take units, perhaps even cash injections from OKE using OKE equity. Would that be fair? Terry Spencer : Yes, that would be fair. We continue to evaluate all of those levers. John Edwards : And then I am just curious on the projects that have been suspended Terry, kind of what's the thoughts behind those perhaps any color on when you think you would be able to bring those back into say execution mode? Terry Spencer : No specific dates at this particular point in time but again we continue to assess the current market environment which is very volatile and uncertain. It is -- and we continue to assess the environment and when the environment makes sense and when the producers need that capacity certainly we will fire those projects back up, okay. Right now we are continuing to -- we are still in a wait and see mode on those suspended projects. John Edwards : Okay and then just any thoughts regarding your plans with all the recent increases in M&A activity? Terry Spencer : Well, our plans are going to be the same. We are going to stay organically focused to the extent of we participate in M&A from a strategic asset standpoint that is we -- when people ask me about M&A I am like okay yes we are interested in M&A particularly as it relates to strategic asset acquisitions like our West Texas pipeline in the Permian. So yes we are going to stay active and focused and look at opportunities. But at the end of that day what happens out there in the M&A arena, we don\u2019t have a whole lot of control over that. We will just keep our heads down and stay focused and continue to drive risk out this business and serve our customers. John Edwards : Okay. Great. That's it from me. Thanks. Terry Spencer : Yes. Operator : Next is Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hi, thanks, so two quick ones. Just one more question on the West Texas LPG pipeline. When you acquired the asset you laid out a plan to spend a significant amount of capital over the next few years and expand the capacity of the line, obviously you have executed on increasing rate already. Has anything changed there or is that still all kind of on plan? Sheridan Swords : Hi Michael this is Sheridan. Yes, we have been talking to quite a few producers out there that will backstop expansion. So we are progressing as planned on that and we are very hopeful hear pretty soon that we will be able to come out and announce expansion of the pipeline. So the Permian has still been resilient. We are still seeing growth and we are getting most people call on us about trying to get on this platform, as we still think with the assets that we have we can be extremely competitive versus the marketplace out there. Michael Blum : And then just I apologize if I missed this but could you quantify the reduction in ethane rejection you saw this quarter? Sheridan Swords : In the Bakken is about 20,000 barrels a day in June. So that's 20,000 barrels a day in June, so you can put over about 7,000 barrels a day on average for the quarter. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : If this already been asked, if it has just tell me to go listen to -- look at the transcripts, but on the ethane rejection, why is it occurring now? What has changed in having to add more ethane in to help the spec? Terry Spencer : Well, Becca, I think the short answer, and I will let Sheridan follow-up, but I think the short answer is just the volume growth, significant volume growth that we kind of broke over to a point where the NGL production has gotten so big to the point where now this issue emerging is something significant. Sheridan Swords : Yes, I would say you are exactly right. It is fundamentally that we\u2019ve had end use people call us and say that the propane is off spec and we need to clean it up. Becca Followill : So, it is just you reached a tipping point? Sheridan Swords : Yes, that\u2019s right. Becca Followill : And then going forward, as you continue to produce volumes and you will have to produce more ethane in order to keep it in balance, is that correct? Sheridan Swords : It will be. We are working on a long-term plan that we can clean this up at our fractionators so that we do not have to continue to extract this ethane. But that is going to take some time to construct and get in place. But we are working, our engineers are working on a long-term solution. Terry Spencer : And the only thing I will add is that is not done for free. Becca Followill : So your shippers will have to pay for that? Terry Spencer : Likely so. Operator : And next line is Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : I just wanted to go back to the -- and I guess not to beat a dead horse. The percent of proceeds to fee based. Your fee-based rate ticked up to $0.39 from sort of the mid-30s this quarter. Is that related to your efforts to move towards more fee-based? Terry Spencer : I think the short answer is yes. Eric Genco : And I guess as I was looking at it last night, is the strategy then to move towards more of a fee-based cut or a hybrid contract structure where maybe if commodity prices are low you get an extra fee payment? Because your equity volumes for NGLs and for residue gas actually ticked up a bit relative to the overall production levels. And I would have thought if that was moving towards fee-based that that would have been down or flat. So, I was just curious to whether this is more of a hybrid move or whether this is a pure conversion. Kevin Burdick : Eric, this is Kevin. It will be -- it is a combination. I mean there we talk about converting to more of a fee-based margin. There are a variety of ways that we get there. One is, like you said, is just increasing the fees and increasing the POP percentages, that kind of trade-off. There is other ways that accomplish the same thing. So our goal, like Terry has talked previously, is each of our customers is different. They are looking for different services. Those different services may require different strategies in how we go about working with them to get to the right mix of what is that. But in all the scenarios, it does result in a higher fee, but it may not, a fee-based margin, but it may not necessarily correlate to a lower equity volume. Terry Spencer : And, Kevin, the only thing I would add to that is that when you think about our business as a whole, we\u2019re keenly focused on bringing new fee-based opportunities and fee-based projects to the table. And in Phil's business segment, as we mentioned in the remarks, the Roadrunner pipeline and its OWT expansion are important. And on OWT expansion, in particular, is a good example of the additional projects that have spun off as a result of this Roadrunner project in establishing a conduit to those markets in Mexico. So we\u2019ll be very focused and remain very focused on fee-based opportunities and that will help bring that fee-based percentage up as we go forward. Eric Genco : So is it fair to say then that that $0.39, at least, probably while commodity prices remain low, is probably fairly sticky at this point? And then perhaps as commodity prices recover maybe that falls back a little bit to where it should have been, but it doesn't matter because you have retained the upside in these contracts? Terry Spencer : No, I don't think so, Eric. I think that as we continue to renegotiate that fee should go up. So, yes, I don't think that that rate is going to be driven much by or affected much by a move in commodity prices. Eric Genco : And I had a couple other quick ones just to sort of -- some of the numbers you gave on the last quarter's conference call, and I think you repeated them, but I just want to double check. So there is about 900 drilled uncompleted wells in the Bakken right now and I think last quarter you said about 50% is on your acreage, so that is basically the same --? Terry Spencer : That is correct, roughly 50%. Eric Genco : And I think you said last quarter that there were 50 rigs drilling on your acreage. I was curious; did you give a number for that today? Terry Spencer : Yes, we did. Eric Genco : Okay, what was that? I'm sorry. I missed that. Terry Spencer : We\u2019re in the 40 range right now. Eric Genco : 40 range\u2026. Terry Spencer : Yes, and again that moves up and down. But all of that has been in line with our expectations. Eric Genco : Okay. Terry Spencer : The only thing I would add to that is keep in mind that these IP rates is the average initial production rates on these wells just continue skyrocket. And I was just reading some materials the other day from some of our customers or some of our producers rather, and it's really remarkable the improvement that we are seeing. So even if you see rig reductions we are seeing these increased IP rates that are more than offsetting some of those reductions. Eric Genco : I think that's fair, I think in some of the instances we've been looking at -- some assumptions it takes about 24 days to drill well and some of these things but we are hearing some things maybe it's fallen down to almost the 16 range for some people so. I guess we would count as not the end all be all that it used to be. Terry Spencer : Yes. Eric Genco : I also just wanted to ask real quick. Of the 900 drilling completed wells in the basin what you view is sort of being an equilibrium number for that? I mean there's always going to be some number of uncompleted wells and I was just curious overall for the basin what do you think is normal? Terry Spencer : That\u2019s a tough one to answer. I mean because especially as producers have shifted almost entirely now to kind of the multi-well pads and those stick a rig and at a spot and then drill several wells and that -- so you kind of have an artificial working inventory if you will of completed -- of uncompleted wells. I think there is some as we have talked with others in North Dakota is that 300, 400 ranges that will kind of always be there as a working inventory as long as you are at this kind of a rig count, you may be in that range. But again that can fluctuate as again as rigs move around and what, where and how they are drilling. Eric Genco : Okay. Well, thank you very much. That's all I had. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : We will go to Andy Gupta with HITE Hedge. And it appears he does not have a question. So we will go to Matt Niblack with HITE. Please go ahead. Matt Niblack : Hi. I just wanted to make sure I understood what you said at the beginning of the call properly that you had ample of liquidity particularly given how credit metrics are calculated by your borrowers that there is no need to issue okay equity at these FX valuations? Terry Spencer : Well I don\u2019t know that I have said that. We have been pretty clear that we expect to continue to issue equity as we balance our credit metrics with issuing at this price. Matt Niblack : Okay. But you said you're going at least avoid the disruptive overnight offering given the ATM program? Terry Spencer : Well I mean we talk about the overnight markets all the time and we certainly continue to look at that option. As we said many times the ATM program has worked pretty well for us. We were able to get quite a bit done in the second quarter, so to avoid that overnight market issue but I can't wool that out for you. Matt Niblack : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back for any additional or closing remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Our quite period for the third quarter starts when we close our books early October and extensive earnings are released after the market closes on November 3rd, followed by our conference call on November 4. Thank you for joining us and have a good day. Operator : Thank you very much and that does conclude our conference for today. I would like to thank everyone for your participation and have a great day.",

Eureste - Director Treasury and Finance Terry Spencer - President and Chief Executive Officer Derek Reiners - Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer Sheridan Swords - President Gathering and Fractionation Kevin Burdick - Vice president, Natural Gas Gathering & Processing, ONEOK Partners Analysts : Eric Genco - Citigroup Inc. Christine Cho - Barclays Capital Craig Schere - Tuohy Brothers Kristina Kazarian - Deutsche Bank Becca Followill - US Capital Advisors Operator : Good day and welcome to the Third Quarter 2015 ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to your host to Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning and thank you for joining us today and for your continued interest in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. As a reminder, key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 websites. Please refer to this presentation and to the earnings releases for various explanation and key metrics. Before we discuss our third quarter and operational updates I would like to reiterate our continued confidence in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ending the year within our 2015 guidance ranges. Additionally, we expect ONEOK partners to maintain 2016 distribution coverage of greater than 1.0 times and to significantly reduce our commodity exposure in the Gathering and Processing segment, as we remain confident in completing substantially all of our renegotiations on Williston Basin contracts in 2015, which we expect will increase our fee-based margin in the segment to more than 70% in 2016, up from approximately 50% in 2015. As we outlined our 2015 financial and volume growth expectations earlier in the year, we emphasize that the partnership\u2019s volumes and earnings will be weighted towards the second-half of the year. We saw this growth in the third quarter as we continue to see earnings growth sequentially and we reached record volumes in the Gathering and Processing segment, and Natural Gas Liquids segment in September. Even in these challenging market conditions our well-positioned 36,000 mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids pipeline network is providing growth opportunities in basins where we operate. We\u2019re executing on these opportunities by continuing to focus primarily on organic growth projects and initiatives that reduce or commodity exposure and make long-term economic and strategic sense for our business. Before I can give an update on our three segments, I would now turn the call over to Derek for a brief discussion of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners financials. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, our 2015 EBITDA contribution continues to increase sequentially as anticipated. We expect EBITDA to once again be higher in the fourth quarter 2015 and to be within our 2015 financial guidance EBITDA range for the year. The partnerships\u2019 third quarter EBITDA of just over $400 million increased 4% compared with the same period in 2014, in spite of a nearly 67% drop in NGL prices. For the third quarter, coverage ratio improved to 0.91 times coverage, a substantial improvement when you consider the increased number of units outstanding following our large equity offering in August. We did accelerate the timing of the issuance from our original plans. Additionally, the partnership\u2019s third quarter EBITDA and coverage ratio were impacted negatively by approximately $16 million in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, and Natural Gas Liquids segments combined, due to unplanned operational outages at the partnership\u2019s natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Williston Basin. Terry will provide more detail on this in his remarks. The partnership has a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our current capital program, including access to our commercial paper program and credit facility. Leverage is also reduced with higher EBITDA and the recent equity issuance. As of September 30, ONEOK partners had an adjusted debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.3. The partnership remains committed to its investment-grade credit rating and will continue to make prudent financial decisions to protect the balance sheet. In August, the partnership raised $750 million of equity from ONEOK and funds managed by Kayne Anderson Capital Advisors, one of the partnership\u2019s largest institutional unitholders. This equity issuance fulfilled the partnership\u2019s 2015 equity needs and is expected to satisfy equity needs well into 2016. Before we move on to ONEOK, I\u2019d like to point out our reduced commodity price sensitivity resulting from the contract restructuring efforts in our gathering and processing segment. As we restructure contracts to more fee-based arrangements our exposure to commodity prices will be reduced. As a result of the restructuring, we have realigned the partnership\u2019s natural gas volumes hedged to reflect the revised natural gas equity volumes expected in 2016, and have provided updated hedging tables and sensitivities in the news release. At ONEOK our liquidity remains strong with all of our $300 million credit facility available and a very strong third quarter dividend coverage ratio of 1.34 times. ONEOK increased its investment in the partnership by using proceeds from a $500 million notes offering and cash on hand to purchase $650 million of ONEOK Partners\u2019 units. ONEOK also contributed approximately $15 million to maintain its 2% general partner interest in ONEOK Partners. With the increased ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners and at the current distribution levels, annual distributions received from the partnership are expected to increase by more than $100 million. In October, ONEOK increased its dividend by $0.01 per share or 2% to $0.615 cents per share, resulting in an annualized dividend of $2.46 per share. ONEOK\u2019s decision to increase the dividend reflects the partnership\u2019s expected natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth, the success in re-contracting efforts, and the recent investment in ONEOK Partners. We continue to have confidence in the partnership\u2019s ability to execute its growth strategies, allowing ONEOK to enhance its dividend. This concludes my remarks. Terry will now take a closer look at each of our business segments. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Starting with our natural gas liquids segment, the segment continued its earnings growth over the second quarter 2015 as natural gas liquids volumes increased in our highest margin areas. We continue to see strong natural gas liquids volume growth in the Williston Basin and in the Mid-Continent\u2019s Cana-Woodford Shale, Stack and SCOOP areas. In the Williston Basin, we are reaching record natural gas liquids, gathered volumes quicker than we had originally expected, and increased the amount Bakken NGL pipeline volumes we expect to reach in the fourth quarter by 10,000 barrels per day from our previous target. In the Mid-Continent we\u2019ve increased the fourth quarter NGL gathered volume we expect to reach by 40,000 barrels per day from our previous target. This increase represents spot volumes we anticipate in order to meet customer needs in the fourth quarter. Moving on to our fractionated volumes, we continue to see increased ethane fractionated due to decreased ethane rejection in the Williston Basin in the third quarter. And we expect decreased levels of ethane rejection to continue. We also saw more than 23,000 barrels per day of incremental spot volumes on our system in the third quarter as we were able to utilize our fractionation assets to meet customer demand. We expect to see increased levels of incremental spot volume on our system throughout the remainder of the year and expect to reach approximately 645,000 barrels per day fractionated in the fourth quarter. This represents an increase of 65,000 barrels per day from our previous target, of which approximately 40,000 barrels per day are spot volumes. And finally, in recent weeks we have seen Conway to Mont Belvieu ethane price differentials range from $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon and we expect this range to continue for the remainder of this year. Our Natural Gas Pipelines business continues to provide the partnership with primarily fee-based earnings in long-term firm demand contracts. As of the third quarter, this segment was approximately 97% fee-based, with additional move primarily fee-based projects underway. One of these new projects is the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project, which reached an important milestone this quarter when it received approval for a presidential permit and authorization from the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The permit allows for the construction and operation of the border-crossing pipeline, which will export natural gas from the Permian Basin in west Texas to Mexico. Construction is underway and we still expect the first phase to be complete during the first quarter 2016. The natural gas gathering and processing segments third quarter results increased sequentially from the second quarter to the third quarter 2015 and we expect a very strong fourth quarter. We already hit record volumes in September in the Williston Basin and our largest producer in the Mid-Continent is making progress completing wells drilled in the first half of the year. Let\u2019s take a closer look at the Williston Basin. Starting off with well connects, we connected more than 720 wells through the third quarter, exceeding our original 2015 target of 700 wells. We are increasing our 2015 well connect target to 825 wells by year-end, which will bring additional volumes to our system in the remainder of 2015 and into 2016. We are reaching record natural gas gathered volumes quicker than we had originally expected. These volumes are the result of multiple factors, including increased well connects, the completion of three of our six compression projects, continued improvements in well performance, and the inventory of flared gas available to capture on our acreage dedication. We saw natural gas gathered volumes reached 685 million cubic feet per day in September, which we previously expected to reach in the fourth quarter. We now expect to reach 710 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter in advance of our 200 million cubic foot per day Lonesome Creek plant coming online. In North Dakota, we continue to actively participate on the flaring task force, which provides policy and flaring target recommendations to the North Dakota Industrial Commission, or the NDIC. The NDIC recently passed updated gas capture percentages and timing, as well as providing a 90-day bank concept for producers who exceed the gas capture targets. These changes are not expected to have a material impact on our volume growth into 2016. While we continue to estimate 145 million cubic feet per day of flared gas on our acreage dedications, we expect that the additional capacity from our Lonesome Creek and Bear Creek plants and associated pipelines and compression projects will deliver the necessary infrastructure to assist our customers in staying well above the NDIC gas capture targets. In the Mid-Continent, our largest producer in the Cana-Woodford did experience minor timing delays in well completion. However, we continue to be on track to reach 910 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. With another quarter complete, we have continued confidence in the success of our contract restructuring efforts. We have renegotiated many contracts to significantly increase the fee-based components and continue to actively work with our producers to similarly restructure additional contracts. We are starting to see the average fee rate increase in our financial results. For the third quarter, the segment reported a $0.43 average fee rate, which is nearly a 20% increase compared with a year ago. We expect this rate to significantly increase as we complete substantially all of our Williston Basin contract renegotiations in 2015 and receive the full benefit of the increased fee-based margins in 2016. Operationally, we expect our Lonesome Creek plant to be completed by the end of this month, and as we complete the startup process, we expect the facility to start ramping up in mid-December. We also expect to complete the remaining three compressor stations in the fourth quarter, which will provide the infrastructure for Lonesome Creek to be approximately half-full by the second quarter 2016. As I already pointed out, our natural gas volumes are at record highs earlier than anticipated. This is the result of both new and existing wells performing better than anyone anticipated in the Williston Basin and our seasoned operators working diligently to maximize our assets not only in the Williston, but across our 36,000-mile integrated system. Our company has a history of operating safely and reliably. However, the occasional mechanical-related outage will occur, resulting in downtime. As mentioned previously, we did experience some unplanned operational outages this quarter at several of our natural gas gathering and processing facilities in the Williston Basin, which were resolved. This downtime allowed us to complete work that will help us further improve our mechanical reliability and runtime. The Partnership\u2019s volume growth through the first nine months of the year has provided us the ability to increase the target natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes we expect to reach in the fourth quarter. And as we have seen our volume expectations met and in some cases exceeded, we have been able to confidently reaffirm our financial guidance ranges for 2015. Our volume growth through the end of 2015, combined with the success we have had converting portions of our commodity-exposed margin to fee-based earnings, is positively positioning our business through these challenging times. Before I finish with our opening remarks, I would like to comment on another topic relating to the notion of a C-Corp general partner acquiring the master limited partnership it controls, also commonly referred to as a rollup transaction. We have seen a number of these rollups either announced or completed over the past year and we continue to field questions regarding our interest level in pursuing such a transaction. As I\u2019ve stated a number of times in the past, we remain focused on executing our key strategies to enhance shareholder and unitholder value by, among other things, reducing commodity price exposure, improving margins, enhancing our cost of capital, and growing earnings while providing quality services to our customers. Additionally, we continue to evaluate structural alternatives and strategic acquisition opportunities that may or may not make sense for us. The idea of a rollup of ONEOK Partners into ONEOK is one such alternative that we continue to evaluate, while monitoring the various announced rollup transactions for relevant market data and commentary. As I have said before, our current structure continues to serve us well and remain committed to investors at both ONEOK and at the Partnership to create value and reduce risk. In December, we plan to provide ONEOK\u2019s and ONEOK Partners\u2019 preliminary financial and volume guidance expectations for 2016. As always, thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and thank you to our dedicated employees for your hard work and continued commitment to our company. Your innovative ideas and reliable operations continue to strengthen our business and allow us to better serve our customers while navigating these uncertain times. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instruction] We\u2019ll take our first question from Eric Genco with Citigroup. Eric Genco : Hi. Congrats on the progress on the POP to fee negotiations. It is good to see some of those benefits trickling in ahead of 2016. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Eric. Eric Genco : That said, I just want to focus a little bit on the outage and the volume outlook you provided kind of over the last two quarters in the earnings presentation, and I mostly just want to make sure that I\u2019m not misinterpreting some of these numbers so I don\u2019t accidentally set a bar a little too high on some of them. If you look at the 3Q NGL gathered volume numbers through-786 [ph], versus the ones on Page 4 of the PowerPoint, I assume that the delta there has to do with the outage. And I just want to see, as we look into some of the 4Q numbers that you\u2019re talking about in terms of being reached, how you think that should compare with sort of an average number, particularly as you\u2019re kind of including some spot volumes in there? Sheridan Swords : Obviously, the reach number is actually what we anticipate we will max at, the max volume we will get on our system, not an average. So the average will be less than that over the quarter and the spot volumes are not for the whole quarter. They\u2019re only for a certain period of the quarter. So, you will see it down on average. Eric Genco : Okay. I mean, is it of order of magnitude similar to what we saw in the third quarter or is there some way that you can provide that or - because I just feel like sometimes if that is sitting there, then people may sort of interpret that and just want to try to get a sense for how to triangulate that. Sheridan Swords : I would say it\u2019s probably - our gathered volume is probably maybe around 5%. The average is 5% down from the peak. Eric Genco : Okay, all right, that\u2019s very helpful. And then, I guess, next so I was interested in, I guess, maintenance CapEx is tracking below the full-year guidance of 142. Should we expect a major catch-up in 4Q? Or is 142 is still the right number, that would kind of imply 4Q maintenance CapEx at double the rate of the first nine months. Is that reasonable or how should we be thinking about that? Derek Reiners : This is Derek. We are expecting maintenance capital to be a little bit lower than the $142 million that we previously guided. I think we\u2019re looking about $130 million. That\u2019s lower mostly just due to timing as well as being able to get the projects done a bit less costly than we had previously indicated just based on cost compression primarily. Eric Genco : Okay. All right, well, thank you very much. I appreciate it. Congrats. Terry Spencer : Yes. Thanks, Eric. Operator : We\u2019ll next hear from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone. Congrats on a good quarter. You are - I wanted to talk about your well connects first. You guys are connecting 125 more wells than originally anticipated earlier this year. It looks like the DUCs are also continuing to grow, yet rig count has fallen substantially. We all hear about oil services guys doing more with less. Do you have any productivity metrics you can share with us, maybe, how many days it takes to drill and complete a well back now versus January? Terry Spencer : Yes Christine. Yes, we do. I mean, maybe not specific to January but most definitely we see efficiencies really at all levels when you think about the producers and what they\u2019re able to accomplish especially in the Williston. From a rig efficiency perspective if you think historically over maybe couple years ago they were drilling, each rig would be able to drill 12 to 14 wells per year now they\u2019re up on average maybe in the 18 to 20 wells per year range. Cost reductions have been consistent across producers in the 20% to 30% range as they\u2019re able to lower the cost to drilling complete wells and then just the performance the completion technologies that are used now we\u2019re seeing 30% to 40% improvements in IP rates over the last six to 12 months. So, the combination of all those factors really absolutely, they\u2019re able to do more or less. Christine Cho : Okay great. And then on the west Texas LPG pipeline volumes it look like those were revised lower for the fourth quarter versus what you guided us towards last quarter. Can you talk about what\u2019s going on there is the production behind your system is slowing or is there something else? I\u2019m just a little surprised, it\u2019s come down given I thought you guys have the cheapest rate in the region and also what do you do for the timing of the expansions for the pipeline? Terry Spencer : Kristine, what I would say is that the main reason we dropped that down is we\u2019re not seeing the short-haul volume out in west Texas we had anticipated it would come on. Now, that\u2019s our lowest margin volume out there so it is just going from certain spot in west Texas to other spot in west Texas. And here, we did see a slight reduction in long-haul volumes when we increased our rates and on the subject of lowest rates in the region in July, we increased our rates up there and brought them more in line with markets. And so, that\u2019s why we saw little bit of this movement on the short-haul volume. Christine Cho : Does that change the - you\u2019re thinking about the expansions on the pipe? Terry Spencer : The expansions will be driven by now, the expansions are driven by new plants being put on out there and we\u2019re still in active negotiations with processors out there to back that expansion and they\u2019re still going well. So, I don\u2019t think that has any impact on our expansions. Mainly, our expansion would be a long-haul expansion not have anything to do with the short-haul volume. Christine Cho : Okay. When do you expect the pipeline to be expanded, just on your current conversations? Terry Spencer : As when we get the ink on paper, but we\u2019re probably looking into 2017. Christine Cho : Okay. And then, I just wanted to go to your comments on the spot volumes. It looks like you guys are seeing some on the NGL system, the gathering, and also fractionation volumes. What is driving this exactly and why would this go away in 2016? Terry Spencer : Well, the spot volumes are being driven by some frac outages in Mont Belvieu and also volume that is anticipating some new fracs being come on that will come on in the later 4Q. So, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t think it will be into 2016, this specific one. Now, we do see some opportunities from some spot volume in first quarter that it would be different spot volume, but it\u2019s really just volume that has a home, but unfortunately the frac feeder had some issues or the frac is not up yet. Christine Cho : Okay, and then lastly, at the parent level when I think about the dividend, you guys are going to see increased cash flow from higher LP unit count and NGP, but how should we think about the increases for the parent? You guys talk about navigating through uncertain times. How should we think about how much you want to keep on the balance sheet just in case you guys do have to help out OKS again next year if things don\u2019t materially improve? Derek Reiners : Yes Christine, this is Derek. Really, no change in our stance here as we did earlier in the year we still expect to retain additional cash at ONEOK as we go through this on certain times, there is value to that and having optionality down the road. So, I wouldn\u2019t expect a big change at this point in our approach. Terry Spencer : And Christine this is Terry. We\u2019ll discontinue to look at it quarter-to-quarter as we said in the past the environment continues to be very uncertain. And so, really in that respect nothing changed. So, I guess we continue to look at it quarter-to-quarter and assist the market environment. Christine Cho : Okay. Thank you for all the color. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move on to Craig Schere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Schere : Good morning. Congratulations on\u2026 Terry Spencer : Hey, Craig. Craig Schere : Good volume guidance here. So on Christine\u2019s question about drivers for increased well connects, do you see some of this better two-half performance working down the flaring versus what you originally anticipated by year-end? Kevin Burdick : Well, as I think about well connect this is Kevin. We think about well connects lot of the increase the increase is really driven. We had really higher than expectations early in the year with the well connects. As we move forward and we think about the well connects for the rest of this year yes, those will connect wells that will be coming on line some point the near future and it\u2019s the combination of those, but then also when we get the infrastructure in place we will have the, that\u2019s really what will pull the flaring numbers down if that is getting at your question. Craig Schere : Okay. So when those plants come online, that\u2019s still available there. My concern was that we aren\u2019t missing out on that buffer there. We are not counting what might be hitting in 2016 and the second half 2015 is what I\u2019m getting at. Terry Spencer : I guess on we struggle a little bit. We think about the, it\u2019s the combination of the well connects in the flared gas, we don\u2019t necessarily bucket the well connects is going to put up the flares as we put more infrastructure in place with our three more compressor stations in fourth quarter and the Lonesome Creek plant as we connect new wells as the drill completed backlog comes down that infrastructure will be there to capture the volumes. So, we absolutely expect our flaring, our gas capture to go up and our flare percentage to go down, does that answer your question Craig? Craig Schere : Yes, I think that does. And can you provide some more details about the ethane recovery? Is that increasing off the 20,000 a day that started in June? Terry Spencer : The ethane recovery out of the Bakken is running about 22,000 barrels a day. Craig Schere : Okay. And we\u2019re making a lot of great headway on the contractor structuring in the Bakken obviously, you had a lot of leverage there, because the wet gas is very small portion of wells and you needed to get those wells in compliance. How do you see prospects from a continent contractor structures? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin here. The Williston the Bakken gets a lot of focus as we talk about contracting efforts, but we\u2019re making great progress in Oklahoma as well it is obviously a much different competitive landscape. As we think about the producers there and we\u2019ve got a different customer mix when we think about dealing there is a lot more contracts with smaller volumes and so, but we\u2019re actively pursuing opportunities to convert more of our margin to fee based in the Mid-Continent, just like we are in the Williston. Terry Spencer : Craig, the only thing I want to add to that is that the thing you have to understand is the Williston basin there is only about 10 contracts they represented 75% of our line. So, we\u2019re not talking about hundreds of contracts when you go to the Mid-Continent though you are talking about hundreds and hundreds of contracts. And so, from a pragmatic standpoint or practical standpoint as you look forward we\u2019re trying to restructure contracts in the Mid-Continent as we\u2019re doing in the Williston you got some, you just got a lot more contracts lot more producers and the volumes under those contracts are much smaller. So, it create some practical challenges in terms of trying to get that done obviously, and that\u2019s in addition to the competitive landscape is the point that Kevin brought up. Craig Schere : Understood. And last question, given the increasing prospects out of the Bakken and the volume guidance rising, what are the prospects for bringing back onto the table some of the deferred projects up there? Particularly given the needs that are only extended, I think, a few months versus originally I was thinking maybe a couple years in terms of that flaring compliance, it seems the producers don\u2019t have forever to wait on these decisions. Terry Spencer : Yes Craig. As we said in the past on these suspended projects if we could see sustained prices crude oil prices in that $65, $70 range there is a good likelihood that drilling will stimulate and the demand for that capacity will come back. And so, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about it right now. We\u2019re not there obviously in this current environment we\u2019re not there yet, but certainly we\u2019re hopeful that we can\u2019t get there and clearly our view is that prices will improve the trick, obviously is how much and when. But yes, if we can see that $65 to $70 barrel range. I think it\u2019s very likely we could kick those projects back on. Craig Schere : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll move on to Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Kristina Kazarian : Hi guys. Nice job on the increase in operating income number from contract mix. Terry Spencer : Thanks. Kristina Kazarian : Quick question, though, Terry, I know you mentioned expecting substantially all of these to be renegotiated. Can you just help me think about the uplift relative to where we are in the process? So, say we\u2019re at 10, have two changed or is it more like we\u2019re at the point of eight now? Terry Spencer : Well actually, I will let Kevin handle that question Kristina. Kevin Burdick : Well, with that getting into specifics we have made a lot of progress I think you are seeing some of that already reflected in our financials, I would expect to see continued improvements in the fourth quarter and then the full effect will get in 2016, but we are at or ahead of really where we expected to be in that process as we move towards the end of the year. Terry Spencer : The only thing I would add to that Kristina is the negotiations have gone well the producers absolutely they need the services, they need other features that they currently don\u2019t have in their contracts discussions their negotiations who have been very constructive and we\u2019re well down the road to getting this all wrapped up by the end of the year. So, progress is good and discussions have been very positive. Kristina Kazarian : Great. And then, can you guys help me - walk me through the one-time coverage for calendar-year 2016 guidance? How do you guys get there? What should I be thinking about in terms of - I know you haven\u2019t given formal 2016 guidance yet, but like commodity growth assumptions that go into that? Is it like, for the entire year one times coverage or is it hit this at some point in calendar-year 2016? Anything there would be great. Terry Spencer : Yes, Kristina. Yes, we have every intention of providing in early to mid-December our 2016 outlook, so we will have a lot of that information for you in terms of volumes. Now we have already provided some volume transparency for 2016, but we will have - in December of this year, we will have all that put together and for guidance purposes and we will have - we will release that mid-December or so. Kristina Kazarian : Thank you there, and then lastly for me, can you just give an update on the balance sheet and how conversations are going with the rating agencies, especially at the OKS level? Derek Reiners : .: Kristina Kazarian : Okay, thanks, guys. Nice job today. Derek Reiners : Thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll move onto Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Hey, Jeremy. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. This is actually Chris on for Jeremy. Congrats on the strong quarter. Terry Spencer : Hey, Chris. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. So my question was - my first question is on contract restructuring. So you guys already had G&P volumes or G&P average fee rates increased about 20% in 3Q. And so, I\u2019m just trying to get a better understanding of how that run rate is going to change going into the fourth quarter and how much potential upside there is looking into 2016? Kevin Burdick : Jeremy, this is Kevin. As we - like I just mentioned, as we move into the fourth quarter, yes, you would expect to continue to see that fee rate to improve and go up, and even further as we move into 2016. We\u2019ve given the margin mix, what we expect of a 70% \u2013more than 70% fee in 2016, but beyond that, getting into specific margins, we will see more as we issue our guidance coming up. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And so you guys noted that the Williston\u2019s contract restructurings should be done by year-end, so could we think of 3Q as maybe more than 50% baked in or? Kevin Burdick : I will just go back to my previous remarks that as we move forward through this, we\u2019re where we are at or where we expected we would be at this point, and we still feel very confident that we are going to get those substantially all complete by the end of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Great. That\u2019s helpful. And then I guess on Bakken flaring, I guess you have seen some regulations pushed back, and so do you see any additional risks to potential regulatory changes there? Kevin Burdick : No, we don\u2019t, I mean as we think about the gas capture targets as we bring on our Lonesome Creek facility, that is going to - there will be a step change as we think about our gas capture behind our system, and then with Bear Creek coming online in the third quarter of 2016, we will see another step change down, and that kind of lines up with the gas capture target increases, so we feel very good about being able to provide the services so that our customers will stay well above that. Unidentified Analyst : And then on your natural gas liquids pipeline operating margins per barrel, those slightly declined over the quarter. And so, Bakken actually was increased as a percentage of the volume pie and so I was just trying to get an understanding of the drivers there. Derek Reiners : The decrease in the margin. Unidentified Analyst : Correct. Derek Reiners : We\u2019ve had more volume come out of the Powder River. We have had some increased volume come out of the Powder River. We\u2019ve had some increase of volume out of the Powder River portion which has a lower fee on those barrels. And then, we have had some other volumes come on that have some Conway pricing. So they don\u2019t have some highest margin as well, so it\u2019s - that\u2019s kind of what\u2019s driving that down just slightly. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. I think that\u2019s it for me. Thanks guys. Thanks for all the color. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll move on to Becca Followill with US Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : Hey, guys. Terry Spencer : Hey, Becca. Derek Reiners : Hey, Becca. Becca Followill : On back on the Bakken and Williston re-contracting, I know that you value your customer relationships dearly, but can you talk a little bit about how that\u2019s impacted by effectively raising the rates and how the new rates compare with some competitors in the region? Are you still competitive or does it hurt long-term relationships? Terry Spencer : Well, let me just make a general comment, Becca. No, we don\u2019t believe that will. As an industry, we have been through this cycle many times and we have been through these - we went through this cycle in the early 2000 timeframe, renegotiating keep-whole contracts actually the POPs, in many cases. And so, now, here we are today. So, those relationships, yes, anytime you go through the contract renegotiation effort it can create some stress on a relationship. But the fact of the matter is that the producers value quality service. And as long as we continue to provide quality service, our relationships are going to be good. And that\u2019s what we have done up there. There is nobody else up in the basin that really can provide that broad range of service that we provide, which includes the natural gas liquids in addition to the gathering and processing services we provide. So we\u2019re differentiated in that respect. And not only from the quality of services but obviously our sheer size. So, really no, we have worked - we could have taken an approach that was much more abrupt, but we have chosen to take a very positive and proactive approach, giving the producers the opportunity to talk with us and tell us what their specific needs are. And so it\u2019s - so it\u2019s been a fairly long process throughout this year, and I think our producers appreciate that positive dialogue. So no, we don\u2019t believe that our producer relationships have been damaged or set back in any way. Becca Followill : Thank you. And then, great volume guidance for the fourth quarter and then going into 2016, but, of course, we always want more. So much of 2015 and 2016 was driven by the flaring capture and new plants coming online and compression. But, do you have any preliminary outlook for 2017 if we are in a sustained $45 to $50 oil price environment? Terry Spencer : Yes. Actually, Becca, no, we have not provided that publicly. We continue to - our belief is that the environment is going to get much better. And as we see production turnover start to happen, I think it\u2019s going to be very abrupt as we move into, when I say production I\u2019m talking about crude oil from macro perspective. So really, we don\u2019t see that $40 environment sustaining out into that period of time. That\u2019s probably as aggressive this will get on an outlook that far out. But we really not have provided any sort of public guidance in 2017 yet. The outlook for 2016 still looks very solid and so we don\u2019t see - we don\u2019t expect any sort of significant downturn as we move to the latter part of the year, which would set you up for a lower 2017. We really don\u2019t see that. Becca Followill : Okay. Great. Thank you, guys. Terry Spencer : You bet. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Mr. Eureste, we have no further questions at this time. I would like turn the conference back over to you for any additional or further remarks. T.D. Eureste: Thank you. Our quite period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until earnings are released after the market closes on February 22, followed by a conference call on February 23. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And, ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude today\u2019s conference. Thank you for your participation.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. T. D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T. D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and yearend 2015 earnings conference call. A reminder, that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Security Acts of 1933 and 1934.

Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T. D. Good morning, and thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest in investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, our Chief Financial Officer; Wes Christensen, Senior Vice President, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. Additional key financial and operational information has been updated in a short presentation and is posted on ONEOK's and ONEOK Partners' websites. Let's start by discussing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners accomplishments in 2015. Then I'll hand it off to Derek for financial update, and finish by reviewing our 2016 financial guidance, which we maintained for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners in last night's release. Our uniquely-positioned assets delivered higher ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and 2015 adjusted EBITDA in a very challenging market, and we delivered on our expectation to significantly grow natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes and earnings in the second half of the year. The partnership grew its adjusted EBITDA throughout the year by nearly 40% from the first quarter to the fourth quarter 2015, ending the year with $450 million in fourth quarter adjusted EBITDA. The partnership also improved its quarterly distribution coverage to 1.03x. These results were driven by a significant ramp in natural gas volumes gathered and processed across our system, especially in Williston Basin, as we connected more than 820 additional wells; captured more flared volumes from existing wells; completed six field compression projects and our Lonesome Creek natural gas processing plant; and restructured several contracts earlier than expected; and in the Mid-Continent volumes increased late in the year as a large producer customer completed wells that had been drilled earlier in the year. The Natural Gas Liquids segment, which is connected to more than 180 natural gas processing plants, continued to benefit from natural gas liquids processed volume growth in Williston Basin. Seven new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in 2015. We also realized solid volume performance on our West Texas LPG pipeline system from our long haul customers as we continued to provide quality service at a good value. With nearly 100% of its earnings fee-based, the Natural Gas Pipeline segment had another solid year. This segment is taking advantage of incremental demands due to lower natural gas prices through its uniquely positioned assets with the announcements of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline and WesTex Pipeline expansion, serving growing markets in Mexico. In 2015, we made significant progress toward reducing commodity risk in our business, which is expected to reduce earnings volatility over the long-term. As a result, we expect 2016 fee-based earnings to be approximately 85%, a significant improvement from 66% in 2014. Drivers of this increase include, growing the fee-based exchange services volumes in the Natural Gas Liquids segment and contract restructuring in the Gathering and Processing segment. The efforts of contract restructuring in the Gathering and Processing segment can be seen by the increase in our average fee rate. The average fee rate for the fourth quarter 2015 was $0.55, a nearly 60% increase compared with $0.35 in the first quarter 2015. At ONEOK, we remain committed to being a supportive general partner, as evidenced by the $650 million equity investment in the partnership in mid-2015, which we expect to result in increased distributions from ONEOK's higher ownership percentage in ONEOK Partners. Our extensive integrated network of natural gas and natural gas liquids assets delivered solid results in 2015 and has positioned us well for 2016. That concludes my opening remarks. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thanks, Terry. I'll start by highlighting the financial steps we took in 2015 and early-2016 that positioned us well for 2016 and into 2017. With a high priority on maintaining the partnership's investment grade credit ratings, we took decisive steps to manage its balance sheet by high grading its growth projects and reducing capital spending by nearly $1.6 billion in 2015 from our original 2015 capital guidance. We issued $750 million of equity in August, along with nearly $280 million of additional equity through the at-the-market program during 2015. Termed out $800 million of short-term debt in March and most recently entered into a $1 billion three-year unsecured term loan, which effectively refinances the 2016 long-term debt maturities at a low cost. With the financial steps we've taken and the momentum and volume growth and earnings leading into 2016, we expect to achieve our 2016 financial guidance. At ONEOK Partners, we expect not to need public debt or equity issuances well into 2017, which includes no equity from the aftermarket equity program to keep distributions flat for the year, deliver distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016, and obtain GAAP debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2x or less by late 2016. At ONEOK, we expect to keep this dividend flat for the year, pay no cash income taxes in 2016, and generate approximately $160 million of free cash flow after dividends in 2016, which along with $90 million of cash at the end of 2015 provides ONEOK with significant flexibility to support ONEOK Partners, if needed. For growth capital in 2016, we expect to spend $320 million in the Gathering and Processing segment, and $70 million each in the Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Pipelines segments for a total of $460 million as previously guided. As producer needs evolve throughout the balance of the year and into 2017, we have the flexibility to significantly reduce growth capital, particularly in the Gathering and Processing segment as we optimize our systems and available capacity. Additionally, we have been able to realize reduced operating costs and capital costs from our service providers across our operations. We continue to control operating costs and have reduced contract labor. We expect this trend to continue into 2016. As it relates to maintenance, capital expenditures we take a conservative approach. We're extremely careful not to underestimate expenditures when establishing guidance of spending for the integrity and reliability of our assets. It is very important to the partnership's success. Over the long-term, our assets have operated very reliably as a result of this approach. In 2015, a number of our large maintenance projects came in significantly under budget, especially the projects scheduled towards the second half of 2015 as service providers reduced costs and did very aggressively due to market conditions. On the topic of counterparty credit risk, we consider our credit exposure to be low across all three of our operating segments. The partnership had no single customer representing more than 10% of revenues and only 15 customers individually represented 1% or more of revenues. Additionally, of the top 10 customers, which represented 38% of revenue, nine are investment grade or provide full credit support. Many of our top 10 customers are Natural Gas Liquids segment customers comprised of large petrochemical and integrated oil companies. Taking a look at our credit profile within our three segments, where we consider investment grade is rated by the ratings agencies or comparable internal ratings or secured by letters of credit or other collateral. The Natural Gas Pipeline segment received more than 85% of its 2015 revenue from investment grade customers, who were primarily large electric and natural gas utilities. The Natural Gas Liquids segment has limited credit exposure in its exchange service fee earnings, as in those contracts the natural gas liquids are purchased and proceeds are remitted from the partnership to the liquids producer less fee. And more than 80% of 2015 commodity sales were to investment grade customers. And finally, the Gathering and Processing segment's credit risk is limited, as in most contracts the partnership remits the proceeds under the percent of proceeds contracts to the producer, net of ONEOK Partner share of those proceeds as well as the fees charged. 99% of the segment's 2015 downstream sales were to investment grade customers. 2015 results at both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners include the impact from non-cash impairment charges totaling $264 million, primarily related to investments in the coal-bed methane area of the Powder River Basin. The partnership remains highly committed to maintaining our investment grade credit ratings, having a solid balance sheet and ample liquidity to support our capital program, ending 2015 with $1.8 billion available on its credit facility. The partnership's GAAP debt to adjusted EBITDA on a run rate basis is 4.1x, reflecting earnings growth during the year. Distribution coverage remains an important metric for us as well. We expect distribution coverage of 1x or better for 2016, by growing our cash flows through volume growth, cost savings and efficiency improvements. ONEOK on a standalone basis ended 2015 with over $90 million of cash and an undrawn $300 million credit facility. The partnership is advantaged by having a strong supportive general partner in ONEOK. With a significant excess dividend coverage, ONEOK has the resources, that may be used to further support the partnership, if needed, as it navigates these uncertain times. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Let's walk through our 2016 financial guidance and key assumptions by segment. Starting with our largest segment, the Natural Gas Liquids segment is expected to contribute $995 million in operating income and equity earnings in 2016. Additionally, we expect the natural gas liquids volumes and earnings to be weighted towards the mid to second half of 2016. Approximately 90% of the expected earnings in this segment are fee-based from the exchange services and transportation businesses. We continue to expect the partnership's natural gas liquids volumes gathered to increase in 2016, primarily from Williston Basin natural gas liquids volume growth expected from our gathering and processing assets in the Basin, including the expected connection of the Bear Creek plant and one third-party natural gas processing plant in 2016. Approximately 60% of the segment's natural gas liquids volumes gathered come from the Mid-Continent, with the majority of the gathered volume coming from third-party processing plants. Our unique natural gas liquids position in the Mid-Continent is similar to the position we have in the Williston, with the partnership's gathering and processing assets as we are connected to most of the third-party plants in the region. We expect to continue to benefit from natural gas liquids volumes gathered through our West Texas LPG system, where nearly 26% of the segment's volume originates. The segment is connected to more than 60 natural gas processing plants in the Permian Basin and is expected to connect one additional plant in 2016, and we expect to receive the full benefit in 2016 of increased tariffs. Finally, we moved the completion of the Bakken NGL pipeline expansion to the third quarter 2018, due to a slower expected rate of volume growth. The realigned timing of the expansion has no impact on financial or capital guidance for 2016. Driving the earnings growth in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment in 2016 is natural gas volume growth in the Williston Basin and enhanced margins due to the contract restructuring efforts. In the Williston, we expect to average 740 million cubic feet per day of natural gas gathered volume in 2016. Our gathered volumes early in the year have been very strong, as we reach nearly 800 million cubic feet per day in February. The recently completed Lonesome Creek plant and compression projects have already added nearly 100 million a day of incremental volume to our system, most of which has come from capturing previously flared gas. We continued to have approximately 24 rigs operating and more than 500 drilled uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. Given this activity, we expect 250 to 350 new well connections to our system in 2016. To put the expected 2016 volume outlook into context, if every rig were to have stopped drilling on January 1, 2016, and we did not connect any new wells in 2016, we would expect an average gathered volume of 720 million cubic feet per day in 2016, slightly below our guidance for the Williston. Natural gas volume growth in 2016 will not reflect a pronounced second half ramp up, as we experienced in 2015. We do expect volumes to slightly decline through the summer, until our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant comes online and we expect to capture an incremental 40 million cubic feet per day of gas currently flaring in Dunn County. In the Mid-Continent, we continued to be in constant communication with our producer customers regarding their drilling and completion activity. And similar to the Williston, the Mid-Continent volume exited 2015 at a high rate. As I mentioned earlier, the segment did receive an early benefit from our contract restructuring efforts in the fourth quarter 2015. However, 2016 is expected to receive the full benefit of these efforts and we expect another increase in the average fee rate in the first quarter 2016 from the $0.55 the segment averaged in the fourth quarter 2015. In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, 2016 earnings are expected to remain more than 95% fee-based, with more than 90% of the segment's transportation capacity and more than 75% of its natural gas storage capacity contracted for the year. The first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline is on schedule to be complete next month, and is fully subscribed under 25-year firm demand charged fee-based commitments, with the second phase expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Before closing, I would like to discuss future demand growth for ethane, which we expect to be a significant opportunity for the Natural Gas Liquids segment, as we move through 2017 and 2018. Approximately 400,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane demand from new world-scale petrochemical crackers is expected to come online by the third quarter of 2017 and nearly 164,000 barrels per day more by first quarter 2019. We expect this new demand combined with additional ethane exporting infrastructure to significantly reduce the ethane excess supply overhang and put pressure on ethane prices, and bringing most natural gas processing plants into full ethane recovery some time in mid-2018. Nearly one-third of U.S. ethane or approximately 180,000 barrels per day is dedicated and connected to our natural gas liquids systems, but it's currently not producing due to insufficient ethane demand. We are well-positioned to transport and fractionate substantial incremental ethane volumes, once the natural gas processing plants we are connected to transition into full ethane recovery in response to growing U.S. petrochemical demand. We expect little to no additional capital expenditures needed to bring this ethane onto our system, as we already constructed the natural gas liquids infrastructure necessary to connect supply to the Gulf Coast region. The total incremental adjusted EBITDA benefit to the partnership, if all of the natural gas processing plants we are connected to enter full ethane recovery, could be in the range of $200 million per year. With the Natural Gas Liquids segment's unique and extensive asset position, we can deliver significant ethane supplies to the Gulf Coast markets from the Williston, Mid-Continent and Permian Basins. Since we issued guidance in December, the commodity price environment has continued to be unstable, and many of our producer customers have reduced their capital expenditure plans for 2016. While these challenges remain, we will continue to remain focused on serving our customers, reducing risks, controlling costs, managing our balance sheet prudently and reducing capital needs. As we have discussed on this call, more than 85% of the partnership's operating income and equity earnings comes from primarily fee-based activities, underpinned by its large 37,000 mile integrated natural gas and natural gas liquids network, with opportunities to grow its cash flows, even in a lower capital spending environment. In 2016, we expect to finish the year within our financial guidance, driven by our uniquely positioned assets. We are less than 60 days into 2016 and we expect similar to 2015 opportunities and challenges throughout the year. We will be proactive in our approach to these opportunities and challenges and prudent in our decision making, all while keeping in mind the long-term interest of our investors. I'd like to thank our employees across the country for their strong performance, hard work and dedication in 2015. Many of our employees have experienced these difficult industry cycles before, and they know what to do. Manage costs, be efficient, be creative and operate safely and reliably, all while being focused on providing quality service to our customers. And many thanks to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : My first question is actually a little bit of a two-parter. I just want to dig a little more on the potential on the ethane recovery. It obviously seems like this is a pretty major opportunity and no incremental capital. Not really if, but maybe when. And I know it's early, I just would like to get a better sense for the timing and maybe the mechanics, and how that some of this might play out in terms of the split between where you'll feel the impact in the Permian, Mid-Continent, and the Bakken? And I guess also in light of the comment that you alluded to in your remarks that perhaps the Permian is going to see a meaningful uplift even in '16 in terms of the rate, bringing that more to market rates. I'd just like to get a better sense for that, if you can? Terry Spencer : Sure. Eric, I'll just make a couple of comments, and then let Sheridan kind of follow this thing. You see, in the slide deck that we provided, there is actually a slide in there that kind of shows you the sources of where that incremental ethane originates. And if you think about it in terms of which ethane is going to come on, obviously those with the lowest transportation cost burden will come on sooner. So you have to think about it in terms of the Gulf Coast probably coming on sooner, the Mid-Continent and the West Texas probably next, and then you\u2019ve got to think about the Marcellus and the Rockies. It's kind of in that order and we provided that table to give you as industry what that volume impact is. So Sheridan, you want to provide little more color and then talk about West Texas? Sheridan Swords : Only thing I would say is that, I think we'll start seeing -- as we enter into 2017, is when we will start seeing meaningful ethane starting to come out. And as Terry said, West Texas of our system will be first, but that is where we have the least amount of ethane rejection on our system followed by the Mid-Continent, where we have the most volume off currently, and then last which will be '18 or beyond, which will be the Bakken. In terms of West Texas pipeline and the rate increase, in July of 2015, we brought the tariff rates, the uncommitted tariff rates on the West Texas pipeline closer to market, so we only realized half the year of that rate increase, which in 2016 will realize the complete year of that rate increase. Eric Genco : But that's not necessarily getting you to the sort of 5x to 7x as sort of the long-term target, it's more just the benefit of half the year at this point? Sheridan Swords : Yes, that\u2019s been the half and the [multiple speakers] full year. We don't anticipate raise in rates. We don't have in our guidance raising rates further on West Texas in 2016. Eric Genco : And I guess, in switching gears a little bit maybe, I'd just like to get some of your thoughts on your most recent conversation with the rating agencies and how that's going. I mean, you have alluded to all the accomplishments and the things that were kind of on their checklist in 2015, the equity offering in August, renegotiating POP, addressing refinancing for '16, but in light of it, I guess, some of the more recent actions sort of in the E&P space, I'm curious, if there's been any shift in the tone or the targets they've set for you? And I'm also curious to what extent they have looked at the potential uplift for ethane. And I know it's typical in some leverage ratios to make an adjustment for capital that's already in the ground and earnings slightly to come on. Is that something that they are considering and looking at, at this point, or is it too early to tell? Derek Reiners : We do communicate regularly with the credit rating agencies, and certainly we intend to continue to do so. I think we've got a long track record of taking those prudent actions and you\u2019ve checked them off the list pretty nicely, just as I would. The term loan and sort of being ahead of our financing needs, I think, is helpful and those things are driving commodity risk out, reducing capital, I think all of those sort of credit-friendly actions that we have taken over time plays into their thought process. I can't tell you to what extent they may or may not be including ethane uplift. I suspect not much. But historically, they've understood and added back some credit, I think, for the capital spending over time. So what I think they look for is a track record, a plan to continue to reduce leverage. And as I mentioned in my remarks, the GAAP debt to EBITDA of 4.1x on a run rate basis is certainly supporting that we're headed in the right direction. And I think the unique aspects of our footprint, the tailwinds in terms of volume that Terry mentioned in the Williston, capturing the flare gas, those sorts of things I think all play into their thought process. Terry Spencer : Derek, the only thing I would add to that is that I think the rating agencies from a macro perspective are aware of the growth that's happening in that petrochemical space. Now, whether they actually take that into consideration in any of their analysis, as Derek indicated, we don't know. But I think, they're certainly aware of it. And I think if you were to ask them about it, I think that they do view it as a strong positive, but whether they've actually factored that into any analysis, again, we don't know. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : In the presentation, you guys showed that the Natural Gas G&P volumes are 662 million cubic feet a day in the Rockies for the quarter. Would you be able to split that between Powder River and Williston? Terry Spencer : Christine, I'll let Kevin handle that. Kevin Burdick : Yes. Christine, you can assume there is roughly 30 million a day of Powder Gas in that number. Christine Cho : And then I just wanted to touch on the ethane opportunity that you guys talked about. As you guys say, and on the slide you guys point to that 150,000 to 180,000 barrels per day being rejected across your system. Could you split that up a little better from Williston, Mid-Continent, and Permian? I know you said the least amount is coming out of the Permian, but any sort of percentages or ballparks would be helpful. Sheridan Swords : You have over 100,000 barrels a day of ethane off in the Mid-Continent, more like 120,000 to 125,000; 36,000 in the Bakken; and virtually 10,000 or less in the Permian. Christine Cho : And then as a follow-up to that question, you guys have a whole bunch of NGL distribution pipes leading to the Gulf Coast from Conway and Mid-Continent. What's the utilization currently on all the pipes between those two points and are you guys collecting minimum volume payments for any of the volumes? Asked another way, are customers currently paying for volumes they aren't shipping? Sheridan Swords : See the capacity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu is about 60% utilized between the Sterling pipelines and the Arbuckle pipelines. And when we think about our minimum volume commitment that's usually for a bundled service, so yes, there are some minimum volumes that have Belvieu redelivery that we are collecting today. Christine Cho : I'll follow up offline, but lastly, is there sufficient ethane fractionation capacity in storage along the Gulf Coast to accommodate all this ethane that's going to have to come out? Sheridan Swords : On our system, we have enough ethane through our fraction -- we have enough capacity through our fractionators to fractionate all of the ethane on our system. And we do have the storage capacity and the connectivity into the petchems to be able to deliver that to market. Christine Cho : But that's specifically for your system. I was kind of more asking like does the industry have enough? Sheridan Swords : Christine, you'd have to ask all the other individuals, fractionators down there. But my sense is yes, there is plenty of capacity to frac this ethane. Most of the fractionators when they are constructed, they are constructed for a full ethane slate. And so when this ethane is being rejected, it just takes it out [multiple speakers] first tower of the fractionators. Christine Cho : Perfect, that's what I thought. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : I think you guys talked about that your guidance included about 300 to 350 well connects in the Williston Basin during 2016, for I'm correct? Terry Spencer : It's 250 to 350. Becca Followill : What I'm looking at on Page 8 of the presentation on your guidance of 740 million a day, it looks like that includes a 100 well connects? Terry Spencer : I'm going to make just a general comment about that slide, Becca, and then I'll let Kevin jump into more of the detail. But that's a theoretical depiction assuming that all of the flare gas gets connected and that we experience a 20% decline, and based upon that, you would need 100 wells. But now, I'll let Kevin take it the rest of the way. Kevin Burdick : Yes. So Becca, there are a couple of things and dynamics that are going on in that, transitioning from that slide to our guidance. Like Terry mentioned, that's kind of a theoretical, assuming all the flares were out. Well, in our guidance volumes, we factor in some level, a minimal level of flaring. And keep in mind; we've got Dunn County where gas is going to flare until we get the Bear Creek plant built in the third quarter. We also factor in a little bit for weather during the winter months. And then just some general operational cushion or whatever you want to call it just to pull volumes back a little bit. So that's the incremental difference between the 100 well connects that's referenced in the stair-step slide and our guidance. But we do feel strong when you look at the activity that's currently there in the basin, and the number of rigs on our acreage and then you look at the drilled and uncompleted backlog, we feel that the 250 to 350 is a really good number to achieve. Becca Followill : And that's even despite recent announcements by some of the producers about suspending completion and pairing back budgets, correct? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Operator : And next we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : So expanding on Eric and Christine's ethane recovery question, how should we be thinking about margins regionally as ethane recovery rolls in? It's not going to be -- you're not going to get over $0.30 out of the Bakken, are you? Sheridan Swords : We will not receive $0.30. Typically across our whole system ethane has discounted to the C3 plus, so we will realize a lower margin than the $0.30 out of the Bakken. Craig Shere : I mean, roughly speaking, against what you're getting on the C3 plus, should we be thinking like nickel-plus spreads or what should we be thinking? Is it even those spreads across the system? Sheridan Swords : No, it will not be even across the system. Some volume will come on that will have Conway options, some volume will have Bellevue options. And they have all different kind of spreads depending on where they are. Obviously, if you're in the Bakken, they are going to have the highest margins and the Mid-Continent will be lower, and obviously a little bit in the Permian will be the lowest. Terry Spencer : And Craig, just let me step in here. So you used the word spreads, I think they are fees. It's not a spread play; it's a fee. And so there will be different rates, as Sheridan indicates, for different areas. And it's very common for us to have a lower fee rate for the ethane component than the C3 plus barrel. Craig Shere : I kind of meant the discount to what you're charging for the C3 plus, that's the spread I was referring to. Terry Spencer : I understand now. I was just trying to make sure, I don't have any misunderstanding. Craig Shere : And thinking about 2017 capital needs, I understand you don't have any need to raise debt or equity until well into '17, but your growth CapEx in '17 for the already approved projects and execution should fall off really materially year-over-year. So when you think about incremental capital needs in '17, is that just terming things out, rightsizing the balance sheet a little bit, I mean there's not a lot of spend that you have planned, right? Terry Spencer : I think that's a fair assessment Craig. We don't have anything of major strategic significance, in particular, in the G&P segment for 2017. So yes, you are thinking about it the right way. And in particular, if we get in this lower-for-longer mode, we do have the ability to flex down our current rate of capital spend down considerably. Now, we've not guided to that, don't intend to guide to that in this call, but I think you're thinking about it the right way. Craig Shere : Is there some range or percentage that you think you can shave-off in a worst-case scenario? Terry Spencer : Well, let me give you this, it's significant, and you could get to a point where just your routine growth, well connects, small infrastructure projects, compressor type projects could be the -- the core of your organic growth opportunities is that kind of stuff. And so it would be a significant reduction in the capital spend that we're experiencing here in '16; significant reduction in '17, if the lower-for-longer environment persists. Craig Shere : And last question, following-up on Becca's query about the 100 well connects on that theoretical slide versus the 250 guidance. I know we're in a period of flux and who knows what's going to happen next quarter, but implicit in that questioning is that you continue to have a cushion supporting your operations in a worst-case scenario, even in '17, because you're not using it all this year in terms of flared gas and the drilled, but uncompleted well inventories. Do you want to address any of that in terms of how measurably things may or may not fall off next year in a worst-case scenario? Terry Spencer : Well, let me make a comment and then Kevin can kind of clean it up. So flared gas, let me just tell you, it's not an exact science. And it's quite possible we could have more flared gas than we actually believe we have, because every time we turn on a compressor station it seems like the wells behind that particular compressor station outperform our expectations. Time and time again, more gas is showing up than what we thought. And so that's what we're dealing with here, that's what we dealt within the fourth quarter of last year and that's what we're dealing with, as we plow through first quarter 2016. So yes, I think we would expect that it's probably not going to turn out exactly the way we think. And it could very possible that we're a big conservative on our assessments and thoughts about flared gas. Kevin, do you have anything to add to that? Kevin Burdick : The only thing I would add, Terry, is that, again, back to the drilled, but uncompleted backlog, when you think about that we've got 550 or a little more than that behind our acreage. I don't think there's any expectation that all of that's going to get worked up this year. So as you move into through this year and you move into '17, even if the flared gas volumes go very low, you've still got some support from that drilled, but uncompleted backlog, that producers can bring on relatively quickly as prices improve. Operator : And next we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to touch back on the call, as far as the $0.55 fee that you guys saw, how do you expect that to trend during 2016 again? Terry Spencer : So Jeremy, we're not going to guide in the first quarters to what that fee rate is going to be, but we are expecting it to increase. And if there's any other color, I'll let Kevin address it. Kevin Burdick : Yes. Jeremy, I mean we did experience an increase in the fourth quarter that was a little ahead of our expectations by getting some of the restructurings done earlier than anticipated. So while we do expect it to increase, I don't think it would be as pronounced as the increase from Q3 to Q4. Jeremy Tonet : One of the questions we commonly get in this space is thinking about maintenance CapEx. How do you guys think about it as far as the depletion to the wells, how do you think about well connects as far as maintenance CapEx? And did that impact the maintenance CapEx revisions over the course of the year or any color you could provide there would be great. Terry Spencer : Yes, Jeremy, how we look at it -- and Derek can jump in here if I mess this up. But when we think about growth capital, well connects, and those types of things, the volume through our systems, we consider that growth capital. If it's attached to revenues, if it's a revenue generating activity, we call it growth. If it's related to the straight-up maintenance of the pipelines systems and mechanical integrity of the assets we call that maintenance capital. And that's the distinction, we've used for a long time and I think many of our peers use that same thought process. Does that help you? Jeremy Tonet : Maybe just in general, as far as maintenance CapEx coming in lower across the year, if you could just help us think through that a bit more as far as like savings through reductions in contractors or any color there would be great? Terry Spencer : I'm going to let Wes Christensen to take that. Wesley Christensen : Sure. In 2015, we did benefit from lower contractor costs across our projects, as well as using less contractors. Also our materials and supplied that we consume inside of those projects, we've seen some benefit in lower cost there as well. And then the last item maybe just the timing of the projects, we expect to see these types of trends continue through 2016. Jeremy Tonet : And then just one last housekeeping item. I think there was an asset sale gain of about $6 million in the quarter. Could you provide some color on that please? Derek Reiners : We routinely will sell-off small pieces of pipe for things like that, that really aren't integral to our systems. So that's all that is. I think it's fairly consistent from year-to-year actually we've got kind of a kind of a small amount every year, it really only impacts DCF by less than $1 million. Jeremy Tonet : So the $6 million, was that non-cash item that's backed out in DCF then? Derek Reiners : Exactly. Operator : And next will go to Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Kristina Kazarian : Just wanted to make sure I was understanding something that was asked earlier about leverage and rating agencies. Can you just help me understand how the conversations have been going, because I think OKS is still on negative at both? I mean you guys have listed a bunch of positives you guys have executed on since then, so what should I be watching for or thinking about or have they communicated what you guys need to execute in order to have OKS removed from negative outlook at either? Derek Reiners : Of course, they wanted to see us execute on those things I mentioned before. Broadly the macro environment, I think is difficult for them to take us off of any sort of a watch at this point. We really forced our hand last year in August, when we did the ONEOK bond deal where they had to rate that debt, that's when they put us on negative outlook. So my personal opinion is it's difficult for them to remove that given the broader macro environment, the low pricing and so forth. Terry Spencer : Just Christine, and the only thing I would add to that as I think they've been appreciative of the fact that we've decisively cut capital spending, have made some really prudent decisions and that we've voiced to them our willingness to continue to cut capital, if the environment dictates. Kristina Kazarian : That's great, which leads into my second follow-up one. And I know you mentioned this earlier about the flex down on possible spend, and I'm not looking for a number at all there, but if I think about it being a lower-for-longer environment, can you touch on maybe some other things you might think about, too? So are there small like non-core asset sales? How do I think about maybe -- I know there was a number in the press release, but financial support OKE could provide for OKS and just things in that vein? Terry Spencer : Well, Kristina, we obviously evaluate our assets at all times, but we don't see asset sales as a primary driver for us going forward. The financial flexibility that we have from ONEOK generating excess cash gives us plenty of different tools that we can use, whether it be equity purchases or considering thoughts around the IDR. We constantly evaluate what would be best for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and we're happy to have those tools at our disposal as we move forward. Kristina Kazarian : And then last one from me, so I know we saw the fee increase in the 4Q was ahead of expectations. Just an update on progress and in terms of like how many contracts left, could I see renegotiations on or anything color there? Terry Spencer : Kristina, most of our objectives have been met in the Williston Basin, but generally speaking, we continue to, where we can, renegotiate contracts to reduce commodity price exposure and where we can increase margin. So that's just an ongoing process. There might be a few more in the Williston, but as I said, for the most part we're done there. Western Oklahoma and Kansas, of course, will be areas of our continual focus. Operator : And next will go to Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets. Elvira Scotto : Thanks for all the color that you provided on sort of your volume expectations in the Williston Basin. But do you think maybe you can provide a little more color behind your Mid-Continent volume guidance, especially given how the commodity price environment has changed and producer commentary? And can you provide any, I don't know, maybe some sensitivity around that guidance? Terry Spencer : First of all, Elvira, my contribution is going to be that rig counts in the Mid-Continent have been pretty resilient even in this latest leg down compared to some of the other basins. So I think that's been somewhat surprising to us. So Kevin, if you want to talk a little bit more specifically on volumes? Kevin Burdick : Yes, the Mid-Continent area, especially the Stack, Cana, SCOOP areas, it's kind of interesting; because you've got really competing data points. Even as late as last week with some calls that we're out there, the performance and the results that many of our customers and other producers in the area are seeing are really outstanding, but yet there is some discussions of some delays. And we are watching that very closely, we're in constant communication with all of our customers in the Mid-Continent. I guess the way I think about it; it's really a function of just time. Those reserves are there, the results are strong, so the volumes will come, it's just, okay, is it going to be fourth quarter of this year, third quarter of this year or a push into '17, we'll be watching that closely over the next couple of months. Elvira Scotto : And then in terms of cost cutting opportunities, do you see any cost cutting opportunity in 2016 and is that baked into your guidance? Terry Spencer : Elvira, yes, we do have some continued management of our cost. And obviously, we're still seeing a downward pressure on vendor cost and we've got contractor costs that are coming down, particularly as we're in a lower growth mode. Wes, do you have anything else you could add to that? Wesley Christensen : No, I think that's consistent. We'll see that in our O&M, as well as we been seeing it in our maintenance capital. Operator : And our final question will come from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Terry, I'm just curious on the guidance, you affirmed the guidance, but obviously since you've provided it things have deteriorated significantly. So what improvements, I guess, are you looking to in your own performance there that would enable you to affirm if you could? Terry Spencer : Well, certainly, John, the outperformance and the exceedance of expectation in volume performance is really key. We continue to be very well hedged, as you can see from the information that we provided to you. And we're going to get the full year of the contract restructuring benefit in 2016. So from a pricing point of view standpoint, we think that there's going to be some correction or some significant improvement in prices, as we move throughout the year based upon our current point of view. So as we sit today, we like our guidance. And as Kevin indicated, we're going to continue to assess producer activity and try and get as much visibility as we can. And if we think updates are necessary, we'll come back to you. John Edwards : And then just you may have covered this, I got disconnected part of the call. But in terms of the, you were pointing on the NGL segment sort of a second half volume story there. If you could just provide a little bit more color or detail on how you see that playing out? Sheridan Swords : Well, first, we start up in the Bakken as you saw the volumes, even though they're slower growth than we saw last year, they continue to grow, especially with the Bear Creek plant coming online. And also, we're going to connect a third-party processing plant up there as well this year. And we have plants in the Mid-Continent that are in the SCOOP and the Stack that will be completed later on this year. So that's basically where we see the volume ramp up coming from in our volumes is from those two plays. John Edwards : And then lastly, just in terms of counterparty risk, to what extent are you baking that into your guidance? Derek Reiners : Yes, John, I've covered that in our remarks. And there's a new slide in the presentation that accompanies the news release that gives you a lot of detail on that. We actually feel very good about the counterparty credit risk that we have. And we're not overly exposed to any particular customer, so good diversification. So we're not expecting any sort of material credit losses. Operator : And I'll turn it back to Mr. T. D. Eureste for any additional or closing comments. End of Q&A T. D. Eureste: Thank you. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extends till earnings are released after market closes in early May. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that will conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation.",

Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the First Quarter 2016 ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to today's host Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 first quarter 2016 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning, and thank you for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice Presidents, Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phil May, Natural Gas Pipelines. I'll begin with a few opening remarks, then Derek will give a brief financial update and then I will wrap up with highlights of the first quarter, our outlook for the remainder of the year and our ethane opportunity. To begin, first quarter 2016 performance was a result of the progress made last year by continuing to focus on increasing our fee-based earnings, reducing commodity price risks in our businesses, project execution and making prudent financial decisions all while continuing to operate safely and responsibly. In this challenging market conditions, we have relied on our strengths, which for ONEOK Partners are predominantly fee-based earnings, our uniquely positioned assets and our dedicated employees. Our competitive advantage is our integrated network of assets that fit and work well together. Our 37,000-mile network of pipelines, processing plants and fractionators are well positioned to withstand the cyclical nature of the industry. Our assets in the Williston Basin have served us well, and we continue to benefit from the basin's large natural gas reserve base and inventory of flared NGL-rich natural gas. Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment remained well positioned to expand its fee-based natural gas export capabilities, particularly to Mexico where we have key relationships through our joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission Pipeline and our extensive Natural Gas Liquids business maintains a growing position in the Rockies, Texas and emerging STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma, providing us a large and diversified base with which to serve our end-use customers. The partnership's distribution coverage increased to 1.06 times in the first quarter, up from 1.03 times in the fourth quarter 2015 and significantly higher compared to the beginning of 2015 which is a reflection of our increasing stable cash flow as we now have a significant amount of infrastructure completed and are able to harvest earnings, particularly in the Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Liquids businesses. ONEOK Partners first quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA of approximately $445 million represents a nearly 40% increase compared with the first quarter 2015. Executing on our growth projects, contract restructuring, capital and cost savings and consistent operations were key drivers to delivering the greatly improved results from a year ago, even in the face of deteriorating industry fundamental throughout 2015. From an operating perspective, volume growth across our businesses, increased fee-based earnings, and ongoing cost reduction efforts across ONEOK Partners business segments have all contributed to a solid first quarter and positive outlook for the remainder of 2016. In the midst of some of the industry's most challenging conditions, our employees once again performed exceptionally well by successfully executing on our strategies to mitigate risk, reduce capital spending and operating costs, and manage our balance sheet. It is through their hard work and determination that our company delivered impressive results quarter after quarter in 2015, and we remain as committed as ever to delivering even better results in 2016. Through our key strategies and well managed and operated assets, our employees have, with a high sense of urgency, met the challenge, just as they have many times in the past. I'd like to thank them for their hard work and commitment to deliver value to the bottom line safely and reliably. We\u2019ll cover each of the segments in more detail later in the call, but first I'd like to have Derek give us some brief financial update. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thanks, Terry. Both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners ended the first quarter in a strong financial position with healthy balance sheets and ample financial flexibility. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK Partners first quarter distribution coverage was 1.06 times. ONEOK's first quarter dividend coverage was 1.31 times, which together with cash on hand entering the year maintains ONEOK flexibility to provide financial support to the partnership if needed. In yesterday's earnings news releases, we maintained our 2016 financial guidance expectations for both ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our proactive financial actions in 2015 and early 2016 and enhanced earnings from the partnership has allowed the partnership to deliver on distribution coverage, while also reducing leverage. The partnership's capital expenditure guidance remains $600 million, including $140 million of maintenance capital for 2016, as the reliability and integrity of our assets is the foundation of our success. However, we are seeing aggressive bidding from our vendors on maintenance projects and the timing associated with our maintenance activities can vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to seasonal impacts in varying maintenance cycles across our ever-changing asset base. Typically our maintenance capital spending is lower in the first quarter. Sequentially maintenance capital decreased $8 million in the first quarter, primarily due to our maintenance project plan for the quarter having fewer projects compared to the fourth quarter, which is not unusual when compared to our historical spending profile. We are on plan for our scheduled maintenance projects for 2016. Similarly, as it relates to operating cost, we continue to see competitive, lower pricing and rates from service providers and we have significantly reduced contract labor across all of our segments. In the first quarter we realized $15 million sequential decrease in operating cost. And as Terry mentioned, we continue to focus on internal operating cost reduction efforts company-wide. We expect these cost savings to continue throughout the year. In January, ONEOK Partners entered into $1 billion three-year unsecured term loan, effectively refinancing our 2016 debt maturities and enhancing financial flexibility. With approximately $1.9 billion of capacity available on the ONEOK Partners credit facility at the end of the first quarter, the reduction of more than $2.2 billion in capital growth projects in two years and higher earnings, the partnership does not need to access public debt or equity markets well into 2017. The partnership continues to progress towards deleveraging as our trailing 12 months' GAAP debt to EBITDA improved to 4.5 times at March 31st. And we continue to expect annual GAAP debt to EBITDA ratio of 4.2 times for the full year 2016 as a result of prudent financial, operating and commercial execution. As always, we remain committed to the partnership's investment grade credit ratings. On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $130 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016 and an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us financial flexibility as we continue to navigate a challenging market environment. In February, we provided detailed information on our counterparty credit risk. We\u2019ve included similar information again this year in our Form 10-Q but there haven\u2019t been any substantial changes. We have a very high quality customer base and no material counterparty credit concerns. The majority of our top customers are large petrochemical and integrated oil companies, which have a higher tolerance for volatility and commodity prices. Our track record of prudent and proactive financial decisions during uncertain times resulted in ample liquidity, too strong balance sheets, and a strong customer base. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners remain well positioned to withstand a volatile commodity and financial market environment. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. In the Natural Gas Liquids segment, volumes continued to increase year-over-year with first quarter 2016 volumes gathered up 6% and volumes fractionated up 16% compared with the first quarter of 2015. Compared with the fourth quarter 2015, volumes gathered and fractionated were lower primarily due to decreased spot volumes, higher ethane rejection and seasonal impacts. We continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plant connections continue to ramp up. In the first quarter, we connected three additional third-party plants to our NGL system and we continue to see volumes ramp at the eight plants we connected in 2015. We expect to connect one additional third-party plant this year in addition to completing and connecting our 80 million cubic feet per day Bear Creek plant in the Williston Basin where additional flared natural gas remains ready to come online. Williston Basin NGL volumes, our highest margin NGL volumes with bundled rates more than three times of those in other regions, remained strong in the first quarter. The average volume gathered on our Bakken NGL Pipeline increased nearly 12% compared with the fourth quarter 2015, driven by the completion of the Lonesome Creek plant in November 2015 and compression project. I'll also talk about ethane and provide an update on our ethane opportunity outlook in just a moment. As it relates to the West Texas LPG system, in July 2015, we increased rates on this system to be more in line with market rates. In March, the Texas Railroad Commission suspended the rate increase until it is determined by the Commission if the rates are in line with the market. We are confident that our increased rates are just in reasonable and in line with the market. However, regardless of the outcome of the pending case, our current 2016 financial guidance remains as indicated. As you all can appreciate, due to the legal process now underway with the railroad commission, it will not be prudent at this time for us to discuss this case in any more detail. We will provide future updates or commentary when and if it is appropriate. In the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, Williston Basin volumes were a key driver to our first quarter performance. Our Natural Gas volumes processed reached 810 million cubic feet per day as we captured previously flared gas and connected new wells to our system. Average natural gas volumes processed in the Williston increased 44% in the first quarter 2016 compared with the first quarter last year, and increased 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2015. Our producer customers continue to drive improvements in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, and combined with the higher natural-gas-to-oil ratios in the core areas where virtually all of our new wells are being connected, have helped offset the reduction in drilling and completion activity. We will continue to benefit from more than 820 wells connected in 2015 and the 115 wells connected to our system in the first quarter 2016. The vast majority of these high performing wells are in the most productive areas of Williams, McKenzie, and Dunn counties in North Dakota where we have more than a million acres dedicated to us and an extensive network of interconnected gathering lines, compression, and processing plants. There are currently 900 drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin, with nearly 400 on our acreage. We saw a decline in the drilling rig count across the Williston Basin during the first quarter and currently have approximately 15 rigs operating on our acreage under dedication. Flared natural gas in North Dakota was reported at approximately 185 million cubic feet per day for the state in February, with approximately 70 to 80 million cubic feet per day on our system. This continues to present an opportunity for us as we add processing capacity to our system in the third quarter 2016 with the completion of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant. In the Mid-Continent, first quarter 2016 processed volumes increased 8% compared with fourth quarter 2015 volumes. Similar to the Williston, our producer customers continue to drive significant increases in initial production rates through enhanced completion techniques, especially in the STACK, Cana-Woodford and SCOOP plays. Procedure delays on completions of some large multi-well pads are expected to impact our volumes over the next several months and potentially through the remainder of 2016. However with the recent improvement in commodity prices and breakevens in the STACK competing favourably with the best plays in the country, we could see acceleration of the delayed completions. Contract restructuring in the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment has significantly decreased the segment's commodity price sensitivity and was another major contributor to the partnership's first quarter results. The segments average fee rate increased to $0.68 per MMBtu, compared with $0.35 in the same period last year and $0.55 in the fourth quarter 2015. We expect the segment's earnings to increase to more than 75% fee-based this year, driven by this contract restructuring efforts. Moving on to the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, first quarter results remained steady as the segment continued to provide the partnership with stable, predominantly fee-based earnings. The segment completed two capital growth projects in March, the first phase of the Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline project and a compressor station expansion project on our Midwestern Gas Transmission pipeline which will add an additional 170 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the pipeline. The Roadrunner project is fully subscribed under 25-year firm fee-based commitment and the second phase of the Roadrunner is expected to be complete in the first quarter 2017. Additionally, the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion is also fully subscribed under 15-year firm fee-based commitments. Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment is primarily market connected, meaning we are directly connected with large stable customers who provide services to end users. These customers such as large utility companies, electric generation facilities and industrials have specific volume needs that don't fluctuate based on commodity prices. Additionally, we work closely with these customers to design our systems to fit their specific needs. Unlike basis-driven pipelines, there is minimal financial risk associated with our Natural Gas Pipelines or our customers. We like the stability of our Natural Gas Pipelines business and the customers we serve, and we'll continue to develop additional fee-based and market-driven long-term growth and export opportunities in and around our asset footprint. I'd like to close by providing an update on our ethane opportunity outlook. For the past three years our industry has experienced an unprecedented period of heavy and prolonged ethane rejection. The partnership continued even in the face of sustained ethane rejection to increase our Natural Gas Liquids volumes gathered and fractionated. We are starting to see ethane prices improve in relation to Natural Gas as a result of improving NGL prices and weakened natural gas, increases in NGL exports and expected incremental ethane demand from new world scale petrochemical crackers. Since last quarter, we've seen ethane recovery economics improve. Some natural gas processing plants on our system have intermittently started to recover ethane, which we expect to continue throughout 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful amount of processing plants to move into full recovery in early 2017. We average 175,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system in the first quarter, and we expect anywhere from 175,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection on our system as new natural gas plants, we are connected to, continue to ramp up, and as we see the impacts of increased volumes in the Williston, STACK and SCOOP plays throughout 2016. We are well positioned to benefit from this ethane opportunity and have more than enough infrastructure to bring these incremental barrels or approximately $200 million in annual earnings to our system with no additional capital requirements. We also have the opportunity to utilize our assets to capture pricing differentials if any dislocations in pricing occur between the Conway, Kansas and Mont Belvieu, Texas market centres as a result of increasing ethane demand. Ethane recovery presents a major opportunity for ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, but it certainly isn't our only opportunity. We remain focussed on additional fee-based growth opportunities for our businesses, cost effective ways to enhance our assets, and employee retention efforts. So we are fully prepared when market conditions improve. Congratulations to our employees on a solid first quarter. We continue to face headwinds from challenging industry conditions, but we've shown once again that we're uniquely positioned to handle these challenges and deliver on the financial results we've laid out for ourselves and our investors. Thank you to all of our stakeholders for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you sir. [Operator Instructions]. We'll pause for just a moment to allow everyone an opportunity to signal for questions. And we will take our first question from Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Hey, good morning. I have a couple of follow-up questions on ethane. Just wanted to kind of go over. I think you mentioned it basically, but in moving to 175,000 to 200,000 barrels a day of ethane opportunity in '16 versus the 150,000 to 180,000 last quarter being rejected, is that basically -- that's basically third-party plant and a shift towards more liquid rich drilling overtime, is that what's accounting for that increase? Terry Spencer : Yes, Eric I think, yes, most of that is a result of the new plants that we've connected here fairly recently. And, of course, the growth that we're seeing behind those facilities that we indicated in my remarks, so, yes, most of that is from the new plants. Sheridan, anything? Sheridan Swords : No, that's it. Eric Genco : All right. And I guess the other thing I was kind of curious about is we\u2019ve been sort of talking about this little bit more, just trying to get a better handle on some of the ethane recoveries that are likely to come out of the Bakken eventually. And so I think I understand based on bundled costs and how that works economically, and you guys have said that basically that Bakken would theoretically be one of the later basins to be culled. But I'm also curious too because I know -- you know, you've referred to some of your services being non-discretionary in the past and it's not like ethane economics specifically is going to drive drilling in the Bakken. So I'm curious is there a way to look at or think about pipeline stacks in the Bakken and sort of -- you know, as things come back, just sort of push ethane recovery and how that might impact you. Is there any way to sort of numerically think about that or is that still something that will just have to kind of wait beyond? Terry Spencer : You know, Eric, broadly as you think about where we deliver ethane across our systems, we really don't have any quality issues or any concerns really on a large scale. We may periodically in certain specific locations dependent upon the location of those pipes to end-user, we sometimes do have some issues with respect to quality specs, but I don't see quality specs being a big driver for ethane emerging from the Bakken, nor really anywhere else for that matter. And when we talk about these non-discretionary services, we talk about producers have to have the process and they got to have the liquids extracted from the gas in order to meet quality specs. Ethane tends to be one of those -- is one of those NGLs that can be -- can easily go into the gas train and be diluted without causing much of a problem, unless you've got industrial customers or commercial customers right near -- located in pretty close proximity to the processing plant, okay? That helped you? Eric Genco : Yes, it does. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time. Operator : And we will go next to Brian Gamble with Simmons and Company. Brian Gamble : Good morning, everybody. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Brian. Brian Gamble : On the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, that fee rates increase obviously excellent year-over-year and even quarter-over-quarter. I know that we'd talked about some of those new contracts hitting in January and that creates a bump. Maybe you could walk us through how we should think about that rate moving through the year. I think there is some contract that come up mid-year, maybe some Mid-Con things. But if I remember correctly, there was a pretty healthy chunk of the Williston that they got repriced? And just want to make sure, being realistic about how I'm thinking about that rate for the rest of the year. Terry Spencer : Yes, I'll just make a couple of general comments and I'll turn it over to Kevin. You know, as far as our contract restructuring effort, the lion share of the contracts or the bulk of what we set out to do in the Williston Basin, that's done. And so don't expect a whole lot more to occur. There's still some work in progress, but don't expect a whole lot more impact from that. The Mid-Continent is just going to continue to be work-in-progress. We have a much larger producer base of, that is, we have a lot more procedures that have much smaller volumes and consequently it takes -- it's a lot more involved in the Mid-Continent than in the Williston, just because of the sheer number of contracts that we're talking about. So that's caught from in a broad sense. Kevin, you've got anything else to add to that. Kevin Burdick : No, I think that's right on. Brian Gamble : That works. And then as far as the connections in the Williston, you mentioned 115 wells, I believe, you said in Q1. You mentioned the flared gas that's still on the system as well as the potential duct completions that would go in. But as far as well count adds that you\u2019re anticipating for the rest of the year, are there wells that are completed that are sitting there that now the system can handle that we\u2019re working on, or are we waiting for ducts for the majority of the opportunity to, I guess, incrementally add new wells to the system more for this year? Kevin Burdick : Brian, this is Kevin. Yes, that will come from -- the way we think about connecting the wells, it will come from a couple of -- from both of those places. I mean as rigs continue to work the basin as those wells that are being drilled or completed, we\u2019ll connect those up. But there is also the backlog of ducts that are on our acreage that as we communicate with producers and realign the schedules, we'll connect those as well. So our future -- our 2016 connections will come from the combination of both of those. And we still expect we'll be in that 250 to 350 range for total connects for the year. Brian Gamble : That delta between what we\u2019ve done so far and that midpoint of the range, so call it 185, how should I think about that as far as the buckets are concerned. Just I mean broadly speaking, can you give me a percentage breakdown between the two? Kevin Burdick : Broadly speaking, it might be half and half. Brian Gamble : Great, that's helpful. I think that's it for me. Appreciate it you guys. Terry Spencer : Thanks Brian. Operator : And we will take our next question from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Danilo Juvane : You guys obviously seeing sort of an increase in your fee-based gathering margins here for the rest of the year. So as you think about guidance for 2016, is the sort of pending issue with the rates in West Texas LPG the only downside risk that you see to this year's guidance? Terry Spencer : You know, as far as West Texas, as I said in my comments, I'm not going to go there for obvious reasons. But you know, as we think about our fee-based activities, we have certainly taken out a lot of risks, okay? And so -- and as far as renegotiation of contracts, we've been successful at increasing our rates across the board, okay, not just in the NGL space but in the gathering and processing space in particular. So, you know, as we move forward we really don't see any -- we don't see from a rate standpoint backing up anywhere. Okay? Danilo Juvane : Got you. Over the last couple of months, we've seen sort of more bullish NGL sentiment in general. How do you guys think about continuing to reach special contracts given that some of the part exposure that you've had before sort of is rebounding right now. Is there a percentage that you're targeting of fee-based versus commodity? Terry Spencer : I'll make a general comment. You know, we don't have a specific target for any of our businesses in terms of, this is how much fee-based margin we want to have. Obviously, we want to have as much fee-based margin as we can possibly get. And obviously we're continuing to push on that re-contract and negotiate everywhere we can, certainly bringing new assets and new businesses to the table or new opportunities to the table that are fee-based. When we think about the reduction of risk, we think about it more from a coverage standpoint, okay? What do we need in this business, what do we need in this business segment in order to maintain an appropriate coverage level for each one, and certainly an appropriate coverage level for the entire entity. So that's kind of how we think about it. Sheridan, do you have anything you want to say about our contracts in NGLs? Sheridan Swords : Well, I think the thing that comes out is even in NGL's we're continuing to change our optimization exposure into fee-based, and we will continue to do that even in widening the spreads. When we say widening spreads, we think that's even a better opportunity to start locking in margins. So as you said, we always want to go to more fee-based and take our commodity exposure out. Danilo Juvane : Got you. Last question for me. You mentioned coverage being a big reason as how you're managing some of these contract restructures. Is there a target coverage ratio that you're looking at long term? Terry Spencer : Well, certainly, as we've said in the past, you know, at the partnership, 1.1 to 1.15 longer term is a coverage that you know, it could make some sense for us, potentially higher. But certainly as we've driven the risk out these businesses, we don't have to maintain this quite as big a coverage. But that's kind of how we think about it. Danilo Juvane : If you take that statement and sort of think about what you're thinking about sort of your debt metrics, where do you see yourself being more comfortable starting to bump distributions? Terry Spencer : Well, certainly we've told you 4.2 times debt to EBITDA ratio is what we're targeting, but we really would like to be sub-4. I mean, ideally that's where we'd like to be. And that's the longer term plan. Danilo Juvane : Okay. Thank you. That's it for me. Thanks. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we will take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone, congrats on the quarter. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Christine Cho : When I look at how much ethane is being rejected on your system, the capacity of your NGL pipes and the utilization on those pipes, I have that your pipes are going to be full once all of the ethane behind your system is extracted. Can you talk about the expansion opportunities on the Sterling and Arbuckle line compression or looping? Would you charge a similar rate as you are now? And is it safe to assume that the economics of an expansion, if through compression, is going to be better than the 5 to 7 times multiple you usually give out? Terry Spencer : Christine, what I would say is that we feel that we have enough capacity on our existing pipelines to handle the ethane that's being rejected, but it will push the utilization of those pipelines to pretty high rates. If we get to the opportunity to expand our pipelines, the cheapest expansion is sitting on Sterling 3 and we had said we can take that up 60,000 to 70,000 barrels a day with relatively inexpensive pump stations on there, which would be at a very high multiple to add that kind of space for a very little capital. The other pipelines Arbuckle and the other two Sterling pipelines are fairly expanded with cheap expansion. It would be inter-looping, so it still would be much cheaper than laying a new line but it would be more expensive than what Sterling 3 has. But we think right now we can handle all the ethane that could potentially come out of our system. Christine Cho : Okay, and then just piggyback on that, I mean, I have that ethane demand that's going to be 800,000 barrels per day if we include the ethane export projects along with the cracker additions. Obviously, we've been thinking that in the near- and medium-term ethane price is going to go up to equate methane equivalent plus CNF. But do you think over the longer term, we could be short ethane, this would imply that ethane price could approach naptha prices? Terry Spencer : Christine, I think what would happen is that first thing if ethane prices increase, you're going to run into the other LPGs that can be cracked, especially in the existing cracker. So you're going to hit into propane, butane, and natural gasoline before you get to naptha. So I don't think we'll see in the long term ethane prices approach naptha prices. I think propane and other ones will put a lid on the price of ethane. Christine Cho : Okay. And then last one for me, very helpful, thank you. What's the average contract life on the NGL pipelines? And you've kind of mentioned this before, but I'm assuming that you have less optimization capacity than you did kind of at the peak, but as these contracts with customers come due, how should we think about how you guys decide whether or not to extend the contracts versus not renew it and maybe retain some capacity for optimization opportunities? Are you kind of happy with the levels that you have now or you want to decrease it, increase it? Terry Spencer : Christine, what I would say is that these contracts that you're referring are contracts that we have with the processing plants. So it's a bundled service for not just transporting product to Belvieu but also for fractionating it as well. So what we would want to do is always continue to extend those contracts. And if we can get the right prices to take them into Belvieu, we would rather put them on a fee-based business than be open up to the spread between Conway and Belvieu. So if we could, we would contract the whole pipe if we could get it at good rates. Christine Cho : Would you say that the bundled rate probably has room to come up then? Terry Spencer : Potentially yes. Christine Cho : Okay, and one more\u2026 Terry Spencer : We would\u2026 Christine Cho : Go on, sorry. Terry Spencer : Any time we look at the rates when we go out and look at a plant, we look at what the competition is, we look at how are our services that we provide and all that and try to price our services accordingly. So as prices continue improving going into Belvieu, I think there is some opportunity to increase our rates into Belvieu. Christine Cho : And what's the average contract life? Terry Spencer : Most of our contracts, substantial amount of our contracts do not expire until we get into the 2020's. We do have a little bit that expires between now and then, but most of it is in the 2020's. Christine Cho : Okay, great. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please proceed. Craig Shere : Good morning. Congratulations on another good quarter. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Craig. Craig Shere : So I think you said 115 well hook-ups in the quarter, Terry. But guidance I think is still only 250 to 350 for the full year. And if I'm not mistaken one of your major customers has just added a frac crew on a farm to work done, that's duct inventory. Given all this, is your reiterated guidance for well hook-ups perhaps conservative? Kevin Burdick : Craig, this is Kevin. I don't know if I'd use the word conservative but yes, we've had a strong showing out of it for the first quarter. But then again, rigs have dropped off quite a bit as well during that same timeframe. So we continue to talk with our customers daily and understand as commodity price moves around, kind of their sentiment towards either adding frac crews or adding rigs changes a little bit. But right now, we feel good about that 250 to 350. If we have some more movement with producers that are going to accelerate completions in the Williston and then yes, that number could go up. Craig Shere : And on the remaining 70 million to 80 million a day of flaring on your Bakken footprint, any thoughts on maybe a run rate as we exit the year? Obviously, new well hook-ups will contribute to potentially some incremental flaring. So this isn't going to go down to zero. Any thoughts on where we could exit the year? And also over time, are we perhaps seeing the actual amount of flaring that's reported perhaps be on the conservative side so that you could get most likely higher uplift? Terry Spencer : So, a couple of things there. One is as we look at our flaring, keep in mind, there is probably 30 to 40 million behind Bear Creek, so when we bring Bear Creek online, we expect that a chunk, approximately half of that will get put out with that -- as that plant comes up. As for the other, yes, there will always be some level of flaring that occurs, but we do have quite a bit and we\u2019ve got some head room from both our field infrastructure and processing plants. So as new wells come online, I don't know that that would contribute much to the flaring. So I do think we expect that number will go down significantly as we move into the back half of the year once the Bear Creek is up. And yes, when you look at the numbers over the last few months, it does appear that some of the reporting has been conservative for overall -- for total kind of state-wide flaring. Craig Shere : Great. And on the ethane question, in terms of specs, I think I forgot when, it's some quarters ago, you had a 20,000 barrels a day of recovery to mid downstream Y-grade requirements. At the time I think you mentioned the possibility of that going away with the downstream solution, obviously still plotting margin for you. Could you see that margin opportunity expanding over time as the Y-grade growth out of the region continues? Sheridan Swords : Craig, this is Sheridan. The ethane coming out of the Bakken is for purely products specifications that we have downstream. And right now with the ethane we have coming out there now, we are able to manage that situation. As we continue to look forward, we are trying to find the most economical way to extract, to solve this solution in another way, but we're still looking at that. It's capital intensive. So we're still trying to work on with the right solution for that is. In terms of getting more ethane out of the Bakken for uplift there, we see the opportunity is there as increasing ethane prices with the new petrochemical facilities come online is where we think the most opportunity is. Craig Shere : Okay, great. And just a little more color around the NGL segment headwinds, including the $10 million decrease in exchange services and $5.6 million in marketing would be helpful. Maybe just more of a discussion about specific spot and about some volumes and about summarization and trends there. Terry Spencer : Craig, the marketing was down mainly because we had a warm winter and also we had less volume from our marketing department going into refineries. We have already seen that tick back up as we move into the second quarter. The extreme services were down, it's because we had spot volume in the fourth quarter, we had a little bit more ethane rejection in the first quarter, and we had a little seasonal or weather effects also in the first quarter. Volumes that have already rebounded as we move into the second quarter and today our volumes on our gathering systems are at or a little bit above 800,000. Craig Shere : Great. And last question. Derek, on the favourable comments you had about favourable bidding for your maintenance CapEx and the falling OpEx cost, how much opportunity is there for further improvement in '16 and could you see these benefits continuing in the '17 or is it very kind of variable quarter to quarter? Derek Reiners : Hey Craig, I'm going to turn it over to Wes Christensen to answer that question. Wes Christensen : Yes, Craig. We continue to have contact with our contractors and find as they are looking for work to keep their crews busy, that there's opportunity there to improve it. We have already captured quite a bit from them through '15 and '16 and expect it to continue in the current environment. Craig Shere : Great. Thank you very much and congratulations again. Terry Spencer : Thanks Craig. Operator : And we will take our next question from Becca Followill with US Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : Good morning, guys. Terry Spencer : Hi Becca. Becca Followill : Hi. On processing, guidance for the year is 1.9 to 2 for the year, but the quarter you were more like 1.95, and you talked about volumes being back-end loaded. Is that back-end loaded for NGLs? And you also have new processing coming on in a year or so, help me out with guidance relative to Q1. Terry Spencer : So, yes, it is. We do have some back-end loading, in particular in gathering and processing because the Bear Creek plant coming on in the third quarter is going to fetch you there. And you're going to see some back-end loading a bit on the NGL side as well. Sheridan, you got anything to add. Sheridan Swords : Yes, I mean we do have plants coming online, the Bear Creek plant will add more to the NGL gathering. We have another plant in the Mid-Continent that's coming on. We just had a plant yesterday, start delivering -- a new plant start delivering into the West Texas pipeline asset. So here we are still little bit. We should see growth from here forth. Becca Followill : But you're already at the mid point of the guidance? That's where I'm coming from. Terry Spencer : Becca, could you kind of clarify when you say the -- we're at the mid point of the guidance, which? Becca Followill : I'm looking at gas process, it was 1.948, I think your guidance was 1.9 to 2. Terry Spencer : Okay. So that's -- again, we had a strong Williston volumes and that's in -- you're referring to the MMBtus and so that's driving that. The gas being much richer coming out of the Williston, so that's what you're seeing there. Our volume profile just at a high level in the Williston is going to be more flattish for the year. So that's the reason you're seeing that. Becca Followill : But you're also adding Bear Creek in Q3? Terry Spencer : Right and that will open another -- again, that's 40 million a day in cubic feet. So when you're talking about the total, it's not going to move -- it'll move it some. But again, volumes between now and then are going to be flattish and then you'll see a little uptick. And if thing don't -- depending on completions at the end of the year, you could possibly see a minor decline post Bear Creek. Becca Followill : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning, guys. Most of my questions have been asked and answered several times, but I just wanted to just clarify a couple of things and I think you've sort of answered it with Becca's question before. But the results this quarter with respect to volumes, was that what you expected the first quarter to be, is it better or worse? Does it sort of change because you didn't change your guidance, does that mean that you still think that you're within your guidance or are you more towards the upper end now versus the lower end? I was just wondering if you can sort of give us some color as to 1Q performance relative to your official plan. Terry Spencer : Yes, we came in pretty much as expected. I mean, as you would expect, you got some areas that performed a little better than expected and others that weren't quite as good. But overall, this first quarter performance is not a surprise to us and it's certainly consistent with our guidance we provided for the year. Just a bit more specific, in the Williston Basin, we continue to perform extremely well. In the Mid-Continent, we've not performed quite as well but when you look at it on the overall basis, particularly for a G&P segment, we are right on plan, right on our guidance. Shneur Gershuni : Okay, perfect. A couple more follow-ups. You stated in the past, I think I saw it written as well too, that OKE stands in support of OKS. Do you expect to have to execute on that this year, or it's just more of a statement at this point in case if needed? Maybe you can sort of discuss that in context with any discussions you've had with rating agencies recently and so forth. Derek Reiners : Shneur, this is Derek. The OKE cash balances there, really just is a prudency matter. We like having that flexibility. But as we've stated before, we don't have any plans really to issue equity at this point. So we'll continue to watch it, but no plans at this point. And in terms of rating agencies, I mentioned in my remarks certainly at the partnership we're committed to the investment-grade credit rating and that allows us some additional comfort should things not turn out exactly the way we would expect. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then one last question just technical in nature, Roadrunner, what's the expected ramp this year? Terry Spencer : I'll turn that question over to Phil. Phillip May : Could you -- did you say ramp? Shneur Gershuni : Yes. Phillip May : Okay. Yes, it's first phase is in service as of March, so it is flowing 170 million a day. Second phase is due in service in the second quarter of '17 and that will ramp up to 570. And then third quarter will follow in 2019 and that's another 70 million a day. So total 640 million a day. Shneur Gershuni : Okay, perfect. All right. Thank you very much guys. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we will go next to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I was just wondering for the NGL gathering, if you could help us think through kind of what leads to the cadence of the ramp over the year. Is that kind of new plants ramping up or is it more on the connection side, or is it more ethane recovery or if you could just help us with that a little bit, that will be great. Terry Spencer : Sheridan. Sheridan Swords : I think to know that coming out of the first quarter, we always see a little bit of a downturn on our existing plant because of the seasonality in the first quarter. So we ramp up through the year, some of it will be that. But most of it will be from the ramping up of the plants that we connected last year and the new plants that we're connecting this year. We really don't expect any incremental -- any substantial incremental increase in ethane recovery in 2016 in our guidance numbers. So mainly, it's going to be from new plant connections. Jeremy Tonet : Okay. That's great. That's it for me. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Jeremy. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go next to John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Yes, good morning everybody. Just I wanted to kind of come back to the incremental ethane opportunity little bit, is the basic cadence of realizing the $200 million, is it more or less in line with what you've laid out on your slide eight of the deck you provided with the release where you're showing the expected incremental petrochemical ethane demand? Or is it going to be some other trajectory? Is it more kind of rateably each year the next few years? Help me understand that a little bit better. Sheridan Swords : John this is Sheridan. I think the best way to explain it is currently today we supply about a third of the ethane demand in the United States. And as you see that demand increase, as you see on page eight, I think that ratio will stay the same. So of that increased demand, we'll be able to see about a third of it on our system. John Edwards : Okay. So is it proportionate then to the timing that you've laid out there or is it some other pace? Sheridan Swords : No, I think it's about proportionate to that timing. John Edwards : Okay. That's really helpful. And then as far as you had made some reference to the potential for improvement to optimization margins, I think your guidance is $0.02. I mean what are the prospects you think for that number actually improving this year and perhaps next year? Terry Spencer : Well, I think the spread between Conway and Belvieu will be -- move around quite a bit this year, but I don't think we'll see any material substantial increase in that spread until you see the ethane come online which will fill up the pipes between Conway and Belvieu and give you an opportunity for wider spread. So probably more better opportunity in '17. John Edwards : Okay, great. My other questions have been answered. Thank you. Operator : Okay. Ladies and gentlemen, that concludes today's question and answer session and also concludes today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day, and welcome to the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Second Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. T. D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 second quarter 2016 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning and thank you for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice Presidents; Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural Gas Liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines. Before I hand the call over to Derek for the financial review, I will open with a few remarks. And after Derek's comments, I will discuss the segments performance and have some closing comments. We continue to like the progress we have made in the first half of the year towards achieving our 2016 financial goals at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Our geographically diverse assets located in the Williston, Mid-Continent, Permian, and Gulf Coast are meeting our customers\u2019 needs by enhancing both supply and market connectivity. The asset footprint we\u2019ve developed over the last decade has generated significant value to our stakeholders. To put the scale of investment and return to our stakeholders into a little perspective, since 2006 we have spent more than $9 billion in growth capital projects and acquisitions. In 2006, ONEOK Partners\u2019 adjusted EBITDA was $615 million and distributions declared in 2006 were $1.80 per unit split adjusted. The partnerships 2016 adjusted EBITDA guidance is $1.88 billion and we expect distributions declared of $3.16 per unit in 2016. This impressive earnings growth with the partnership has also benefited ONEOK. In 2006, distributions declared for ONEOK\u2019s limited and general partner interests in ONEOK Partners totaled approximately $145 million, compared with ONEOK\u2019s 2016 guidance of approximately $790 million in distributions declared from the partnership. I would add we have prudently managed ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 dividends and distributions through a number of challenging industry events without a decrease. We have slowed the capital spending during uncertain times to protect the partnerships balance sheet and investment grade credit rating, while aligning our business to take advantage of growth opportunities. Many of the investments we have made have positioned ONEOK Partners with continued running room for growth with minimal capital requirements. Available capacity in our natural gas liquid segments allows us to continue to benefit from increased volumes driven by expected higher ethane recovery levels and NGO volume growth from more than 180 natural gas processing plants connected to our system. Our natural gas gathering and processing segment also has considerable available processing capacity, as our new processing plants have demonstrated operating performance at higher capacity levels than our original design expectations. In addition, many of our gathering and processing plants are interconnected with each other, providing flexibility to direct NGO-rich natural gas volumes to the most efficient plants. Our hardworking and experienced operating team will continue to optimize our asset to further enhance performance across our facilities. As we continue to take advantage of the considerable capacity we have available across our natural gas and natural gas liquids businesses, our returns on invested capital, coverage, and leverage metrics should continue to improve. Now, Derek will provide a brief financial update on the quarter. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thank you, Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% from the first quarter 2016, resulting from an increase in natural gas liquids volumes gathered in fractionated and higher average fee rates in the gathering and processing segment. Even in this lower commodity price environment, the partnerships\u2019 year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of $900 million is nearly $200 million more than in the same period in 2015. Last year's earnings were weighted more to the second half of the year, but to Terry\u2019s points, our assets continue to produce solid earnings in a very challenging pricing environment and we have significant room to increase our earnings with available system capacity. Our distribution coverage ratio increased to 1.15 times in the second quarter and 1.11 times year-to-date. This includes a one-time benefit from the change in the timing of cash distributions received from the partnerships\u2019 equity method investment in northern border pipeline. Beginning in the second quarter, cash distributions related to the partnerships\u2019 50% interest in the pipeline are received monthly instead of quarterly. This one-time $15 million cash increase to distributable cash flow were approximately 0.07 times to coverage. Excluding this benefit, our distribution coverage ratio still continued to improve. The second quarter of 2016 represents the fifth quarter of consecutive increases in distribution coverage with our third consecutive quarter above 1.0 times. We continued deleveraging the partnerships\u2019 already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt to EBITDA improved again to 4.4 times at June 30. We continue to expect a leverage of 4.2 times or less for the full-year of 2016. The partnership has ample liquidity with more than $1.8 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility. On a standalone basis, ONEOK ended the first quarter with nearly $180 million of cash and expects to have approximately $250 million of cash by year-end 2016, with an undrawn $300 million credit facility, allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK\u2019s second quarter dividend coverage increased to 1.33 times with free cash flow of over $40 million after dividends.  Finally, you will note there is 7% increase in operating cost compared with first quarter of 2016. This increase is mainly in the Natural Gas Liquids segment, due to the timing of plant after integrity projects at our pipelines and fractionators and higher property tax estimates. I\u2019d like to reiterate from a financial perspective, we are pleased with the progress we have made in the first half of the year. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market\u2019s needs, including through our aftermarket equity program, until well into 2017. Although, we continue to evaluate opportunities to proactively manage debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership. And lastly, I\u2019d like to point out we accelerated the expected completion of phase two of the Roadrunner project and the WesTex expansion project to the fourth quarter 2016 from the first quarter 2017. With all thanks [indiscernible]. we could see a 2% or 3% resulting increase in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment\u2019s operating income in equity earnings. We are maintaining our 2016 financial guidance expectations for about ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and expect to continue to navigate the remainder of the year with prudent financial position making. I\u2019ll hand the call back over to Terry. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of our business segments. Our Natural Gas Liquids segment continues to be a key driver of fee based growth for the partnership. We recorded NGL gathered and fractionated volume growth across the segment\u2019s footprint driven by recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. The ethane opportunity remains a strong expected tailwind for ONEOK Partners. Our processing plant customers connected to our system averaged approximately 150,000 barrels per day of ethane rejection in the second, down from approximately 175,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2016. However, a portion of the fees associated with the increased volumes were previously being earned under contracts with minimum volume obligations, we expect ethane recovery levels to continue to fluctuate for the remainder of 2016. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity beginning in early 2017 and expect $200 million in annual impact to the segment wants in for ethane recovery. In addition to the ethane opportunity, the growing STACK and SCOOP plays in Oklahoma present an opportunity for Natural Gas Liquids volume growth as we remain a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. Based on the conversations we\u2019ve had with producer customers in the STACK and SCOOP plays and with the results they are seeing, we expect to gather an incremental 100,000 barrels per day of Natural Gas Liquids from the play. Our current gathering system capacity can handle the Natural Gas Liquids, out of the Mid-Continent when the region is in full ethane recovery, and we expect to have available gathering capacity of approximately 40,000 barrels per day at full ethane recovery. We can expand by an additional 60,000 barrels per day, with capital expenditures of less than $100 million for total available gathering capacity of more than 100,000 barrels per days. Excluding the impact of changes in ethane recovery, we continue to expect NGL volumes to be weighted toward the second half of the year, as incremental volumes from new natural gas processing plants connections continue to ramp up, including the connection of three third party processing plants from the first half of 2016. We expect to connect two additional third party plants, one each in the Williston and Mid-Continent and our Bear Creek plant in August 2016, which equals a total of six plant connections in 2016. From a Natural Gas Liquids perspective, supply and market connectivity remains our competitive advantage, or said another way; our competitive advantage is our ability to connect our producers in key basins to consumers in key market centers. A very important component of our integrated NGL system is the connectivity we have between Conway and Mont Belvieu, we have a significant amount of available capacity between these two market centers, which allow the Natural Gas Liquids out of the Williston, Rockies and the Mid-Continent to have connectivity to end markets. In the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, the average fee rate increased to $0.76 in the second quarter of 2016, driven by benefits from increased volumes on previously restructured contracts, and continued contract restructuring effort. This average fee rate is $0.08 or 12% increase compared with the first quarter of 2016, and a $0.37 or 95% increase compared with the second quarter of 2015. We expect the average fee rate to continue to increase, but at a slower rate compared with the last three quarters. We are continuing to work on restructuring more contracts to be primarily fee based to reduce earnings volatility and enhance margins. Additionally, we did add nearly 85 new well connections in the Williston Basin during the second quarter. There are 19 rigs currently on our dedicated acreage, along with approximately 350 drilled but uncompleted wells in inventory. Segment volumes decreased slightly compared with the first quarter of 2016, impacted by the planned facility maintenance, and weather events in the Williston Basin. We estimate without these occurrences the Williston Natural Gas Gathered and Processed volumes would have equaled the first quarter. The Mid-Continent\u2019s volumes were impacted by the timing of well completions and volume declines.  I\u2019d like to emphasize that the Gathering & Processing segment\u2019s EBITDA increased approximately $10 million from the first quarter, even with lower gathered and processed volumes, which show the value of the enhanced margins achieved through our contract restructuring effort. The STACK and SCOOP plays are also benefiting the Gathering & Processing segment as we continue to see strong producer results in the place. The majority of the well completions we expect to see at the end of 2016 and early 2017 are in the STACK which is becoming one of the top return plays, which bring significant opportunities to all three ONEOK segments and especially the Natural Gas Liquids segment. Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment had another solid quarter. We moved up the expected completion of phase 2 of the Roadrunner pipeline project to the fourth quarter 2016. The early expected completion resulted from good weather, limited issues with write away and less rock than expected during the construction process. We also moved up the completion date of the WesTex expansion project, as I mentioned previously which is complimentary to Roadrunner. This project is another example of our commitment to grow out the partnerships long term fee based business. Our continued focus on stable fee based earnings growth has positioned us well for the remainder of 2016, while we are optimistic about the long term outlook for commodity prices will continue to prudently manage our business and position it for continued earnings growth, while weathering the sometimes challenging and cyclical nature of the industry. Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners, and as always thank you to our employees, whose hard work, experience and good decision making has made for another solid quarter amid difficult industry conditions. It is through our employees\u2019 hard work, creativity and dedication that our company remains well positioned to take advantage of the many opportunities, we have under development. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning guys. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Shneur Gershuni : Just a quick operational question and a big picture question, you know you had some interesting color about the Bakken, had the weather issues not been there you would have been in line with your first quarter, so when we think about the guidance that you sort of said at the beginning of the year, how would you say volumes are tracking versus plan and then when we think about a few rigs being added into the basin increasing completion crews I think it was announced by widening the other day as well too, how should we be thinking about the exit rate for the Bakken, do you think it will be higher than what you originally planning on in the original budget and then in contrast if you can talk about I guess a little bit more in doubt about producer completion plans in the Mid-Continent, does that change your exit rate there as well to, just wondering if you can give us a little bit more color on that. Kevin Burdick : Sure this is Kevin, if we talk about Williston first, yeah I think the volumes are progressing very much as we anticipated coming into the year. We have had some producers announce some bringing some crews back and we do have that factored in. The weather and the facility maintenance we saw basically the minor decline in the second quarter. We are kind of flat right now as we move in, we have got Bear Creek which is now - say will be completed in August so we will see an extra 30 million to 40 million a day coming in when that plant comes online. Then towards the back half of the year, you know we are looking flattish type volumes as we go through the end of 2016. With the completion activity in the rigs that we currently have kind of on the schedule. If we transition to the mid-continent, little bit different story, we absolutely expect a back half waiting especially towards the end of the year as so of the large fab; the completions were delayed to the fourth quarter. So from that stand point, we do expect a ramp there and we have also had some gathered only volumes that have dropped off a little more than we anticipated coming into the year. But that\u2019s kind of how we see the mid-continent volumes shaped up through the end of the year. Terry Spencer : This is Terry, Kevin and it is fair to say that we are seeing a lot of activity in the stack, and predict the feedback that we are getting from producers has been really remarkable. And so if you have got any other comments you have to say about the discussions you are having with producers. Kevin Burdick : Yes, again the information I have seen come up so far this quarter and conversations we are having with our producers. The tight curves continue to improve. There has been couple of announcements already. The producers have strengthened tight curves in the area. We have seen results that have been quite impressive and a lot of the analysts are now talking it as one of the top place in the basin. We have about 200,000 acres of dedication in the stack. So we are very positive and bullish on what we expect through the - especially in the fourth quarter. It is just getting these completions on these pads done, most likely in the fourth quarter. Shneur Gershuni : I guess a bigger picture question, when I looked at one of your opening slides, I think slide four, you sort of highlight the $9 billion of capital that you spend. When I think about in contrast with the OKS guide of just under $1.9 billion in EBITDA for this year. You have talked about $200 million worth of upside with respect to ethane in the near future, taking us over to $2 billion. I guess is that really a guidance quotient per say but in a more constructive commodity environment I am not talking peak oil but a constructive environment, how much operating levers does all this capital represent, you know could it would be another 10% - 20% higher at a more normalized commodity environment. I wonder if you can sort of give us a little color about your operating leverage. Terry Spencer : Sure, so we think about that operating leverage in the capacity that we have available. When we think about our business, the capacity that we have available are certainly in the most active basins. Not just from a GMP prospect but also from NGL perspective where we have capacity and are in the good spot candidly. So when you think about more constructive environment say maybe $55 to $65 a barrel of oil environment, we are well positioned to capture more opportunities. So if you think about the impact from EBITDA perspective or the incremental EBIDTA I think 10% to 20% improvement if all those things happen. I think would actually be conservative. So I think we could outperform that considerably. Shneur Gershuni : Great thank you very much guys. I\u2019ll jump back in the queue. Operator : And our next question will come from Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Hi good morning. Just want to touch real quick on the NGL segment; I was hoping you could expand a little bit about the MBCs that were absorbed by the increased ethane volume. I didn\u2019t realize the MBCs were like significant pieces just wondering if you could tell on what parts of the system have the MBCs associated with or escalating in. Just want to make sure that doesn\u2019t impact in any way the $200 million benefit that you had talked to in terms of going to fall I think recovery. Sheridan Swords : Eric this is Sheridan, when we looked at the $200 million up lift from ethane recovery we took into consideration in the MBCs. But also the decrease in MBCs that you saw in the second quarter was not just from ethane, it was also from an increase in C3 plus volume we are getting from the added plant that were coming online. So it is not apples and apples when you compared that, but the big thins is $200 million took into account what we have in MBCs, there is already being captured. Eric Genco : Okay and what part of the system do you have been, can you - Sheridan Swords : We really have some across the whole system but most of this probably in the mid-continent. Eric Genco : Okay and I think also in the press release you referenced there were some benefit in the Bakken from increases that made recoveries. I think that search in the crack was wide enough lot of Bakken except, can I read that correctly or what\u2019s going on there, just in sort of discounting, sort of competitive there, just wondering if you could stop there? Sheridan Swords : We did see some more ethane recovery in the Bakken, but it was minor so less than 3,000 barrels a day and still it is all wrapped around this quality issue but we have a little bit of change but I think more on Kevin\u2019s plan trying to keep it on the minimum level what they need to be that quality and it will bounce around little bit. Eric Genco : Okay, all right. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Christine Cho with Barclays Christine Cho : Hi, everyone, so I wanted to start on your stacks group comment. Terry I think you said you have the opportunity to gather 100,000 mmbtu per day, what is the time frame on this and I noticed that you didn\u2019t say processing either so is it just gather only contract and also if you could just reiterate your comments about how you have already capacity to handle the huge volumes. Terry Spencer : Okay Christine first thing, the number 100,000 barrels per day. Christine Cho : I\u2019m sorry. Terry Spencer : Yes we are talking primarily about gathering system capacity that is NGL gathering system capacity, once we make that comment. Christine Cho : Okay. Terry Spencer : Sheridan anything you can share. Sheridan Swords : In terms of fractionation, we think first 40,000 barrels a day we would have fractionation capacity for when we expand the next 60,000 we think there is capacity in Mont Belvieu with other fractionators that handle that. If it wants we would be more willing to build our fractionation capacity and expand for that as we go forward but. Christine Cho : Okay, great. And then I thought the first quarter fee based trade in GNP, what is the run rate to go off I think, you kind of guided us towards last quarter so, what happens in second quarter that drew those rate higher and I noticed that your implied equity volumes didn\u2019t look like it got smaller, so I need any clarification with overall. Kevin Burdick : Christine, this is Kevin. Yes when we talked about the first quarter we did say that we expected, we were for the most part thought we have seen the peak of the increases. We did see some again some improvement in the fee rate, that is primarily driven from just a mix of our where the volumes are coming. Each quarter the volumes will have - it will grow in some areas and decline in other areas and just depending on the types of contracts those volumes are growing or declining, will move that fee right around. So in this case we had additional volumes show up on contracts that it had been previously restructured that had a higher fee rate, some of the declining volumes were occurring on the contracts that had a lower fee rates. In addition we continue to just as part of our normal commercial activities as contracts come up with the term and so forth we work with our producers to again try to remove as much risk out of our businesses as possible and continue to convert and move the contracts to more fee based contracts. Christine Cho : I see and then on the restructuring, are they still mostly happening in the Bakken and then how much of the Bakken can still be restructured meaning you know what percentage of the volumes haven't been converted yet? Derek Reiners : You know that it's occurring all over our system, so we don\u2019t just limit it to the Bakken, as we think about moving in and you know driving to a more fee-based structure, is getting into the specifics of how much remains, I don't know that I want to talk about that, we will just continue to work that in due course. Terry Spencer : You know Christine, I guess, this is Terry. I would add that when we set out in the Williston Basin with this objective to restructure these contracts, there were some fairly large contracts that were already heavily fee based that we felt like we could and we did, and we left those contracts alone, we were satisfied with those. So those contracts still remain. But I think for the most part I think we've accomplished what we set out to do. I would not anticipate a whole lot more contract renegotiation happening obviously until - now some of these contracts come up to term many years down the road. So I think for the most part we\u2019ve accomplished what we set out to do, for the ongoing perspective we will stay focused in particular in the Mid-Continent to restructure where we can understanding that the challenge there is that the contracts are much smaller, there's not a lot of large volume contracts and it's a bit more tedious work and of course more challenging, more challenging environment. Christine Cho : Okay, thank you and then last question from me, how much NVC are you still collecting right now in the NGL business, dollar wise or volumes or whatever you can give would be helpful? Terry Spencer : Christine, we\u2019d not disclose that information, not going to disclose it here. Christine Cho : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Abrams from Morgan Stanley. Tom Abrams : Thanks. Just thinking about Oklahoma and the SCOOP-STACK and the excitement building there, is there any buzz that we get out of the Cana-Woodford, is that additive to the SCOOP-STACK thought processes, or is it operationally separate? Kevin Burdick : Tom, this is Kevin. I guess when I talk about the STACK, we\u2019d roll in, I mean the Cana is right there with it. So as we think about our gathering system and our processing capacity, we kind of we pull those two together. Tom Abrams : Okay, fair. And then with all that [indiscernible] excitement is going to move up the need for some residual gas takeaway, when does the industry need to commit to a project and I guess really when can we, would it be Roadrunner 3. How would you guys play? Terry Spencer : Let Phillip May handle this question. Phillip May : Yeah we are actively in conversations with the producers about the issue and frankly have been for a couple of years, commodity prices coming off a year or so ago, kind of dampened that discussion but it's ramping up pretty rapidly right now. We have a pretty extensive interest rate system in Oklahoma that access somewhat of a super system, so we're very attractive to some of those producers from a residue takeaway perspective. But we do get to a point where we exhaust all of our available capacity and we're going to have to build a project and we've got a couple things that we're talking about right now to several of those producers. So I think it's sooner rather than later. Terry Spencer : The only thing I would add to that is that, if you think about your question relating to Roadrunner, many of these producers in here in Oklahoma understand what Roadrunner means to producers up in this region and many of them would like to have access to that pipeline and get access to those markets in Mexico, so they're thinking broadly about where they can get their gas and access to those markets in Mexico and certainly it could like with the WesTex project it could other projects similar to Roadrunner or related to Roadrunner could develop as a result of that high level of interest in producers who wanted to get to markets in Mexico. Tom Abrams : And just lastly, could you remind us of your debt to EBITDA comfort zone or target. How much you might want to drift below that temporarily if you're waiting for a project like this to be to come in? Derek Reiners : Sure, this is Derek. We finished June 30 about 4.4 times debt to EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis, I think if you look at that on a run rate it's closer to, it's around 4.2. Our target is to get that below four times and obviously we've been taking steps to actively make that happen. So obviously we've got capital in our forecast and so we'll factor that all and that's still headed towards the four times or less. Tom Abrams : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : Thanks. As an extension of the question from [indiscernible], you guys have met your budget for the year thus far. If you continue to do so what are expectations for the resumption of dividend growth and distribution growth that OKS has and how much is your leverage target sort of playing out that that decision? Terry Spencer : As far as dividend and distribution growth goes it's still early. We continue to assess the markets, you know the markets have backed up a bit here as of late. We're not out of the woods yet as an industry. So we're going to continue to try to carry that coverage we're building coverage that at OKS and getting it really gotten some good traction there. We hate to back up on that prematurely so as we move into the planning phase here in late 2016, and put together our forecast and guidance for 2017, we will certainly assess and there is a possibility of increases in the distribution in the dividend. But candidly at this point in time we like where we are right now. I think it's prudent to manage it the way we've been doing it. Danilo Juvane : Alright, the follow-up to that, if you post it at the end of the year and you are still targeting if not modestly exceeding your budget, would that put you in a position to consider an increase at that point or I guess what else would you be looking for - on the end of the year? Terry Spencer : Well okay, so let me just reiterate we get to the end of the year through our planning phase, we're going to sit down with our Board and we're going to - we will assess our cash needs and make a decision at that particular point in time and certainly when we roll out you'll know exactly what our plans are. Danilo Juvane : Great thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Yeah, good morning and congrats on a nice quarter, just Terry could, I mean you made some comments about ethane recoveries, I mean and I think you said it was like 3000 barrels a day or so, so not a whole lot here in the first and second quarter, but as we're moving here into the second half, I mean in terms of incremental ethane recovery volumes, what do you think you're going to be seeing at this point and then obviously you've put on some slides out there where you're expecting a pretty large increase in 2017, so maybe if you could just a little more color on the trajectory would be great? Terry Spencer : Sure, I will let Sheri to tackle that question. Sheridan Swords : John, we did see increased ethane recovery in the second quarter but as the price have slid and spread between ethane and natural gas have compressed, we are back down into the 175,000 to 200,000 barrels a day of ethane being rejected across our system today and really we expect that ethane recovery in rejection will kind of inadvertently go in and out as we finish the rest of the year, but we don't expect a whole lot more of ethane recovery to the rest of this year. As we get into 2017, we think that we will gradually come out of ethane rejection as we first quarter 2017 in the Mid-Continent and we'll probably end up the end of the year being about half - into 2017 being about half what we are today. John Edwards : Okay, all right so somewhere in the kind of 80,000- 90,000 range of additional recovery is I guess is a fair number. Sheridan Swords : Yes. John Edwards : Okay, all right and then you were talking a little bit I think to it was Christine's question as far as any additional upside from restructurings. I mean and I know you don't really want to talk too much about or quantify it in some way. I mean can you say that you know directionally at least you are expected to be higher, I mean could you at least give us that much as far as that goes? Derek Reiners : Yes. I think directionally we would expect it to continue to creep up but I don\u2019t - again I don\u2019t know, I don\u2019t expect that you are going to see the sizable increases we have seen over the previous couple quarters. John Edwards : Okay, alright. That\u2019s helpful, that\u2019s it from me. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Jeremy. Unidentified Analyst : Yeah, it\u2019s Chris on for Jeremy. The first question is on JMP fee based margins, you\u2019ve talked about them in the first half of this year, so when we were thinking about the second half, so to what degree could contract restructuring benefit the second half of the year and also how much of a mixed shift could that - could impact results in the second half as well. Terry Spencer : Kevin, you want to reiterate. Kevin Burdick : When we talked about, we have seen the uptick in the first half, as we think about it in the second half of the year, I would think about it kind of where we are at just a slight increase maybe as we go to the rest of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. And then in terms of the contract restructuring thus far, what kind of, you see where we are in, in terms of the existing, are you current expectation and then also in terms of your efforts thus far what\u2019s been your success rate with customer\u2019s internal feedback at large? Derek Reiners : Again as I and Terry has talked about, when we set out in 2015, we have accomplished almost everything we set out to do. So we are well into the game, and we will continue as we have opportunities going forward. Unidentified Analyst : Great, and then let\u2019s move on to asset recovery, you guys mentioned, you have seen some ethane recovery, but at the same time, it\u2019s kind of an offset by those NVCs, so I was wondering what part of the system is exact on the fraction ration in NGL pipes, any color there would be helpful. Sheridan Swords : Yeah I mean most of the ethane recoveries we have seen have come out of our Mid-Continent volume, and some of it\u2019s been on transportation element, and some of that you have seen come out of the frac space, unless they [indiscernible], and today that ethane has gone back to rejections, we were back to where we were at the start of the year, between 175,000 to 200,000 barrels a day on the system. Unidentified Analyst : And when we think about the cadence going in at 2017, I guess to what extent are those NVC is going to impact potential uplift? Sheridan Swords : Well, the 200 million, when we said we had a $200 million uplift, when all of that comes down, we took in to account the NVCs when we stated that number. Unidentified Analyst : Got it, that\u2019s helpful and last one from me, on the Roadrunner you guys were ahead of your schedule for 4Q \u201816, what\u2019s driving the earlier than expected start-up date? Terry Spencer : Well candidly, we have done a great job in construction, and we have got great contractors out there, getting the work done, we had the benefit of weather. I think as I said in my comments, we actually expected to encounter some difficult conditions in the way of rock, and we have just not encountered those conditions, so it\u2019s just gone very well, and accordingly we are ahead of schedule and revising our completion date. Unidentified Analyst : Alright, thanks a lot guys. Terry Spencer : You bet, thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Hi Craig. Craig Shere : I know that you didn't want to get into how much remains on the NVCs, that\u2019s covered by existing volumes, but perhaps you could help us with getting a sense for when you expect ethane recovery to start or meaningfully hitting the bottom line, is it a first half type situation or to really feel some of the stronger Mid-Continent benefits next year or it's really more second half. Terry Spencer : Well what I would say is we think that we will ramp up the Mid-Continent volume that goes to Belvieu in the first half, 2017 more weighted towards the latter part of the first half. And then the second half is where you'll get a little bit more the Mid-Continent, maybe they will have a common pricing out of it. So you would say you would see most of it weighted towards the second half, but you will start seeing meaningful impact in the first half of 2017. Craig Shere : Okay, great. And another question is about the dividend distribution policy, like I know it's a dynamic market, I know we got to wait, you'll be in your planning phase some months, as we move towards the end of the year, but you normally have annual dividend distribution policy and we're in a very dynamic market and you've already commented how you're in the catbird seat to take advantage of recovering markets once they stabilize. If we're in mid-2017 and all of a sudden things are looking better, producer activity is changing, could you call an audible and make a mid-year adjustment? Derek Reiners : Certainly we could, and we look at it every quarter, and we examine it, and then spend as you would expect a robust amount of time talking about our dividend and distribution policies with the two companies. So it's entirely possible that if the conditions in our point of view change or improve dramatically, certainly we would consider it. Craig Shere : Okay, great. And last quarter, there were some comments about an attractive situation for cost reduction opportunities. I know that we had a bit of a sequential increase in quarterly OpEx, but some of that was partly due to timing issues. Can you elaborate about ongoing prospects for both corporate overhead, OpEx, cost containment in this market environment? Terry Spencer : Well. So you know broadly speaking the low hanging fruit in terms of cost containment or cost reduction opportunities is really attributable to reduced contractor cost that is the market and the rates associated with the services that we hire out, had reduced dramatically and they continue to soften. So that\u2019s probably the lion share of the cost benefits. Certainly we are working to try operator assets efficiently and try and find ways to reduce maintenance cost in other ways in just the market, and we\u2019ve had some success in doing that, but I think in the first quarter I think generally speaking, we were talking more in the order of what\u2019s the market giving us in terms of reduced rates. Craig Shere : Okay, do you see any ongoing opportunity there or we\u2019ve already kind of\u2026 Terry Spencer : Probably, the lowest hanging fruit has already been picked, but we continue to apply pressure. And there continues to be fallout and adjustments in the third party service arena and we're constantly looking for opportunities to get you know better rates and lower costs from our suppliers and vendors, there's still opportunity out there although it's slowing. Craig Shere : Okay, great, and last question, I'm sorry, it was probably in the prepared comments, but what was the spot volumes in the quarter again? Derek Reiners : For NGLs? Craig Shere : Yes. Derek Reiners : I don\u2019t think we provided that number but, Sheridan do you want - Sheridan Swords : It\u2019s about 8000 barrels. Craig Shere : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey Terry. Terry Spencer : Hey Chris, how you are doing? Chris Sighinolfi : I'm good, I'm good thanks. Nice work on that continued improvement in the gathering fee and I appreciate the dialogue around the role in the mix shift, we were curious about that ourselves. I'm just curious, I guess with regard to the ongoing re-contracting effort itself and realizing you know that the bulk of those identified opportunities have already been done, but I'm just wondering if there is any change in producer acceptance of that effort. You know I ask it because there was at Williston Basin, producer who this quarter disclosed that it\u2019s initiated arbitration for seatings with its midstream provider because it was unwilling to do a move to fee and so I am just wondering if that's indicative of anything or if that\u2019s anything you've seen. Terry Spencer : Well I won't make any comments about the producer, but what I will say is that with nearly all the producers we've dealt with all have understood the story and the rationale. They understood why our contracts had certain provisions in them that allowed this to happen or allowed the renegotiation to happen. They understood the need. They understood the requirement that we continue to need to be incentivized to invest capital in these areas. I think all the producers got it. None of them really - none of them liked it, but they understood the reality. They certainly did not want us to pick up and invest capital elsewhere. They needed capital to continue to be invested; they needed the services in order to monetize their reserves and continue to produce their crude oil candidly in the basin. So they all understood the rationale and as I said before, it was a long process, one that was carefully, we were very careful on the discussion with the producers, and patient and very open. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay thanks. Terry Spencer : Does that help you? Chris Sighinolfi : It does, yeah, we haven\u2019t seen any issue like that, and then we started this one last quarter, so I was just curious if that signal just shifted, it seems like it maybe just an one-off situation. So I appreciate just the clarification on that. Switching gears a little bit, maybe that\u2019s a question for Sheridan, but wondering in your ethane outlook, how much switching that you guys are encouraged by the crackers, I think earlier in the Q&A dialog you talked about beginning to move more ethane towards the first half of 2017. I\u2019m just wondering what has taken there with regard to - effectively the feedstock ability on the cracking fleet, there was an assumption or if there is just a general way to think about that. Sheridan Swords : When you say switching, switching feeds to propane. Chris Sighinolfi : Yeah exactly. Terry Spencer : Cracking propane instead of ethane, you know our view always has been and we still understand that most of these crackers only can crack at bay, okay there is few that have the capability to switch and I think there's been perhaps some, I don\u2019t know if it's confusion or what, the information hasn't been real clear, but we talk to these petro chemical companies all the time and we have a very good understanding of what they can and can't do and Sheridan, actually I\u2019ll let Sheridan - Sheridan Swords : And we think that there's a switching capability that the crackers can consume somewhere around 500,000 barrels a day of propane, which we are doing about 400,000 today. So there's not a whole lot more switching capability. As Terry said, the new crackers that are coming online the big crackers all except for Dow are ethane only crackers and Dow has some flexibility and it's not - none of these are it's not a full flexibility, but they can't consume a little bit more, switch a little bit in between propane and ethane, but mostly everything is coming on and all the expansions are ethane only. Chris Sighinolfi : Right, so switching that we have focused on would obviously be on the legacy fleet, but if there's a pickup and I think demand from the new end services, if prices are warranted not - not a totally crazy scenario that there might be some loss on the legacy fleet? Sheridan Swords : Right. Chris Sighinolfi : But your point is as you look at it you think at most that would be about 100,000 barrels a day? Sheridan Swords : Right. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay, all right well thanks a lot guys. I appreciate the color. Terry Spencer : Thanks Chris. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hey everyone. Terry Spencer : Hey Michael. Michael Blum : Just on the, I guess this is one question, the uptick in NGL optimization and marketing, can you just kind of talk about what's driving that and I guess not expecting you to give us the secret sauce, but just kind of what type of metrics can we look out from the outside to sort of try to predict a little better how that business will trend. Terry Spencer : Sheridan, you got any sauce? Sheridan Swords : Yeah, there is a secret sauce. But Michael when I look at it, as when you look at optimization the big thing you want to look at is you want to look at the spreads on all five products between Conway and Belvieu, and we've seen a little bit wider spreads between Conway and Belvieu, and that's why you're seeing an uptick in optimization. On the marketing, the big thing we've seen in the second quarter had been we were moving a lot of propane from the Bakken and from the Northeast into Conway and that shows up in our marketing our - that's where our truck and rail activity is housed, we're seeing a lot of movement come into the Mid-Continent. Over December period time, it will be the second, third quarter, we will see that moving of propane. Michael Blum : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Theresa [Indiscernible] with Simmons and Company. Unidentified Analyst : Hi, good morning, just a quick follow-up on the NGL supplier opportunities in the SCOOP and STACK. When you're talking about the 100,000 incremental barrels per day of NGL, can you just give us a sense of what kind of pricing assumptions are baked into this and whether strategic [Indiscernible] like sub 40? T.D. Eureste: Pricing - I'm sorry, pricing assumptions for the NGLs, what we were charged, only thing we have put out there is that the average price we have in the Mid-Continent is roughly around $0.08 per gallon. That is a combination of both when we delivered Conway into Bellevue, most of these will probably go to Bellevue, so you're probably $0.08-plus per gallon of what we are charged for this movement if our customers want to go to Bellevue. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. And just one other one on the continued strength in process in fractionated volumes. Should we expect this to continue into Q3 or just expect more of like the seasonal shift in Q4 as usual? And also would you think of adding even more incremental processing plans aside from the three connections expected in the second half of \u201816 if we continue to see this increase in volume? T.D. Eureste: When you look at the fractionation volumes in the uptick you see from the first and the second quarter, you've got to be a little careful, because we did have a lot of raw feed in storage from the first and the second quarter. So, you really need to kind of think about those averages across the two and we had a little bit spot volume and some more ethane recovery that kind of boosted those numbers up there. We still think that we look at our guidance that we have out there for fractionation will be middle, will be right around the middle, maybe a little better than that for the rest of the year. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, great. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks a lot. I appreciate it. Operator : And our final question will come from Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley. Tom Abrams : Yeah. Just a question on the Bakken and kind of how does it work question, as the wells produce and you get more gas I think as they mature, do you get more NGLs such that if production were to say, oil production were to say remained flat that you would actually see an increase in gas processed and an increase in NGLs recovered. T.D. Eureste: Kevin, you\u2019re following? Kevin Burdick : Yeah, I mean we have especially in the Williston we have seen an increased gas to oil ratio in the core, so that's where we have seen as oil has been flat to slightly declining, the gas produced out of the basin has actually strengthened over the last several months. It came off a little bit in May - in April and May, but that's the phenomenon. More of it I think is related to the wells being drilled in the core as much as it is just the increasing gas as the oil declines. Tom Abrams : I got you. T.D. Eureste: The only thing I'd add to that is in the core that those gas to oil ratios are much higher than in other parts of the basin, right. Kevin Burdick : That\u2019s correct. T.D. Eureste: Yeah. Tom Abrams : Good. Thanks a lot. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I'll turn the conference back to Mr. T.D. Eureste at this time for any additional or closing remarks. T.D. Eureste: Thank you. A quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October and extends until earnings are released after the market closes in early November. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day, and welcome to the Third Quarter 2016, ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Earnings Call. Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Mr. T. D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners\u2019 third quarter 2016 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning and thank you for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and Senior Vice Presidents; Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural gas liquids; Kevin Burdick, Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Phill May, Natural Gas Pipelines. In yesterday\u2019s earnings releases we reiterated that ONEOK and ONEOK Partners expect to finish 2016 in line with financial guidance. In addition, we provided updated 2016 volume estimates for the gathering and processing and Natural gas liquid segments in the third quarter earnings presentation. As I\u2019ve discussed previously, our industry is experiencing one of many down cycles in my career and it\u2019s been particularly challenging due to the duration of the low commodity price environment. While the cyclical nature of this industry continues, we are seeing more positive data points from our producer and end user customers, industry fundamentals see to be improving and most importantly ONEOK Partners\u2019 is well positioned to benefit from growth opportunities in 2017 and beyond. Our businesses have performed well in a tough environment and we remain disciplined and committed to making prudent operational, commercial and financial decisions. As I think about opportunities, I remain confident in our ability to serve our petrochemical customers as their ethane demand grows. We also continue to see producer activity ramping up in the STACK and SCOOP, which we expect will benefit all three of our business segments. And most importantly, the available capacity in our Natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments gives us room to grow without the need for large capital spending. Or more than $9 billion of investments over the last 10 years gives us the flexibility to grow with our producer and end user customers without needing to spend significant capital. The efforts we have taken during this down cycle to better position ONEOK and ONEOK Partners will allow us to continue providing value to our stakeholders. Derek that concludes my opening remarks. Derek Reiners : Okay, thank Terry. Starting at the partnership, second quarter 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2016 and year-to-date adjusted EBITDA of approximately $1.4 billion represents 23% increase, compared with the same period last year, benefiting from recently completed capital growth projects across our system and sustained higher average fee rates in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. ONEOK Partners\u2019 distribution and coverage ratio was 1.11 times for both the third quarter and year-to-date 2016. In yesterday\u2019s earnings release we also lowered the partnership\u2019s expected maintenance capital spend for 2016. About $10 million of this reduction relates primarily to the timing of an NGL relocation project, $5 million for information technology upgrades, $5 million from lower than expected vendor and contractor costs, with the balance being various smaller items. We continue deleveraging the partnership\u2019s already strong balance sheet as trailing 12 months GAAP debt to EBITDA improved again to 4.3 times at September 30. We continue to expect leverage of 4.2 times or less for the full year 2016. The partnership has ample liquidity and more than $1.7 billion of capacity on its $2.4 billion credit facility at September 30. In October we repaid $450 million, 6.15% senior notes with the combination of cash on hand and short-term borrowings. We continue to have no debt or equity capital market needs, until well into 2017. However, we will continue to assess the markets for opportunities to proactively manage our future debt maturities and liquidity at the partnership. The proactive steps we\u2019ve taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized. In October, Moody\u2019s affirmed the partnership\u2019s investment grade Baa2 credit rating and improved our outlook to stable from negative. Also, we expect these improvements will provide the partnership flexibility with excess coverage in the future. Options include, repaying debt, funding capital expenditures, acquisitions or increasing the distribution. On a standalone basis ONEOK ended third quarter with more than $230 million of cash and continues to expect to have approximately $250 million by year-end 2016, with an undrawn $300 million credit facility allowing us continued financial flexibility. ONEOK\u2019s third quarter dividend coverage was 1.3 times consistent with the second quarter. ONEOK\u2019s healthy coverage and liquidity provides flexibilities we transition into 2017. Leverage improvements increased distribution coverage and increased fee base earnings at ONEOK Partners have decreased thee potential need for ONEOK\u2019s support of the partnership. We will continue to be a supportive general partner to ONEOK partners, to help maintain its investment grade credit ratings, but also recognize that we have many potential options for the excess coverage at ONEOK. Those options include purchasing additional units in the partnership, repaying debt, repurchasing ONEOK shares, funding ONEOK Partners capital growth at the ONEOK level, acquisitions and increasing dividends to shareholders. I\u2019d like to reiterate, from a financial perspective, we\u2019re pleased with the progress we\u2019ve made in 2016 at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Through the downturn we\u2019ve maintained our $0.615 per quarter dividend and ONEOK and $0.79 per quarter distribution at ONEOK Partners, while also improving coverage and reducing leverage through the proactive steps we\u2019ve taken. And we continue looking for additional ways to increase shareholder value. Now, I\u2019ll turn the call back over to Terry. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Let\u2019s take a closer look at each of our business segments. Let\u2019s start with our Natural gas liquid segment and some updates to our outlook for the year. In the presentation we released with earnings, we updated our expected NGL volume estimates for 2016. We have seen lower volumes than expected with the lower margin gathered only barrels particularly on our West Texas LPG system and in the Barnett Shale. However, we have also seen higher fractionated volumes, as gathered and fractionated barrels that earn higher fee rates have been strong on the Bakken NGL pipeline and the Mid-Continent region and we\u2019ve also fractionated more spot barrels during the year. We expect 2016 gathered volumes to average approximately 780,000 barrels per day, compared with our previous expected range of 800,000 to 870,000 barrels per day. And we expect volumes fractionated to average approximately 590,000 barrels per day, which is at the high end of our previous expected range. In the third quarter of 2016, we connected two additional third party natural gas processing plants, one each in the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent. Including the connection of our Bear Creek natural gas processing plant in the Williston Basin, we\u2019ve connected a total of six new plants to our NGL system in 2016. At full capacity, Bear Creek is expected to generate approximately 10,000 to 12,000 barrels per day white grade takeaway excluding Y-grade takeaway excluding ethane. The expected ethane growth from the petrochemical industry remains a key opportunity for ONEOK partners. As we said previously, approximately one third of the ethane currently being rejected in the U.S. is on our system. We continue to expect a meaningful impact from the ethane opportunity as new petrochemical plants come online, plus an increase in ethane exports during 2017. And we expect as much as $200 million annual EBITDA impact to the segment launching for ethane recovery. Recently we\u2019ve been talking quite a bit about the STACK and SCOOP Plays in Oklahoma and the rapidly developing growth opportunities they can provide to all of our business segments, but particularly our Natural gas liquid segment because of our position as a critical NGL takeaway provider in the area. We estimate that we\u2019re currently gathering approximately 150,000 to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the STACK and SCOOP areas, which accounts for more than 20% of our expected 2016 gathered volumes and demonstrates our strong position in the growing STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent where many producers are moving in, drilling rigs and seeing very positive results. Wells in the STACK Play in particular are very NGL rich with 6 gallons to 9 gallons of NGLs per Mcf in the natural gas stream. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment, we expect natural gas volumes gathered to average approximately 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates 1.7 billion to 1.8 billion cubic feet per day. This whole driver of these changes as we said previously, are delays to large multi-well drilling pads and steeper than anticipated declines in gathered only volumes in the Mid-Continent. We expect natural gas volumes processed to average approximately 1.4 billion to 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2016, compared with previous estimates of 1.5 billion to 1.6 billion cubic feet per day. Our 2016 Williston Basin volume estimates remain unchanged and have benefited from a backlog of drilled but uncompleted wells, slowed natural gas capture, new plants placed in service and continuing infrastructure build up. While Mid-Continent volumes have been volatile this year, we continue to expect the segment to have higher natural gas processed volumes in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter 2016, as we\u2019ve seen the completion of several wells in October and expect additional multi-well pad completions through the end of 2016 and into early 2017. We expect Mid-Continent processed volumes to reach nearly 690 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. Specifically in the STACK, drilling economics remain viable based on recent conversations with our producers and well results have been impressive. We\u2019ve seen some wells on our acreage averaged 30 day peak initial production rates of 8 million to 10 million cubic feet per day. In the Williston Basin we expect natural gas processed volumes to reach nearly 780 million cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter. This volume increase is driven by our recently completed Bear Creek plant and by increased well completions as producers work off some of their drilled but uncompleted well inventory. The segments average fee rate remains $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2016, unchanged from the second quarter 2016 and up $0.33 per MMBtu compared with the third quarter of 2015. Sustained higher fee rates have provided stable earnings for the segment and we expect the fee rate to stabilize in this range with some fluctuation due to volume or contract mix changes. With the full benefit of our contract restructuring efforts being realized in 2016 and volume benefits from capital growth projects completed this year, we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance for the segment. In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter 2016 increased 17%, compared with the second quarter 2016, driven by increased contracted capacity. In October, the segment completed its 260 million cubic feet per day WesTex Transmission pipeline expansion and the second phase of its joint venture Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline, which adds an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of capacity to the Roadrunner pipeline. Both projects were completed ahead of original schedules and below cost estimates and are fully subscribed under long-term fee based commitments. We\u2019ve been successful in our strategy to new markets such as Mexico closer to supply areas, such as West Texas and then Mid-Continent. Our recently completed Roadrunner and WesTex pipeline projects are examples of our ability to do this and as the STACK and SCOOP continue to gain momentum, we\u2019re well positioned to revive needed residue take away options. We\u2019re currently connected to 34 natural gas processing plants in Oklahoma with a total combined capacity of approximately 1.8 billion cubic feet per day and have a broad footprint throughout the state, placing us in a strong position to offer transportation and storage services as producer activity picks up in the Mid-Continent. Related to this effort, yesterday we posted a binding open season soliciting interest in expanding segments of our intrastate natural gas pipeline in Oklahoma, ONEOK gas transmission, to drive additional residue take away from the STACK and SCOOP production areas. The expansion would provide increased capacity in delivery options and the pipelines in the Western Oklahoma serving markets in the upper Mid-West and Texas. We have secured a firm commitment from a customer to support expanding the pipeline being incremental 100 million cubic feet per day and in the open season we will seek additional long-term firm commitments from shippers to support a broader expansion of the facility. With nearly 100% fee based earnings in the segment and our portfolio of high quality and high connectivity assets, we\u2019ll continue to look for additional opportunities to grow the stable business. Acting as a solution provider to end use markets has served us well and will continue to be a key segment strategy. To wrap up, I\u2019d like to reiterate that we expect to finish 2016 in line with our financial guidance. We\u2019ve seen better than expected results so far in our natural gas pipeline segment and on target results in our gathering and processing segment. Our natural gas liquid segment remained slightly below our operating income and equity earnings guidance for the year. With line of sight into our expected earnings growth, strong balance sheets at ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and continued healthy coverage, we expect to be in a position to increase dividend and distribution payments to stakeholders in the second half of 2017, if industry fundamentals continue to improve. Financially and operationally we\u2019re in a strong position and we have the flexibility to take advantage of opportunities to create additional shareholder value. Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmentally responsibly. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Good morning, I was just want to talk a little bit about OKEs tax situation going into 2017, what are you expecting for the cash tax rate if nothing changes and how are you thinking about managing coverage going forward if we have to assume that cash tax is [indiscernible]? Derek Reiners : Eric, this is Derek. We will guide to cash taxes for 2017 when we rollout the rest of our guidance, maybe later this year or early next year. We do think about and we do forecast cash taxes as we think about distributions. Obviously, we\u2019ve been running sicker coverage at OKE here in this period of some uncertainty, but as we look forward and think about the dividend growth, we\u2019ll consider the cash tax as a part of that announced. Eric Genco : Okay, and if you were to consider doing a transaction at the OKE level, are there ways that you could basically structure a deal where you would be able to sort of take advantage of the OKE currency but then also shield some of the taxes, like if you were to buy a C core that had some differed taxes, would you be able to use that to shield some of the OKE income or does it exclusively go to whatever you purchase and just how should we think about that? Wes Christensen : Yeah, I think you\u2019re thinking about that right Eric. Certainly we have - look the two balance sheets have some flexibility in terms of structuring any sort of an acquisition. Stock-for-stock deals probably would not result in a step up in the basis, but if we structure the transaction in some other ways such that the acquired entity is stepped up for tax purposes and obviously that would generate a fair amount of additional shield there. Terry Spencer : Yeah, certainly, Eric, this is Terry. Yeah, we\u2019re obviously highly focused on the tax liability in OKE and we\u2019ll continue with thinking about opportunities where we could acquire assets or businesses that could help shelter those taxes. So that\u2019s an ongoing process and certainly as we prepare our 2017 - we\u2019re in the middle of our 2017 planning process with our boards. As we come out of that process, we may be in a position to shed even more light on our thought. And I think broadly speaking as we think about OKE coming to your earlier question, we\u2019ve kept the sticker coverage in this very challenging environment, but I think as you think about coverage going forward at OKE over a much longer term period, we\u2019re going to gravitate more toward a 1.0 to 1.1 coverage range. So that\u2019s kind of how we\u2019re thinking about it in a much longer term perspective. Eric Genco : Okay. Thank you for taking my question. I\u2019ll jump back in queue. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll now take our question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Today and maybe I just can follow-up on the last question actually that you just had, which I think you answered based on the OK level. I was wondering if you can talk about it at the OKS level. Can you share with us how management in the board is thinking about what\u2019s the acceptable coverage ratio that you'd like to see at OKS before you would consider an increase? Some other management teams have talked about 115 being the new 105 or 120 being the new 105. Just wondering if you can sort of give us your thoughts with respect to that and - and how you're thinking about a higher retain DCF to fund growth CapEx kind of on a go-forward basis versus just maintaining the old 250 model? Wes Christensen : Yeah, I think, Shneur, yeah, we\u2019re thinking very similar to our peers caring a bit thicker coverage I think broadly speaking over the long term at OKS, coverage in the 101 to 102 range is kind of how we're thinking about it longer term. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then - Wes Christensen : If we can - if we can establish a sustainable coverage at that level, then certainly we've got to be thinking about distribution growth when we get to that point. Shneur Gershuni : Right. Okay. So, 101 to 102 is kind of the new target range that we should be thinking about for OKS? Wes Christensen : Yeah, it\u2019s correct. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then in terms of all the detail that you gave on the SCOOP/STACK I think was on Slide 4, you sort of talked about the potential for this SCOOP/STACK mentioned very minimal capital for 100,000 barrel increase on the NGL system. You also highlighted that you have some idle capacity decking come on line. So I guess I really have two questions. One, given all the excitement [ph] by the producers, what is the timeframe that we would expect to see you FID that decision to spend a 100 million in capital and bring that idle plant back? And then secondly, could we actually see new builds of facilities as well too beyond kind of the operating leverage that you just highlighted? Wes Christensen : Well, Shneur, I think we\u2019re seeing tremendous development in the STACK and SCOOP as we speak and it's - and it's still early. Now, this 100,000 barrel a day potential is, as we've said in the past, is a two to three-year phenomenon. Certainly, at the rate that we're seeing this development it could happen earlier. But a two to three-year timeframe I think is an appropriate way to think about it. And as we - as we move into 2017 and we hear more about producers\u2019 plans and as they prove their budgets, we're going to get a better sense of the SCOOP and STACK and what it will mean to us from a timing standpoint. We\u2019ll be in a position to better refine that certainly as we move into the first quarter 2017. Sheridan, do you anything to? Sheridan Swords : The only thing I would add is that we continue to get multiple calls from the processors out there trying to add more plants in the area and as processors are talking to us, they continue to revise their volumes up. So, the chance of that moving forward in the two to three time frame is a great possibility. Shneur Gershuni : Okay, great. Thank you very much guys. I really appreciate the color. Sheridan Swords : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Brian Gamble with Simmons and Company. Brian Gamble : Good morning, guys. Sheridan Swords : Good morning. Wes Christensen : Good morning. Brian Gamble : Good morning. A follow-up on that point, lots of producers out this morning and last night chatting about SCOOP/STACK development, down in Marathon, you feel the whole nine yard, it seems like they're adding rigs and putting out wells that are well in excess of what they had previously planned. The 150,000 to 200,000 barrels you're talking about that you're pulling now from SCOOP/STACK, is that - I guess were the upside potential there without additional - additional assets on your end and then you've mentioned the 100,000 barrels a day and the minimum capital there, is there I guess additional capacity within the system as it sits today for Q4, Q1, maybe Q2 just the short-term ramps or do we need to see dollars for that direction to allow additional volumes at the system? Kevin Burdick : Yeah. So, you answered the question. We do have capacity available today for some of it. I think what we said, Sheridan, 40,000 barrels a day today. So, that's capacity that's existing naturally in the system that we don't - we don't have to expend any meaningful capital for that. There's the incremental 60,000 barrels a day that gets you to the 100,000 is where we'd have to spend some capital and I think that number was on the order of 100 million. Sheridan Swords : Yeah, to get to the whole 100 million we need to spend, the whole 100,000, we need to spend about 100 million and a bulk of that is going to be the incremental pumps on Sterling to get to the 60,000. Kevin Burdick : So, the gathering infrastructure that we have in the play is pretty extensive and it's been there a while and it's - we\u2019re well positioned. It\u2019s the downstream moving the barrels downstream to the market where, as Sheridan indicates, where that capital has been spent. Brian Gamble : Okay. It\u2019s helpful. And then on the net gas numbers pulling those down for the year, seem like the direction we're heading out to the Q2 results and kind of softness that is targeted for Q3. When we look at the exit rates, you mentioned the multi-pad well delays coming, I guess, coming into the fold, is that the only the - is that the only benefit that we're getting that leads to those higher rates or do those higher rates also foreshadow activity increases on top of the delayed connections? Kevin Burdick : Yeah, this is Kevin. It's really both. I mean we are seeing - there have been the delays that have really caused the lower volumes and the lower guidance. Those pads are coming online. We've seen some of that already completed in October. There are now some - some more - many additional wells to come online through the rest of this year and we've also got visibility into early \u201816 to expect that ramp to continue on into the early parts of \u201816 as well. So, with the producer activity and the ramp that we've seen in completions and also some visibility we have into rigs going forward, that's what gives us the confidence that that ramp will continue through Q4 and then into Q1. Brian Gamble : Kevin, what type of magnitude of change so we see from Q4 into Q1 based on your visibility today? Just trying - I know too early to guide \u201817, but - but just given those comments, how dramatic is that continued ramp from current plan that you guys are aware of? Kevin Burdick : Well, it's - it is a little too early to talk about some specific numbers into Q1 and part of the reason there is, as Terry talked in his remarks, the size of these wells are extremely large. So, pads or wells being completed and moving around a little bit can swing your numbers. But as we release our guidance for \u201817, we\u2019ll provide some more color on how that - how that ramp occurs throughout the year. Brian Gamble : Great. I appreciate that, Kevin. Operator : Our next question will come from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi. So, I actually wanted to start off on some of the M&A comments or response that you gave to an earlier question. When you - you talked about cash being paid to sale taxes versus giving equity to a potential target. What's the leverage that you would be willing to go to at the parent in such a scenario? Derek Reiners : Christine, this is Derek. I think it depends a bit on the nature of the - of the acquisition and the - and the assets or the businesses within - within that business. So, if you think about what we've been trying to do over time is move more towards fee-based businesses, certainly the pipelines business where we've got Road Runner now in service in the West Texas expansion. Those more highly fee-based businesses perhaps could carry a little bit more leverage than one that\u2019s more volatile. So, I think it would depend a bit on that. What we've been targeting at the partnership for leverage is four times or less and we think we're going to be at 4.2 times or less by the end of this year. So, I don't think you would expect it to be dramatically higher than what we're thinking about today. Christine Cho : Okay. Sheridan Swords : Christine, I think ideally for us, the objective is not to get to four, but to get below four. And that's really - that's the long term goal, stay below four. Christine Cho : At the LP? Derek Reiners : That's right. That's in LP. Christine Cho : Okay. Derek Reiners : That\u2019s in LP. Christine Cho : Okay. And then moving over to the NGL segment, your Bakken G&P volumes were down sequentially over the last quarter, yet the volumes on the Bakken NGL pipe was up. It looked like there was some incremental ethane. But could you confirm that and talk about what's driving that? Sheridan Swords : The ethane is about, Christine, this is Sheridan. The ethane is about the same between the two quarters. We are seeing - as we saw a [ph] little bit of ramp up in our other volumes from the third-party plant that kind of makes up a little bit of the difference there. Christine Cho : Okay. So I think historically you guys have talked about like 25,000 barrels per day of ethane flowing down that pipe or what - what they\u2019re currently running at? Sheridan Swords : Well, actually about - I think what we said is 25,000 barrels a day is what ORM has extracted. What our plants have, we\u2019re seeing above 30,000 barrels a day if you put all the plants in there. Derek Reiners : So, that\u2019s affiliated in - Sheridan Swords : Affiliated in 25,000 and you get above 30,000 with the non-affiliated plants. Christine Cho : Okay. And we should continue - that level continues going forward? Sheridan Swords : That\u2019s correct. Christine Cho : Okay. And then I might be kind of getting ahead of myself. But when we think - you talk about Sterling 3 expansion and it's clearly really low cost 100,000 barrels per day. I mean 60,000 that you can add for 100 million. But is that kind of the last of the low-hanging fruit like because we do kind of have a line of sight into all of those assets being fully utilized. So, beyond that, would it have to be looping if you were to add capacity and does the capital spend become like meaningful if you want to add capacity beyond that? Sheridan Swords : Christine, if you want to add more raw fee capacity between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast, which would be expanding Sterling beyond the 60,000 or expanding our buckle you will be talking about loops and it will be more meaningful. Christine Cho : Okay. Can you give us an idea of how much more meaningful? Sheridan Swords : Well, a lot depends on how much volume you want to put on there and which one we put it on, but I can't give you an idea without having running through the hydraulics and everything else and volume predictions. Christine Cho : What about if a new build? How much more expensive would that be versus the looping? Sheridan Swords : Well, the new build would be substantially more expensive. I mean if you're going to - and we think about putting pumps on is actually really low-hanging fruit, very cheap, as we just said. You get 60,000 barrels a day for less than 100 million. And if you're going to go put in a line depending on what size of the line and you're talking probably a little bit under $100 million, I mean a 100 - a million dollars a mile to put that in. So looping is going to be much closer to the putting pumps on than it will be to a completely new build. Wes Christensen : Now, Christine, so the looping projects that we're talking about, we're not talking about necessarily a loop of the entire pipeline. These are - these are strategic loops between pump stations that we put depending upon the volumetric need in the most efficient place. So we're not talking about looping the entire - entire pipeline. So, that\u2019s something - so the capital - the capital expense a lot greater than just putting in pumps is not going to be the same as looping the entire pipeline. Christine Cho : Got it. Okay, great. Thank you for the color. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Wes Christensen : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Sorry if I missed it. But did you guys touch on the number of docks on your acreage across your systems? Wes Christensen : We have not touched on it, but we\u2019ll tell you the numbers about 375 or so in the Williston Basin on our dedicated acreage. Is that right, Kevin? Kevin Burdick : Yeah, that\u2019s kind of where we're maybe - maybe slightly lower than that right now and that's where we do expect that number will start to trend down through the fourth quarter and that's what as we've talked about our Williston volumes and Terry in his remarks, when we think about the increased activity we're seeing, a lot of that is the completion of docks. So, we'll see that number trend down between now and the end of the year. Jeremy Tonet : Thanks for that. And then there's - there has been a good amount of conversation on M&A in general. I was just wondering if you could take a step back at a higher level on how you see the market right now as far as the bid/ask spread? There has been some consolidation. There has been some transactions recently in this space. How do you see ONEOK fitting into that? Any thoughts would be helpful. Kevin Burdick : Well, so, Jeremy, we continue to assess opportunities and the challenges continue to find opportunities and our potential targets that are willing to transact. The bid/ask spread is still - is still wide. I think there will be more transactions and certainly for us as we think about transactions and we just - not just from an M&A perspective, but acquisitions strategically make a lot of sense and those are good fit. Do they make sense within our footprint, do they bring in an olden amount of commodity risk to us or do they perhaps bring a lot of fee-based, stable fee-based business to us? Those are all things that we think about and certainly our bias is more toward fee-based and not as much commodity exposures as some of the midstream businesses have. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. That's it for me. Thank you. Kevin Burdick : Yeah, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Yeah. Good morning everybody. Derek Reiners : Good morning. John Edwards : Thanks for taking my question. Just you made the comment in the opening remarks on the potential raise in the distribution, if things continue to go well perhaps in the second half of \u201817. I mean is a logical move through there as you expect your leverage at OKS to drop under four times by the second half of next year? Derek Reiners : Yeah, John, this is Derek. We do expect leverage to continue to ratchet down as we move through 2017. So, we\u2019ll be - I would expect that we would be in that area. John Edwards : Okay. And then, Derek, I presume you - before you contemplate recommending an increase of the distribution, you would really rather be below four times leverage correct? Derek Reiners : Well, sure, John, we would - I don't think we draw bright lines here and we're certainly looking forward even beyond \u201817 as we think about it going back to increasing the distribution. So if we've got to the good line of sight, I don't know that we're going to draw a bright line. But as I mentioned, we continue to see that leverage ratchet down and you've really seen that quarter after quarter here. I don't expect that to change. John Edwards : Okay, great. And then just following on Jeremy's question on the M&A front, obviously you want to have businesses that could potentially integrate where there is a footprint DP-based, I mean if there are - I mean are you looking at, say, any kind of step out opportunities or something where you think you'd like to geographically be in areas where you aren\u2019t currently? I mean just any thoughts around that potential appetite? Wes Christensen : Most of the transactions - potential targets that we - that we think about do have some overlap within our existing footprint, but do modestly reach into some other areas? I think that that could make sense for us. Looking something - looking a collection of assets stand-alone significantly outside our geographic footprint just the buying stuff because it's perhaps - you can get it at a good value. Certainly it doesn't have much appeal to us. But - but yeah modestly outside our footprint, it could make some sense. John Edwards : Okay. All right, my other questions have been answered. Thank you so much. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Just one question really, just on the quarter, can you talk a little bit more about what's driving lower volumes on West Texas LPG? I would think just given the dynamics on the Permian that - that might be at least steady to growing and then does that anything to do with the rate dispute that\u2019s going on? Thanks. Kevin Burdick : Yeah, yeah, Michael, I think most of that on West Texas pipe is ethane, ethane rejection. I think that's the - that's the most of that impact. Sheridan, anything else? Sheridan Swords : That\u2019s right. Michael Blum : Okay. Thank you very much. Kevin Burdick : You bet. Thank you, Michael. Operator : And our next question will come from Ethan Bellamy with Baird. Ethan Bellamy : Hey, guys. What\u2019s the remaining flared gas capture opportunity in North Dakota look like? How much of a backlog do you think you have there? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. Yeah, we're - we're still in that 70 million to 80 million a day range, we have brought on Bear Creek. We don't have - the state reports of the flaring a couple of months in arrears, so we don't have that data yet to give the exact numbers, but I would absolutely - I mean we know the flaring has gone down as Bear Creek has ramped up. We've just, as recently as last weekend, kind of completed the last step of a gathering system expansion that put out some additional flares. So, I would expect that run rate - we\u2019re expecting that run rate maybe to be in the 5% range kind of going forward if we think about the - our total production in the gas capture we expect going forward. Ethan Bellamy : So, just to understand it correctly, 5% year-on-year versus 2016 total gathering up there? Kevin Burdick : I\u2019m not sure. Apology there. Ethan Bellamy : What do you mean exactly by 5%? Kevin Burdick : Oh, okay, yeah, 5% of the production. So, if you go back to that theoretical chart that we put out there, we\u2019re in that a little over a 800 million a day of production on our acreage. So if you look at 5% of that, 40 million to 50 million a day flared gas may be on going. Ethan Bellamy : And when - as you look forward, when would you see that opportunity exhausted in terms of - at some point are you going to be capturing every - every new molecule that's produced or we\u2019re going to see a consistent backlog there as producers continue to bring on wells and flared gas? Kevin Burdick : Well, I don't - I don't think that it's ever going to go away completely. I mean there's always going to be some level of flared gas just to - just due to ongoing. You're always tying in new new infrastructure and new well connects, you're always going to have operational hiccups. So, there's always going to be some level of flaring and that's what I think that 5% range that would be kind of an ongoing run rate. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Hi, good morning. Sheridan Swords : Hey, Craig. Craig Shere : So, are you still confident speaking of M&A? Are you still confident about ultimately hitting that six to eight times EBITDA multiple all-in for the West Texas LPG pipeline? Sheridan Swords : Craig, this is Sheridan. Yeah, we're still confident. We\u2019re still getting - we are out there actively engaged with a lot of potential new processing plants that are coming on. So we\u2019re very excited about the volume growth that we see on the West Texas system. So, we - yeah, we\u2019re very confident about getting the six to eight times by I think what we said is 2020. Craig Shere : Okay. And any color on when - and when that rate dispute might be resolved? I mean you're below market on your rates, aren\u2019t you? Sheridan Swords : We are below market on the rates. I think the best thing we could say about is that we're going through the process. We're comfortable about our case. But it's up to the Texas Railroad Commission how the case progresses. So, we hope it soon. Craig Shere : Did they give a timeline for that? Sheridan Swords : No. We have a procedural schedule that we're walking through. Craig Shere : Understood and on the new STACK resolute gas pipeline opportunity, is it fair to say that that ought to be much better than the normal gas pipe EBITDA multiple and how large could it be? Phillip May : Yeah, this is Phil. I think it would be probably a good multiple project. It's at this point just expansion. There may be opportunities to develop more capacity as the open season matures, which may - may mean that we need to put in some pipe. But, yeah, it's probably 200 million to 400 million a day. I would say it\u2019s the sweet spot for us and it provides a lot of interconnectivity with the interstate pipelines out in West Texas. So it seems to be very popular discussion, because of the value associated with getting the molecules out there. Sheridan Swords : Phil, you probably looked from a multiple standpoint, probably on the low end of that five - of our typical five to seven times, are you going to be on the low end of that multiple range, Phillip May : Yes. Great, thank you. Craig Shere : That's great for a gas pipe. Sheridan Swords : Yeah, it is a great project. Craig Shere : And, look, there is some noise in the quarter; something is a little better than one would have expected. Gas pipes had a good quarter. You had some down, some of the more volatile margin staff with spreads. But you basically met street expectations and you're guiding to flattish to up fourth quarter NGL volumes and rising G&P volumes sequentially. Commodity pricing is much higher than the third quarter to date. ISO to normal butane spreads are up sequentially into the fourth quarter and you\u2019ll get a fourth quarter contribution from the recently completed pipes. My question is if you think street expectations of just over 20 million higher, sequential fourth quarter EBITDA might be light? Kevin Burdick : So, Craig, from a street expectations, what we - what we've told you that from a financial guidance perspective we're going to - we're going to hit our numbers. Okay. And so, I don't know where that - where that puts you in the fourth quarter relative to the street, but we feel highly confident in our ability to hit this financial guidance. And you're right there is a lot of noise in the business, in the industry, and there is a lot of things that move up and down and you know what, I'm really glad we\u2019re in a lot of basins and we've got a lot of levers to pull and we\u2019ve pulled some levers during the third quarter and we continue to pull levers each and every quarter. So, we've got a lot of optionality, a lot of flexibility, a lot of opportunity. We do have some upside in the - in the - in the fourth quarter. Some of these volumes in the G&P business materialize as these big pads come on line. We could see - it's not gotten cold yet, so you could see some upside in terms of NGL pricing and spreads and what have you. But you also do have - you've got headwinds too and you've got heavy inventories in the - in the industry that could weigh on it and some uncertainly in the export markets that could affect the industry near term. All in all for us, it equates to a high degree of confidence in our ability to hit our numbers in terms of our guidance. Does that help - does that help you? Craig Shere : That does. And I apologize I got on a little late. I had trouble dialing in. Was there any comment about the third quarter Mid-Con spot NGL gathered and the NGL frack spot volumes? Kevin Burdick : Sheridan? Sheridan Swords : The spot volumes in the third quarter were minimal. We didn\u2019t have all that spot lines in the third quarter, Craig. Craig Shere : Okay. Great. And lastly with M&A, is there any particular side of the business that you would emphasize or a geography like Permian where you already obviously made a move or maybe the Niobrara, any kind of color on where your wish list would be? Sheridan Swords : Craig, I think from the NGL\u2019s perspective, as we look at, we want to have something that is complimentary to the assets that we already have something that bolts on. I mean obviously from a resource play, the Permian is a very good play with West Texas pipeline, but in other areas anything we can put into our system to be able to continue that integrated chain is what we're going to be looking at. Craig Shere : Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question will come from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : Thanks and good morning. Most of my questions have been hit. Just I had one quick clarifying question though. With respect to you guys have a more visibility to distribution and dividend growth in 2017; do you have a sense of what that magnitude could be at OKS than OKE? Wes Christensen : No, we're not going to provide that information. We're going to - we go through our planning process here for 2017 here and to say we\u2019re in the middle of that process now. When we issue guidance, maybe we'll provide a bit more specificity for you. We're not prepared to do that at this point. Danilo Juvane : And as you sort of evaluate fundamentals potentially changing, you said that this sort of growth was contingent on fundamentals remaining intact, right. What specifically are you monitoring in terms of making that decision? Wes Christensen : Well, certainly just the overall industry climate commodity price environment, our producers are feeling how are they - how are they spending their capital, the petrochemical space, are they on schedule with their petrochemical plants, and - and just the general - the general climate of the industry and in particular our business. Danilo Juvane : Okay. That's it for me. Thank you. Wes Christensen : Yeah, thank you. Operator : It appears there are no further questions at this time. I'd like to turn the conference back to Mr. Eureste for any additional or closing remarks. T.D. Eureste: Thank you. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends to earnings are released after the market closes in late February. Thank you for joining us. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Good day and welcome to the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners Fourth Quarter 2016 Earnings Call. Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to today's host Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners fourth quarter and year end 2016 earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners\u2019 expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry? Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, T.D. Good morning and thank you all for joining today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. On this conference call is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President of Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer; and our Senior Vice Presidents; Wes Christensen, Operations; Sheridan Swords, Natural gas liquids; and Phil May, Natural Gas Pipelines. We also have Kevin Burdick, who is recently promoted to Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer reporting to me with responsibility for all of our business segment commercial activities. Kevin has served a number of key leadership roles and performed at a high level. I have no doubt that Kevin's exceptional leadership skills and experience will continue to serve the company well in his new role. Congratulations to Kevin. Thank you for joining us this morning to review our 2016 and fourth quarter results. ONEOK and ONEOK Partners reported strong 2016 financial performance as ONEOK Partners adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 18% compared with 2015. Increased fee based earnings drove double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in all three of our business segments. This strong year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth was achieved despite increased ethane rejection and severe weather in December that impacted volumes in our natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments in both the Williston Basin and the Mid-Continent.  The impact of the severe weather and increased ethane rejection in December reduced fourth quarter results by approximately $15 million. Severe weather continued early in the first quarter of 2017 impacting volumes but volumes have rebounded significantly in February to November 2016 levels which were some of our highest monthly volumes. We expect year-over-year adjusted EBITDA growth in 2017 to be weighted towards the back half of the year, this growth is driven by mostly routine high return capital expenditures to fill available capacity in our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments and sets the stage for significant adjusted EBITDA growth into 2018 and beyond.  Growth is expected to be fueled by industry fundamentals from increased producer activity and highly productive basins across our operating footprint and from increased ethane demand from the petrochemical industry and NGL exports. We anticipate closing our recently announced acquisition of the remaining 60% of ONEOK Partners that we don't already own in the second quarter of this year. We expect the transaction to be immediately accretive and then double-digit accretive to ONEOKs distributable cash flow in all years from 2018 through 2021 providing for a 21% initial dividend increase followed by expected annual dividend growth of 9% to 11% through 2021 with 1.2 times or greater dividend coverage all the while improving our consolidated credit metrics. Our integrated assets and growth over the last 10 years has us well positioned to capitalize on improving market fundamentals and the continued development of the extensive resource plays within our broad 37,000 mile footprint. Derek will now provide additional details about our financial performance and outlook. Derek S. Reiners: Thanks Terry, starting with the partnership fourth quarter and full year 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased compared with 2015 by approximately $20 million and $275 million respectively. ONEOK Partners distribution coverage ratio was 1.03 times for the fourth quarter and 1.09 times for the full year of 2016, a substantial improvement compared with the 0.86 times coverage for the full year 2015. The slightly lower fourth quarter distribution coverage ratio as anticipated was due to the timing of maintenance capital spending.  Credit metrics again improved the partnerships already strong balance sheet with a trailing 12 months GAAP debt-to-EBITDA ratio of 4.2 times at December 31st. ONEOK maintained its healthy dividend coverage throughout 2016 ending the full year coverage of 1.31 times or approximately $250 million of cash on hand and an undrawn $300 million credit facility. We expect to utilize ONEOKs available cash to pay down consolidated debt this year.  ONEOKs 2017 financial guidance was issued as if our proposed merger transaction with ONEOK Partners closed on January 1. We expect to true up the guidance for net income, income tax as a non-controlling interest once the timing and related impacts of the transaction are known. We still expect closing to occur in the second quarter. Adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow should not be materially impacted by the timing of the transaction closing.  For the NGL segments 2017 adjusted EBITDA guidance we are mindful of the primary components that may impact results including the timing and amount of additional ethane recovery and incremental volumes from the STACK and SCOOP. Based upon our current assessment of producer activity in petrochemical and construction we expect to be within the guidance range as this segment delivered nearly $1.1 billion in adjusted EBITDA in 2016. We expect to lower cost of funding resulting from our strong financial performance -\u2013 our strong financial performance and successful efforts to reduce commodity price risk combined with the recent transaction announcement which eliminates incentive distribution rights. Also the credit rating agencies have viewed ONEOK favorably placing ONEOK on review for upgrade to investment grade following the closing of the transaction. The expected growth in adjusted EBITDA and use of the excess cash on hand to repay debt should enhance ONEOK -- should enable ONEOK to improve its credit metrics reducing consolidated debt to EBITDA to round our target of four times in the next 18 to 24 months.  In terms of timing and next steps for the merger transaction we expect to file a registration statement and joint property statement within the next week or so. Once the registration statement is declared effective by the SEC, we will mail the joint proxy statement to our shareholders and unit holders and set unit holder and shareholder meetings to be held on the same day. As of now our best estimate is for the transaction to close in June. I'll now hand the call back to Terry. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Starting with our natural gas liquid segment, 2016 adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased more than 10% compared with 2015 benefiting from new natural gas processing plant connections in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas and increased ethane recovery during the first half of the year.  Severe winter weather continued to impact our system in January however NGL gathered volumes have rebounded in February averaging approximately 780,000 barrels per day this month. This average is more in line with our November 2016 volumes. We've also seen higher NGL product price differential and location differentials which we expect will partially offset early year impacts from weather.  We expect 2017 NGL volumes to be driven by increased drilling activity across our system and the ramp up and full year benefit of the six natural gas processing plants we connected in 2016. We also expect to connect an additional six plants this year including one in the Rocky Mountain region, three in the Mid-Continent, and two in the Permian Basin. These new connections will increase the partnerships total third party plant connections to nearly 200. Producers are planning to move more rigs to the STACK and SCOOP area and the Williston Basin by mid-year and with the ramp up of new processing plants we expect volumes to increase significantly during the back half of 2017.  With respect to ethane we continue to expect ethane recovery levels to fluctuate throughout 2017 but we are also seeing positive signs from petrochemical and export facilities so far this year. At least three world scale petrochemical facilities are slated to begin operations in the second half of 2017 in addition to increased capacity utilization at new export facilities. Additionally a new 36,000 barrel per day Gulf Coast ethane cracker recently began start-up operations. While ethane recovery is an important part of our growth outlook and is expected to provide additional NGL volume growth into 2018 it's important to note that our 2017 financial guidance expects increased recovery of ethane to provide $40 million to $60 million of adjusted EBITDA growth.  Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment, 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 40% compared with 2015 driven by higher average fee rates and continued volume growth in the Williston Basin. Prior to December\u2019s severe weather impacts natural gas volumes processed in the Williston Basin exceeded 780 million cubic feet per day in November. The segments average fee rate increased to $0.84 per MMBTU in the fourth quarter 2016 and $0.76 per MMBTU for the full year. High initial production volumes from customers with fee based contracts contributed to the higher average fee rate in the fourth quarter. We expect an average fee rate of closer to $0.80 in 2017 with fluctuations due to volume and contract mix plus we have hedged a significant portion of the segments remaining 2017 commodity price exposure.  In the Mid-Continent we saw several additional multi-well pad completions through the end of 2016 and into early 2017. Our natural gas volumes processed increased in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter and we saw processed volumes exceed 790 million cubic feet per day periodically during the fourth quarter.  Producers across our natural gas gathering and processing systems have accelerated their drilling activity particularly in the prolific STACK and SCOOP plays where production results continued to improve. We currently have 10 to 12 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the STACK and SCOOP compared with 3 to 4 rigs at the low point in 2016. Recently a number of our gathering and processing customers which account for more than 200,000 acres of dedication have increased their drilling programs which could push rigs on our acreage to a range of 17 to 20 by the end of 2017.  Volumes are expected to increase significantly in the second half of 2017 as producers continue to move additional rigs into the area during the first half of the year. The increased drilling activity in the STACK and SCOOP not only benefits our natural gas gathering and processing segment but also significantly benefits our natural gas liquid segment which is a take away service provider in Oklahoma as is our natural gas pipeline segment. Producers have also accelerated drilling and completion activity in the Williston Basin with expectations for higher 2017 volumes compared with 2016. Producers continue moving rigs back into the core of the basin with approximately 23 to 25 rigs currently on our dedicated acreage. Approximately 300 drilled but uncompleted wells remain on ONEOKs acreage dedications which provide a backlog of volume growth opportunities in 2017 requiring minimal capital while rigs continue to increase throughout the year.  We expect to connect approximately 400 wells in the Williston Basin this year compared to nearly 340 in 2016. The segment remains well positioned to take advantage of growth opportunities requiring minimal capital investments such as well connections and compression projects. The majority of the segments 170 million to 210 million of expected 2017 capital expenditures is dedicated for these types of high return projects. In the natural gas pipeline segment 2016 adjusted EBITDA increased 14% compared with 2015. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee based earnings driven by increased firm contracted capacity and capital growth projects recently placed in service.  In 2017 the segment is expected to benefit from a full year of operations on three natural gas transportation projects placed in service last year including the Road Runner gas transmission pipeline, ONEOKs West Texas pipeline expansion, and the Midwestern Gas Transmission expansion. Combined these three projects added an additional 1 billion cubic feet per day of transportation capacity to ONEOKs natural gas pipelines system. All three projects are fully subscribed under long term firm fee based commitments. The segment continues to expand its operations this year with additional capital growth projects including additional electric generation plant connections and increasing natural gas takeaway capacity out of prolific shale plays such as the STACK and SCOOP. Already this year we've begun construction on a 25 mile pipeline that will provide transportation and storage services to OG&Es Mustang Electric Generation PLANT near Oklahoma City. This project is supported by a long-term fee based agreement with OG&E. We've also started construction on a Westbound expansion of our ONEOK gas transmission pipeline out of the STACK play. This project is also supported by a long-term firm commitment. The initial expansion design which consists of adding compression provides for 100 million cubic feet per day of capacity on the pipeline and a scalable up to 400 million cubic feet per day. Discussions are ongoing with producers which could potentially increase the expansion volume. We expect to complete the Mustang project in the third quarter of this year and complete the westbound expansion in the second quarter of 2018.  In addition we continue our discussions with producers for ONEOK to potentially construct a new natural gas pipeline to revive much needed takeaway services from the STACK and SCOOP plays. If ONEOK is successful in securing the necessary contractual commitments and Board approvals, the proposed 200 mile intrastate pipeline and related compression would run through the middle of the STACK and SCOOP providing essential takeaway of up to 1.4 billion cubic feet per day and connectivity with the existing ONEOK facilities in Central Oklahoma as well as the Bennington market hub in Southeastern Oklahoma. If constructed, the pipeline and related infrastructure would have an anticipated completion date of the third quarter 2018. Our natural gas pipeline segment is well positioned in increasingly active basins such as the Delaware and Midland Basins and the STACK and SCOOP plays to compete for additional takeaway opportunities. Looking ahead to the remainder of 2017 and beyond, we are well positioned for growth opportunities. The continued improvements and producer drilling economics, funding costs and a long runway of future development potential in our basins are resulting in more customers with the increased takeaway capacity. With this line of sight into growth opportunities and improving market fundamentals, we have between 1.5 billion and 2.5 billion of future potential organic growth projects in the development phase. Additionally we have lowered our cost of funding to support these growth opportunities with the recently announced transaction. We are confident in our assets, experienced people, financial flexibility, and discipline and our legacy of providing reliable and quality service to our customers and creating value for our stakeholders even during difficult industry cycles.  Thank you for your continued support of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners and as always thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely, reliably, and in an environmentally responsible manner.  Operator we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. And we'll take our first question with John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Good morning everybody and you know thanks for updating us on what the narrative, just as a follow up Terry could you just walk us through the fourth quarter Permian gather volumes a bit below average for the year and I was just thinking it wasn't -- that wasn't going to be in a weather impact there, so any color of what happened there and then how you think that'll turn up in 2017, you are a little bit beyond the detail you provided in the narrative already? Terry K. Spencer: Sure John I am going to let Sheridan kind of walk you through those components. Sheridan C. Swords: The first thing John we did see a little bit of impact of weather in the Permian but West Texas pipeline which a lot of people think of as just a Permian did see more weather impact through the Barnett Shale and we did see some methane more increased ethane rejection out of -- on the West Texas pipeline in the fourth quarter. And we should continue to see growth in the Permian. As we go in, the Permian has been fairly steady through the year but we are connecting additional plants in the Permian, two additional plants this year will increase our volumes out of the Permian. John Edwards : Okay, that's helpful and then just as far as ramping up to the overall guidance of 800 to 900 that you provided a few weeks back, I think you indicated in your opening comments you're already seeing in February something like 780, so would it be fair to say that you're thinking you'll cross over, I mean when would you expect to across north of 800 and then would it be fair to say because it's the second half situation that you're going to be closer to the 900 range kind of in the third and fourth quarters, is that the right way to think about it? Sheridan C. Swords: I think to think about it definitely would be ramping up in the second half of the year because that's when we said that we'll start seeing the ethane sustainably coming out in the second part of the year as we go forward. But I think as we come into the second quarter as I think we will start seeing this cross the 800, a lot depends on the growth out of the SCOOP and the STACK. We're seeing a lot of great results today and we are seeing some of those, I mentioned some volume growth out of the Permian and then the Williston Basin still comes on strong for us as well. We see that throughout the year. So I think an answer to your question is going to be much more second half with your ethane and these plants continue to ramp up but will probably cross 800 in the second quarter. John Edwards : Okay, that's helpful and just if I could just switch gears on one other area, just I am assuming more of a question for Derek, you're in the cading gets us four times leverage in the next 18 to 24 months or so and our assumption has been such it's primarily an EBITDA growth story in that regard not really dependent so much on equity issuance. So, if you could just sort of clarify for us how you think you're getting there that would really be helpful? Derek S. Reiners: Sure John, this is Derek and you are exactly right. I think we don't need to issue equity in order to get the leverage metrics down into that target range of four times. Now certainly we could depending on additional capital projects. If we have some large capital projects we could issue some equity there but really don't have the need to do so in that 18 to 24 months as we're thinking about it today. John Edwards : Okay, that's helpful and just last one, just in the deck you provided to us Terry there was the optimization, marketing price differential, you indicated there were some squeezing going on there, how should we be thinking about that going forward? Terry K. Spencer: John, definitely in the fourth quarter the spreads were narrower than we've seen in the third quarter and also the structure of the market that we get a lot of our marketing activity was narrower than we've seen. But as we move into the first quarter we've already seen the spreads between come and go it would be a lot wider than in previous years. We're seeing propane at $0.08 to $0.10 and butane at $0.12 in February and a little bit narrowing in March but still very strong. So I think that we will have a very good optimization in the first quarter. John Edwards : Okay, that's it for me. Thank you so much for the clarifications. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you, John. Operator : Moving right along, we\u2019ll take our next question from Kristina Kazarian with Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead. Kristina Kazarian : Afternoon guys, so just a quick follow up for clarification on John's point, so that 17 millionish that you guys refer you on page eight in the slide deck, did I just get that right that you said that that's already worked itself out and probably won't be a go forward impact that we should be thinking about? Terry K. Spencer: The 17 million is compared to the third quarter and most of that is in the marketing book. We had a very good third quarter in the marketing but we're definitely seeing wider spreads today than we saw in December as we continue to go through that. So we'll definitely have -- should be better off in the first quarter maybe different within the fourth quarter. Kristina Kazarian : Perfect, so a bigger picture question you know, there's been a theme of we\u2019re starting new projects and I know you guys had some delayed projects and you also talked about that 1.4 bcf type of takeaway capacity out of SCOOP and STACK, can you just remind me how much a pipe like that would cost, what you know catalyst to watch for on it moving forward in other new projects that you might think about coming back into the queue? Terry K. Spencer: Sure Kristina I\u2019ll let Phil to take that question. J. Phillip May : Sure Kristine, the pipeline that we're trying to develop out of the SCOOP and STACK is 200-210 miles of 36 inch pipe with compression and depending on what kind of capacity sales that we are able to garner in the discussions it can be between $750 million and $900 million Kristina Kazarian : And then other projects that you guys might think about moving back into the queue maybe some of the ones that had been delayed before the cycle turn down or anything else on your radar there? Terry K. Spencer: Yes Kristina I think that you're thinking about it right. As we think about this 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion of projects under development there's a pretty good portion of it in our gathering and processing segment where we're adding additional capacity more around the SCOOP play and then certainly along the lines of the types of projects that Phil\u2019s talking about specifically in the pipeline segment. But also opportunities in the Permian NGL related infrastructure, NGL storage, those types of things when you think about how it's broken up at a $2.5 billion level you're roughly talking about a third, a third, and a third, that is a third G&P, the third pipes and third liquids. And so generally that's how you think about -- that's what the that's what the projects look like that are currently under development. Kristina Kazarian : That\u2019s really helpful and last one from me, can you -- I know you guys get this a lot, but can you just remind me of your thoughts especially post the transaction we announced earlier this year of appetite for strategic M&A and how you might think about using the currency? Terry K. Spencer: Sure, certainly we have an appetite for M&A we've got an appetite for asset acquisitions as well and in the things that the transaction certainly provides a benefit to our currency. And we are continually thinking about strategic M&A and what assets that we don't have that would certainly make sense. So, the challenge remains finding something that's actionable and if you do find something actionable trying to find something where the bid has spreads not so wide. So those challenges remain but certainly as a result of this transaction we\u2019re very interested in acquisition opportunities. Kristina Kazarian : Perfect, thanks guys for the update. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you. Operator : Thank You. Our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Please go ahead. Eric Genco : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to follow up on the last question, you think about the guidance numbers, it looks like you're more than buying on fractionation capacity for 2017 and maybe into 2018 but if we were to look out a little bit and think about some of the higher end of guidance and how some of that could go, I mean how soon do you think you might need some new fractionation capacity, do you think about top end being 6.35, 1.40 for ethane, you get the 7.75 and you talked in the past about 100,000 barrels incremental from SCOOP STACK like how soon could that occur and how long it will be time to get some of those things in? Terry K. Spencer: Well it usually probably take us about two years to get a frac for that standpoint and I think we won't need additional frac capacity until we get into 2019. Some of the people we've talked about out of the SCOOP or the STACK we are talking about dish transporting their barrels maybe not doing a complete frac, complete bundle service. So you kind of play that into as well but I think it will be 2019 before we would really think we need to look at additional frac capacity. Eric Genco : And how about on the processing side? Kevin L. Burdick: Eric on the processing side, again a lot of it will depend on the ramp that we see. As Terry mentioned we have seen pretty significant uptick in rigs in the STACK. That area, those wells are much higher volume than we see in the Balkan. If that type of activity continues we're going to need some additional capacity probably in the next couple years. So because we will eat up our available capacity pretty quickly. As we think about the Williston we got a couple hundred million a day of capacity available there. We also have the opportunity for some low cost expansions so you're probably looking at maybe three to four years before we would get in with current type pricing environment where you would fill up our capacity and may need additional processing. Eric Genco : Okay, and then last one real quick you mentioned the higher rates being somewhat in the G&P somewhat due to some higher IP wells coming on but I was just curious you could expand a little I mean, believe there was a contract settlement one of the customers in the Balkan and I was also curious to see if there was any sort of movement on perhaps the Mid-Con and getting any momentum there and maybe getting a little more money there? Kevin L. Burdick: Eric, this is Kevin again. That rate did spike a little bit in the fourth quarter. We did reach agreement on a restructured contract that was relatively sizable that drove that up a little bit. But we also had a significant amount of IP Gas come on in the fourth quarter which kind of drove -- which did drove up -- drive up our volumes and the vast majority of that gas was on contracts that were -- had a much higher fee based component. So quarter-to-quarter we think that rate will settle in more than $0.80 range as other volume comes on and just the volume mix on the contracts moves around a little bit. Now that is completely separate from the $8 million contract settlement was a service contract that is unrelated to our producer, our customer contracts. Eric Genco : Okay, alright well thanks a lot and congrats on your promotion. Terry K. Spencer: Everybody I want to just make a just a quick correction, I guess I got tongue tied in one of my numbers when I was talking about Mid-Continent. Natural gas volumes I said 790 million cubic feet per day periodically and what I meant to say was 690 million cubic feet per day so perhaps that was a wishful thinking on my part but anyway my apologies. So hopefully that clarifies it and we will make sure the transcript appropriately reflects the corrected number. Thank you. Now back to questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Sir, please go ahead. Michael Blum : Hi, thanks. Can you provide update on where you stand on the West Texas LPG line and then just how that sort of interplays with, sounds like you're connecting some additional plants in the Permian and do you have enough takeaway capacity and it just kind of you know update in terms of your thoughts on NGL takeaway capacity and just any update on West Texas LPG? Sheridan C. Swords: Sure. Michael, this is Sheridan. The West Texas rate case we will be in front -- we have a hearing in front of an administrative law judge at the end of March and then after that it will go through its normal course to come to a resolution on that. In terms of how that impacts the new plants we are connecting, we are able to contract these new plants at market rates not at the lower rates due to the -- that is what the market is out there. So as we increase the volume out there we'll get it at a higher rate. The capacity that we have is we're talking to many different plants out there and some much further than others and we think that through those discussions there is a distinct possibility of an expansion coming on the West Texas pipeline out of the Permian Basin as that continues to grow. So that will be depending on how successful we are with contracting some of these new plants that will be up in the next year to 18 months. Michael Blum : Okay and that expansion would that be at the other end like timing or is that just pumps and cost and I'm just trying to get a feel for what that would entail? Sheridan C. Swords: Well, definitely it will be cheaper than laying a new line but it will be in some pumps and some little bit of looping up some of the line and there probably be some additional gathering infrastructure out to the Permian. Michael Blum : Okay, great. And then the other question Terry I think I heard you say earlier that in the 2017 guidance assumes $40 million to $60 million EBITDA uplift from ethane recovery, did I hear that right? Terry K. Spencer: That's correct. Michael Blum : Okay so, I feel it was about a year ago you guys are talking about the potential for $200 million EBITDA uplift from ethane recovery. When do you think that could occur? Terry K. Spencer: Well, certainly that happens over time and that $200 million EBITDA impact that is still a good number. The timing is 2017, 2018, and 2019 impact. So the cumulative effect of all the incremental ethane coming on would have an impact of $200 million. So that's all still -- that is all still -- well still works. So that's the timing bit. 2018 is a big year for the petrochemical facilities starting up with as we said earlier in the call we've got three large crackers coming on that are going to crack anywhere from 80,000 to 100,000 barrels a day a piece of ethane. So of course that's pretty big and a million barrels a day ethane market and then we have been significantly more crackers starting up in the 2018 timeframe. So we expect significant uplift in this business as we think forward in this NGL segment. The uplift from ethane continues to be a big part of our story in addition to all the raw feed growth that's happening in the STACK and the SCOOP and in the Permian. Michael Blum : Great, thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We\u2019ll take our next question from Christopher Sighinolfi. Please go ahead with Jefferies. Christopher Sighinolfi : Hey Terry, thanks for taking my question Terry K. Spencer: You bet Chris, how are you? Christopher Sighinolfi : I am well, thanks. I just want to follow real quickly maybe on where Michael left off so just to understand so 40 to 50 is what's in the guidance for this year. Sheridan I think was mentioning you're still anticipating that to be mostly back half loaded. And so I guess I'm just wondering do you still see sort of the regional profile that you've outlined before where we should expect sort of all Permian to be recovered and then we move to Mid-Con for the next sort of tranche of recovery? Terry K. Spencer: Yes Chris, that is right. The Permian will come first and then we'll go into the Mid-Continent but I will say that the rates out of the Mid-Continent aren\u2019t very far behind the Permian. They're very close to each other so they could -- you could see a little bit come out Mid-Continent first depending on which power contracts are structured. But that's basically on a high level, that's what we see happening. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay and then there was a question earlier about frac capacity within ONEOK franchise and we've obviously seen some frac announcements now first time in a while. And I know that some others at Bellevue remained permanent. You had mentioned Sheridan potential for you to transport volumes on behalf of potentially what others might frac. Can you just talk to us a little bit about that dynamic and I how you think it might take shape, you know vis-\u00e0-vis the producer schedules and then also you know this recovery dynamic? Terry K. Spencer: Well in terms of just transporting out of the SCOOP and the STACK we have some customers out of the SCOOP and the STACK that have frac capacity and they wanted to fill their frac capacity first. And so that's why we were working with them to just do a transport only type of deal. In terms of our frac capacity I would like to see what comes out of the SCOOP and the STACK, there's an opportunity to fill the existing capacity we have today and obviously ethane is going to flow that capacity as well. But we are very excited that we think as we go forward and look into 2019 and beyond that there is opportunities as the Permian grows, as the SCOOP and STACK grows that we may have a frac coming on but all is going to depend on commitments from the producers and processors I'm going forward. Sheridan C. Swords: So, just the only thing I would add to that Chris is that from an ethane perspective we have the capacity necessary to reap this $200 million impact, EBITDA impact from incremental ethane. So that capacity, our deethinizers are underutilized right now as a result of the ethane rejection. So there's no capacity that has any meaningful size and needs to be built to accommodate that. What Sheridan's primarily talked about is the raw feed or C3 plus capacity that needs to be constructed to accommodate this organic growth not just out of the STACK and the SCOOP but certainly out of the Permian. We expect to be a fractionation service provider for customers in the Permian even though currently many of our customers frac in other locations. As we bring on the incremental development that's happening in the Permian we expect to be providing the full menu of services these customers are gathering fractionation and certainly storage as well. Terry K. Spencer: Other thing I would add to that is that we as well also have fracs permitted in Mount Bellevue so when we get the commitments we will be able to start building fracs. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay, I was more curious like somebody was signing up for new frac capacity I guess chances are that's under a fairly lengthy commitment so I was just wondering if then somebody is looking to take pipe capacity on your system to sort of provide the volume that would subsequently be frac if you would get sort of an equal duration contract or how that might work and I know you've had sort of a sterling three expansion opportunity out there for a while like at what point you might maybe see that fall back into reality kind of to Kristina's earlier question? Terry K. Spencer: I think really as we talk about people that we may be transporting out of the SCOOP and the STACK they\u2019re predominantly be going into their own fracs that they own. They would be doing it but and so we negotiate on those transportation deals independently if they're going to take it to a third party frac, we negotiate those independently. So we'll go after the link that term that we think is appropriate for our business here regardless of what they get on the frac side. Some people have done shorter term frac deal, some people have done longer term frac deals, and some of the other volume that we transport only. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay and then if I could really quickly Sheridan just to clarify something you had said earlier in response to question so if I think about the profile of where you are anticipating C2 volumes to be recovered, you kind of have this profile of cost structure if you will. And what you were saying that if I heard you correctly some regions within the Mid-Con are competitive relative to the Permian. We would see that rate sort of -- that volume hit first and then we profiled sort of in a rising cost water flow, is that the right way to think about it and then where would -- I guess where does the -- you've noted a bundle fee on the Permian of like less than $0.03. I mean that's kind of like the ballpark you're talking about then in terms of the lowest cost areas of the Mid-Con? Sheridan C. Swords: No, the $0.03 that we have talked about is an overall fee on the West Texas pipeline at the lower rates that we are at today. The most of the other pipelines are at a much higher rate and that higher rate is where we see is comparable to the Mid-Continent. So if you just look at what we've provided we've provided $0.08 a gallon on an average fee out of the Mid-Continent. And so that we feel that fee is competitive with some of the fees that are out of some of the new plants that are out of the Permian that are on the newer pipelines which are at a higher rate than our normal pipelines. Christopher Sighinolfi : So Sheridan the rates, the $0.03 and $0.09 that you're referring to are transportation only, they do not include fractionation correct? Sheridan C. Swords: The $0.03 yes, it\u2019s definitely transportation only it is an average fee for the whole West Texas pipeline. That takes in Permian, Barnett Shale, East Texas, short haul volumes. So it is an average across that whole thing. Obviously Permian is going to be on the higher state even on our system. $0.08 out in the Mid-Continent is an average fee that has both transportation and transportation in frac. But could also go to [Indiscernible] different places but we see -- as you talked about certain contracts in the Mid-Continent we know are competitive with some of the new plant out of the Permian. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay, that's very helpful. Thanks for the clarification. Terry K. Spencer: You bet. Thank you Chris. Operator : And it appears there are no further questions at this time. I\u2019d now like to turn the conference back over to our presenters for any additional or closing remarks. Terry K. Spencer: Thank you our quite period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extend till earnings are released after the market closes on early May. Thank you for joining us. Operator : That does conclude today's presentation. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time I'd like to turn the conference over to today's host Mr. T.D. Eureste. Please go ahead, sir. T.D. Eureste: Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK and ONEOK Partners First Quarter Earnings Conference Call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK or ONEOK Partners' expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provisions of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Terry Spencer : Thank you, T.D. Good morning and many thanks for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK and ONEOK Partners. Along this conference call today is Walt Hulse, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; Derek Reiners, Chief Financial Officer; Kevin Burdick, Chief Commercial Officer and Senior Vice President of Wes Christensen Operations. Before I hand over the call to Derek, I have a few brief opening remarks. Our first quarter 2017 financial results have a soft to a solid start for the year. As expected, we have seen volume growth across our business segments as we begin the second quarter. I would like to reiterate that ONEOK's 2017 guidance expectations have not changed. We continue to expect volumes to be weighted towards the second half of the year in both the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the natural gas liquid segment, we expect increases in NGLs gathered and fractionated as a result of anticipated increases in ethane exports and the startup of new world scale petrochemical facilities, as well as benefits from the ramp-up of recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased drilling activity. The increase in producer rig activity across our natural gas gathering and processing footprint also supports the second half of the year of natural gas gathered and processed volume ramp. We're excited about the pending merger transaction with ONEOK Partners, which better positions us to continue to execute on our long runway of organic growth opportunities. These growth opportunities are driven by our extensive and integrated asset footprint, well position in several active shale place providing our customers with full service capabilities in many areas. I'll now turn the call over to Derek for a brief discussion of ONEOK and ONEOK Partners' financials. Derek? Derek Reiners : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK maintained a healthy nearly 1.3x dividend coverage in the first quarter of 2017 based on cash flow available for dividends and had more than $300 million in cash and an undrawn $300 million credit facility. In our 2017 financial guidance announcement on February 1, we provided guidance for ONEOK's full year of 2017 distributable cash flow on a post transaction basis. ONEOK's first quarter 2017 distributable cash flow, the metric we plan to use following the transaction totaled nearly $325 million with a dividend coverage ratio of 1.46x, reflecting our excess coverage on a consolidated basis. ONEOK's higher dividend coverage over the long term is expected to provide greater flexibility, enabling us to reinvest in the business, reduce the need to access the capital market's post transaction and sustain a level of dividend growth as market conditions fluctuate. As Terry mentioned, ONEOK's 2017 guidance has not changed and includes an expected 21% dividend increase to $0.745 or $2.98 per share on an annualized basis for the first quarterly dividend following the completion of the transaction, with subsequent dividend growth of 9% to 11% annually through 2021. Additionally, we expect to reduce consolidated debt to adjusted EBITDA to around our target of 4x by late 2018 or early 2019, driven by expected growth in adjusted EBITDA and the use of excess cash on hand to repay debt or fund capital growth projects. The partnership's higher first quarter results reflected increased fee-based services across our footprint which drove higher first quarter adjusted EBITDA in all three business segments compared to the same period last year. ONEOK Partners' distribution coverage ratio was 1.10x for the first quarter of 2017. I'd like to note that we took January's severe weather effect on volumes, primarily in the Williston basin into account when setting 2017 financial expectations. The total impact of which was approximately $8 million in our gathering and processing in NGL segments. Terry will provide more details on the recovery of our volumes as well. The process towards closing the merger transaction continues to go smoothly and we expect to close the transaction late in the second quarter, early in the third quarter. We filed our amended Form S-4 with the SEC on April 21 and are working through the SEC review process. Once the SEC declares our Form S-4 effective, both companies will mail the joint proxy statement to shareholders and unit holders for special meetings of ONEOK shareholders and ONEOK Partners unit holders to vote on the transaction. We will communicate the timing of the meetings accordingly. Last month we executed a new $2.5 billion five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility to replace the existing ONEOK and ONEOK Partners credit facilities. The new facility will be available upon the closing of the merger transaction and the termination of the existing credit facilities. Finally, first quarter results include approximately $7 million in costs associated with the proposed merger transaction including approximately $1.1 million in cost at the partnership. I'll now hand the call back over to Terry. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Derek. Let's take a closer look at each of our business segments. Starting with our natural gas liquid segment, first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 3% year-over-year and 10% compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Results benefited from increased optimization marketing from wider NGL location priced differentials, increased volumes from recently connected natural gas processing plants and increased ethane recovery. Since the first quarter, we've seen the Conway to Mount Belleveu NGL pricing differentials narrowed slightly. However, we still anticipate a modest optimization benefit in the second quarter and expect the price differentials for the remainder of the year to be close to $0.03 per gallon for ethane. We continue seeing the volume benefit from the six third party natural gas processing plants, connected to our system in 2016 and as expected, we connected three additional third party plants to our system in the first quarter 2017, one each in the Permian basin, Mid-Continent and rocky mountain regions. We also remain on track to connect three additional plants this year, including two plants in the Mid-Continent and one in the Permian basin. The total combined NGL production of these six new plants is expected to ramp up to approximately 30,000 barrels per day by the end of 2017, an increase to approximately 40,000 barrels per day in 2018. Our new NGL plant connections in 2016 and 2017 combined with increased drilling activity across our footprint due to lower breakeven costs and improved well productivity are expected to drive NGL volume growth from the SCOOP and STACK areas, the Permian basin and [indiscernible] NGL pipeline through the remainder of 2017. Ethane rejection levels on our NGL system decreased to an average of more than 150,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2017, compared with an average of more than 175,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2016 and an average of more than 175,000 per day in the fourth quarter 2016. We continue to expect ethane throughput to increase in the second half of the year as demand increases from three new petrochemical plants coming online the remainder of 2017 and capacity utilization increases at existing ethane export facilities. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment, first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2016 primarily driven by higher fee-based revenues from restructured contracts. The segment's average fee rate was $0.83 per MMBTU in the first quarter 2017, compared with $0.68 per MMBTU in the first quarter of 2016, a more than 20% increase. We expect the segment's average fee rate to be in the range of $0.80 to $0.85 for 2017. Severe winter weather in January impacted first quarter volumes processed, primarily in the Williston basin. Volumes have since recovered with natural gas volumes processed in the Williston basin averaging more than 800 million cubic feet per day in April, which is above our November 2016 average of approximately 780 million cubic feet per day and a new monthly average high for ONEOK in the basin. Producer activity levels continue to increase as there are approximately 30 drilling rigs currently operating on ONEOK's dedicated acreage in the basin, up from 20 rigs at the beginning of 2017. Recent reports show there are nearly 50 total drilling rigs operating in the Williston basin, which means more than 60% of the rigs operating in the basin are on our dedicated acreage. We connected 75 wells during the first quarter and we estimate there are still approximately 300 drilled but uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage in the basin. We currently have approximately 175 million cubic feet per day of available capacity, compared with the 200 million cubic feet per day we indicated previously. It's a similar story in the STACK and SCOOP areas with producers' increasing activity and moving additional drilling rigs onto our acreage. We have approximately 12 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the Mid-Continent and expect this number to increase through the remainder of the year as well production results have continued to improve for our producer customers. In the natural gas pipeline segment, first quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 12%, compared with the same period in 2016. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings driven by increased firm contracted capacity and capital growth projects recently placed into service. In the first quarter 2017, the segment saw the benefit from operations of the ONEOK West Texas pipeline expansion and the roadrunner gas transmission pipeline including the full revenue from Phase 2 of the roadrunner pipeline which was placed in service in October 2016. These projects provide additional fee-based earnings and expand the partnership's connectivity of producers in the Permian basin within used markets. The segment continues to expand its operations this year with additional fee-based capital growth projects including the 100 million cubic feet per day, west bound expansion of the ONEOK gas transmission pipeline out of the STACK and the 55 million cubic feet per day pipeline which will provide transportation storage services to an electric generation plant near Oklahoma City. Both projects are currently under construction with the electric plant connection project expected to be complete in the third quarter of 2017 and the OGT expansion to be complete in the second quarter 2018. We are actively engaged in discussions with producers for long term natural gas takeaway solutions in the Permian basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. In the Permian basin, these projects could include an expansion of our roadrunner pipeline to provide more natural gas supply to Mexico or an expansion or extension of our ONEOK West Texas pipeline system. In the STACK and SCOOP place, we believed there will be a number of additional opportunities to expand our ONEOK gas transmission pipeline system to move more natural gas to on system markets, as well as provide natural gas takeaway options out of the play. Now, more than four months into 2017, our visibility for the remainder of the year continues to improve. We reaffirmed our financial guidance and continued to gain confidence in the producer and end user market activity across our footprint as drilling rig counts continue to increase in the basins we serve and ethane demand increases. We're excited about the remainder of the year and [indiscernible] ahead for ONEOK as we approach the anticipated completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partner's merger transaction. We have a long runway of potential growth opportunities with $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion of growth projects under development. We are focused on executing our long-term strategy and operating as one of the country's leading midstream energy companies. Thank you to our employees for their continued hard work and dedication and thank you to our investors for your continued support. Before we take questions, I have one additional announcement and thank you that I'd like to extend. Yesterday, ONEOK board member Kevin McCarthy tendered his resignation from the Board of Directors. Due to increasing responsibilities related to his position as Chairman of the Board of Kayne Anderson acquisition corp which recently completed its initial public offering, Kevin has elected to remove himself from the ONEOK Board of Directors effective immediately. Kevin has been a valued board member and key contributor to our company since joining the board in December of 2015. His deep experience in the energy industry and knowledge of the financial markets will be deeply missed. We thank him for his many contributions, the experience, wisdom and most importantly, his friendship. We wish Kevin well in his future endeavors. Operator, we're now ready to take questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We will take our first question today from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead. Shneur Gershuni : Hi. Terry, I wanted to start off with - it's almost like a two-part question - but I was wondering if you can talk about how much spare capacity you have across the company broadly to handle growth? Or one way to measure it maybe is how much EBITDA growth can you have or can you experience without spending any incremental capital? The reason I ask this question is when I sort of look at proposed CapEx for '17 and '18 and kind of compare it to your market cap and enterprise value, it seems on the low side. So I just wanted to know if we're approaching max fairly soon as to where the EBITDA growth can be or is there a lot of spare capacity out there alternatively? Are there projects that you're reviewing with the board and we can actually see that number go up? I'm just wondering if you can comment on that broadly. Terry Spencer : Sure. I'll actually let Kevin take that capacity part of the question. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Shneur, we still see the available capacity. Terry referenced 175 million a day we have in the Williston for processing. We're probably in the 75 million a day range in the Mid-Continent from a processing G&P standpoint. On the liquid side, we're still in that 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of capacity on the NGL system that we had to grow into and then we've talked quite a bit about there are some expansions we can do for tremendous amount of incremental capital to get us up to maybe 100,000 barrels a day of incremental capacity along the NGL side. Terry Spencer : Shneur, the only thing I'd add to Kevin's comment is that when we think about what that operating leverage provides to us from an EBITDA perspective, I think we've said publicly in the past the 20% to 30% potential impact to EBITDA, assuming it kind of normalized $50 a barrel type pricing environment. That just gives you a sense of the earnings potential if we're able to take advantage of this excess capacity which we fully expect to do. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then as a follow-up question. I'm not sure if you saw the Enable announcement earlier today, but as I sort of look at what they announced, it seems like they're basically moving unprocessed volumes out of the basin as a synthetic takeaway solution. When I think about the broader impact, I'm not processing it in the basin, I'm processing it outside of the basin and it's seems like basically taking away an NGL, take away opportunity for ONEOK. I'm trying to understand, is that an opportunity loss and if somebody else is moving it, or is it an opportunity cost? Could we see as a connect that some of their volumes that might have been going on your system move further down into Texas and so forth? I'm wondering if you could have some early thoughts on that announcement? Terry Spencer : First comment I'll make is that I think that what the announcement were, yes, we're aware of it. I think what the shows you or provides you is an indication of the strength in display and how much activity there is. I think in terms of potential impact to ONEOK, we don't see any - at least given what we know of the project today. We don't see any impact to our existing business. Enable has, just like they always had, they had a very strong position across Western Oklahoma with their gathering and processing business. Well, I don't see this change in the competitive landscape. They were either going to build that process in capacity on location, or they were going to seek a third party to process it for them and that's what they've done. So I don't think that announcement in it of itself, the access to additional capacity doesn't surprise us at all and broadly speaking, doesn't change really the competitive landscape which has always been competitive in the Mid-Continent. Shneur Gershuni : So your forecast didn't contemplate where they built the processing plan? Because if they build it on site, then you would have had an opportunity to move those NGLs and now that it's off site. If so, it has really either an opportunity loss, it's certainly not a cost. Right? There's no negative impact? Terry Spencer : That's right. It's not a cost. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. Terry Spencer : I'll ask Sheridan Swords. Do you have anything to add? Sheridan Swords : Yes. The plants that are on the ground for Enable are dedicated to us for a long period of time. And we see them filling those plants and coming to us. So we see this more as an opportunity loss that's in liquids that we could have got, have moved out the basin. But I would say as we're talking to many other people right now that have a lot of liquids that will be coming to us in the future. Shneur Gershuni : Perfect. Terry Spencer : Shneur, the only other comment I'll make is that obviously if that's a path for NGLs to make it down to the Barnett Shale and if that's some indication that Barnett Shale plants are going to be increasing their NGL production, obviously, we're in the Barnett Shale today and certainly as if NGLs materialize in the Barnett as a result of this project or any other projects, we stand there ready, willing and able to compete for that business. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. That makes sense. I just wanted to make sure it wasn't a negative. It's a neutral, it's how it looks. Okay, perfect. Terry Spencer : That's how it look to us. It's not surprising. Enable needed to do something, needed to come up with some capacity to serve their specific customers just like we have to serve our dedicated customers. Shneur Gershuni : Perfect. Great. Thank you very much, guys. I really appreciate the color and detail. Unidentified Executive : You bet. Thank you. Operator : And we'll now go to Christine Cho with Barclays. Please go ahead. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone. I wanted to actually maybe start on in the Bakken. The volumes on your Bakken NGL line are approaching capacity, yet your expansion on the pipe isn't scheduled until third quarter next year. Can you run above name plate? And if so, by how much? Why wouldn't you accelerate the expansion to be sooner? Do you not think it's necessary? And would this also require more expansion on pipe somewhere downstream like [indiscernible] or Sterling, beyond Sterling III. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Christine. This is Kevin. The quick answer is yes, we do believe in many cases as we've build assets, they can perform better than designed and we believe the Bakken pipeline is no different. We have been able to operate the pipeline above the name plate. We potentially could get to the 145-150 range, we believe, operating safely. We got some head room that we have, we continue to evaluate the producer activity coming out of the Williston and are accordingly looking at a variety of different options for the expansion and potentially even larger than has been than we've talked about previously as we can get additional commitments from the producer community up in the Williston. Christine Cho : Okay. That answers it. Thank you. And then in the Permian, we've seen some of your peers announce a new Permian NGL pipe, while an existing one continues to expand capacity. And it seems like they're both being underpinned by the utilization of either their own processing plants and/or existing relationships with certain producers. We've seen some turnover in the acreage private equity [indiscernible] some of the processing assets and for one, the buyer was a customer on your West Texas line, is the NGL takeaway for those newly acquired assets committed to somebody else already, or is that an opportunity for you? And if you could talk some about the dynamics about what's going on in the Permian and whether or not being involved in processing here is the competitive disadvantage with respect to your NGL pipe? Terry Spencer : Christine, I'll make a comment and then I can let Kevin and Sheridan chime in. But from that strategic question with respect to owning, gathering and processing assets - certainly if a gathering processor also owns a liquids pipeline in those particular scenarios, you're going to have some challenges in competing for those particular barrels unless those producer customers have specific taking kind rights and they have targeted a particular NGL pipeline to do business with. But overall, there is a large body of third party - at least as far as ONEOK is concerned, to see third party NGLs out there is pretty deep. So regardless of who owns or operates the G&P business, we've got a pretty big playing field in terms of opportunity and competing for barrel. So really don't feel like we're disadvantaged. You can be in certain specific situations, certainly yes, it can create challenges for you. But broadly speaking, we don't feel like we need to own G&P assets in order to be a more effective NGL service provider. No, we don't have that view. Christine Cho : Okay. Terry Spencer : Hang on just a second, Christine. Do you guys have anything to add to that? Okay. I thought with respect to the private equity, Christine, didn't you have a question on the private equity barrels and whether that would create opportunity? Private equity processing plants are an opportunity. Christine Cho : Because one of them sold to a customer on your West Texas system and I was just curious, was that an opportunity for you? Terry Spencer : Do you guys want to make a comment? Kevin Burdick : I think we're always looking at the opportunities out there. But again, I'd go back that specific opportunity. We don't necessarily feel that not having the G&P puts us in that competitive disadvantage in that circumstance. We're in a lot of very positive conversations with producers out there that were extremely competitive. So we feel good about that. Terry Spencer : And Christine, the only other comment I'd make is that candidly, a number of these NGL producers or processors in this basin tend to take a look at a portfolio approach, too, in terms of the NGL service provider. So they're continually thinking about that mix and putting all their eggs in a particular basket. That dynamics out there, too, and from time to time, that could work to our advantage. Christine Cho : Okay, great. And then lastly, just a housekeeping item. In the G&P segment, your NGL sales went up to over 170,000 barrels per day after being flat at about 155 all of last year. Despite gas gathered and process volumes being flat from fourth quarter and generally down from first to third quarter last year. Similarly, we saw the equity condensate volumes spike up during the Q2 despite your conversion of POP contracts to [indiscernible]; so I was just curious, what's driving this? Kevin Burdick : Two different things, Christine. This is Kevin. On your first question on the NGL sales, that was almost entirely driven by increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. That's what drove your NGL sales up. The condensate question with the abnormally cold winter, we saw additional condensate fall out in the gathering lines, so you would see the condensate go up a little bit and what you didn't then see, you'd see a corresponding NGL drop a little bit from an equity standpoint, is that condensate didn't make it to the plant. Christine Cho : Okay, got it. Kevin Burdick : It's pretty tactical stuff. Christine Cho : Okay. Thank you so much. Operator : Next is Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Hi. Good morning. My first one has already been answered a little bit. But to the 25,000 barrels a day of methane increased acceptance, what that all Mid-Continent? Kevin Burdick : The vast majority of that was from the Mid-Continent. Eric Genco : Okay. And then to jog my memory, if I think about the $200 million of ethane uplift that you guys have talked to in the past and $100 million of incremental NGL benefit from the STACK SCOOP, I'm curious, if you were to break that $100 million of STACK SCOOP benefit down between ethane and C3 plus, how much of it is a C3 plus? Terry Spencer : Probably 55% or so. Eric Genco : 55%? Okay. So there is some sort of ethane there. I guess the follow-up. If we think about sort of how things are shifting around and I think when we originally gave a $200 million marker for ethane, we were referencing what rejection was on the system at the time and there was that pretty significant amount of Bakken ethane rejection. If you were to be in a situation where Bakken ethane from an economic standpoint wasn't really called on, can you still get to the $200 million without cannibalizing say some of the ethane from SCOOP STACK or something like that? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Eric, this is Kevin. I think what we've provided is there's about $170 million out of the $200 million that's from the Mid-Continent area. So that incremental just would be what you would have left from the Bakken. Eric Genco : Okay. All right, thank you. Operator : And Ted [ph] with Goldman Sachs is next. Unidentified Analyst : Thanks. You've talked about this 1.4 bcf at a project out of the Mid-Continent, but clearly there are some competitors that are trying the same thing. I'm just wondering if you can give us an update on that project, please? Kevin Burdick : Yes, Ted. This is Kevin. We continue to work with our producers and other customers and processors in the play to look for takeaway options. Those are going well. There are maybe specific things we're look out of the SCOOP and some talking to some customers that may want to go west with their gas. So we just continue to work to try to gain the commitments necessary to announce something that would be another takeaway solution out of the STACK. Again, going well. Just as we get those commitments, then we'll make the announcements. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then I'm not sure how much you can talk about this, but you've got protections on your S-4 where you show your EBITDA through 2021 or so, you're up to about $2.7 billion in the expected case. I'm wondering if you can just help us on some of the key assumptions you used to get to those projections. We know the commodity price assumptions, but are there other things around whether it's volume growth, or ethane rejection, or different capitally deployed to get to those projections? Kevin Burdick : Ted, let me just make a couple of comments. As far as the S-4 projections go, one thing I just want to make clear is that those assumptions that we made were assumptions that were made at that particular point in time. So what we don't want to do and we're going to talk about it, but what we don't want to do is get into a position where this becomes sort of guidance. The S-4 is out there, it's public information, it's based upon the best data and our point of view at the time. Our point of view continues to be generally in-line with what you see in the S-4. Good, solid fundamentals, good organic growth opportunities in the STACK and SCOOP. The ethane story all of those things enroll into that story. What I don\u2019t want to do is get in a habit here of having to address the S-4 just on a continual, on a continual basis then it kind of sort of becomes a by default a five year guidance. So I appreciate your question and I\u2019m being responsive to it. It again let me say it, in capital-ex all the elements we\u2019ve been talking about here does not require any sort of major project outside an organic, kind of a routine organic run rate of growth. Does that make sense? Unidentified Analyst : Yes, well it\u2019s in part because your organic cap-ex spend has been down a bit in the last couple of years if you pull back on projects. So you are telling us there isn\u2019t a lot of I don\u2019t know new processing plants or a big gas pipeline takeaway out of mid compensate those numbers? Derek Reiners : Exactly, you don\u2019t have any, I call that a major strategic organic project. You really don\u2019t have in there. I would put it more in the category of routine growth. Okay. You\u2019re going to have some processing capacity, you\u2019re going to have system expansions, you\u2019re going to have plant connections on the NGL side, you may have some frac capacity increases, you\u2019re going to have some storage projects in there but nothing that I will consider like a major geographic expansion project. So I know we said publicly in the past about the capital spend in the five year view it\u2019s been very consistent with. It would be consistent with what you\u2019ve seen in recent history like what we\u2019ve seen in 2016 and what we\u2019re budgeting here for 2017. From a CapEx standpoint what would be the consistent run rate through that five year, that five year. Unidentified Analyst : Understood, that\u2019s actually very helpful. So I\u2019ll leave it at that. Thank you. Derek Reiners : Okay. Great, thanks. Operator : We\u2019ll now go to Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : Good morning and thank you. Most of my questions have been hit, but I wanted to follow-up on Eric's question around ethane. So I estimate roughly 300,000 -- today have demand ethylene cracking plant still coming online through the balance of the year. As that sort of progresses through the course of the years, where do you guys automatically see that the recovery is falling between be 35,000 to 55,000 barrels per day rejection they have projected for this year? Danilo Juvane : Sheridan, yes. Sheridan Swords : I think what we say is we say ethane rejection as we said ramping up during the second half of the year as that volume comes on as or that demand comes on. A lot of that demand, specifically the CBC cracker and the Exxon Mobil cracker going to come up in the fourth quarter. So we're going to see ramp up through the second half of this year then when we get into 18 I think you'll see more sustained recovery across most of the mid-continent and in Permian and there is to be able to meet all this new demand coming on. Did that answer your question? Danilo Juvane : It does. I guess maybe if I can ask that question differently. Do you see perhaps you following at the high end of that range or how should we think about that? Derek Reiners : That\u2019s going to be interesting. I think it\u2019s going to be very volatile as we get through this year and don\u2019t forget about the exports coming out of the Gulf Coast as those ramp ups well, they could have a big impact on that but you also have quite a bit ethane storage that needs to be worked off. I think it will be interesting this year. We think it will be fairly steady through the second half of this year, but it definitely could be quicker than we expected as well. Danilo Juvane : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Christopher Sighinolfi : Hi, good morning Terry. How are you? Terry Spencer : Hi Chris, how are you? Christopher Sighinolfi : Good, good. Wanted to ask a couple items on frac volumes. Looking at the outlook and thinking about the comments in ethane recovery. I guess if we would ignore the change in ethane recovery, year-on-year we got this frac volumes could be down. So I am just curious like on the legacy business changes in ethane expectations. What sort of might be driving that if you are shared and have any color on sort of that element would be appreciated? Terry Spencer : Sheridan? Sheridan Swords : So the question is that's why they're cracked lines down in the fourth quarter and first quarter. Or no 2016 versus 17 particularly if I ignore any potential diffract recovered ethane. But I think you still as you look into the 2 years had some. We are going to have some opportunities you just to transport it only volume as we come out of that we also had in 2016 we had quite a bit of spot going we had in 2016 that we do not put into our expectations in 2017 there may be some opportunity for that. But overall, if you look at the base business on Frac 1, we think that Frac 1 will increase the C 3 plus possible and will increase to our attraction haters if you take out the Shiprock paper. US department but yes spot volume that we had in 2016. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay, got it. So there is spot volume but from a guidance convention not included? Derek Reiners : We do not include spot volume in are our guidance. Christopher Sighinolfi : Understood; okay. Wanted to also look like the delta between, I guess this is sort of a related question shared I mean the delta between the volumes you gather and the volumes you frac and particularly the change in those numbers from the back half of last year to what we saw in the first quarter. Looks like there was a bit of a deviation where you were effectively fracking volume in advance of the volumes you gathered in the back half of last year and now you're gathering more than you're cracking. So just wondering if that's a temporary shift if it's specific something we can discuss or if it's something we should think about more on a ratable basis going forward. Derek Reiners : I think the big issue you have when you think about gathered volume and frac volume and trying to tie those two together is storage and that there is some as we go in and out of quarters we may have more or less in storage or specifically as we think about the sterling pipeline where we end the quarter what might have small feet on it we could actually have a lot of storage in my circle of those lines. So frac volumes can kind of get smeared out through the quarters where one quarter you could see gathered volume is up, but frac volume is down, you\u2019d have to go look at our inventory. How we ended the quarter and how we exited the quarter with our line fill inventory and also with our inventory in our storage wells as well. So that I think was the difference we think about frac and gathered. Gathered is pretty much real time frac indeed, you can see ship to volume that was gathered in one month and gathered in one quarter and frac in the subsequent quarters. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay. No, that\u2019s really helpful. So over time you would expect those numbers to move sort of I guess loosely intent? Derek Reiners : Yes, that\u2019s right. Christopher Sighinolfi : And then final question for me Terry, you had mentioned it and obviously flagged it on last quarter's call but the optimization opportunities that we saw in the first quarter, you were noting in your prepared remarks expectation for ethane differential at 3 cent. After the remainder, can you just remind us if that was what was embedded in the NGL segment EBITDA guidance or if it's changed all? And then as you see enhanced ethane recovery would it stand to reason that we should see perhaps a wide thing right? Sheridan Swords : I think the answer to your question both is yes. Christopher Sighinolfi : Still consistent. Okay, great. Thanks for the time this morning guys. Derek Reiners : You bet. Thank you, Chris. Operator : And we'll go to John Edwards with Credit Suisse. John Edwards : Yes. Hi, Terry. Thanks for taking my question. Terry Spencer : Hi, John. John Edwards : Just following up Chris\u2019s question here just is there a relationship between ethane recovery and that optimization spread? I mean do you have some kind of -- is there a correlation there that we can kind a track on that? Terry Spencer : Yes. I think there can be, I\u2019ll make a comment then I\u2019ll let Sheridan follow-up. When I think about it, I just think about strengthening demand in the market area which is the Gulf Coast. And of course it depends on what your supply situation is that upstream and if you are in a situation that we are we have lots of supply you can see a widening of the spread when the demand pull increases. Okay so that and so that can then have an impact on the pricing differential between the two hubs. So that's kind of how I think about it in its most simplistic terms. Now the other part of the answer can get more complicated but Sheridan have you got anything to add there? Sheridan Swords : The one thing I would add to that is as we do increase ethane recovery, the one thing we\u2019ll continue is continually high utilization of the pipeline in between Conway and Bellevue which has the potential to have a widening on the other product as well. John Edwards : So there's not, you can\u2019t say for every 10,000 barrels of additional recovery or utilization on those pipes between locations you\u2019ll add a quarter of a penny. I'm just trying to think is there some sort of formula there or is it just too complicated to make that close of an analogy there? Derek Reiners : We bet our careers here at ONEOK, on the spread candidly and we still have difficulty trying to forecast the spread. And so it's a difficult, as you indicate there are a lot of variables involved we\u2019ve tried to accumulate lots of data we can come up with general correlations but to get as precise as what you're contemplating very difficult to do. John Edwards : Okay. Alright, so\u2026 Derek Reiners : Hey John, we can trend it. And that's about as good as we can probably do. John Edwards : Okay. So just, I had a question on this is on one of the guidance slides that you published. It was on your natural gas gathering and processing slide and you indicated there with increased swab completions and rig activity that you expected about 400 well connects this year in the Wilson basin, 75 already. So I was just running through some simple math and maybe you can tell me where I'm wrong about this because we were thinking, okay you've got 30 wells out there and you drill. I mean 30 rigs and you drill a well every 2 weeks or so. 25 wells per rig for the year, multiply that you get 750 potential wells but you are guiding to 400. So am I wrong about the frequency of how long it takes to drill a well or you can have an increase or build up in doc so how should I think about that or where am I wrong about that? Kevin Burdick : John, its Kevin I think the assumption you are making on average is probably a little strong. We use probably more 15 wells per rig per year on average. Absolutely if a rig is sitting there in great weather it might be able to spit out the number of wells you're talking about per year but on average across the basin with all things included, we see an average of probably more 15 wells per rig per year. So that put you in the 450-ish range. Then you've also got to factor in the lag right, when these rig show up there will typically be several month lag between when first flow happens by the time they get completed. So that's why we still feel pretty good about our 400. John Edwards : Okay. I mean that's helpful. That's it for me. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Thank you, John. Operator : And we\u2019ll go to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Blum : Hi, good morning everybody. I just had one question really. It\u2019s kind of, I guess I sit back and seems like all the focus is on this SCOOP, STACK but I\u2019m curious obviously that your overall guidance has been changed but in terms of what's going on in the Bakken can you just provide like an update in terms of what you're seeing there in terms of activity levels and how things are trending maybe relative to how you thought it would be when you started the year, just trying to get an update on that piece of the business? Kevin Burdick : Yes Michael, its Kevin. We've been extremely pleased with the activity levels we've seen over the last several months. In fourth quarter we communicated that we saw some rig increases, we continue to see those increases up to 30 rigs and continued activity and then Terry talked about our April volumes and where -- how they've recovered to where we're setting records and that puts us in a great position to me relative to our guidance. Michael Blum : Great thank you. Operator : We'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Craig. Craig Shere : Any update on -- rate case and the expansion opportunity on the line? Terry Spencer : The rate case, we did have the hearing with the AOJ and process continues as we\u2019ve kind of outlined the four. So we\u2019re still on schedule and expect to reach a decision by the end of the year. As it comes to expansions, again we continue to discuss with a lot of producers and other activity out there as we get those commitments then we'll obviously be coming forward with the project to expand the product. Craig Shere : And -- you\u2019re getting additional shippers on the line. They are currently already signing up at higher rates then what the legacy calls --. So you actually have a kind of transparent market number right there with ALJ is that correct? Terry Spencer : Yes, we believe. We absolutely believe that's the case. Craig Shere : And so that number might be closer to a nickel or something versus under 3 cents? Derek Reiners : We have not provided that. Terry Spencer : Craig, this is Terry. Given the fact that we are in the midst of this case, I\u2019m hesitant to throw some numbers out there that might create a problem for us as you can appreciate. Craig Shere : Understood. Don\u2019t want to create trouble. Terry Spencer : That\u2019s good. Craig Shere : On the expansion opportunity is this something that we see more backend loaded in the decade or because of the growth in the Permian could this really be something or Kevin announcement the next year? Terry Spencer : I think it's much more near term then the end of the decade. Again we're having discussions literally daily with producers and the processors that are in the basin and you can easily point to the rig increases and the volume increases that are coming out of that to show that there's some near term, definitely some near term opportunities. Craig Shere : What\u2019s driving the short term fall off in the last couple of quarters on the line in terms of volumes? Terry Spencer : Well, the primary reason for the drop just sequential quarter-to-quarter is we do have with that pipe, we have -- we continue to look for ways to optimize and integrate that pipe with other assets we have. And so we have taken the opportunity to -- we look to shift, we've shifted some volumes coming out of North Texas from the West Texas pipeline to the Arbuckle pipeline to get a feel for as volumes grow out of the STACK and SCOOP and comes out or as volumes come out of the Permian just looking for ways and to understand the capacities that we have on both of those pipes. So you really saw a little bit in Q1, we took the opportunity to do some of that optimization so you saw some volume shift and we saw an increase in the mid-continent and that's the primary reason why the West Texas volumes were down. Craig Shere : That very helpful. And my last question, the one half of $2 billion in potential growth project opportunities like the middle opportunities. Given the fact that maybe the STACK residue takeaway solution it may not be an opportunity after the connection project and with sub $50 crude. Should we be thinking more towards the low end of that range or you feel there is so much in backlog that the chairs may get rearranged but the opportunity set still and totals? Terry Spencer : Craig, no, I would not look at it that way. We've got more projects that were in the process of high grading that could flow go right and have gone right into that backlog. So I wouldn't think about it that way at all. Craig Shere : Great. Thank you very much. Terry Spencer : You bet, thank you. Operator : And there are no other questions. So I'd like to turn it back for any additional or closing remarks. Derek Reiners : Thank you. Our quite period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends until earnings are released after market closes in early August. Thank you for joining us. Operator : And that does conclude our conference for the day. I'd like to thank everyone for your participation.",

Today\u2019s call is being recorded. And at this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Vicky and good morning everyone and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s second quarter earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. I would like to start by welcoming Andrew back to the team and I also want to acknowledge T.D. Eureste for his many contributions to our Investor Relations efforts during some of the most challenging times over the last few years. T.D. is now Vice President of our Treasury team. Joining me today on this call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Our second quarter ended with the completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction, which included the acquisition of all of the common units of ONEOK Partners we did not previously own. ONEOK is even better positioned to execute our long-term growth strategy for the benefit of both our legacy and new ONEOK shareholders. We have many opportunities for organic growth across our businesses through our diversified and integrated midstream asset footprint in some of the nation's most active shale plays. We can provide our current and new customers with full service midstream capabilities. As I have said before, growth opportunities continued to develop in the areas we operate. Our second quarter 2017 financial results were solid with volume growth in both our gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. Higher average fee rates in our G&P segment and higher transportation revenues from completed expansions in our natural gas pipelines segment. Walt will review our financial results and provide additional color on our 2017 guidance, which was updated to reflect the merger transaction and our business outlook for the rest of 2017. Kevin will discuss our operational results in more detail as well. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK reported strong financial results for the quarter, including healthy dividend coverage of approximately 1.5 times for both the second quarter and through the first half of 2017. As noted in our earnings release, second quarter results included approximately $43 million in one-time and transaction related charges, which impacted second quarter earnings per share by $0.12 per share and dividend coverage by 0.18 times. Last week, we increased our quarterly dividend by 21% to $0.745 cents or $2.98 per share on an annualized basis. The successful completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction combined with the proactive steps we have taken to improve our leverage position and balance sheet are being recognized. In July, ONEOK received credit rating upgrades to investment grade from both S&P and Moody\u2019s. Both agencies also have established stable outlooks on the company. ONEOK\u2019s trailing 12-month GAAP net debt to EBIT was 5x at June 30, including transaction costs, 4.9 times without the transaction costs. We continue to expect to reduce leverage to a target of 4x or less by late 2018 or early 2019 primarily driven by expected growth of adjusted EBITDA. In July, we took additional proactive steps to manage our future debt maturities and liquidity by utilizing ONEOK\u2019s cash on hand to immediately reduce commercial paper borrowings, completing a $1.2 billion senior notes offering redeeming all $87 million of our 6.5% senior notes due 2028 and repaying $500 million of our $1 billion term loan due 2019. As a result, we now have nearly $2.2 billion of available capacity on our $2.5 billion credit facility. 2017 guidance has been updated to reflect the June 30 close of the merger transaction with the only adjustment to the midpoint of adjusted EBITDA being the impact of transaction expenses. Our original guidance provided on February 1 did not include the one-time or transaction-related charges I mentioned earlier and the original guidance also assumed a January 1 transaction closing day. We narrowed ONEOK\u2019s adjusted EBITDA guidance to a range of $1.89 billion to $2.06 billion and increase our growth capital expenditure range by approximately $70 million to reflect recently announced projects. Please refer to our news release, investor presentation and the 10-Q filings for additional details on the quarter. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments. Kevin Burdick : Thanks, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segment, NGL volumes gathered averaged approximately 807,000 barrels per day, a 6% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017 and NGLs fractionated increased 8% compared with the first quarter. Bakken NGL pipeline volumes were up 8% averaging 141,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. NGL volumes gathered from the STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent and out of the Permian basin also increased during the second quarter. Mid-Continent volumes increased 4% and volumes on our West Texas LPG pipeline increased 7% compared with the first quarter 2017. The Permian basin remains one of the most active basins in the country and we continue to have promising discussions with producers and processors in both the Midland and Delaware basins to expand our West Texas LPG system to capture expected production growth. We connected two additional third-party natural gas processing plants during the quarter both in the Mid-Continent in addition to the three plants connected in the first quarter of 2017. And we have already connected one additional third-party plant in the Permian basin in the third quarter. The total combined NGL production of these 6 new plants is expected to run to approximately 30,000 barrels per day by the end of 2017 and increased to more than 40,000 barrels per day in 2018. Ethane rejection levels on our NGL system remained relatively unchanged in the second quarter 2017 averaging more than 150,000 barrels per day similar to first quarter levels. We continue to expect an increase in ethane recovery on our system through the remainder of the year as new petrochemical plants are completed. For the natural gas gathering and processing segment, second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 23% compared with the first quarter 2017 primarily driven by volume growth in the Williston basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. The segment\u2019s average fee rate was $0.87 per MMBtu in the second quarter 2017 compared with $0.76 per MMBtu in the second quarter of 2016, a 14% increase which was driven by increased volumes on higher fee contracts in the Williston basin. We expect the segment\u2019s average fee rate to be closer to $0.85 for all of 2017 as our volume mix shifts across regions and contracts depending on producer activity. We achieved our highest level of volumes processed in the Williston Basin during the second quarter, with volumes averaging more than 820 million cubic feet day, a 13% increase compared with the first quarter of 2017. Mid-Continent volumes average more than 690 million cubic feet per day, a 4% increase during the quarter. Despite commodity price fluctuations during the quarter, drilling rigs have remained steady. We currently have more than 30 rigs operating on our dedicated acreage in the Williston basin in approximately 15 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas. In the Williston Basin, we connected 108 wells during the second quarter. We expect to connect 400 wells in the basin this year and estimate there are still approximately 300 drilled, but uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage. With this new production that has recently come online, our available processing capacity is now approximately 150 million cubic feet per day in the Williston Basin. Growth in the Mid-Continent continues to be driven by increased activity and strong production results from our customers in the STACK and SCOOP. Recent activity levels and production results continued to exceed expectations. We connected 27 wells in the Mid-Continent during the second quarter and we expect to connect approximately 100 wells on our dedicated acreage in the Mid-Continent in 2017 as our volume ramp is expected to be weighted more towards the second half of the year. In the natural gas pipelines segment, second quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 18% compared with the same period in 2016. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee based earnings driven by increased firm contracted capacity in connection with the expansions of our West Texas transmission pipeline and our Permian Basin joint venture Road Runner pipeline, which will both completed in October 2016. In our earnings release, we provided updated segment specific guidance and volume expectations. Overall, we have increased adjusted EBITDA for our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipelines segments and increased our G&P volume outlook. These increases were primarily driven by higher than projected volumes in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas and our expectation that drilling and completion activity will remain strong through the second half of the year based on recent discussions with our producer customers. We narrowed our adjusted EBITDA guidance in the natural gas liquids segment reflecting adjustments for the timing of the expected volume increases from recently connected third-party plants. In mid-June, we announced NGL and natural gas related expansion projects totaling approximately $170 million to accommodate growth in the STACK area. Projects include a 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline, increasing its capacity to 250,000 barrels per day and additional NGL gathering system expansions in the area, which are all backed by a long-term contract and plant dedications. These expansions are expected to be complete by the end of 2018. Additionally, we announced the construction of a 30 mile natural gas pipeline through the heart of the STACK to connect with an existing third-party natural gas processing plant in Oklahoma, which will provide us access to an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity and is expected to be in service by the end of 2017. And most recently on Monday, we announced plans to expand our Canadian Valley natural gas processing facility in the STACK area of Western Oklahoma. The project will increase capacity at the facility to 400 million cubic feet per day from 200 million cubic feet per day and is expected to be complete by the end of 2018. It also will provide approximately 20,000 barrels per day of additional volume into our NGL gathering system. Combined with the third-party processing agreement I just mentioned, this plant will bring our total Oklahoma processing capacity to 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. The additional capacity is needed to support the rapidly growing production in the area and is backed by more than 200,000 acres of dedication primarily fee-based contracts and minimum volume commitments. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks Kevin. A couple final comments as it relates to our future growth projects before we take your questions. We continue to grow our backlog of potential capital growth projects that we are working hard to develop and earn customer commitments. Once we do so we will certainly announce those projects. Additionally I am confident that over time, we will add to our backlog as we have done in the past. We expect to continue to grow in our existing businesses and continue to focus on applying our core capabilities to create value for our customers and investors. Finally, I want to thank our employees for their continued hard work, dedication and commitment and operating our systems safely, reliably and environmentally, responsibly every day. Operator, we are now ready for your questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And we will take our first question today from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Please go ahead. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning, guys. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Shneur. Shneur Gershuni : Just two questions here, the first one is with respect to guidance, I was wondering if you can square something for me, I recognized that you have raised guidance at the operational level, because of Bakken volumes, however when I look at the kind of the midpoint it doesn\u2019t suggest a surge in volumes, but at the same time I look at your performance, I look at comments from E&P producers, it seems like the \u2013 your volume guidance should have been a little bit higher in the \u2013 in the Bakken, is there a hint of conservatism or is there a bottleneck that we should be thinking about. And then staying on the guidance question, the NGL segment revision sounds like it\u2019s a delay in some [indiscernible] by producer, is that just shifting earnings into next year, I was just wondering if you can give a little bit of color about that as well? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Shneur, this is Kevin, I will take the G&P question first. No, I don\u2019t know that we believe there is conservatism built into our volume guidance for that we provided. One thing when we think about the Williston, to me look you do the math, we are showing that we are going to need to grow in Q3 and Q4 to meet the midpoint of the processed volume guidance. The other dynamic going on there especially what the Williston is winter. So we have to \u2013 we learned from January, last January and February that we do have a little bit of winter weather factor built into that guidance as well. As we look from an NGL repeat \u2013 could you repeat the question on NGL side again. Shneur Gershuni : On the NGL I was wondering if you can give just a little more color as to why the revisions there is it something that rolls into \u201818 or how should we think about that? Kevin Burdick : Yes. The downward revision, small revision to our volumes in the EBITDA on the NGL segment was related to timing. We clearly, don\u2019t see that as a change in our point of view on the activity levels. It literally was just as that the specific timing the plants came online and how the volumes then are ramping. So yes, it would be, we don\u2019t necessarily see our exit rates changing, it was more a factor of when they came online and how that played into the full year average. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then a final bigger picture question, when I sort of look at Oneok\u2019s earnings performance and CapEx spend over the last 2 years, relative to your peers your capital investment intensity has been fairly low, I do recognize that you haven\u2019t announced capital investments, but relatively speaking versus earnings growth which has been much higher than your CapEx expense, are there more opportunities to continue growing your business while keeping your capital intensity on the lower side. I suspect you have done some off-take agreements and asset optimizations, but is that largely done and future growth will kind of have a corresponding one-for-one investment in CapEx or are there more opportunities continue growing earnings without the same intensity on CapEx that we see in some peers? Terry Spencer : Shneur, I will \u2013 let me make a couple of comments and then if the Kevin has got some of that he can follow-up. We do have some more opportunity in terms of \u2013 in terms of taking advantage of the headroom that we have in our businesses. That will kind of come and go and we will kind of work those opportunities dependent upon what\u2019s out there in terms of the G&P landscape. So that will be a bit of a moving target, but we think there is more opportunity to do that. But I think just fundamentally speaking we are going to see more capital spend going forward than we have seen from our traditional run rates over the last couple of years, just based upon the fundamentals that we are seeing the strong rig counts that we are seeing right underneath our noses. So I do expect that run rate to increase as we continue to develop those projects and those projects that hit the full menu of services that we provide NGLs, G&P, fractionation and what have you, so as those come together and materialize, we will adjust our backlog of unannounced growth projects appropriately and certainly we will provide you more color as we move forward. Okay, Kevin anything that you would add there. Shneur Gershuni : Great. Thank you very much guys. I appreciate the color. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Hi, good morning. I guess this is going to touch on the last question a bit, but in terms of the extension with Canadian Valley, you are getting 200 a day for 145 million to 155 million. I am just thinking back to the \u2013 before the commodity price collapse of 2015, you had plans for the Knox plant 200 a day again for 365 to 470 million. So, from a cost per capacity standpoint, this is clearly better. My question is why not choose to expand Canadian Valley in the first place over Knox a few years ago? And then is there something that\u2019s changed perhaps in location of where Knox is going to go that makes it less necessary or is there potential to revive that plant. How should we think about all that? Kevin Burdick : Hi, Eric. This is Kevin. Yes, three is a variety of things I think that are going on with that Delta. Sorry we had some weird feedback here. First I would say yes when we announced Knox it was a completely different business environment at that point. I mean it was the heyday of the growth and so that drove costs for materials and services were higher. The second thing is the rationale for the Knox location was at that point in time the SCOOP was really the hot play and that\u2019s where the majority of the activity was and Knox is geographically right in the heart of the SCOOP. And then \u2013 so as the drilling activity shifted a little bit to the north and the STACK became really a prolific play, we started taking a look and that\u2019s where our volumes were going to show up and therefore being able to leverage the facility \u2013 existing facilities at the Canadian Valley site became the appropriate place to put that next tranche of capacity we are bringing online. That also had an indirect effect of the gas coming on in the STACK where we had a significant amount of infrastructure already in place, so that also drove down the field infrastructure necessary for the plant as well. So, a combination of all those factors we still have is the stack matures, we still have the ability we could put another train at that same facility. If the SCOOP continues to evolve that wouldn\u2019t preclude us from putting another plant down at the Knox site that we have referred to previously. Eric Genco : Okay that\u2019s very helpful. And then just real quick on the NGL segment showed an 11% increase sequentially in operating costs versus 6% in volumes and you talked about your ability last quarter to run the Bakken NGL line above nameplate in this quarter EAA did. Did that cost you on the operating expense front or is there something else going on there and what is the status of the pipeline expansion there? As 3Q \u201818 is still a good target you come earlier would be good if it did 20 years Dawson capacity there and then possible expansions beyond the 160? Terry Spencer : Yes. I will start from a cost standpoint, no, there was no relationship between the cost increase and in the capacity on the pipeline that was purely we had timing impact of some maintenance and expense projects that occurred in the second quarter. As we think about the Bakken capacity, we still have some headroom. We have said it will run nameplate. Clearly, we are having conversations with a variety of our customers both in the not just in the Bakken, but also the powder and that in the DJ about additional capacity. So, we were working through what that expansion might look like the timing of such. Operator : Okay. We will now take our next question from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead. Danilo Juvane : Thanks and good morning everyone. In the G&P segment, NGL sales volumes average 186,000 barrels per day. I recall on the last quarter\u2019s call we talked about the delta year-over-year being driven by ethane recoveries. And since we are talking about ethane recoveries being essentially flat between the first and second quarters, I wanted to make sure that, that increase is just driven by propane plus? Terry Spencer : Yes that volume was entirely driven by propane plus. Danilo Juvane : Got it. And second question for me, I didn\u2019t see anything in the release, so I apologize if I missed it, but typically you disclosed your equity NGL data and customarily also report hedges that, that you often update. Did you firstly update the hedges and is there any equity NGL data available? Terry Spencer : That will be part our two that we will file here today, so yes we didn\u2019t put it in the earnings release, but it will be in the 10-Q. Danilo Juvane : Thank you. That\u2019s it for me. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hi, good morning everyone. I am wondering can you give us an update on where things stand on the West Texas LPG line and the case there? Thanks. Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. Yes, on West Texas, we are still in the process. From the rate case standpoint, the ALJ has the information and we are awaiting on that and we continue to expect we will have resolution on that by the end of the year and are confident in our case. Michael Blum : Okay. And then little bit of a nitpicky question, but just wonder if you can provide a little background on, there is a footnote in these release related to contribution to the ONEOK foundation of 20,000 shares that had a value $20 million, which looks like was part of the adjusted EBITDA calculation. Can you just kind of talk about what\u2019s going on there? Walt Hulse : Yes, sure. Michael, this is Walt. The ONEOK Foundation was a foundation that we created in 1997 to support the communities that we operate in. Over the course of the last several years, we haven\u2019t made any contributions to that given the business environment and with the closing of the transaction, we saw it as an opportune time to true up that foundation and made a contribution of $20 million in the form of a preferred stock. Michael Blum : Okay. So, on a go forward historically I guess before the last 3 years, you would be systematically contributing and that would be running through the statements? Walt Hulse : That\u2019s correct. And it was periodic. It was not necessarily annual event just from time-to-time. Michael Blum : Okay, alright. Thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll go to Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone. I actually wanted to start on West Texas. One of your customers there announced plans to build their own NGL pipeline, which would imply that they are pulling volumes off your system once that comes online. Would you be able to give us an idea of how much you are expecting to come off and how we should think about the outlook for the pipeline and whether or not we should think that the expansion that you guys have previously talked about gets pushed out? Sheridan Swords : Christine, this is Sheridan. Look, I can\u2019t take specifically how much any shipper on the pipeline moves, but what I can tell you is no shipper on our system moves more than 25% of the volume on that. So, everybody is below 25%. And if we would lose volume then we do know that pipeline coming in. We are highly confident that we will be able to re-contract that volume at definitely better rates than we are getting today, because we are getting the lower rates and also that would give us the opportunity to offer bundled services to also get practices in there. And actually we are working very diligently and close to have an expansion on the West Texas pipeline back by customers and we don\u2019t see this new pipeline having any impact at all on the timing of that expansion? Christine Cho : Sheridan, you might clarify, when you said you can\u2019t provide that information you might clarify, why that\u2019s the case? Sheridan Swords : The West Texas pipeline is a regulated pipeline and we can\u2019t \u2013 as an operator of that pipeline divulge shipper \u2013 specific shipper information. We can only give generalities about what it is. That\u2019s why I say nobody is greater than 25%. I can\u2019t tell you specifically what that one customer has. Christine Cho : Okay, that\u2019s helpful. Thank you. And then on the Canadian Valley expansion is that being driven by new acreage dedications or faster than expected ramp on production for from existing acreage dedications? Also, if you could talk about the ability to add more trains at this facility if there is need? And lastly how should we think about the need or potential for Arbuckle Sterling expansion beyond Sterling III with these additional volumes? Kevin Burdick : Hey, Christine, it\u2019s Kevin. Yes, when we look at the STACK in general, obviously the production growth we have seen and you just back up away from our specific G&P presence and you look at what the producers are doing in the region, it\u2019s been pretty staggering with some of the results they have reported here over the last several months. So, most of the \u2013 the vast majority of the capacity needed is going to be to serve existing acreage dedications that we have and under long-term contracts. We have added a few small additional contracts here and there. But the primary expansion and the capacity is needed to serve those existing just more growth on those existing contracts. And yes we do as I mentioned earlier we have the ability to put at least one more train and potentially two at the Canadian Valley facility as the STACK continues to grow. And again when you are looking it over hundred rigs in the STACK and SCOOP combined, clearly as we are talking and in Sheridan\u2019s business and the NGL side talking to a variety of processors and producers an expansion of our \u2013 additional expansions needed to our book or are not out of the question. Christine Cho : Okay, great. And then just going off the STACK/SCOOP, several weeks prior to the announcement of the expansion on Canadian Valley you guys announced that you would be offloading 200 million cubic feet a day processing from that region to a third-party plants, could you explain why these volumes aren\u2019t being directed to the Canadian Valley plant, is it more of a timing thing, a geographical thing or anb economic decision? Terry Spencer : Is was really all the above, we haven\u2019t \u2013 we just had an attractive opportunity presented and we work with our counterparty and the combination of timing and we were able to get this capacity in place sooner than we would have built. We would have been able to build an existing train and obviously economics factored in. We wouldn\u2019t have done it if it wasn\u2019t attractive to us and our customers. Christine Cho : Okay, great. Thank you. Operator : And Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers is next. Craig Shere : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning Craig. Craig Shere : It looks like on Slide 4 of the deck that NGLs volume were up sequentially, pretty well and that was also highlighted in the prepared remarks, but on Slide 7 there is some commentary about consequential operating performance, down $9.9 million forward margin on seasonal product demand, is this more a product mix issue, is this something we should see annually does it have anything to do with the adjustments to volumes for the year unexpected third-party interconnects? Kevin Burdick : No Craig, this is Kevin. No, it\u2019s nothing we \u2013 yes, it is seasonal. So from the standpoint of what we expect and in fact when we \u2013 if you look at last year as we were explaining our second quarter, we had similar seasonal impacts. This is volume shipped on our north system that are seasonal in nature and so that\u2019s what\u2019s driving that aspect. The other \u2013 the cost side is what I referenced earlier it was just a timing. Typically as we come out of winner, we end up having a higher level of maintenance and expense project activity and that\u2019s what drove that increase sequential quarter-to-quarter from a cost perspective. Craig Shere : But if the overall volumes on your system higher sequentially, it is a simply product mix can you explain that a little more? Kevin Burdick : Yes. The volumes that we are talking about, the volume growth isn\u2019t necessarily on the distribution system. Some of the earnings is shown up in the exchange services side of the business. So the volume specifically in the margin on the transportation side is related to that seasonal North system. Craig Shere : Okay. And then a follow-up on Shneur\u2019s question about unannounced growth projects, I think you all have already announced with two press releases about $300 million in aggregate growth CapEx, an opportunity set that was previously described that $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion as you think about our book goal and this expansion maybe over the Overland past JV needing some expanded capacity over time that additional GMP capacity requirements, do you see this $1.5 billion to $2.5 billion opportunities set reduced by about $300 million, do you see some additions on the ground expanding, contracting from that initial outlook? Terry Spencer : Craig, now we don\u2019t see it reducing. We see it go in the other direction just given the fundamentals that we are seeing under our footprint today. Craig Shere : And in terms of the timing for Terry, we didn\u2019t have huge dollar amounts relative to your historic spend announced, I mean we did have a couple of nice announcements, could you see more material announcements in the second half here? Terry Spencer : We could see that, certainly in the second half we could see it in the early 2018. Craig Shere : Great, I appreciate the help. Terry Spencer : You bet. Operator : Next is Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey Terry, good morning. Terry Spencer : Hi good morning Chris. Chris Sighinolfi : Just want to \u2013 we are at the point in the call, a lot of the big new have been hit, so I wanted to hit on some of the maybe some of it set additional items, but on the optimization and marketing commentary and I know I have inquired with Sharon about this in the past, but it looks like if I were to follow sort of the Opus prices or the Bentek [ph] reported prices that regional spreads on prices and intra-product price perhaps present an opportunity for greater optimization in marketing year-on-year, do you highlighted in the release that there was actually a headwind, so I am just I know it\u2019s a complicated series of decisions around the optimization in marketing activities and so I didn\u2019t know if there was a simplistic way to plan maybe what happened in the market year-over-year net to what we are seeing on the quoted prices? Sheridan Swords : Chris really this is Sheridan, year-on-year most of that or all of that delta that\u2019s down decrease was due to our marketing activity. And really it was due to timing on our inventory that we have sold out in fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter that we have seen prices drop in the second quarter that we will realize that back in the fourth quarter, third and fourth quarter when those sales come on. So it\u2019s all in marketing it was not in optimization. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. And that\u2019s something just to clarify what you just said, is that something you saw last year in the fourth quarter are you saying, we would expect to see it in the back half of this year some of these gains in the back\u2026.? Sheridan Swords : Actually last year we had the opposite effect, where we had inventory and prices rose last year and that\u2019s in the second quarter. So we kind of got a little bit of two different things going on with our inventory, but the cells are out there in the fourth \u2013 third and fourth quarter work what will realize higher third and fourth quarter on the marketing for the decrease in the second quarter. Chris Sighinolfi : Got it, okay, perfect. And then I guess following-up on the change in the gathered volumes for NGL gathered volumes versus a static forecast on what you were expecting or what you are still expecting on the frac side, just looking at that if I think about $25 million of segment EBITDA decline on 25,000 barrels a day of full year movement on the guidance [Technical Difficulty] by somewhere around $0.065 a gallon, I know when you quote the regional areas some include frac, some don\u2019t and it would seem like that\u2019s more aligned with an area that includes fractionation services that\u2019s if an absent, so I am just wondering were you \u2013 was that gathering amount planned to be frac then you were just sort of previously at the high end of where you thought the frac items would be and backgrounds with metal or how do we interpret I guess the financial implications of the volume if you could help us with that would be helpful? Sheridan Swords : Whether the volumes got spread out over the whole system, but I would say most of that we were planning on cracking. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay, perfect. I guess one follow-up question Michael Blum asked earlier with regard to the preferred equity placement that the contribution, is there an associated \u2013 it looks like there is an associated preferred distribution on that at least recorded small very small quarter, just wanted if you give us a sense what the run rate on that might be? Derek Reiners : Sure it\u2019s a 5.5% preferred on the $20 million. So it\u2019s reasonably immaterial in the overall scheme of things. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. So just relatable well that comes out every quarter, it\u2019s not an audit \u2013 it\u2019s not twice a year, every quarter? Derek Reiners : It\u2019s quarterly, yes. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. And then I guess final question for me, we have seen a very nice up-tick, continued up-tick in the average be on your GMP activities, I am guessing based on your earlier commentary that that might I think talking about that maybe sliding back down a little bit given a composition of volumes, I am assuming since it continued to rise that the surprise, upside surprise on Williston Basin activity, I am just wondering how you think about that progressing now given what the activity has been, I think you have said $0.85 for the full year, I guess any help in how you are thinking about producer activity across the [indiscernible] has been moved into 2018 would be really helpful? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Chris, this is Kevin. We clearly see growth in both our regions in the Williston and in the Mid-Continent of STACK and SCOOP primarily. As we move forward, so yes the fee rate will move around just literally quarter-to-quarter as that volume mix changes between a little bit higher fee rates in the Williston versus the Mid-Continent, so as the volume growth kind of shifts from one to the other that that fee rate will move around. We still feel good about $0.85-ish through the rest of this year or for the full year. How that moves around will just depend literally on the timing of individual well completions and how the volumes grow sequential quarter-to-quarter. Chris Sighinolfi : So Kevin, it\u2019s fair to say that you should \u2013 we are probably not going to see any step function changes in that weighted average fee rate? Kevin Burdick : No, part of the reason for the pretty significant step up from Q1 to Q2 was because we had the severe weather impact to the Williston volumes in Q1, so that as those volumes grew substantially relatively \u2013 comparatively that\u2019s what drove up the fee rate. But going forward no, we shouldn\u2019t see step change functions in that fee rate. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. So does the tone we are in right now is a pretty comfortable [indiscernible] found around sort of high to low pace on competition quarter-to-quarter, is that a fair understanding? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. Thanks a lot guys. I really appreciate the time this morning. Kevin Burdick : Thanks Chris. Operator : We will go to Ethan Bellamy with Baird. Please go ahead. Ethan Bellamy : Hi guys. Good morning. Hey, you have just \u2013 you guys have done a really great job in the past few years of a multi-year strategic shift in financial structure and with the [indiscernible] on you now have a really good cost of capital what\u2019s next, what\u2019s the next corporate strategy goal, is it more aggressive on M&A, I mean where do you go? Terry Spencer : Well, Ethan as far as aggressiveness on them M&A nothing has really changed in terms of our view. From an M&A perspective we are always interested in strategic opportunities, certainly the challenge associated with those as actionability as you are well aware. But our strategy remains heavily organically focused and certainly where are we building off this big asset footprint that we have, the incremental returns or the incremental investments that we are making and the returns that we are seeing are very attractive. And we will stay focused on taking care of our customer needs, building off of this existing footprint. And then from time-to-time, acquisition opportunities if they present themselves and they fit with this with this NGL centric kind of strategy that we have certainly we will pursue those. But that\u2019s kind of help things\u2026 Ethan Bellamy : So the sea change in your cost of capital really haven\u2019t changed your strategy or the way you are thinking about growing things\u2026? Kevin Burdick : It really hasn\u2019t, I mean we are certainly from a business perspective and as we think about our growth strategies, they are still spot on with where we have been in the past. I will tell you that we are all \u2013 we have always been in a prospecting mode in terms of M&A regardless of our structure. And we are still there, but they got to certainly make sense, got to make a lot of sense for us. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. And then one really granular question, how much behind pipe gas in the block and is still low hanging fruit in terms of capturing things are being flared right now? Terry Spencer : When you say behind pipe, are you talking about it from a geologic perspective? Ethan Bellamy : Yes. I am? Terry Spencer : Okay. So Three Forks, are you comfort Kevin\u2026. Kevin Burdick : Well, I heard a couple of question. You just want to get at how much low hanging fruit from a flaring perspective? Ethan Bellamy : Yes. Well, I am just thinking about maybe also something that\u2019s getting flared now, but you know that there is going to be some wells drilled. You don\u2019t have pipe in the area now that kind of I am just trying to get a sense for the opportunity there, because I know a lot of your volume catch-up has been intrinsic, going out and capturing that that for a gas? Terry Spencer : Now, we have \u2013 in large part we have captured a good chunk of that low hanging fruit. I mean we still estimate we may have 60 million to 70 million cubic feet a day flaring behind our system. But again that\u2019s as our volumes have grown we have lowered, at the same time we have lowered that flared gas. So there is always going to be some level of flaring. We might estimate 30 million to 40 million a day that\u2019s just going to be ongoing. So there may be another 20 million that we are continuing to pursue that you would kind of call low hanging fruit. But for the most part our operations team has done a fantastic job and relative to the rest of the basin our flaring is well below the statewide averages. Ethan Bellamy : And is the state left in your face about this now? Terry Spencer : Well, yes from the standpoint of the industry in total is delivered and specifically yes. So yes, from the standpoint that industry stepped up and has met the flaring targets and is \u2013 and it takes it extremely seriously. And as we worked with our customers to drive the flaring down, yes it is it is limited and eased the pressure. Ethan Bellamy : Good to hear. Thanks gentlemen. Terry Spencer : Great. Thanks Ethan. Operator : And that will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn it back to Andrew Ziola for any additional or closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Okay. Well, thank you all very much for joining us. Our quite period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October and extend till our earnings are released after the market closes in early November. Again, thank you for joining us and feel free to follow-up with me in the coming days. Have a good rest of your day. Operator : Thank you very much. And that does conclude our conference for today. I would thank everyone for your participation.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you and welcome to ONEOK's third quarter earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always we appreciate your continued interest in investment in ONEOK. Joining me today's call are Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Before I hand the call over and I have a few brief opening remarks. I am going to start up by saying how much I appreciate the efforts of our employees who personally endured Hurricane Harvey, employees at our Mont Belvieu area facility and countless others at our company work tirelessly to keep our assets running safely in order to provide needed services to our customers. I am very proud of them. And as expected, their dedication and commitment to this company continuous to be nothing shorter remarkable. I should also mention that the swift recovery of the Mont Belvieu infrastructure following Harvey would not have been possible without the hard work and cooperation of many of our industry peers, customers, service providers and local governments. Many thanks to them. I also wanted to extend our thoughts and prayers to the victims, their families and all effected by the senseless tragedy that occurred in New York City yesterday afternoon. The city and its people once again prove its courage and resolves as it copes with this tragic event. Moving on to our third quarter performance, building off our second quarter results. Third quarter performance was strong benefiting from natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth and higher transportation revenues in our natural gas pipeline segment. These results demonstrate that we are well on our way to achieving our 2017 guidance. As we stand today compared to a year ago, rig counts have increased in the states we served by 70%, driven primarily by technological advances in drilling which has made exploration more effective, more efficient and production more prolific. We are seeing petrochemical facilities and ethane cracker coming online and expect two more to startup in the next several months. The industry has been anticipating these startups for several years and now we are beginning to see real demand for ethane, which Kevin will discuss more in a moment. We're also hearing from customers about the next wave of petrochemical facilities to be designed and built on the Gulf Coast. I mention this because it's important to point out the energy industry is once again proving its resiliency and its adaptability to the market place. I believe ONEOK has played a big part in that by continuing to invest capital to aggregate supply and deliver it to the markets. We are well positioned to meet the needs of our customers today and we are committed to continue investing in and around our assets to meet their needs into the future. With that I will now turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $517 million compared with $462 million in the second quarter 2017. The 12% increase primarily driven by natural gas and natural gas liquids volume growth. As noted in our earnings release, third quarter results included approximately $20 million in non-cash impairment charge related to non-strategic assets and equity investments in our G&P segment which impacted third quarter earnings per share by $0.03. We estimate that without the disruption of Hurricane Harvey, the NGL segment's earnings would have been approximately $4.5 million higher for the quarter or $0.01 per share. Last week, we announced our quarterly dividend of 74.5 cents per share or $2.98 per share on an annualized basis unchanged from the previous quarter when we increased the dividend by 21%. Dividend coverage was healthy 1.3 times for the quarter. Management still expects to recommend annual dividend increases of approximately 9% to 11% beginning in 2018 and annual dividend coverage of 1.2 times or greater. Since June, we've announced nearly $0.5 billion in attractive, low multiple growth projects supported by commitments from anchor customers. In September and October, we issued 3.3 million shares through our ATM equity program resulting a net proceeds of $184 million. The proceeds of these issuance along with gas generated in excess of dividends support these recently announced high return projects as we prudently manage our balance sheet. We continue to see opportunities to make attractive investments supported by customer commitments. To the extent that we make additional future investments, the ATM will be one of the tools available to fund future growth. ONEOK's trailing 12 month GAAP debt-to-EBITDA improved again to 4.9 times at September 30. Our annualized third quarter GAAP debt-to-EBITDA run rate was 4.6 times. We continue to expect leverage to be around our target of 4 times or less by late 2018 or early 2019. We continue to proactively manage our balance sheet. We repaid $1 billion in its outstanding debt in July and September combined and completed a $1.2 billion senior notes offering in July, essentially extending the term of the debt at a very attractive rates. We are well positioned with ample liquidity to effectively manage our debt maturities and continue to finance growth investments. As it relates to review of rates on West Texas LPG, in late September, the Administrative Law Judge provided its findings to the Railroad Commission of Texas, which the commissioners may expect, modify or remand for further preceding. There is no deadline for them to take action. That we anticipate the commissioners may consider the findings in any exceptions filed by the parties this December. Regardless of the outcome, we do not expect the Railroad Commission's decision to have a material impact on our financial results. They will also not impact our current our future negotiated rates on West Texas LPG. [indiscernible] our ability to secure new NGL supply from producers and processors. As noted by our recently announcement to expand into the heart of the Delaware Basin. In yesterday's earnings announcement, we maintained our 2017 guidance outlook which was updated last quarter to reflect the completion of the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction. We expect to announce 2018 guidance sometime after the first of the year. Please refer to our news release, investor presentation and 10-Q filing for additional details on the quarter. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segments. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 8% compared with the second quarter 2017 including the impact from Hurricane Harvey which lowered our EBITDA by approximately $4.5 million. We sustain mills significant damage to our facilities but experienced reduced volumes due to industry downtime and increased operating cost following the hurricane. We essentially realized no benefit from optimization directly related to the hurricane. As we look forward, we had seen wider spreads so far early in the fourth quarter. NGL volumes gathered averaged approximately 812,000 barrels per day, a 5,000 barrels per day increase compared with the second quarter 2017. Higher Mid-Continent volumes and higher volumes on our West Texas LPG pipeline drove the increase. Volume on Bakken NGL pipeline decreased slightly from the second quarter due primarily to plan maintenance activities at our Garden Creek and Grassland's natural gas processing plants in the Williston Basin and planned maintenance on the Overland Pass Pipeline. As we discussed previously, our Bakken NGL pipeline can run above its nameplate capacity of 135,000 barrels per day and through October, volumes had return to levels at or above what we experienced in the second quarter. We continue monitoring producer customer activity as well as the current utilization of Overland Pass Pipeline and are evaluating our options to provide additional capacity out of the region. Third quarter NGL volumes fractionated were down slightly compared with the second quarter 2017, primarily impacted by Hurricane Harvey. Volumes that were unable to be fractionated during the third quarter were stored and will be fractionated in either the fourth quarter of 2017 or first quarter 2018. Ethane rejection levels on our NGL systems remained relatively unchanged in the third quarter 2017 averaging more than 150,000 barrels per day similar to second quarter levels. As multiple, petrochemical facilities are expected to come online in the next few months, we continue to expect ethane recovery levels to fluctuate in the fourth quarter and into early 2018 as the startups occur. As we have moved into the fourth quarter, we had seen a significant increase in our gathered volumes. In October, we exceeded 900,000 barrels per day on numerous days. The increase in a combination of volume growth of overall raw feed and additional ethane that is being recovered. For the natural gas gathering and processing segment, third quarter 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased to 11% compared with the second quarter 2017. With the segment once again posting solid volume growth in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. In the Williston Basin, volumes processed again established new highs with an average of more than 840 million cubic feet per day during the quarter. Despite plan maintenance act some of our processing facilities and the maintenance on Overland Pass Pipeline. Mid-Continent volumes averaged more than 740 million cubic feet per day, an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2017. Rigs remained steady across our acreage with approximately 30 rigs operating on a dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin and approximately 15 rigs on a dedicated acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas combined. In the Williston Basin, we connected 130 wells during the third quarter for a total of 313 through the first nine months of the year, well on our way to completing our target of 400 in 2017. We now estimate the drilled but uncompleted wells on our dedicated acreage increased between 350 to 400, compared with 300 previously. We continue hearing of improved efficiencies across the basin including indications between 10% and 15% productivity improvements in wells completed in 2017 compared with 2016. At current rig activity levels, in addition to inventories in the basin, we expect continued volume growth into 2018. Growth in the Mid-Continent continues as well. We connected 35 wells in the Mid-Continent during the third quarter and it connected 76 through the first nine months of the year, well on track to reach our target of 100 by the end of the year. The segment's average fee rate was $0.86 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2017 compared with $0.76 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2016, a 13% increase which was driven primarily by increased volumes on contracts where we received higher fees. We still expect the segment's average fee rate to be approximately $0.85 to all of 2017. In the natural gas pipeline segment, adjusted EBITDA increased 8% in the third quarter 2017 and 13% through the first nine months of the year compared with the same periods in 2016. The segment continues to benefit from high fee based earnings and increased transportation capacity contracted. We continue discussions with producers and markets to develop long term natural gas take away solutions across our footprint especially out of the Permian Basin where we had a long standing asset position with our West Texas Pipeline system and recently our joint venture Road Runner pipelines. As Walt discussed, we've announced nearly $0.5 billion of capital growth projects with the most recent being the $200 million expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline into prolific Delaware Basin, one of the fastest growing plays in the U.S. The project is supported by long term dedicated NGL production from two third party natural gas processing plants which we estimate will produce up to 40,000 barrels per day. The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2018. Fees on this project are negotiated bundled rates at market based transportation and fractionation rates. Because this is an extension and expansion of an existing pipeline asset, we expect EBITDA multiples to be in the four to six times range better than our typical five to seven times. Additionally, the lateral is sized to allow for future growth beyond the initial two plants. We continue to discuss opportunities with numerous customers in the Delaware regarding potential contracts with more than ten new processing plants in the area. Terry that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks Kevin. I have just a couple of closing comments as it relates to our future growth projects before we take your questions. Following the West Texas LPG expansion announcement, we still continue to develop our unannounced inventory of potential capital growth projects. We've updated that inventory which is now between 2.5 billion and 3.5 billion compared with 1.5 billion to 2.5 billion previously. This inventory remains heavily focused on NGL infrastructure which we anticipate could be announced between now and 2020. We are expanding our existing businesses and continuing to focus on deploying capital prudently at attractive returns and in ways that will create value for our customers and investors. Finally I want to once again thank all of our employees for their continued hard work and their commitment to safe operations, our customers and the communities we operated in. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question will come from Shneur Gershuni from UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning, guys. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Shneur Gershuni : Just a couple of questions. Just to start off, I was wondering if you can talk about your CapEx funding strategy going forward, you tap the ATM this past quarter and I'm trying to understand is it more because you were during a blackout during the merger process and needed to get leverage in line post close and no longer expect to use it and use retain DCF or alternatively do you continue to plan using the ATM as a primary source of funding? Walter Hulse : Fortunately, there was no relation to the period of time between the announcement of merger and the closing of the merger. I think it's important to note that we've announced this 500 million or so of new growth projects since June and we wanted to use the ATM to make sure that we funded those because they were in addition to the CapEx that we had previously been discussing. So it was more of a getting ahead of the game and making sure that as we look at forward growth projects, we maintain a very strong balance sheet. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then secondly, the 500 million of identified CapEx for 2018, are there any other projects that you're very close to approving or moving forward with that could take the number materially in 2108 or is that kind of the run rate we should be thinking about? Terry Spencer : Well, I think you should always - this is Terry. I think you should always think about that, got this base run rate of kind of routine growth but we're continually working this backlog of new projects. And as contractual commitments and anchor customers come together, certainly we'll go forward and take those projects to our board. So we've got a number of projects that are in various stages of development, as those things those things mature like we've always said, we will not only - once we get those approve, our board will certainly go public with those. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And final question, you've had this forecast out there for dividend growth around the 10% range for several years going forward. How much capital you need to be investing in to achieve that growth rate over the next couple of years? Is it a couple 100 million, is it more you're running at last just kind of wondering what the cadence to being able to achieve that growth rate, operating leverage versus needing to invest capital? Walter Hulse : Sure Shneur. This is Walt. The dividend growth rate that was previously announced was supported by base growth CapEx in line with the past couple of years. New projects enhance these cash flows and will produce more free cash flow to reinvest in our business and maintain our strong balance sheet. Shneur Gershuni : Great. Thank you very much guys. Walter Hulse : Thank you. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet, JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : Terry, just want to pick up on one of your last comments there with regard to the upsize in the kind of growth project up evaluation last going up to 2.5 billion to 3.5 billion there. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on what specifically is driving that what's changed, sounds like this NGL pipeline is part of the driver there. But is there any more you can share as far as what basins or anything else in the market that evolve that you guys see as better opportunities now? Terry Spencer : Well, so certainly Jeremy at that at a high level what we're seeing certainly is core in NGL growth in the basin that we operate certainly in the Williston Basin we continue to grow. Their prospects as Kevin mentioned on the call, on his call remarks rather look great and continue to see strong development STACK and SCOOP. And certainly this recent announcement of West Texas is certainly an indicator of the opportunity that's in front of us there. So the bulk of the CapEx this increased CapEx in this unannounced backlog is going to be in the NGL segment and it will be in the form of pipeline loops, pumps, pipeline, infrastructure, potentially fractionation capacity that could be some storage in there possibly. So projects of that nature primarily what they consists of. Kevin, you got anything that you could add to that? Kevin Burdick : Just growth of our existing again significant growth of existing assets. Jeremy Tonet : That makes sense. Thanks. And then just another question on funding growth CapEx going forward, there's been kind of an increase use of hybrid securities out there and wondering how you think those STACK on versus the ATM when you walk into you know minimize dilution for future growth? Terry Spencer : Well, of course we will look at every opportunity that we have to fund the business going forward. We're pleased to be in a position with a very strong investment grade balance sheet and traditional capital access is something that we enjoy and it would probably be where we would lean more towards. But we'll say though that price of everything that's in the marketplace and evaluate whether as it fit into our cap structure or not. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thanks. And then just looking at the STACK and SCOOP, I just wondered if you could talk a little bit more about the dynamics there, it seems like STACK continues to have good opportunities moving forward the Canadian value there and knocks seems like it still on the back burner at this point, I was wondering if you could share any more on what you see there? Terry Spencer : Kevin can help you there? Kevin Burdick : Yeah Terry, again we excited about STACK and SCOOP. And I think our volume growth sequential quarter-to-quarters just shows that and just demonstrates some of the potential. On the G&P side, we do have the 200 million a day off load that we've got out there that's expected to be complete by the end of the year, so that's the first tranche of capacity. Then we've also got the Canadian Valley two expansion which we've announced. And beyond that our NGL segment with the footprint we've got in the STACK and the SCOOP there, there's a lot of other additional plants I think they just came out yesterday and announced a new plant that would be under our contract with them. So a lot of activity going on in the STACK and the SCOOP, producers have come out here, in just the last couple calls I've seen and talked about moving to kind of the full development program which just drives the efficiency of the rigs up. And so there's a lot of opportunity for us given our footprint in the STACK. Jeremy Tonet : Thanks for that. And then just last on the Bakken. On the processing side there, I was just wondered if you could update us and competitive dynamics you see in some other NLPs moving forward processing expansion such as Bear and others and I was just wondering if you could give us your latest thoughts there. Kevin Burdick : You know with the volumes that we have seen in the Williston, we probably especially as we moved into the third quarter and gotten past some of this maintenance, we're probably - excuse me into the fourth quarter and gotten pass some of the maintenance, we probably have 125 million a day of capacity left. So with the rig activity we're seeing and the well performance that we're seeing then clearly we could see additional processing capacity that we would need. Jeremy Tonet : Okay. Great. Thanks for that. That's it for me. Operator : And our next question comes from Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Hey, good morning, guys. I was just wondering what you've been hearing from producer customers in the Williston kind of heading into next year in terms of rig counts activity, you targeting about 400 wells here and 30 rigs it seems like that's about 27 days to complete a well which seems high. So do you expect the rig counts to taper off and if nothing changes is 400 a conservative number going forward or how do you think about all that? Kevin Burdick : Hi, Eric, this is Kevin. I got some thoughts and Mike Fitzgibbons may have a couple of thoughts as well. But our conversations with the producer customers continue to be very positive. The rig counts have held and we've seen some price strength here over the last few weeks. We see no indications that those rigs are going to back off. So yes if you maintain this activity level at 30 rigs, the 400 would be light as we think about 2018. Not ready to get out there with the guidance yet, we will do that as we as we release our financial guidance. But clearly you're right, the 2017 is high in and so we would expect the well connects to go off in 2018. Mike? Michael Fitzgibbons : I agree with that. The only thing I will add is we've had a couple of producers announced, they can achieve their volume growth target with less rigs because of the efficiency increases. So we may see a rig or two drop, but we're still seeing very productive wealth and forecast of volume growth from those rigs. Eric Genco : Great. And just one quick follow-up. I'm curious as you look out at the - I think it's sort of asked in couple different angles, but you got the 485 million to 495 million of projects since June and 40 million that is finished in 2017, sort of I guess the rest is overwhelmingly in 2018. Do you expect your overall debt balance, you debt today is at quarter end was around 9.5 billion, do you expect that to drop or do you meaningfully at all or do you think it hangs in there maybe drifts off a little as you have the EBITDA growth that sort of gets to the year leverage target? Kevin Burdick : Well, we're not going to give specific guidance 2018, but I would say that we do expect to have significant EBITDA growth that will help those levers statistics along in the most dramatic fashion. Eric Genco : Okay. So 9.5 billion is of net that is that - do you see it materially dropping over the course of the next year or no? Kevin Burdick : I think given level of our CapEx, we expect to see our deleveraging come more from the increase in EBITDA than a drop in that. Eric Genco : All right. Thank you. Kevin Burdick : Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital. Danilo Juvane : Good morning, everyone. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Danilo Juvane : I was looking at the - I want to go back to 2017 guidance. The G&P segment specifically the wave how strong the gathering perform this year would imply decline in 4Q, just to get to the high end of the guidance range there. So is seems that you've been a little bit conservative but not raising guidance in my opinion. Is there any other assets that we should be thinking about whether there be related to Harvey or maybe some of the ethane volumes that you had baked into your forecast they're going to be late end because of the outages in the Gulf Coast? Terry Spencer : No, I mean specific to your question about G&P, yeah when you do that math that where you get to. The one dynamic that we always at least consider as we're thinking about the fourth quarter for gathering and processing is weather, especially when you look at the month of December, we do historically see a little bit of a pullback of our volumes. So we do factor that in. I don't think we see any lingering effects related to Harvey from our business. As we've talked about we've seen it transitioning a little bit just overall we talk about the volume growth we have seen in October in our NGL segment. Clearly a decent chunk of that volume growth would be ethane which would since signaled that the ethane recovery story starting a little bit. So that's - I mean that's how I would frame up kind of how we're thinking about guidance in still holding that firm. Danilo Juvane : Thanks for that. And then with respect to growth CapEx, I think the previous guidance was $500 million for the year, thus far we've paid I think $250 million, so should we expect a big chunk in 4Q here or is that going to extend over into 2018? Terry Spencer : Yeah, we will - I mean yeah with that with the recent announcements obviously we're getting - we're hot and heavy into the construction on those projects that we've announced, so you would see that capital ramp up in the Q4. Danilo Juvane : Okay. Thank you, those are my questions. Terry Spencer : Yes. Thank you. Operator : .: Unidentified Analyst : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Unidentified Analyst : On the West Texas expansion project, could you elaborate a bit on the volume assumption on 4 to 6 times multiple expectation? Terry Spencer : Sure. As we think about those the - up to 40,000 barrels a day, it goes room service on the back half of 2018, we would expect that volume to ramp up maybe over a year to two, past in service date. Kevin Burdick : Right, within two years, we should be at or above 40,000. Unidentified Analyst : So the 4 to 6 time multiple the same as around 40,000 barrels a day volume? Terry Spencer : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And then on those new barrels, what type of fractionation opportunities are there potential with those go to third parties? Terry Spencer : Well the 40,000 that we referenced in the press release, we do have a bundle of service with them. We will be fracing those barrels. So it's a total package deal for us. The pipeline does give us the opportunities, we talk to more people to bring more volume on that and fractionated as well at or below multiples that we will see on this project. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Just to summarize the 4 to 6 times multiple expectation seems about 40,000 barrels a day of volumes including now fractionation fees? Terry Spencer : Yes. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That's helpful. And then obviously have excess capacity, how do you view the competitive landscape in the Permian for NGL take away increase the utilization of the expansion? Sheridan Swords : Brian, this is Sheridan. It's a very competitive landscape out there, but as we've said before with have an existing pipeline that we can incrementally add capacity to it to dial in to what the customer actually needs. We can do it much cheaper and faster than other pipelines, brand new pipelines that are coming in there. So we see ourselves being very competitive. And with this new expansion in here, we get this us into position that we can compete even better for these Delaware barrels. And we have been talked to multiple producers and processors out there in the short term before we announced this. And after we announced this, we've even had more come to us and want to get on this pipeline, we want to talk this about. So we're very excited what this bring to us and very excited about seeing more expansions come out. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. And for updates on the expansion, so obviously a lot of focus on your organic opportunities. As we moved into 2018, how do you see M&A playing overall in your growth? Terry Spencer : Well, certainly in our thinking we don't have any M&A factored in but we're always going to be thinking about those opportunities and certainly we've got a strong currency to work with, certainly, financially sound company. But I can tell you what our focus will be heavily organic and any M&A whether it's a bolt on asset or whether it's something even broader from a strategic perspective will certainly just be an opportunistic approach. So heavy organic will be the key strategy, key focus for 2018. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you, Terry. Operator : And our next question will come from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hey, good morning. Terry Spencer : Hey Michael. Michael Blum : Just one more question on West Texas the new pipeline project. I think you mentioned you're also be expanding the existing system, how much - if that's correct, how much you also expanding that by? Terry Spencer : Michael, we expanded by equally amount of 40,000. Michael Blum : Okay. So I guess since the extension line is 110, as you move above that 40,000 on the extension line, so that imply that you have to then probably further expand the mainline and I guess what is the capability to do that? Sheridan Swords : Michael, you're exactly right that you will have to continue to expand the mainline that's when we get into we can expand and spend that capital on the mainland as we get the commitments on the lateral coming in there. So we don't have to spend it all upfront, we can incremental life that capital in there. And as I said we expect those projects that we're working on now to expand the mainline to bring more volume in on the lateral will be in at or better than the 4 to 6 times that the original one is. We did put some upfront capital in there to put a bigger piece of pipe in the ground, so that we are better able to compete in the Delaware. Michael Blum : Okay. And then my other question was just this on the cadence of dividend increases as you go out in time, are you planning to do like one dividend increase per year or you planning to do every quarter, what's thought there? Walt Hulse : Well, Michael, obviously the board will address that on a quarterly basis, but our expectation would be to be in line with the past practice and most likely look at the quarterly and the board will evaluate the facts and circumstances each quarter and then act accordingly. Michael Blum : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : And our next question will come from Tom Abrams with Morgan Stanley. Tom Abrams : Thanks. What's left here, G&P strong margins in the quarter, can you just break that down a little bit on how much you might attribute in NGL prices and spreads versus fees? Kevin Burdick : Tom, this is Kevin. Yeah, it's again, we converted so much of our through the contract restructuring, we've moved so much of the commodity exposure to fee, it is primarily fee and when you combine that with our hedge position for 2017, virtually all that is just volume growth with the fee increase. Tom Abrams : Good. And then on the distribution, last question, not so much for 2018 but more for 2019, is the philosophy around issuing equity to make a 10% or so distribution growth when you want to strengthen your balance sheet, your capital spending is clearly very strong and the industry itself seems to be moving more toward that mid-single-digit type being acceptable for the larger companies. Just wonder how you've traded off those kinds of dynamics? Kevin Burdick : Well, we were in a position today were in this particular quarter, we cover the dividend by 1.3 times and we expect to have significant dividend coverage going forward which will give us a lot of excess cash flow to put back into the business and reinvest in the business. We as I said previously, the dividend growth that we had previously guided to was based on kind of the run rate dividend - run rate CapEx that we've been spending over the last couple years. So as we have these lot of multiple projects, we just expect to have even more cash flow to invest in the business going forward. Tom Abrams : All right. Thanks a lot and great quarter. Kevin Burdick : Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone. I just have a couple of operational questions. The Bakken G&P volumes were up but the NGL pipeline volumes were down sequentially. What went on there, was it just more ethane that was you tested versus last quarter? Terry Spencer : Yes, Christine, that was primarily around ethane and it also relates to the maintenance activities that we saw at our assets and how we had to move gas around and to continue to process as much of the gas as we possibly could. We did end up projecting more ethane than we had the previous quarter. In addition to that, another dynamic that was going on during the same time is our deethanizer at state line really ramped up during that time period. So the NGLs produced actually went up, but yet the NGLs we were pushing down the pipe went down a little bit. Christine Cho : So, if the NGL volumes were up but the pipeline volumes were down like where did the incremental NGLs go, do you guys have storage up there? Terry Spencer : No. it was - again it was primarily ethane that was rejected due to a lot of the maintenance and other activities that were going on. And then the ethane that's going through the deethanizer does end up in markets in Canada as well. Christine Cho : Okay. And then in your prepared remarks, you alluded to evaluating opportunities for providing additional takeaway out of the Bakken. Your 10-Q says that you're expecting to add capacity to the Bakken NGL line by third quarter of next year. And if you do that, don't you have to expand Overland Pass, I thought that was full, or if there are other alternatives? Sheridan Swords : Christine. This is Sheridan. Yes, we are looking at the total system both over the past and Bakken pipeline to look at all alternatives to expand it. But you are correct, Overland Pass is full, so any expansion on the Bakken pipeline will have to take into account takeaway from the bottom end and we're looking at all options. But all options to expand that system as we continue to see the robust growth in the Williston. Christine Cho : And that would have to be looping, I'm assuming? Sheridan Swords : There's a lot of different options there, it could be looping of the existence system or completely new system. Christine Cho : I see, okay. And with natural gas production increasing out of the Bakken, is the incremental residue gas still going down northern border, or do you guys have an idea of how much of the gas is going there? Sheridan Swords : Well, again physically all the gas out of the basin is virtually all of it is ultimately ending up on Northern border that ends up in the Mid-Continent the upper Midwest markets. So how it gets priced is really a separate from an acre prospective is really a little bit, it's a different question. But all the gas and we're confident that with the growth projections we see out there that we will continue to be able to move all the residue out of the region on board. Christine Cho : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Theodore Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Theodore Durbin : Good morning. I just wanted to verify, I think in your prepared remarks you said your NGL gathering volumes are up to 900,000 barrels a day in October, is that right? Terry Spencer : That's correct. Theodore Durbin : That's a big pickup versus what you did in third quarter, what's the driver there and can give us a breakdown of whether it's mostly mid corner which is come out of? Terry Spencer : Well, we're really seeing increasing in all of our regions. We talked about we talked about the Bakken barrels being down and now we're back up to those levels before. Mid-Continent volumes are up as well. A chunk of that is going to be ethane. As we have seen ethane recovery pick up during the month of October. We still think that will fluctuate a little bit when this come online and go through the startup. But again, we've seen some nice volume growth out of all the areas. Theodore Durbin : And is it fair to say the margins on that additional will be in line the sort of your rules of thumb $0.30 and $0.09 in that $0.03? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. There will be close. Typically we have a little bit of a breakdown for ethane, a little bit of an incentive, but it's going to be materially in the line of what we've given. Terry Spencer : Remember a lot of ethane's pipe come on is going to be value based barrel coming out in Mid-Continent which would be at a higher. Then the average rate that we have in our presentation because that has booked Conway and Bellevue and we talk about the Mid-Continent. So probably just slightly higher than that. Theodore Durbin : So Sheridan, it's fair to say that in many of your contracts, you have a structure slightly lower transportation and frac rate for ethane versus your propane plus? Sheridan Swords : That's exactly right. But we expect the Bellevue barrels to come out first which would be higher than the Conway price barrels. Theodore Durbin : Right. Okay that makes a lot of sense and it's really helpful. And then can you talk about the overall returns, I guess blended returns both on the let's call it $500 million of growth CapEx you have announced since June and as we think about that bigger chunk the $2.5 billion to $3.5 billion, what kind of the EBITDA multiple should we think about for both of those buckets, please? Walter Hulse : Well, I think you're going to see a lot of those projects in that unannounced backlog are going to be similar to the routine growth that we've seen historically. So you could see a good chunk of this coming in at 4 to 6 times but I think broadly speaking overall some of the larger infrastructure projects that are in that mix are going to be in your 5 to 7 times that we've historically indicated. Is that help you? Theodore Durbin : Yeah, it's helpful. And then last one for me, just operating costs look like they're up a decent amount here third quarter sort of year-over-year. Is that all just sort of new assets something like the rest of hurricane costs in there, what sort of a good new run rate on op costs or is there anything any kind of onetime items in there? Walter Hulse : Yeah the op costs are really just more of our growth in dealing with that. Yes, there was a little bit in there for the hurricane but again every quarter typically we will see some one time attributes. But I think that be - it would probably be a decent run rate as we think about going forward. Theodore Durbin : All right. That's it for me. Thank you. Walter Hulse : Thanks. Operator : And our next question will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Craig. Craig Shere : . : Terry Spencer : Well, as we - I mean yes, Craig you're right. We have seen an increase in spreads through the month of October. We do think there's some likelihood that those will kind of maintain for two to three months here or beyond that. On the flip side as our volumes do increase that will reduce a little bit the amount of volume we can actually move on the pipes as we physically are flowing more volume on our assets. So there's a little bit of a give and take there but yes it's nice to have that tailwind of the stronger spreads. Sheridan? Sheridan Swords : Yeah, I definitely agree. And you are very right, there is more of this ethane, and we talked about more volume growth. We will consume more of the pipeline for fee based business and that will leave less capacity for optimization activities. Craig Shere : Understood. And with respect to the 200 million was the excess LPG expansion, I guess 116 that's OKE. I think three years ago, the guidance was given that you are hoping to achieve on the original acquisition and you know follow-on this is including maybe 500 million of expected growth CapEx, you are expecting to achieve an all in 6 to 8 times multiple by the end of the decade. It seems like maybe the growth CapEx figures coming well under the 500 million you all envisioned years ago. Do you see that due to efficient but the EBITDA you know expectation would be untacked or how do you see that multiple playing out overtime. Walter Hulse : Craig, I still thing we still reach that by the end of the decade as we go through especially as we look at all the projects and all the plans that we are looking at right now and how that kind of drills. But we knew it will take us sometime when we bought the assets to get our strategy in place because lot of the plans that are coming on. When we first bough the assets, we are already committed, so we knew we had to wait for the second wave of gas plants have been built that were not committed, and that's where we all right now and we are finding that we can very effectively compete for these gas plants. And so I still think that we will reach that 6 to 8 times by the end of the decade. Craig Shere : Okay. And one last follow-on. I was under the impression that are original guidance did not corporate any additional upside from associated fractionation, does that continue to be the case and does a 4 to 6 times for 200 million project include or exclude related fractionation? Walter Hulse : We got to look at it, fractionation is - our fractionation system pulls from all across our assets and then we see growing to the whole things. So it all depends on when those fractionation capacity is needed. As we keep room like this, as Terry mentioned, we will probably end up happened to build more fractionation capacity and we will see the Permian is being able to help support that growth and we will get market rates for that. Craig Shere : But does that feed into the original multiple expectation for the West Texas acquisition you originally made? Walter Hulse : The original when we get that originally was more based on just pure cares and not the fractionation piece. Craig Shere : Okay, thank you. Operator : And our next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey, good morning, Terry. Terry Spencer : Hey, good morning, Chris. Chris Sighinolfi : Last think asked and answered. I appreciate all the color, except two follow-ups I could, there more sort of structure. I was just curious you know Bakken has done quite well this year, obviously the DAPL Pipeline was sitting out there for a long term, had a story history to get into service, but that is and we see a clear bit pricing at Permian, I was wondering your conversation with producer counterparts out there, how much the pipeline actually being in place in the pricing dynamic, if that all is shaping decisions and how long they might - how they see that I guess evolving overtime? Terry Spencer : I mean obviously with DAPL, it clearly anytime we can provide more pipeline takeaway capacity for crude, it benefits the producers from a reliability perspective and also just a net bag perspective. I mean, we typically hear their net bags are maybe 2 or 3 bucks better than they were before DAPL. So you know that's just increased strength and helping their cash flow to fund more drilling. Kevin Burdick : Certainly operational reliability has have improved significantly. Terry Spencer : Absolutely, I mean you know you can look at some of the state and in rail who is really taken it downward trend, so that clearly the pipe is going to be more reliable than rail. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay, that's helpful. And then I guess switching gears probably for share and just this is question to Michael Fitzgibbons. What is your expectation, have your guys looked at what happens with ethylene, polyethylene markets when we bring on this much same cracking capacity in the window of time, I am kind of blind what happens for their downstream and so I am just wondering if you could help us think about the effects of that and maybe what you're customers or are saying and thinking about it and if there's an opportunity for you to spend it on that into it? Terry Spencer : What I would tell you on what we look at Chris for that we hear from our customers on the polyethylene market, so they think that these crackers are going make ethylene but you're already seeing these companies bring on ethylene to polyethylene units. So you're really talking about where the ethylene is going. In worldwide, with the low cost of feedstock so we have the United States they're all saying the Gulf Coast crackers are much further to the left on the supply stack. So if we would overbuild and the world cannot consume that much polyethylene, you will see more the crackers and more east crackers being shut down, maybe some European crackers a long time before you see the Gulf Coast crackers shutdown. So that's why everybody - that's why you are seeing the next wave of crackers being talked about on the Gulf Coast, because this is the most advantage place today to build crackers due to the cost to feed stocks. Chris Sighinolfi : So the multiyear view then is I guess if I were to paraphrase, it is something similar to what we've seen with other our hydrocarbons where U.S. markets simply because of advantage cost structure pushes out higher costs like globally and so we're basically going to make inroads via exports that's the expectation? Terry Spencer : That's right. You're exactly right. Chris Sighinolfi : And if I could, I don't know if you know the answer but are there particular foreign markets we could pay attention to it, maybe get a sense of from where that demand or where that supply competition is going to be most I guess most severe? Terry Spencer : Well, I think from a demand side, you're going to see the growth from China and India. We also see some from Latin America and maybe a little bit from Europe but China and India are going to be the big movers on the demand side. Competition\u2026 Chris Sighinolfi : No, no that's\u2026 Terry Spencer : You said on a competition for supply. I think it's a big - don't think it's going to affect that is the gas to oil ratio, if you would see oil and gas on the BTU basis come back closer together and it would become more advantage you may see that would I think where you would see on supply. We are seeing, it depends on how you look at supply competition, obviously we are exploiting propane and ethane which are going to crackers that would compete against polyethylene, against our polyethylene this mean produced in United States, but that still pull hydrocarbon through our system and now the United States. Chris Sighinolfi : Right. And so I guess the next wave, I guess this is the instant question for me is that if we're seeing the next wave of ethylene crackers that talked about to be built domestically. It would seem like that communities making a determination that the facility better exists here then to export the ethane to whatever foreign market there? Is that - I guess is that fair or is there something about the nature of all this and I don't understand? Terry Spencer : I think it's a combination you're seeing, where we're seeing in most of the people that want to export ethane for cracking or even propane for cracking are really in India and China and I think they want to build their own facilities over there and get advantage of feed stock from United States. The big the - people that are building the next wave of crackers are the ones that built the first wave, they're going to be obviously already heard about the Exxon Mobil Saavik cracker down the Corpus Cristi that's been announced there's and all the other people are also talking about when do they build their next cracker and all of them are saying it's probably going to be in the Gulf Coast. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. Great. I know unrelated to third quarter, but it always good to get your thoughts on market structure over time, so appreciate it. Terry Spencer : Thanks Chris. Operator : And that thus conclude today's question-and-answer session. At this time, I will turn the conference back to management for any additional or closing remarks. Terry Spencer : Okay. Well, thank you everyone. Our quite period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until earnings are released after the market closes in late February. Have a great rest of your day. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this just concludes today's conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today's call is being recorded. At this time I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Avenee, and good morning everyone and welcome to ONEOK's fourth quarter 2017 and year-end earnings conference call. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in any forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me today's call are Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs, Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. And the Senior Vice President of our business segments, also are available for questions. On this call, we will focus on fourth quarter and year end 2017 financial results. And provide some additional cover on our strategic and accretive growth projects including our recently announced Arbuckle II Pipeline, MB-4 Fractionator and Demicks Lake projects. We've previously provided 2018 guidance in January. 2017 was an important year for ONEOK. We completed the ONEOK and ONEOK Partners merger transaction in June. And the benefits of that transaction are paying off to ONEOK and its shareholders, particularly as we invest more than $4 billion in strategic expansions over our existing integrated network of pipelines, plants, fractionation and storage facilities with more favorable access to the financial markets as a result of the merger and our continued focus on generating attractive returns. That was proven by extremely successful traditional equity offerings in early January that pre-funded that projects that we have recently announced. From an operations perspective in 2017, I again want to thank our employees who personally endured Hurricane Harvey and countless others who worked tirelessly to keep our assets running safely in order to provide reliable services to our customers not only during the hurricane but every day. The dedication and commitment of all our employees to this company is remarkable and I very much appreciate their hard work in making our company successful. Moving onto our 2017 performance, for the fourth quarter and for the full year of producer activity in production results drove the volume growth in all our business segments throughout our operating footprints which led to an adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow growth. The recent completion of two world scale petrochemical crackers will continue to increase demand for ethane in the Gulf Coast, as these facilities complete their startup activities. In addition four more crackers with a total capacity of nearly 200,000 barrels per day of ethane are expected to be completed later this year. As outlined in our 2018 guidance, this additional demand for ethane is expected to drive approximately $100 million of additional EBITDA in our NGL segment compared with 2017. After staying for a few years now that new petrochemical facilities and ethane crackers are being built, it is now evident in the marketplace that the incremental demand for ethane is here. Our focus remains on executing our cracker growth projects to meet the need of our customers at Williston, Powder River, DJ STACKS SCOOPS and Permian basins. Over the last decade, ONEOK experienced operations, constructions and commercial teams successfully executed $9 billion in capital investments, aggregating supply and delivering into the market safely, reliably in an environmentally responsible manner. With that I will now turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's 2017 operating income totaled nearly $1.4 billion and adjusted EBITDA totaled nearly $2 billion. 30% increases compared with 2016 and more than 25% increase compared with 2015. All driven primarily by strong volume growth and we expect to see that growth continuing with adjusted EBITDA increasing more than 15% for 2018 compared with 2017. Distributable cash flow was nearly $1.4 billion in 2017 and dividend coverage of more than 1.3x, was well above our guidance of 1.2x or greater for the year. This month we paid a quarterly dividend of $0.77 per share or $3.08 per share on an annualized basis. The 25% increase compared with the same period in 2017. Management still expects to recommend dividend increases of 9% to 11% annually and maintain our target for annual dividend coverage of 1.2x or greater. As noted in our earnings release, fourth quarter net income included $141 million of one-time non-cash charges related to the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which impacted fourth quarter earnings per share by $0.36 and full year earnings per share by $0.47. We view the overall impact from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act as positive to ONEOK due to the lower corporate tax rate and the immediate expansion of most of our capital spending. As Terry mentioned, we have announced more than $4 billion of new capital growth projects since June. These interactive investments are expected to generate adjusted EBITDA on multiples of 4x to 6x and are backed by a combination of long-term fee-based contracts, volume commitments or acreage dedications. Based on these recent projects announcements ONEOK's 2018 capital growth expenditures are now expected to range from nearly $2 billion to $2.3 billion, an increase of approximately $700 million compared with our initial 2018 guidance. Maintenance capital guidance remains unchanged to $140 million to $180 million. We have talked quite a bit about the funding of this highly accretive growth projects and how we essentially pre-funded our equity needs. In the fourth quarter, we received net proceeds of $384 million through ATM equity program and completed a $1.2 billion public common stock offering in January, resulting in total combined net proceeds of approximately $1.6 billion. With the expected significant cash generated from operations and excessive dividends, and ample borrowing capacity, we don't expect to issue any equity in 2018 or well into 2019. Following the equity offering in January ONEOK's pro forma debt to EBITDA on last 12 months basis improved to just under 4x and put us at our target a year earlier than we expected. We expect our leverage to increase modestly during the later stages of construction but we continue to view four times or less, as an important target for ONEOK in long term. Our anticipated EBITDA growth in 2018 will enable us to fund our growth with excess cash flow from operations and short and long term debt, while maintaining strong credit metrics. As it relates to review of rates on West Texas LPG, the regulatory process continues and it will resolve itself in due course. Our 2018 NGL segment financial guidance encompasses a range of potential outcomes for the rig division. The midpoint of NGL segment adjusted EBITDA guidance does not assume any uplift from potential rate increase. As we said previously, the outcomes of which will not impact our current or future negotiated rates of West Texas LPG nor will it hinder our ability to secure new NGL supply from producers and processors including the project which extends West Texas LPG into the core of Delaware basin. As we continue to actively negotiate with producers in the Permian for additional capacity. Now I will turn the call over to Kevin for closer look at each of our business segments and to provide to some additional color on our growth projections. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Starting with the performance of our Natural Gas Liquid segment. 2017 was another year of strong volume growth setting us up well for even greater growth in 2018. Fourth quarter 2017 NGL volumes gathered averaged 867,000 barrels per day, a 7% increase compared with the third quarter 2017. And a 17% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2016. Higher overall raw feed volumes on our Mid-Continent and West Texas LPG pipeline drove the sequential quarter increases with Mid-Continent volumes increasing more than 9% during that timeframe. Mid-Continent growth continues to be driven by strong producer results in STACK and SCOOP areas. Our Bakken NGL pipeline is operating at full capacity as volumes averaged 136,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter 2017. Our recently announced Elk Creek pipeline project will alleviate NGL capacity constraints out of the Rocky Mountain region once complete. And we expect to use our rail transport capabilities as early as second quarter 2018 to provide the necessary takeaway for expected volume growth until Elk Creek is in service. NGL volumes fractionated in fourth quarter 2017 increased 13% compared with the third quarter 2017 driven by higher gathered volumes across our NGL systems, and lower volumes fractionated in the third quarter due to impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Volume that could not be fractionated during the third quarter because of the hurricane were stored and fractionated in the fourth quarter. Our NGL volumes were in line with our guidance range even with petrochemical cracker completion delay and the impacts from Hurricane Harvey. Moving onto the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We exceeded our 2017 financial guidance expectations due to the strong producer results in Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. The segment's fourth quarter 2017 average natural gas gathered and processed volumes increased 20% compared with the same period in 2016. Fourth quarter volumes processed increased 5% compared with the third quarter 2017 averaging nearly 1.7 billion cubic feet per day across our system. Williston Basin volumes processed again established new highs with an average of more than 870 million cubic feet per day during the fourth quarter. Mid-Continent processed volumes average more than 790 million cubic feet per day, a 6% increase compared with the third quarter 2017. We exceeded our well connection expectations for 2017 in both the Williston Basin and Mid-Continent, connecting 430 and 113 wells respectively. And we expect to connect approximately 650 wells total in 2018, a nearly 20% increase from last year. In the Williston Basin, continued producer activity, improving well performance and higher gas to oil ratios are driving volumes growth. Analysis of recent well results shows 25 to 30 rigs to date can produce as much natural gas volumes as 70 to 80 rigs three years ago. With now only 100 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity on our systems, our recently announced Demicks Lake processing plant will provide producers in the region with much needed processing capacity to accommodate growth expectations. Volumes growth in the Mid-Continent in the fourth quarter 2017 was driven by strong producer results in the STACK and SCOOP areas which led to a 6% increase in natural gas volumes processed compared with the third quarter 2017. Our third party offload is operational which provides us access to an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity for our growing volumes in the STACK, and we are on track to add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity in the fourth quarter of this year with the expansion of our Canadian Valley plant. Once complete, we will have an approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in Oklahoma. In the natural gas pipeline segment, 2017 adjusted EBITDA increased 9% compared with 2016. The segment continues to benefit from higher fee-based earnings and increased transportation capacity contracted. The segment continues discussions with producers in Permian basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas to accommodate additional natural gas takeaway capacity given the strong growth expectations in those splits. Recent tax reform laws have spurred conversation around potential impacts for regulated pipelines. For ONEOK, since most of our natural gas pipeline contracts have been established through shipper specific negotiated rates and settlements, we don't anticipate adjustments to rates solely because of lower tax rates. Related to rate settlements on February 23, Northern Border Pipeline received a letter order from the FERC approving their uncontested rate case settlement without modifications. Now let's take a closer look at our recently announced capital growth projects and how these latest projects complement and enhance our previously announced investments. This year we have announced two strategic NGL pipeline projects, Elk Creek and Arbuckle II. The 530 mile Arbuckle II pipeline will have an initial capacity of 400,000 barrels per day and has the capability to be expanded up to one million barrels per day with additional pump facilities which could more than double our current capacity between the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast with minimal capital investment. We are also adding 125,000 barrels per day of additional fractionation capacity at Mont Belvieu with the announcement of our MB-4 fractionator. The Arbuckle II pipeline is already more than 50% contracted and will provide producers in all the basins where we operate with connectivity to growing demand in Mont Belvieu. The adjusted EBITDA are multiple forecasted for these projects are based only from these contracts and discussions with customers regarding additional supply continue to take place. The MB-4 fractionator is already fully contracted and both projects are expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. Our Demicks Lake Plant will add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in Williston Basin bringing ONEOK's total capacity in the region to more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in the fourth quarter 2019. Additionally, we are in the permitting process for an expansion of our Bear Creek processing facility that we expect could add 40 to 60 million cubic feet per day of capacity with minimal capital. NGLs from the Demicks Lake Plant will ultimately feed our Elk Creek pipeline which in turn will connect with ONEOK's extensive Mid-Continent NGL gathering system which provides connectivity from the Williston Basin to the Gulf Coast. A quick update on our Elk Creek pipeline announced in early January. We continue to have discussions with producers and processors to secure additional supply out of the Rocky's region. And our outlook now exceeds our original volume expectations by 10% to 20%. We continue to proactively communicate with landowners, state and local agencies and other stakeholders along the pipeline route and expect to be given construction later this year. All of these strategic attractive return projects will work together to provide much needed solutions for producers and position ONEOK with considerable long-term operating leverage across our integrated network of assets. Terry that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks Kevin. Before we take questions, I have got a couple of items to point out. As I mentioned earlier in my remarks ONEOK's will like to focus on executing on our $4 billion announced growth projects over the next several year. So which will take us to 2020? As we look beyond 2020, I'll go ahead and answer questions, some of you maybe wanting to ask and that is what's next. As Kevin detailed, many of our projects are being designed with the ability to expand immediately with minimal capital investments. And we'll continue to develop opportunities and in our under our asset footprint to expand even further. Whether that is to pipelines, processing plants, fractionators or storage. All of which we proven, we don't have to manage, build operate and optimize. So with that operator we're now ready for questions.

Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. On this call, we will focus on our first quarter financial results and operating performance and provide our perspective about the recent FERC announcements related to natural gas and NGL pipelines. But before we dive in, I\u2019d like to start where we left off on our fourth quarter call, which is our $4 billion plus of announced organic growth projects. As you may recall, I was clear that the next couple of years will be about executing on these growth projects, and we\u2019re making good progress so far. On the natural gas liquids side, we continue to work with landowners, state and local agencies and other stakeholders along the pipeline routes for Elk Creek and Arbuckle II, and we expect to begin construction later this year on both projects. Within the last couple of weeks, pipe for Elk Creek started being delivered, a big step closer to actual construction. We plan to start construction with the southern part of Elk Creek first in the third quarter as this action would allow barrels from the Powder River Basin to flow on Elk Creek before the entire line is complete, which could free up capacity on the Bakken NGL Pipeline for additional barrels from the Williston Basin. The southern section would be in service as early as the third quarter of 2019. Additionally, our MB-4 fractionator is permitted and we expect construction to begin this month. On the natural gas gathering and processing side, expansions of our Canadian Valley and Bear Creek plants and construction of the Demicks Lake plant are progressing on schedule. Kevin will discuss these projects in more detail shortly. Increased ethane recovery and Mid-Continent volume growth remained key drivers of our 2018 guidance. And so far this year, we\u2019ve seen both. STACK and SCOOP of volumes on our system continue to meet or exceed our expectations, and demand for ethane continues to ramp up with additional ethane crackers coming on line this quarter. With that, I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK\u2019s first quarter operating income totaled nearly $420 million, a 30% increase year-over-year and a 6% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2017. First quarter adjusted EBITDA was $570 million, a 24% increase year-over-year and a 4% increase compared with fourth quarter 2017. During the first quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.77 per share and in April announced another 3% increase to $0.795 per share or $3.18 per share on an annualized basis, which is payable on May 15th. We generated more than $115 million of distributable cash flow in excess of our dividends paid in the first quarter. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $430 million, with healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4 times. In January, we successfully completed a $1.2 billion equity offering, pre-funding a significant portion of our more than $4 billion capital growth program. At March 31, our debt-to-EBITDA on a trailing 12-month basis was 3.8 times. On an annualized run-rate basis, we are 3.5 times. As we said previously, we expect our leverage to increase modestly as we move through the construction cycle on the larger capital growth projects we\u2019ve announced this year. But we continue to view leverage of 4 times or less as an important target for ONEOK over the long term. We expect to fund our capital growth projects through excess cash flow from operations and ample borrowing capacity while maintaining our strong credit metrics. We ended the quarter with no outstanding commercial paper and nearly the full $2.5 billion available on our credit facility. Since December 31, we\u2019ve decreased total debt outstanding by $1 billion. ONEOK\u2019s strong liquidity offers us financial flexibility and the ability to repay current debt maturities with cash from operations and short-term debt or to opportunistically access the long-term debt markets. We are maintaining our financial guidance expectations for 2018 and continue to expect no need to issue equity in 2018 and well into 2019, if at all. Before I turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update, let\u2019s briefly discuss the March FERC announcements and potential impact to ONEOK. First, related to interstate natural gas transportation pipelines, which represent only slightly more than 5% of our total 2018 adjusted EBITDA. A couple of key points. Most of ONEOK\u2019s natural gas pipeline demand charge contracts have been established through shipper-specific negotiated rates and settlements and are not based on cost of service calculations. Additionally, as a corporation, ONEOK is a taxable entity. So, any taxable allowance adjustments on cost of service rates would reflect an adjustment to the newer lower corporate tax rate, not an elimination of the tax allowance. From a regulatory timeline perspective, we do have a couple of interstate pipelines with upcoming rate cases, including Viking, which is required as part of its previously negotiated rate settlement to put in place new rates by January of 2020. Midwestern, which is currently undergoing a routine FERC-initiated Section 5 rate review, with any changes in rates being prospective only. Guardian has negotiated rates for virtually all of its firm capacity through 2022. And Northern Border Pipeline recently implemented new FERC approved settlement rates. We do not expect the ultimate outcome of any of these matters to materially impact our financial results. Moving on to FERC regulated natural gas liquids pipelines. There is still quite a bit of uncertainty as to how changes related to tax policy may be applied or what adjustments may be made related to indexing during FERC\u2019s next five-year review. We\u2019ve taken a close look at our NGL pipelines that could potentially see some impact from indexing adjustments. A key item to understand about ONEOK is that the vast majority of volumes transported on our NGL pipelines are at negotiated rates, which we expect would see very little impact from a change in indexing. We expect that a 100 basis-point change to the FERC index rate would have an annualized impact to ONEOK\u2019s revenue of less than $2.5 million. We feel this hypothetical provides a good look at what could happen in a downside scenario. And we expect the impact will be immaterial. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Starting with the performance of our natural gas liquids segment. First quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 23% year-over-year and 11% compared with the fourth quarter 2017. NGL volumes gathered in the first quarter averaged 855,000 barrels per day, a 12% increase compared with the first quarter 2017 volumes and relatively flat compared with the fourth quarter 2017. Year-over-year growth was primarily driven by increased volumes in the STACK and SCOOP areas of the Mid-Continent, a trend that we expect to continue throughout 2018. Winter weather impacted first quarter volumes relative to the fourth quarter, but we\u2019ve since seen volumes pick up in April. Volumes on our West Texas LPG system reached more than 200,000 barrels per day on several occasions in April, and system-wide NGL gathered volumes reached more than 900,000 barrels per day on multiple days during the month. NGL volumes in the Mid-Continent are materializing at or above our expectations at this point in the year, driven by strong producer results in the STACK and the SCOOP. In the Williston Basin, our Bakken NGL Pipeline remains full, and we continue to expect to begin transporting additional NGL volumes by rail in the second quarter 2018 to provide interim takeaway capacity until Elk Creek is in service. NGL volumes fractionated averaged more than 690,000 barrels per day during the first quarter, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year and a 2% increase compared with last quarter. Ethane volumes on our system have increased approximately 50,000 barrels per day in the first quarter 2018 compared with the same period in 2017. Our reported ethane rejection levels may look relatively unchanged year-over-year. However, this comparison is affected by our 12% increase in NGL volumes gathered since the first quarter 2017. A portion of this increased volume is attributable to ethane recovery. We are seeing increased demand from newly operational petrochemical facilities and exports, and we expect demand to continue to ramp up through the remainder of the year as recently completed crackers operate at full rates and additional facilities are completed later in the year. Higher optimization and marketing activities in the first quarter also contributed to the segment\u2019s adjusted EBITDA increases, resulting in approximately $25 million increases, both year-over-year and sequential quarter-over-quarter. Wider NGL location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu and the sale of NGL inventory previously held contributed to the increases. We expect wider spreads between Conway and Mont Belvieu to continue until our Arbuckle II goes into service as growing volumes from new production consume available transportation capacity between the two market centers. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 26% year-over-year, driven by volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. Adjusted EBITDA decreased approximately 9% compared with the fourth quarter 2017 due primarily to higher third-party processing costs, weather impacts in both of our regions, and temporary system constraints in Oklahoma due to the volume growth. These higher weather-related costs were isolated and are not expected to continue. A key metric for the quarter was our volume growth. Average natural gas volumes processed in the first quarter 2018 were more than 1.7 billion cubic feet per day, a 24% increase compared with the first quarter 2017 and a 3% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2017. Volume growth compared with the fourth quarter was primarily driven by increased STACK and SCOOP volumes, where processed volume averaged 845 million cubic feet per day during the quarter, a more than 6% increase from the fourth quarter and our highest volumes processed to-date in the Mid-Continent. We connected 112 wells in the Williston Basin and 35 wells in the Mid-Continent during the first quarter. We continue to expect approximately 650 total well connections in 2018. We have approximately 75 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity in Oklahoma, including the 200 million cubic feet per day offload that is fully in service. And we will add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity in the fourth quarter 2018 with the completion of our Canadian Valley plant expansion. Available processing capacity in the Williston Basin is approximately 125 million cubic feet per day currently, but this will be reduced with the return of warmer weather and additional well connections. We\u2019re in the process of expanding our Bear Creek plant and related infrastructure, and expect the initial expansion to 130 million cubic feet per day from 80 million cubic feet per day to be complete in the third quarter of 2018. This expansion will require no additional capital at the plant and minimal capital for additional field compression. Additionally, our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake plant is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2019. In the natural gas pipelines segment, first quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 13% year-over-year and 6% compared with the fourth quarter 2017, primarily benefiting from higher interruptible transportation volumes and increased storage services. The segment this month completed its 100 million cubic feet per day westbound expansion of our ONEOK Gas Transportation system, and we continue to have discussions with producers in the Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas to accommodate additional natural gas takeaway capacity, given the strong growth expectations in those plays. As for the general market conditions, producer activity across our operating footprint remains strong. In the Williston Basin, our customers continue to experience production increases resulting from drilling and completion improvements, which is causing more of the play to have strong economics, specifically further south and west in McKenzie County and further north in Williams County. ONEOK has substantial acreage dedications in both of these counties. In the STACK and SCOOP areas, it\u2019s a similar story. Producers continue to test various drilling and completion techniques and different formations to determine what provides the best results. The volumes we\u2019re seeing on our system so far this year from the STACK and SCOOP areas are extremely positive and have met or exceeded our expectations at this point. This continued activity gives us confidence in our volume growth outlook across our operations. Terry already touched on our growth projects and construction progress. But in addition, we continue active discussions with producers and processors for additional commitments on our announced projects. We\u2019ve contracted an additional 40,000 barrels per day on our Arbuckle II, a 20% increase in contracted volumes since the project was announced in February. We\u2019ve also seen a 20% increase of committed volumes on Elk Creek since it was announced, with more than 120,000 barrels per day now contracted. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks Kevin for that really good and thorough update. Before we take your questions, I think it\u2019s important to mention the Western Oklahoma wildfires. Although the fires had a minimal impact to our facilities, the fires did affect and caused hardship for several of our employees. Some employees experienced significant damage to their homes, buildings or to their farm and ranch lands. Fortunately, last week, rainfall soaked the region and helped firefighters contain the wildfires, which have charred almost 550 square miles. I want them to know that we\u2019re thinking about them as they recover and rebuild. Much work lies ahead for those impacted by the fires. And ONEOK is here to help by making resources available to those employees in need of assistance. To our investors, thank you for your continued support of ONEOK. And as always, thank you to our employees for your hard work and continued dedication to operating our assets safely and environmentally responsibly. So, with that, operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We will go first to Eric Genco with Citi. Eric Genco : Good morning, guys. You\u2019ve talked in the past about Mid-Con processing each 200, and that plant produces roughly 20,000 to 25,000 barrels a day of NGLs. Can you just remind me what\u2019s a decent rule of thumb for the Bakken, even if we were to assume full ethane rejection. Kevin Burdick : Eric, it\u2019s Kevin. If you assume full ethane rejection, you\u2019re probably talking in that same range. Eric Genco : Okay. So, I\u2019m just think about this now. I was looking back, a year ago, I mean, the Bakken pipeline was basically full a year ago. And if you look at the statewide data February to February, year-over-year, it\u2019s almost a 400 a day increase -- Mcf a day increase. So, basically, the simple math of that would suggest that there is another 50,000 barrels a day. So, I\u2019m just trying to put this in the context. If you need to get to 100,000 a day on Elk Creek, are you basically with what must be being railed out of the basin now? Are you basically half way there with your targeted returns? Kevin Burdick : First, we\u2019re not railing today. So, the pipeline\u2019s been able to run a little above nameplate. So, that\u2019s out there. The numbers last year did have some additional -- if you remember, had some additional ethane included in those barrels for our spec due to specification issues downstream. So, we\u2019ve since been able to back some of that ethane out and replace it with C3 Plus as we\u2019ve had other additional ethane come on from other parts that are flowing in to the Mid-Continent frac assets. But, where you\u2019re going with, as we continue to rail and you look at the available capacity we\u2019ve got and you look at the Demicks Lake plant that we\u2019ll be adding, the Bear Creek expansion, yes, if you start doing the math on that, we are a long ways down the road as those assets fill up to meet the commitments and to meet the numbers we\u2019ve provided for Elk Creek. Eric Genco : I guess, maybe switching a bit. I just want to ask, I know you have the question fairly regular but around ethane and NGL exports more broadly. If you look at your asset portfolio, you are probably the largest player without an export terminal in-house. And recognizing that your molecules can still get the docks today, still potential margin opportunity. How aggressively would you be pursuing in other export terminal? We saw another player announced a JV, someone came in on an ethane terminal? Is that something you are after or could be there what would be a structure for that that might be interesting? Terry Spencer : Yes. Eric, this is Terry. So, we\u2019ve been thinking about exports for many years. And so, we\u2019ve been very actively engaged in developing opportunities. We came real close a few years ago with an opportunity that would have involved the third-party JV partner. It didn\u2019t materialize as the economics eroded significantly. We continue to work the exports side. Most likely if we did put an export project together, it probably would involve a potential JV. It could involve existing facilities that are already in place that need to be modified, and it could consist of just a completely grassroots new facility. But we do and continue to remain very interested in having exports -- export capability. It\u2019s not absolutely essential that we have it because we have international relationships in markets and market access today. But to your point, it\u2019s a good solid, fee-based business that would be a nice bolt-on added to our service capabilities. So, yes, we continue to remain highly interested and continue to be very active in that regard. Operator : We will go next to Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Just maybe to stick on the whole ethane thesis for a bit. There is sort of a broader thesis out there about the Permian tightness for capacity to evacuate natural gas out of the basin, could incentivize more recovery of ethane in the Permian at the expense of other basins. Is that incorporated into your ethane recoveries? You had a bigger number this quarter, but you still got into a lower number. I\u2019m just trying to square the circle here. Kevin Burdick : Shneur, this is Kevin. As we look at ethane recovery, our premisses haven\u2019t changed. And when we still are confident in the numbers we see coming out, yes, you are seeing some downward pressure on basis, on gas basis in the Permian. But, by and large, we believe the vast majority of ethane is already -- is already being recovered out of the Permian. So, how much incremental ethane can continue to come out? I don\u2019t know that -- I don\u2019t think that changes our point of view that we are still going to see ethane come out in the Mid-Continent, given the demand we are seeing, we\u2019ve seen come on line, and the demand we expect to come on line the remainder of the year. Sheridan? Sheridan Swords : One thing I\u2019ll add is we\u2019re also seeing some pressure on Mid-Con and gas prices as well, which is making ethane to be extracted and Mid-Con very competitive with Permian. Shneur Gershuni : Okay, fair enough. And then, sort of continuing on the Permian gas theme. Roadrunner, is that an option that you guys can flip or do something with is kind of a response to what\u2019s going on in the Permian? Terry Spencer : Yes. We\u2019re in active discussions with several companies out there to utilize our WesTex system and also the Roadrunner system to potentially move gas bidirectionally. So, connections to potentially move gas to the west to the El Paso and Mexico markets or back to the East, back to the Waha market on Roadrunner. Similarly, with the WesTex intrastate system, lot of conversations of potentially some services around the Waha hub and also looking at bidirectional capabilities to take gas out of Waha back to the north, up to other interstate markets in the Texas Panhandle and Western Oklahoma. So, a lot of activity going on with our commercial team on the gas pipeline side. And obviously as we get some of those inked up and we may make some announcements. Shneur Gershuni : Let\u2019s say you, FID a decision given the various options you\u2019re looking at, how long would that actually take to execute? Terry Spencer : I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t catch the first part. Kevin Burdick : How long. These projects are very low capital, very quick timeframes. We\u2019re talking weeks or months, not years. This is install some compression, maybe you have to install little piping and we\u2019re done. Operator : Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Last time the Belvieu-Conway spread was wide, [ph] you guys had a decent amount of capacity for your proprietary use. Last quarter, you said Sterling was about 60% to 70% utilized. So, I think that leaves 130, 140,000 barrels a day open. I\u2019m guessing some of that is expected for the ethane extraction that you\u2019re expecting and some of that\u2019s for just general growth in Oklahoma production. If ethane rejection doesn\u2019t fall from 140,000 to 70,000 barrels per day by year-end, does that mean you essentially have 70,000 barrels per day that you could use for optimization? Just trying to figure out how we should think about the impact of wider spread for you. Sheridan Swords : I think, you\u2019re looking at it right. To the extent that ethane does not come out, that does leave us more opportunity for optimization. We\u2019re seeing volume growth today that\u2019s probably pushing our Sterling system to the 80 to 90% range. And then, also, one thing we are seeing today is also we\u2019re moving more wide grade onto the bigger line the Sterling III line if we can\u2019t utilize all the capacity. So, we get a little bit of a degradation there. So, there is no doubt. If the ethane doesn\u2019t come out, these spreads are staying wide, optimization will more than cover that shortfall. Christine Cho : Okay. And then, one of your competitors who is currently building a pipeline in Taxes, announced that it\u2019s also going to be building a line to connect to their plants in the Mid-Con. Should we think that there is a potential for volumes to come off your line in the future, or is this more of an opportunity cost and that volume from their future plants will likely be going down that line? Terry Spencer : Yes. That pipeline is connected into -- will connect into a plant that\u2019s currently on our system. So, we will probably see about 20,000 barrels a day come off our system later this year. But, I think that will be the extent of it. As Kevin mentioned in his statements earlier that we\u2019ve already contracted more volumes in the Mid-Continent and part of that is in the Arkoma. [ph] So, we did not see that we -- will prevent us from continuing to secure plant commitments in that area. Christine Cho : And then, do you expect the change in flaring rules in the Bakken to impact you guys at all, on the G&P front? Kevin Burdick : Christine, it\u2019s Kevin. No, we don\u2019t. Historically, our flaring has been well below the -- has been at or below the state flaring capture targets and we\u2019ve been below the statewide averages. So, we get to the wells in a timely manner with the capacity we have available right now and the expansions and the new plant we are talking about. We still feel good that we will be able to stay ahead of those targets. And we don\u2019t necessarily think the new regulations will have any impact on us. Chuck? Chuck Kelley : I think, the only thing I\u2019d add to that is with flaring rules going from 14 to 60 days for the producer, as Kevin said, we connected these pads and these wells very quickly that extra 46 days, it\u2019s not even an impact to us because we typically out there tied it already. Christine Cho : And then, lastly, I basically remember you guys awarding one share to all of your employees every time the stock hits an all-time high. You guys aren\u2019t that far off from high. The next time this happens, what\u2019s the impact on G&A? Walt Hulse : I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve actually provided that estimate in the past. So, I\u2019m not going to provide it now. But I\u2019m hoping that\u2019s a problem. Operator : We will go next to Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish : I\u2019m sure you are aware that ethylene margins have declined. Just curious on your thoughts on this. And whether you see this as just a temporary risk or a longer-term issue? Terry Spencer : Praneeth, I think broadly, it\u2019s a temporary issue. And Sheridan can give you some more color. Sheridan Swords : I think, the big thing you need to look at is -- and you heard other companies say the same thing is if you look at the ethane to polyethylene spreads, they are significantly wider now than they were a year ago. And that\u2019s really what these correctors are looking at what the fundamentals are. So, we are still seeing great -- it looks like there is great demand for polyethylene out there. So, I think you are really talking about is temporary phenomenon at this time. Praneeth Satish : And you have some excess ethylene inventory? Sheridan Swords : We came in and at the last we heard we came in, the crackers came in with little excess inventory, they just need to get to derivative units ramped up to hit this point out. So, I think you are seeing it\u2019s going to be cleaned up the next couple of months, the next couple of months to quarters. Praneeth Satish : And then, can you just talk about where you stand on gas takeaway in the Bakken with respect to BTU limits, so I guess the Northern Border? And then, tied to that question, if we are hitting limits, could we start to see meaningful ethane recovery out of the Bakken on Elk Creek? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. We still feel good about where we\u2019re at right now with the residue going into Northern Border. We are not seeing any downstream impacts. Now, as we have talked about that, yes, if you continue to push higher BTU content into Northern Border and it\u2019s displacing dryer Canadian or lower BTU Canadian gas, then you could get to the point where you would see some downstream impacts. But, we don\u2019t see that happening in the next couple years. But, that\u2019s going to be driven more from the volume growth in the Bakken and what happens there. So, it\u2019s not an immediate problem and/or opportunity for us, but it is something that we\u2019re clearly keeping our eye on. Operator : We will go next to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Sterling [ph] for Jeremy. On the G&P segment, it appears your average were pretty high this quarter. I understand it\u2019s a larger than mix shift impact. But curious if you can expand $0.80 is still the right way to look at it. Chuck Kelley : Going into the quarter, obviously we expected the $0.80 average fee rate to in fact be there. As we went through the quarter and ultimately exited the quarter, yes, our Mid-Continent volumes were up. So, you would expect that fee rate would have declined or bit in the $0.80 range. However, our Bakken fee rate increased due to volume from certain large 100% fee-based contracts. If you recall, we have really several kinds contracts, some 100%, some 100% with a little bit of pop. But, these were large 100% fee-based contracts that ultimately caused the segment\u2019s overall fee rate to increase to the $0.88 level. Kevin Burdick : The only thing I\u2019d add\u2026 Chuck Kelley : I was just going to say, a lot of that is driven by the weather when you think about what\u2019s going on in both the Williston and Oklahoma. You have certain areas where you have more wells off-line and did impact different contracts. So, it\u2019s not uncommon for us to see a little bit of noise related to that fee rate due to the weather impacts. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And on your optimization and marketing results, just kind of curious what NGL products you\u2019re optimizing during the quarter. Chuck Kelley : Right now, we\u2019re seeing EP spreads in the $0.16 range; propane in the $0.15 and normal butane in the $0.18. So, we\u2019re pumping as much as all that that we can. Unidentified Analyst : And then, last one for me. G&P segment, I apologize if I missed it. But can you discuss the higher third-party promptings cost and system constraints. Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. That was really kind of an isolated phenomenon in the first quarter. As we talked about the 200 million a day third-party, long-term third-party offload we have, as we were transitioning volumes from other third-party offload that we were kind of using the bridge into that, as we worked through the startup process on the long-term offload, we incurred some additional costs as we worked through that transition. That\u2019s really what that was. And similarly, just from other constraints that were going on as we saw the volume growth and as we were trying to move volumes around to ensure that we got it to a processing plant, we had some of that. But we do not expect those costs to continue as we have transitioned to our longer term third-party offload. It\u2019s fully in service and is at much more attractive rates. Unidentified Analyst : So, shouldn\u2019t see anything show up in 2Q then? Kevin Burdick : No. Operator : We will go next to Brian Zarahn with Mizuho. Brian Zarahn : You discussed Permian gas takeaway projects that you\u2019re evaluating. Any update on potential expansion of your NGL system in the Permian? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. We continue, we\u2019re in advanced discussions with a couple other producers and processors in there. And so, we are expecting to -- hopefully in the short-term we will have something more to talk about on the West Texas system. But, as we have done in the past, we usually don\u2019t announce expansions until we have secured the contracts behind. Brian Zarahn : In the Permian, I guess, on your projects overall, any impact on higher steel costs? Kevin Burdick : No. As we have talked before, we had procured and locked in the steel prices for the pipe several months ago actually. So, we are in great shape from a steel perspective. Brian Zarahn : And then, on financing, if you could elaborate a bit on your expectation, no equity potential in 2019. Is a key driver more, so you have additions to your project backlog or is it more the cash flow ramp and marketing contributions? Walt Hulse : I think that if we were in a position where we saw an attractive project that we needed to add but then we would have to think a little bit harder about whether some equity was appropriate. But, the reason we put the qualifier at all, as we see the business moving today and the fact that we are starting today 3 and hey, if you annualize the first quarter at 3.5 debt to EBITDA ratio, we\u2019ve got some pretty good room there for debt capacity going forward as EBITDA expands. Operator : We will go to Ted Durbin with Goldman Sachs. Ted Durbin : Just the 140,000 barrels a day of ethane rejection across the system, can you give us the split between the Williston and the Mid-Continent? Kevin Burdick : Yes, it\u2019s about 50,000 to 70,000 barrels a day in the Williston and about 70,000 to 100,000 barrels a day in Mid-Continent. Ted Durbin : Okay, got it. I realized that changes based on the process and economic. So, if we think about the Elk Creek, the early Elk Creek expansion you\u2019re doing, how much volume can you get out that Bakken pipeline with that early construction you are doing? Kevin Burdick : I think we can get another 10,000 to 15,000 barrels a day down the pipeline, but also that will release more of the rail volume; it had to go on rail, probably another 15,000 to 20,000 barrels a day that we could increase coming out of Bakken to go out of our rail terminal. So, I think overall that will give us about 25,000 barrels a day, could give us 25,000 barrel a day. Ted Durbin : And that would be at the same sort of $0.30 economics that you talked about before? Kevin Burdick : Probably a little bit. We said that when we contracted Elk Creek it was a little bit less than that $0.30 that we have seen before but it\u2019s going to be in high 20s. Ted Durbin : And then, just this additional contracting that you\u2019ve done, both on the Elk Creek and Arbuckle with the additional commitments, is that pushing us closer to the midpoint of the 4 to 6 times build multiple range, close to low-end, how do we think about the returns now with the new commitments? Kevin Burdick : So, how I think is the turns on the new -- with these new commitments is we will get to the 4 to 6 faster because we will have more of the ramp-up coming quicker. And we will push more towards the lower end if not even lower than the 4 times. Ted Durbin : Can you quantify the impact of weather this quarter on your volumes and revenues, and I guess by segment if you have it? And then, the impact of the NGL inventory fell, how much did that impact the result? Kevin Burdick : From a weather standpoint, no we\u2019re not. We haven\u2019t necessarily quantified that from -- we\u2019ve kind of given you where we\u2019re at in April. And from a G&P perspective, process, volumes. It was normal again. It\u2019s not uncommon for our volumes to be slightly off relative to Q4. So, the fact that we were up was a very positive signal from a weather standpoint. And then, on the -- I don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to go down the path of splitting out our optimization or the details of the optimization and marketing from an NGLs held in inventory. Operator : Next is Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning and congratulations on continued great execution here. Most of my questions have been asked and answered. Just picking up on Ted\u2019s question about the NGL inventory with marketing. To the degree that you aren\u2019t quantifying it, can we -- do you then need to rebuild, is that a headwind in the future periods, how should we think about that? Kevin Burdick : I don\u2019t view it as a headwind at all. Again, Sheridan talked about the spreads we\u2019re seeing right now. And a previous question also talked about the capacity we have for optimization. And if ethane shows up, great, but even if it doesn\u2019t, with the spreads there\u2019s the opportunity we will see an offset there. So that\u2019s how I think about it going forward is we do believe the spreads will remain strong. And so you would expect to see that optimization bucket stay strong. Craig Shere : And you addressed the higher G&P OpEx for the quarter that a lot of that is temporary. I think there was some lower expense in the NGL segment. How should we think about that? Kevin Burdick : You kind of had a little bit of both in those. If you think about -- I think we\u2019re trying to get as run rate. In the GMP segment, run rate might be a little lower than what we saw in the first quarter because of some of these costs. But you\u2019ve also got volume growth. So, as you go through the year, you\u2019ll see a little step up in op cost just for -- to deal with that volume growth. On the NGL side, we saw a higher op cost in the fourth quarter. We had several maintenance projects and expense projects and work that we did in the fourth quarter that it was probably a little artificially high. And then, you saw a step down. So, run rate there might be probably closer towards Q1, maybe a little above that. Again, as you see volume growth through the rest of the year, you\u2019re going to see a little uptick there as well. Operator : We will go next to Rebecca Followill with U.S Capital Advisors. Rebecca Followill : Good morning. Just following up on the fee rate at $0.88 versus the guidance of $0.80. Are you saying that $0.80 is probably the good go to number for the rest of the year? Kevin Burdick : Yes. That\u2019s what I would use at this point. Again, we\u2019ve got -- that will depend on how the volumes come on, on which contracts. But we do believe -- we saw some anomalies in the first quarter that drove it up a little bit and it will -- you\u2019ll see it come back down as the weather gets out and our customers get back to some of the drilling programs, and you see the volume growth. We do think that will tick down a little bit. Rebecca Followill : And then back to Texas intrastate market and what you can do there, can you quantify how much additional capacity you can add to evacuate gas north? Kevin Burdick : It\u2019s not -- we are not talking Bcf a day type projects. You probably got two or three different projects in the 100 million, 300 million a day type range. So, these are a little more tactical projects that we are talking about. Again, low capital, low multiple, building off our existing asset footprint, but that\u2019s how I\u2019d think about those types of projects. Operator : We will go next to Ethan Bellamy with Baird. Ethan Bellamy : Just a follow-up on Brian\u2019s question on the steel prices, a couple questions in that area. First, can you confirm you are not exposed on Elk Creek? Separately, other projects in your backlog, either announced or unannounced, has that meaningful moved or changed the economics there, the viability? And then, finally, will we see any movement in maintenance CapEx cost going forward if steel prices maintain current levels? Kevin Burdick : I\u2019ll take the first one. Elk Creek, no, we are not exposed there. Again, we bought that pipe; it\u2019s already showing up. And we are locked in from a price perspective. So, nothing there. As we look at -- as we think about our backlog and other things, we have not seen any other ancillary cost escalation at this point and feel good about those projects that we\u2019ve already announced. As we think about our backlog, I mean obviously, the tariffs stuff continues to evolve. So, we will get -- as we move through it, we\u2019ll include anything there in our economics as we evaluate the economics. Terry Spencer : Kevin, you might mention Arbuckle in terms of the steel\u2026 Kevin Burdick : Yes. That\u2019s right. We\u2019re focused on Elk Creek but Arbuckle II is also locked in as well from the steel price standpoint. So, we have got the vendors locked in, prices locked in, schedules locked in, and we are good to go there. Ethan Bellamy : And in terms of anything you might be negotiating with customers, does it delay potential negotiated agreements on new plants if you don\u2019t know what the cost of project is going to be? Kevin Burdick : No. Ethan Bellamy : And then, just kind of a housekeeping item, but we\u2019ve seen a few small North Dakota flood warnings, anything to be concerned about for Q2? Kevin Burdick : No. I mean, we -- what\u2019s that? Terry Spencer : Not outside the ordinary. Kevin Burdick : Again, normal to me; as we moved through April, May, we\u2019ve seen what we would consider a normal spring. Operator : That concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. At this time, I\u2019ll turn it back to Mr. Ziola for any additional or closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the second quarter of 2018 starts when we close our books in early July and we will extend until we release earnings in late July. We will provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you all again for joining us and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

Today\u2019s conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Brad, and good morning. And welcome to ONEOK\u2019s second quarter 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions, should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and CEO of ONEOK. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. On today's call, we'll discuss ONEOK\u2019s second quarter financial and operational performance, our updated financial guidance included in yesterday's earnings announcement and share our progress on our more than $4 billion of capital growth projects. As we noted in our release yesterday, the high level of productivity continues in the basins where we operate. Our consistent volume growth underscores the strong performance of our supply customers across our asset footprint. And while NGL pricing spreads and optimization are noteworthy, the fact is our core business, the fee based services we provide for both natural gas and natural gas liquids customers continues to expand with incremental volume growth across our system and is the largest contributor to our earnings growth this year. And we are well positioned for additional volume growth through incremental investments at attractive returns. Our long term strategy remains focused on expanding our integrated assets through capital growth projects and strategic acquisitions that fit within our footprint and provides sustainable long-term fee based earnings. Yesterday, we completed the acquisition of Martin Midstream\u2019s 20% interest in the West Texas LPG pipeline. With that acquisition, ONEOK became the sole owner of West Texas LPG, a strategic step in our broader Permian Basin strategy and further positioning us for expansion opportunities, some of which are in the late stages of negotiations. Construction on our organic growth projects is progressing as planned and Kevin will provide more detail on those projects in a moment. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK\u2019s second quarter operating income totaled nearly $450 million, a 40% increase year-over-year and a 7% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $602 million, a 30% increase year-over-year and a 6% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.795 and last week, we announced another 4% increase to $0.825 per share or $3.30 per share on an annualized basis, in line with our previous guidance. The dividend is payable on August 14. At June 30, our debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.4 times and 3.66 times on a GAAP trailing 12-month basis. We generated more than $160 million [Later changed by the Company to $126 million] of distributable cash flow in excess of our dividends paid in the second quarter, a 9% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $450 million, with healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4 times. We have proactively managed our future debt maturities and liquidity with our $1.25 billion senior notes offering completed in July. Proceeds from the offering were used to repay short-term borrowings and together with excess distributable cash flow will fund our upcoming debt maturity and help fund our capital growth expenditures. As of today, we have approximately $900 million in cash and $2.5 billion available on our credit facility. We continue to maintain a strong balance sheet and significant liquidity as we construct our capital growth projects. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our net income and adjusted EBITDA financial guidance midpoint expectations and narrowed our financial guidance ranges. The midpoint of our net income guidance increased $30 million to 1.09 billion and our adjusted EBITDA midpoint increased $35 million to 2.35 billion. These guidance increases are primarily driven by expected continued volume growth and our NGL optimization and marketing results. If the optimization spreads maintain at these levels and no severe weather occurs in the fourth quarter, we could easily be at the high end of our guidance range. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our businesses. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Starting with the performance of our natural gas liquids segment, NGL volumes gathered in the second quarter averaged 903,000 barrels per day, a 12% increase compared with the second quarter 2017 and a 6% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Volume growth remained strong, as we have averaged more than 930,000 barrels per day in July. Two new third-party natural gas processing plants were connected in the STACK and SCOOP areas in the second quarter where strong producer results and increased ethane recovery continue to drive higher volumes.  Mid-Continent gathered volumes averaged 569,000 barrels per day during the quarter, an 8% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. Our Bakken NGL Pipeline remains full and we began railing NGLs out of the region during the quarter. We expect to be able to rail up to 30,000 barrels per day to provide interim takeaway capacity until the Elk Creek pipeline is in service. NGL volumes fractionated averaged 696,000 barrels per day during the second quarter, a 12% increase compared with the same period last year. We expect to be toward the high end of our guidance range of 650,000 to 725,000 barrels per day fractionated in 2018.  As total NGL volumes increased across our system, ethane volumes are also increasing. We had approximately 60,000 barrels per day of additional ethane on our system in the second quarter compared with the same period in 2017. The increase has continued in July with more than 70,000 barrels per day of additional ethane on our system compared with the same month last year. With a strong volume growth across our system, pipeline utilization has increased, which has led to a higher than anticipated location price differential for ethane priced in Conway.  This price differential is causing Conway priced ethane to remain in rejection. Even without the Conway priced ethane being recovered, we are well on our way to achieving our volume targets. We continue to expect ethane production across our system to increase during the second half of this year, as petrochemical companies complete expansion projects and exports increase. Last week, the startup of another Gulf Coast ethane cracker was announced, which is approximately 90,000 barrels per day of additional demand and we expect several additional petrochemical facilities to come online by the second quarter 2019, totaling more than 200,000 barrels per day of new ethane demand. Optimization and marketing activities in the second quarter also contributed to the segment\u2019s higher adjusted EBITDA, with increases of $23 million compared with the first quarter 2018 and nearly $50 million compared with the second quarter 2017. Wider location price differentials between Conway and Mont Belvieu and the sale of NGL inventory previously held contributed to the increases. We continue to expect transportation capacity from Conway to Mont Belvieu will remain highly utilized due to growing NGL volumes, which we expect will sustain current spreads until Arbuckle II is placed in service. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 30% compared with the second quarter 2017 and increased 28% compared with the first quarter 2018, driven by volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. Producer activity across our dedicated acreage remains strong. Second quarter natural gas volumes processed averaged nearly 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, a 17% increase compared with the second quarter 2017 and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2018.  During the second quarter, ONEOK\u2019s natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region averaged 932 million cubic feet per day, more than 100 million cubic feet per day higher than the same period in 2017 and a 5% increase compared with the first quarter 2018. We connected 210 wells in the Williston Basin and 26 wells in the Mid-Continent during the second quarter. We now expect well connects to total approximately 680 for the year, with 550 well connections expected in the Williston Basin and the remainder in the Mid-Continent.  We have approximately 60 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity and we\u2019ll add an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of capacity in Oklahoma in the fourth quarter of this year, with the expected completion of our Canadian Valley plant expansion, which remains on schedule. In the Williston Basin, we have approximately 125 million cubic feet per day of available processing capacity, including the recently completed expansion of our Bear Creek plant, which increased its capacity to 130 million cubic feet per day from 80 million.  We continue to look at additional plant and compression and expansion opportunities in the basin in addition to our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake plant that is under construction and expect it to be complete in the fourth quarter 2019. The segment\u2019s average fee rate increased to $0.89 per MMBtu in the second quarter 2018, above our original guidance of $0.80. Higher fees have been driven by greater than expected volume growth in the Williston Basin and higher volumes on contracts that have higher fees. We now expect our average fee rate to be in the range of $0.85 to $0.90 for 2018. In the natural gas pipeline segment, second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 6% year-over-year, benefiting from higher interruptible transportation volumes and decreased 9% compared with the first quarter 2018, primarily due to normal seasonality. In June, we announced four expansion projects to provide additional takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas by up to a total of 1.7 billion cubic feet per day.  The projects include an expansion of ONEOK\u2019s WesTex Transmission system from the Permian Basin to the Texas Panhandle; a project to make Roadrunner Gas Transmission bidirectional to transport natural gas from the Delaware Basin to additional markets at Waha, and both westbound and eastbound expansions of ONEOK\u2019s gas transportation system in Oklahoma to accommodate growing volumes from the STACK and SCOOP areas. These capital efficient expansions will quickly create critical takeaway capacity and offer additional optionality for natural gas producers and processors in these areas. The open seasons have concluded on the WesTex, Roadrunner and ONEOK gas transportation westbound projects. We've received strong interest on the projects and we\u2019ll provide the results once all bids have been analyzed and contracts finalized. Now, a quick update on our growth projects, starting with Elk Creek. We have begun construction on the southern portion from the Powder River Basin area to the Mid-Continent and we continue to expect this section to be completed as early as the third quarter 2019, which should help alleviate some capacity constraints in the Williston Basin before the entire line is in service. We expect the entire project will be complete by the end of 2019. We've also contracted an additional 20,000 barrels per day on Elk Creek since our last call, bringing the total contracted volume to approximately 140,000 barrels per day. We are currently buying right away [ph] for Arbuckle II and remain on schedule for that project, which is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. We've contracted an additional 30,000 barrels per day on Arbuckle II, bringing our total contracted volume to approximately 290,000 barrels per day. Site work has begun on our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator and we remain on schedule for this facility to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. We remain on schedule to complete our 110,000 barrel per day extension of our now wholly-owned West Texas LPG pipeline in the third quarter and we are in late stage negotiations with several producers and processors in the region for additional expansions. As those deals are finalized, we will announce them. Lastly, the 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III pipeline is also on schedule and is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter 2018, which will provide additional capacity for growing Mid-Continent volumes. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. These calls are a great way to discuss operational performance and earnings results, but they don't always allow time to discuss the many other valuable and business enhancing initiatives happening at ONEOK. Whether it's implementing new technology to help our employees stay safe, volunteering time in our communities, improving pipeline safety monitoring or protecting the environment, our employees are doing great things for our business and for the communities where we live and work. So thank you to our employees for all of your efforts.  Within the next month, we'll be publishing our 10th Annual Sustainability and ESG Report, which will highlight these initiatives and many others. I encourage everyone to review the report. To all of our investors, thank you for your continued support of ONEOK, our operations and our strategy for growth. So with that, we\u2019re now ready for questions operator. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : My first question, I was wondering if we can talk about kind of the drivers related to guidance. You tightened up the low end of the guidance range and so forth, but I was wondering if you can talk about the higher end of the guidance range? What we would need to see to be able to hit the higher end? Is there some specific drivers that you think that are likely to happen? Are there some macro events that we should be thinking about? Any color around hitting the higher end would be appreciated. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Sure. Shneur, as Walt indicated in his comments, he mentioned that optimization margins, going forward, if they stay about where they are, we could see hitting the high end of the guidance pretty easily, particularly also if we see some -- a little bit less severe weather than we've typically planned in our G&P segment. So, certainly optimization spreads, as we've proven, are very difficult to forecast with any degree of certainty. We really don't see anything fundamentally that could -- that will change or compress these spread, but certainly we\u2019ve factored in some cushion in our current guidance. But again, let me reiterate, if we see these optimization spreads kind of stay in this $0.20 a gallon range throughout the end of the year, we can see some upside, particularly in this NGL business. Certainly, the high end of guidance is very achievable, if that happens. Shneur Gershuni : So to clarify, kind of the midpoint of your guidance does not assume that the spreads that we're seeing maintain themselves, but if they do and you're not forecasting one way or another, then you would definitely be able to hit the high end. Is that a fair paraphrase? Terry Spencer : That's right on. Shneur Gershuni : All right. Perfect. And a follow-up question, just wanted to dig in on Mid-Con volumes a little bit and I think you guys kind of touched on it in pieces in your prepared remarks, but is it a scenario where ethane is backing up the gas pipelines, the Permian with what it's doing is sort of backing up the entire system, are there de-bottlenecking issues that just sort of need to be taken care of and we can see an upside opportunity for Mid-Con volumes, as [indiscernible] are worked out. I was just wondering if you can sort of talk about kind of the steps and where we are with that. Kevin Burdick : Hey, Shneur. This is Kevin. No, we don't see bottlenecks from a standpoint of the ethane that's being left in, creating residue issues. Our producers, from what we hear, both are, on our G&P side and overall producers from an NGL standpoint, continue to have great results. We haven't seen them back off at all and we definitely expect those volumes to increase as we move through the rest of this year and into \u201819. Shneur Gershuni : So is it fair to say the Mid-Con is kind of a timing issue right now? Kevin Burdick : For our G&P business, yeah, a lot of timing and then the slight reduction in the well count in well connects that we put out there is just really, maybe slightly less than one rig and some timing is all that drives that, but no, still feel good about where we're at from a volume perspective. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : I was wondering if we can get an update on the utilization levels on Sterling and Arbuckle and if you could provide some insight into which products you're optimizing the most at the moment? Terry Spencer : So, we'll turn that question over to Sheridan. Sheridan Swords : Christine, this is Sheridan. Right now, in the Sterling pipeline, we're still in that 80% to 90% utilized range, even though we had a bit more volume in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter. And then on the Arbuckle pipeline, we're in the 85% to 90% range and we were moving all of the Y grade [ph] we can out of the Mid-Continent on Arbuckle at this time. Christine Cho : Okay. And which NGL product are you optimizing the most at the moment? Sheridan Swords : Ethane and propane are the ones we\u2019re optimizing the most and that's just really driven by the fact that those are the two products that we have the most on our system. So, we're still optimizing butane as well, because it has a very nice spread, but we just don't have as much butane as we have ethane and propane. Christine Cho : Okay. And then I noticed that you guys took out the language that ethane rejection is expected to decrease to 70,000 barrels per day by year end. With Conway ethane frac spreads expected to be negative and the producers that are priced off Conway expected to continue to reject ethane, what do you expect your ethane rejection exit rate to be now? Kevin Burdick : I think, Christine, this is Kevin. I mean, we \u2013 clearly, we're not going to -- we won't be at the 70,000 barrels per day but \u2013 of rejection at the end of the year, with Conway still being rejected, but I think the key there is that ethane that's not coming on is giving us the space for the optimization and will more than make up the value, if you will, that wouldn't come from the Conway barrels that would be recovered, will more than make up for that with optimization. So that's kind of where we sit today with these widespreads, no, we don't expect that to come out by the end of the year, but we're going to more than make it up with the optimization. Christine Cho : Okay. And then one more if I could. Can you give us an idea of how much your Mid-Con contracts are priced off Conway versus Belvieu? And then if -- and then are all the Bakken contracts priced off of Belvieu? Terry Spencer : We won't give that much breakdown, but at the macro level, all the contracts, you're probably 60-40 Belvieu to Conway. Christine Cho : 60-40 Belvieu-Conway. Perfect. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hey, good morning, everybody. Just wanted to clarify or get confirmation. The incremental contracting you did on Elk Creek. That\u2019s coming from Bakken, producers of Bakken volumes. And sort of the follow-up question to that is, do you have any update on the potential to add either DJ volumes or even potentially Western Canadian volumes to Elk Creek? Kevin Burdick : Yeah. Michael, it\u2019s Kevin. The 20,000 barrels a day is coming out of the Bakken. I mean, that's I think primarily coming out of the Bakken, maybe a little bit out of the Powder. But in -- and discussions continue to go well up there. I mean, you're seeing a lot of growth across all the G&P companies in the Williston, as producers continue to have great success in the Williston and we've seen a lot of activity in the Powder as well and the DJ. So, a lot of conversations going on with producers about additional volume. Sheridan? Sheridan Swords : The one thing I would add is, we talk to the contract that we\u2019ve already \u2013 the people we've already contracted with, their ramp-up schedules have been moving forward, so we think that we will ramp up to our contracted volume quicker than we originally thought. Michael Blum : And then kind of a minor issue I guess, but just more curious on the dynamics. The North System, is there anything out of the ordinary going on there, given the delays with Mariner East II getting into service and who they\u2019re servicing [Technical Difficulty] over there? Thanks. Terry Spencer : Shifting on the North System that's been affected by Mariner East or what's going on there, I mean, the North system was down in the second quarter versus the first [ph] quarter, but that's more seasonality that we see every year. We still do receive volume into the Conway off of rail out of the Marcellus and that's probably driven by the Mariner East issues, but we\u2019ve been receiving those for quite some time. But I don't think it's enough to really affect the North-South spread or affect anything on the North System. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets. Elvira Scotto : Hey, good morning. So what are some of the benefits that you guys see with the full ownership of West Texas LPG versus only owning 80%? Is it just the ability to deploy more capital? Terry Spencer : Well, so, Elvira, one of the key things to make note of with -- when you have a partner and particularly if that partner is trying to monetize and create liquidity, you could wind up with a partner that doesn't necessarily fit with us. So, you have some risk there. So we've taken that risk off the table, but I think probably the most important thing is the ability to freely integrate that pipeline system in with our existing NGL business.  When you've got a partner that's got a 50-50 vote, which is basically how it the JV was structured, long ago when Chevron owned it, you've got -- you want to be on the same page obviously and so the thing that -- the risk that you \u2013 the risk that you run is that you can't -- you don't -- you're not perfectly aligned, if you've got somebody else involved and as a result, you may not be able to do all the things you want to do with that pipeline asset. So by taking out Martin, we clean that up and now we own it 100% and now we can more effectively, without risk, integrate that business and take advantage of all these synergies that that asset has with our existing business and existing assets. Did that help you? Elvira Scotto : Yes, very helpful. Thanks. And then in your -- you mentioned in your prepared remarks that you were looking at expanding your integrated footprint through organic growth projects and strategic M&A. So, can you maybe talk about your appetite for larger scale M&A and what sorts of assets you\u2019d consider to expand your integrated footprint, is it more downstream sort of export type capacity? Terry Spencer : Well, first of all, from an M&A perspective, certainly, we're very -- we remain very interested in M&A, but I think what you saw with the West Texas pipeline acquisition, I mean, that's a perfect example of what we're really interested in. Certainly, as we think about acquisitions and acquisitions from a more strategic standpoint, if they simply don't fit very well or have a real compelling strategic logic, we're not going to be very interested in it. So that's how we think about it. I think broadly speaking, in terms of the types of assets again that we -- that we're interested in, certainly, downstream assets, particularly as it relates to terminal and storage, transportation of liquid products that don't have to be NGL, it could be crude oil, could be refined products, could be petrochemical products. That infrastructure as well as long haul crude oil transportation up -- further upstream could certainly make a lot of sense and we've been very vocal about that over the past couple of years, but then just candidly what I'll tell you is those assets, people don't want to let go of very often, so the opportunity from an acquisition perspective sometimes is limited as well as -- there\u2019s certainly quality fee based assets that everybody wants, including us. Elvira Scotto : Great. All right. Thanks a lot. Terry Spencer : You bet. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : Thank you and good morning. Guys, [indiscernible] gathering fee being as strong as it has been for the first six months of the year, is it fair to say that the new guidance number that you provided, I think it was $0.85 to $0.90. Should that be something that we should carry over into 2019 as well? Chuck Kelley : Yeah. This is Chuck. I would say that in \u201919, you'd probably see similar range on our fees as we move forward with the mix of volumes coming out of the Bakken, primarily driving that. Danilo Juvane : Got you. And I guess switching gears, I noticed that you're still stating, no equity needs well into 2019. Does that change at all, just given how strong you\u2019ve performed so far this year and of course you do speak about having additional opportunities next year, do you see a need of potentially issuing equity at some point in \u201919. Walt Hulse : This is Walt. We obviously have experienced strong cash flows, which is helpful, because we get to reinvest that back into the business and that helps us from a debt capacity standpoint as well. So we don't see anything today with what we have on the table that would change our view that we want to issue equity in 2018 or well into 2019, if at all in 2019. Now that said, we are seeing opportunities for growth projects that are on the horizon and if they come sooner as opposed to later, we have to leave that door open, if we need to manage the balance sheet. We think the investment grade credit rating is incredibly important and we're going to do what we need to do to protect that, but as those move out further on the timeline and these pipelines start cash flowing the way they will, we continue to expect to de-lever very quickly 2020 and beyond. Danilo Juvane : Thanks, Walt. Last question from me, you mentioned in the press release some impact to NGL segment earnings from the timing of unfracked NGL volumes, should we be expecting a positive impact over the next couple of quarters from that dynamic? Terry Spencer : I mean, when we think about the frac volume, yeah, we did put some raw feed and inventory in the second quarter. We expect that will get fracked off over the rest of the year, so we should be -- you should see that come over the next couple of quarters. Danilo Juvane : Any estimates as to what the EBITDA impact would be from that? Walt Hulse : Probably in that -- it would be in the $10 million to $20 million range. Danilo Juvane : That's it from me. Thank you so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Thanks. I think you guys kind of touched on a couple of different times here with regards to guidance, but just kind of bringing it all back together as far as what kind of the main drivers were to the guidance increase, raising it here, was it just kind of strong first half is in the books at this point or now you kind of assume spread duration is going to remain at higher and better levels for longer duration in the back half of the year. And just want to confirm West Texas LPG acquisition is not in the -- not factoring in here as you guys already consolidated that, are there any other items that you'd say, if you kind of rank order, what was the biggest components to the increase in guidance here? Terry Spencer : Well, Jeremy, I think you're right on in the comments you made, but the biggest mover certainly is optimization. Now, we do very typically, as I mentioned and Walt mentioned in his remarks, as we do factor in some weather degradation later in the year, if that and you know that weather can be severe, if it's not as severe as we've got factored in, we could certainly see some pretty significant benefits to our G&P segment, as we move through the fourth quarter. But the biggest mover is the optimization. And again as I said earlier, it's difficult to predict these spreads with any degree of certainty, but what I will tell you is everything that we're looking at today is leaning toward pretty consistent scenario where we see wide spreads for an extended period of time. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. Thanks. And then just going back to the 30 less well connects in Mid-Con you were talking about, it seems like it's kind of timing related I think. But just wondering if you could share kind of what areas this is, if this is a STACK, SCOOP or kind of legacy areas? Terry Spencer : No. It's pretty much just in general. And again, that's back to, rigs move around a little bit on our acreage and it's not that we're seeing any degradation overall in the STACK and SCOOP. It's just, maybe less than one rig that's been on our acreage versus somebody else and a little bit of timing, that's all that\u2019s driven there. There is no structural or fundamental change in our outlook of how we\u2019re viewing the STACK and SCOOP. Jeremy Tonet : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks for taking my question. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America. Dennis Coleman : Yes. Hi. Good morning. A lot has been asked, so just a couple of detailed ones from me if you would please. There's a footnote that says you may bring Elk Creek on the Southern in the third quarter and the whole thing on in the fourth quarter. Any meaningful earnings impact from that that we might expect to model in? Walt Hulse : The earnings impact would be, like we've said, we're using rail as a bridge to provide our customers those -- that service as it relates to their growing volumes in advance of the pipeline capacity. So -- one way to think about it is, as we move barrels, if we get that Southern section done, we're able to move barrels from the Powder River Basin over to that pipe and start collecting the full pipeline fee rather than the rail -- and not have to pay the rail cost, so that would be the uplift we would get. That's the way we're thinking about it and we haven't really talked about \u201919 guidance yet, but clearly, as we get closer and we do that, that will be considered as we provide that guidance. Dennis Coleman : Perfect. Okay. And then obviously strong results here and potential for higher guidance, does that change anything about when you think you will become a cash tax payer? Walt Hulse : No. We still have a -- as we've guided in the past, we won\u2019t be paying taxes through at least 2021 or beyond. It will be some point further out than that and that hasn't changed. Dennis Coleman : Okay. That\u2019s it from me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : [indiscernible] but just a little confused on the last answer to Jeremy\u2019s question on guidance. You\u2019re assuming some discount to recent spreads from Conway to Mont Belvieu on the optimization into the second half, right? A \u2013 Terry Spencer : That's correct. Some degradation in the spreads going forward through the third and fourth quarter. Craig Shere : Okay. And so -- and to your point, if we just stay flat from where we've recently been, you\u2019ll hit the upside of guidance? A \u2013 Terry Spencer : You got it. Craig Shere : Okay. And then Kevin, on the additional 20,000 a day for Elk Creek and 30,000 for Arbuckle, any thoughts about how quickly that will ramp? I know Sheridan kind of mentioned that up in the Bakken, producer activity plan seem to suggest a quicker ramp than you guys had shared on the last call for your legacy contracts. Kevin Burdick : I don't -- I mean, yeah, we continue to get good information or positive information from our producers about the volumes being stronger. That has translated into additional contracts and a little bit steeper ramp, but we would still expect it, the volumes are going to ramp over a year or two, as we move through these projects and once they come online. Craig Shere : Okay. And any thoughts about what next in the Permian besides the West Texas LPG expansion. Kevin Burdick : As we think, we've got a lot of visibility to volume growth. And when you look at what's going on out there, I mean, clearly, the Permian with the number of rigs and the growth expectations on the liquids side, we have a lot of targets out there and again are in late stage negotiations with several of them. So, we would look to continue to expand and loop West Texas all the way from the Permian to where it connects with Arbuckle II and now that we wholly own it, we\u2019ll be able to integrate eventually that pipe into Arbuckle II and achieve some significant capital savings by leveraging the Arbuckle II pipeline and the capacity there versus laying another line that's part of West Texas LPG. Craig Shere : Okay. So it's just maximizing what you\u2019ve got, nothing on the crude side or any other ideas there? Kevin Burdick : So Craig, we're always thinking about the crude business, we're always thinking about the potential to take existing assets and repurpose them to crude and vice versa. So, we're always thinking about those things. I would never rule out the opportunity, particularly in a basin where crude is being produced as prolifically as it is. We're certainly always thinking about it and in particular in the Permian. Craig Shere : Okay. And last question, a bit of a follow-up to Elvira\u2019s M&A question. She referenced export possibilities. I know that Terry, you've kind of commented in the past, you wouldn\u2019t mind moving into LPG exports. Any kind of update on the market there, your thoughts? Terry Spencer : Well, we continue to aggressively pursue export terminalling opportunities, that has never stopped. We like the prospects that are in front of us today. Our commercial teams are working very hard and looking at a lot of options. We're talking to a lot of international markets that we\u2019re spending a lot of time hopping across the pond, speaking with potential customers and potential partners in the project such as an export terminal. So very high on our list and certainly a business or an activity that makes a lot of sense for us. Operator : Thank you. We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over back to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Andrew Ziola : Well, thank you, everyone. Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October and extends until we release earnings in late October. We'll provide details on the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and have a good day. Operator : Thank you. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

Today's conference is being recorded. At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Sir, please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Katie, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter 2018 Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. On today's call, we will discuss, among other topics, ONEOK's third quarter financial and operational performance; our financial guidance increase included with yesterday's earnings announcement; NGL fractionation capacity; and we'll share our progress on our now $6 billion in capital growth program. Our strategy to create value for our stakeholder remains the same with our assets well positioned. In some of the most economic and prolific basins in the United States, we continually find opportunities to serve our customers through long-term fee-based contracts. The NGL and natural gas volume growth we have experienced this year continues to result in high-quality earnings growth attributable to our core business of fee-based services. Our volumes in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas, combined with favorable optimization and marketing activities from our extensive, reliable and integrated NGL network, has resulted in another increase in our 2018 financial guidance. Since our last call, we've announced additional capital growth projects anchored by long-term customer commitments, which include the second expansion of our West Texas LPG pipeline to serve the continued growth in the Permian; another NGL fractionator in the Gulf Coast, MB-5; another processing plant in the Williston Basin, Demicks Lake II; and an expansion of the Arbuckle II pipeline, which has already begun construction. Building off our extensive asset base allows ONEOK to expand at attractive returns, providing clear visibility to strong earnings growth in 2019 and accelerating thereafter. With that, I will now turn the call over to Walt. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter operating income totaled $495 million, a 40% increase year-over-year and an 11% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $650 million, a 26% increase year-over-year and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2018 financial guidance for the second time this year, driven by strong financial and volume performance year-to-date and our confidence in the fourth quarter. We increased guidance for net income by 9%, distributable cash flow by 7% and adjusted EBITDA by 5%, all compared with our previous guidance midpoints. Our new adjusted EBITDA midpoint is now $2.47 billion, an increase of $120 million compared with the guidance we announced last quarter and nearly $500 million above our 2017 adjusted EBITDA. Adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for all three business segments also increased with the largest increase of nearly 11% in the natural gas liquids segment. Continued volume growth and strong optimization results drove the $145 million increase in the NGL segment's guidance. And greater-than-expected volume growth and higher average fee rates drove the guidance increase in the gathering and processing segment. With two months left in 2018, we feel confident in our new financial and volume guidance ranges. Kevin will provide additional detail on our revised 2018 volume expectations. During the third quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.825 per share and last week, we announced another 4% increase to $0.855 per share or $3.42 per share on an annualized basis, in line with our previous guidance. The dividend is payable on November 14 to shareholders of record on November 5. At September 30, our debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.4x and 3.78x on a trailing 12-month basis. We generated $133 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the third quarter, a 6% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. For 2018, we expect to generate more than $500 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends that we can reinvest in the business to fund our capital growth program. Total distributable cash flow in the quarter was more than $470 million, up 4% from the previous quarter with a healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4x. With $1.6 billion of equity issued in 2017 and January 2018, we have satisfied our expected equity needs for our announced capital growth projects through the remainder of 2018. We expect to benefit from increasing cash flows from operations in 2019 and expect any additional equity financing to be considered in the latter part of 2019. This consideration will be based on the timing and amount of capital expenditures. We expect any additional equity financing, if needed, to be limited to issuance under our existing at-the-market equity program. As of now, we have nearly the full capacity of $2.5 billion available on our credit facility. We remain focused on sustaining our strong investment grade balance sheet and having significant liquidity as we construct our capital growth projects. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments. Kevin Burdick : Thanks, Walt. Starting with our natural gas liquids segment. NGL volumes gathered in the third quarter averaged 956,000 barrels per day, an 18% increase compared with the third quarter 2017 and a 6% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Mid-Continent gathered volumes averaged 614,000 barrels per day during the quarter, an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Volumes on our West Texas LPG system averaged 204,000 barrels per day, a 4% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Our Bakken NGL Pipeline remains full, and we continue to rail NGLs out of the region. We expect rail volumes to continue to increase until the Elk Creek pipeline is in service. NGL volumes fractionated average 732,000 barrels per day during the third quarter, a 21% increase compared with the same period last year and a 5% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. Fractionation capacity across the industry remains tight, and our fractionators have been running near capacity. With recent expansion and debottlenecking projects, we estimate we have more than 800,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity given our current product composition, which gives us approximately 60,000 barrels per day of available capacity to accommodate growth. We expect that this capacity, along with additional debottlenecking projects at our existing fractionators, our storage assets and a small amount of already contracted third-party offloads, will provide sufficient capacity until our and MB-4 fractionator comes online in the first quarter of 2020. ONEOK's standard practice is to align our NGL transport and fractionation agreements pricing terms with the actual physical redelivery location of either Conway or Mont Belvieu, thus, avoiding the risk of pricing mismatch in our contracts. So the contracts that support Arbuckle II include Conway pricing terms until Arbuckle II is in service and then the terms will switch to Mont Belvieu pricing. The benefit of our integrated system, including our use of storage for unfractionated NGLs in both the Mid-Continent and Mont Belvieu, offers a number of ways to optimize available capacity and provide our customers the NGL services they need. Our Sterling I and II pipelines are currently shipping purity products and running full. And our Sterling III pipeline is transporting unfractionated NGLs into Mont Belvieu. Our Arbuckle Pipeline continues to operate close to its full capacity of 255,000 barrels per day. We continue to expect the transportation capacity from Conway to Mont Belvieu will remain highly utilized due to growing NGL volumes, which we expect will keep spreads wider than normal until Arbuckle II is placed in service. When Arbuckle II comes into service, it will have the ability to move the unfractionated NGLs currently flowing on Sterling III. This will open up capacity for more purity products to get to Mont Belvieu, which we believe will narrow the Conway-to-Mont Belvieu NGL pricing differentials. In conjunction with increasing the segment's adjusted EBITDA guidance, which Walt talked about earlier, we've also updated 2018 volume expectations. Our guidance for NGLs fractionated increased by approximately 5%. And we narrowed the range for NGL gathered volume guidance, keeping the midpoint at approximately 925,000 barrels per day due to better-than-expected C3 plus volume growth in the STACK and the SCOOP, which was offset by the continued rejection of Conway-priced ethane. Total ethane supply on our system continues to increase with approximately 100,000 barrels per day of additional ethane gathered on our system in the third quarter 2018 compared with the same period in 2017. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. For the third quarter, adjusted EBITDA for the segment increased 12% compared with the third quarter 2017, driven by volume growth in the Williston Basin and the STACK and SCOOP areas. Contract settlement adjustments in the second and third quarters of 2018, together, resulted in a sequential quarter adjusted EBITDA decrease, but the core business continues to grow. Volumes remained strong across the basins where we operate. Third quarter natural gas volumes processed averaged more than 1.8 billion cubic feet per day, a 15% increase compared with the third quarter 2017 and a 3% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. During the third quarter, ONEOK's natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region reached a new milestone averaging more than 1 billion cubic feet per day, a 17% increase compared with the third quarter 2017 and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter 2018. In the Mid-Continent, third quarter natural gas volumes processed averaged 835 million cubic feet per day, a slight decrease compared with the second quarter 2018 due to several large well pad completion delays. In October, we have already seen increased production with processed volume reaching nearly 900 million cubic feet per day on several days. We connected 137 wells in the Williston Basin and 29 wells in the Mid-Continent during the quarter. We've now connected a total of more than 550 wells through the first 9 months of the year, well on our way to meeting our increased guidance of 680 well connections. Rig activity remained strong with nearly 35 rigs on our Rockies-dedicated acreage, including two in the Powder River Basin and 15 in the Mid-Continent. The strong producer activity we've seen around our assets year-to-date is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. We updated our 2018 volume guidance for the segment with the main change being the expected volume mix by basin. Our Rocky Mountain processed volume midpoint increased and our Mid-Continent processed volume midpoint slightly decreased due to the timing of completions in the STACK and the SCOOP areas. The segment's average fee rate increased to $0.92 per MMBtu in the third quarter 2018 from $0.89 in the second quarter 2018. Higher fees continue to be driven by greater-than-expected volume growth in the Williston Basin compared with the volume growth in the Mid-Continent. We expect our average fee rate for the fourth quarter to be similar to the third quarter. In the natural gas pipelines segment, third quarter adjusted EBITDA increased 6% compared with the second quarter 2018 and increased 3% year-over-year, benefiting from increased interruptible transportation volumes and firm transportation capacity contracted. We had successful open seasons on three of the expansion projects announced in June, which will provide additional takeaway capacity in the Permian Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas. Open seasons resulted in more than 900 million cubic feet per day of capacity secured on our project to make Roadrunner Gas Transmission bidirectional, 300 million cubic feet per day of capacity secured on the expansion of our WesTex transmission system in the Permian Basin and 100 million cubic feet per day secured on the westbound expansion of ONEOK's gas transportation system in Oklahoma, which is on track to be completed before the end of the year. The eastbound expansion of the ONEOK gas transmit - gas transportation system did not have an associated open season, but was anchored by 115 million cubic feet per day of firm commitment. Now a quick update on our growth projects. Since our last earnings call, we've completed the extension of our West Texas LPG pipeline into the Delaware Basin. We also completed the expansion of our Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant in the STACK, which brings our total Oklahoma processing capacity to approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. Volumes on both projects are expected to ramp up over the next 12 to 18 months. Additionally, we recently completed some meaningful fractionation expansions in the Mid-Continent, including an approximately 20,000 barrel per day expansion of our propane plus capacity or heavy-in capacity at our Bushton, Kansas fractionator. This expansion was part of the related infrastructure upgrades included in our Elk Creek pipeline project to help accommodate the heavier NGL barrel coming from the Williston Basin. We remain on schedule to complete the 60,000 barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline this quarter. Construction remains on track for Elk Creek, and we continue to expect - to complete the southern section as early as the third quarter 2019 and the entire pipeline by the end of 2019. We've also contracted an additional 30,000 barrels per day on Elk Creek since our last call, bringing total contracted volume to approximately 170,000 barrels per day. Arbuckle II is under construction and on schedule for an expected completion in the first quarter of 2020. The expansion of Arbuckle II, which was announced in July and will increase capacity - total capacity from 400,000 to 500,000 barrels per day is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2021. We've contracted an additional 20,000 barrels per day on the system, bringing our total contracted volume to approximately 320,000 barrels per day. Also, our MB-4 fractionator is on schedule to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. Finally, we are currently constructing an additional 400 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Williston Basin with our Demicks Lake I and II plants with Demicks Lake I on track to be complete in the fourth quarter 2019. Given our current volume outlook, we expect Demicks Lake I to open nearly full. As a reminder, all these projects are backed by long-term commitments and/or acreage dedications addressing the needs of our customers and are aligned with the expected volume growth we see across our operating basins. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Kevin. This has clearly been a quarter of operational milestones and impressive financial results that underscore the reliability of our employees and our assets and the success of our customers in the basins where we operate. I'm not one who typically focuses on statistical records because we've achieved more than I can count over the years. Our goal, after all, is to create value for our stakeholders and let our track record of capital discipline and performance speak for itself, including doing what we say we're going to do and working hard to improve each and every day. But the milestone Kevin mentioned earlier about reaching 1 billion cubic feet per day of processing in the Williston Basin is one that, I think, speaks volumes about the growth of our operations and the ambition of our employees. Just 8 years ago, we had only one processing plant in the basin. Now we're processing 1 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas and are the primary NGL takeaway provider from the region. The growth between then and now isn't just the story of the Williston Basin, which has been an incredible basin for us, but it's also a reflection of our bigger company story and our continued growth in all the basins where we operate. Our employees have taken a great base of assets across our system and built a fully integrated midstream operation with unique competitive advantages in each basin where we operate. This kind of ingenuity and drive while doing it safely is what our employees thrive on and what has enabled us to announce our long list of growth projects at attractive returns. This couldn't have been accomplished without the hard work and dedication of each and every employee or without the continued support of our long-time investors. To follow up on my closing remarks last quarter, we recently published our 10th corporate sustainability and ESG report, which is available on our website. Stakeholder expectations have continued to increase for the energy industry to operate safely and environmentally responsibly. At ONEOK, our long history of good corporate citizenship is clearly reflected in this report and I'm proud of our progress. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Our first question will come from Danilo Juvane from BMO Capital. Danilo Juvane : I wanted to start with the Mid-Con and how the volumes were sort of light this quarter. Can you sort of explain what drove that decline? Kevin Burdick : Yes, Danilo, this is Kevin. Again, as I stated in my remarks, it was really just a timing of some of the well completions that we had kind of scheduled out with the producers. We had a little maintenance activity. But I think, as it relates to the STACK and SCOOP, what I'd do is look at the Mid-Continent volumes of NGL. I mean, we have like a 45,000-barrel per day increase sequential quarter-to-quarter for the NGL group, which I think is a broader indication of we still feel very strong about the SCOOP and STACK as well as we've seen the volumes pick up significantly in October in our G&P segment. Danilo Juvane : Got it, got it. I know you don't provide guidance until February at least. But should we expect the volumes in Mid-Continent to remain as strong, if not stronger, in 2019? Kevin Burdick : Yes, I think we expect - if you see this rig count remain, which we expect and I think you will see volume growth. I mean, getting the Canadian Valley II expansion complete and having that capacity now, you've got some of the pipe constraints with our projects and others that have taken care of some of the residue. So I think you're set for growth as we move through '19 and beyond. Danilo Juvane : Got it. One of your largest customers in the Bakken outlined a pretty bullish long-term view for the basin. By our estimates, you are tapped out on central processing capacity and that's without including the PRB picking up here. How much more Rocky-related growth are you guys seeing going forward here? Kevin Burdick : Well, let's start, on the G&P side, we still have some available processing capacity that we think we'll see a little more flaring, but we'll get there with our Demicks Lake I plant that's coming up in the fourth quarter. From an NGL perspective, yes, takeaway, the pipeline is full, but we've got the rail capacity that we've got up to 30,000 barrels a day of rail capacity that we will take advantage of as we move through '19 until Elk Creek comes online. And with Elk Creek, again, the southern section being complete in the third quarter, that allows us to accommodate growth that we expect to come out of the Powder early by shifting those volumes over to that pipe. Does that help? Danilo Juvane : Got it. Last question for me - yes, absolutely. I appreciate that. Last question for me is on the ATM. Obviously, you said that you may need limited equity next year dependent on project timing. As you are sort of developing these organic projects, is it fair to see that you continue to get something in the 4 to 6 times EBITDA range? Walter Hulse : Yes, we continue to see very attractive growth opportunities that are in the range of our capital investments. Operator : Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Maybe I - just to start off, I was wondering if we can talk about storage a little bit. I guess kind of two-part question here. When we look at the inventory builds on your balance sheet, can we just assume that's effectively unbooked EBITDA and that's due to timing? And then, secondly, when we sort of think about your storage positions and we sort of think about the spreads and the pipes being full and so forth, are you able to synthetically effectively sell volume at Mont Belvieu without actually moving the molecule by using your storage in Belvieu and using your store storage in Conway? Sheridan Swords : I don't think so. I mean, we can sell volume - I'm sorry, this is Sheridan, we can sell volume forward and store it in Conway until it's ready to be shipped to Belvieu, but eventually, it's going to have to be shipped. We can't synthetically make the transaction without actually physically shifting volume. Does that answer your question? Shneur Gershuni : Yes, that's essentially it. And also the value of EBITDA - of the inventories booked at the end of each quarter on your balance sheet, is that effectively unbooked EBITDA that just didn't happen due to timing? Kevin Burdick : Yes, this is Kevin. I mean, Shneur, you're really talking about from a raw feed perspective, that would be an inventory, yes, that would be effectively unbooked EBITDA. Shneur Gershuni : Great. And just a couple of follow-up questions here. You sort of addressed some of this in your prepared remarks, but just to try to nail it down for us less technical people. Given the questions in the industry about being short capacity, can you walk us through how you mitigated that risk? When you go to build a new processing plant, for example, do you already line up the transportation and frac capacity that you expected the output of that plant? If you can sort of walk us through that, please. Sheridan Swords : Yes, this is Sheridan. Yes, that's basically what we do. So most of our bundled services that we provided and how we contract, we go and provide certain amount of capacity to each processing plant, whether it's us or whether it's other people. And we make sure we have the transportation and fractionation capacity available to get that to the pricing point in the contract. And that's when we talked about Arbuckle II. Until Arbuckle II comes up, some of our contracts will stay priced in Conway as we can't physically get that barrel yet to Belvieu. But we look at through our whole system to make sure we're balanced and we don't get out of whack and get into a spot where we are having to buy third-party or buy out of spreads to handle our contracts or commitments. Shneur Gershuni : Perfect, that makes total sense. One final question just in terms of outlook both near term and longer term. Ignoring the optimization spreads just due to the volatility in that, the good results that we've had this quarter, you've raised guidance, which implies a stronger 4Q, how much visibility do you have a of the base business growing into 2019? And then if I recall correctly during your prepared remarks, you'd mentioned that Elk Creek is now 70% contracted. By the time it comes online, could we actually be in a position to be expanding that? Kevin Burdick : On that last question, yes, this is Kevin. We would love for that to be the case. I mean, we continue with - the growth in the Bakken continues to be strong. I think a lot of people listened to the call yesterday of one of the large producers up there and they were clearly very bullish when you just look at the returns they're getting on the wells. So absolutely, we don't think we're done. And like we've mentioned, we could expand that pipe with minimal capital by just adding pump stations as we continue to grow our contracted volume. And you're also seeing growth in the Powder River as well, which would feed Elk Creek from that standpoint. So yes, we think that, that's something that we're keeping an eye on of when we might need to expand that. Shneur Gershuni : And with respect to 2019 in terms of the trends in your base business, should we expect a similar cadence of growth that we're seeing in 3Q this year and what you're guiding to for 4Q this year? Kevin Burdick : I mean, without getting into guidance, clearly, when you look at the rates that are in our acreage on the G&P side and you look at the rigs that are ultimately behind our significant positions in the Mid-Con and the Bakken on the NGL side, absolutely, you would expect growth. As we've talked about, some of the pipes are full, but again we definitely believe that core business is going to be in a great position not just in '19 but then as we move through 20 when these assets come in service Terry Spencer : Shneur, this is Terry. We'll be coming out with guidance after the first of the year at some point in time in January. So and as Kevin indicated, all the fundamentals look incredibly strong for us as we think about '19. Certainly, you can't forget about 2020 and 2021, we're doing a lot of things in '19 that set us up for 2020 and 2021 in a big way. So you'll see more as we come out with guidance after the first of the year in terms of what our thoughts are as far as volumes, but - and all the indications we're seeing from all the producers and rig count expectations are all just - are outstanding for '19. Operator : Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis from Credit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : Just wanted to start off on the tightness in the frac market. Obviously, you guy have taken steps there with Mont Belvieu 4 and 5 in 2020, 2021. But I guess, just in the near term here, how do you guys think about some of the short-term solutions to help clear the market? Is it all just going to storage? Are there other creative solutions you guys come up with going forward? And then just around OKE specifically, what are the other benefits we could see you accrue to you guys over the near term here? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. I think what you're seeing happening in the market is obviously storage plays a big place in that. If you can store barrels, for us it could be in Conway or in Belvieu for unfractionated NGL barrels until your fracs step up in '20 and 2021. Also we continue to look at our fracs in very detail to see is there any minor debottlenecking that we can do to eke out 5,000 barrels a day here, 10,000 barrels a day and then look at the different compositions we have. So we have some plans for that as we get into '19, the first quarter of '19, we'll have a little bit of turnarounds to help - allow us to incrementalize and move some of our fracs up in capacity. So I think you're seeing some of those - by all the industry participants continue to look at each one of those. And also we have seen, it's been pointed out in other calls, that there's actually some petrochemical crackers now that are looking at cracking unfractionated raw feed as well, especially when the spot frack market gets as wide as we have seen it, you always then have those participants coming in. So I think all those things are what's going to be needed to get to 2020 or beyond 2020. I still don't think the frac market will - I think the frac market will still be tight in 2020. We need to get through 2021 to really loosen it up or get it back to more normal levels. But everybody is well incentivized to find every creative solution to get a little more frac capacity to do storage, do cracking through our petrochemical facility or increasing your own frac capacity. Spiro Dounis : Got it, that's great color. And then just on West Texas LPG and the potential to, I guess, convert to a crude pipeline there. How are you thinking about the timing around that, which I think is kind of a big factor, I'm guessing, in the economics. But what are the other factors you guys are considering as you think about that decision? Sheridan Swords : I think one of the things we're considering is whether or not, with all the growth we've seen out there and our ability over these last months to be able to contract new volume, which drove our announcement under the expansion out there, that it may be better served to leave it in NGL service. And so that's probably one of the biggest decisions we have is what's the best service and how do we make the most money out of it going forward. Obviously, there's a spread differential in crude out there right now that everybody's trying to get to, but what's the long-term aspect of being able to contract that. So there's lots of different things, but we're talking to people about it, trying to understand how do we make the most money with the assets we have. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : I apologize in advance, this is probably like a multipart question, but I'm trying to understand a little bit about some of the dynamics with the flows and the bottlenecks. So it sounds like the producers are getting close to flaring limits in the Bakken, which, obviously, one way to alleviate that would be to toggle ethane yet you got downstream constraints on frac capacity to fractionate. So just wondering like how those two factors are sort of playing out those dynamics? And I guess, related to that, what is your utilization of frac capacity currently at Conway? And is there any room there for additional frac? So I know there's a lot in there, so apologies. Kevin Burdick : Michael, this is Kevin. We'll start with the flaring in North Dakota. Clearly, as you've seen the state report information published the latest one, it's ticked up little bit. I would remind everybody that, that information is the gross production and the gross gas capture levels. So then what happens with each individual producer then is able to, with the updated regulations, they're able to utilize or take credits, if you will, if they have beat the target over the last six months. And they're also able to exclude 60 days of IP gas on their new wells. So we believe many of our producers will be able to stay under and expect to stay under the flaring targets as they move through '19 till some of the capacity comes online. To the question about the ethane and the toggling there, clearly, we're managing that very carefully with all our processing plants to try to maximize throughput while still also managing the downstream impact. So obviously, we are rejecting at this point with the Bakken line being full and then the rail activity, we are rejecting as much ethane as we possibly can to give us as much NGL Takeaway capacity as possible to help them out. So that's the way we think about that. As for the Conway specific, Sheridan, do you have comments about the Conway? Sheridan Swords : Michael, what I'd say about Conway is we stated in Kevin's remark that we have about 60,000 barrels a day of available fractionation capacity. And with our integrated system, we can make that fractionation capacity show up anywhere on our system that we want to as we move raw feed around. But with wide north-south spread, you would say all that fractionation capacity is in Conway because we're taking everything we can to Belvieu. So right now we'd probably say we have 60,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity in our Conway market. That is above what we're bringing in on gathering. Today, we're using that 60,000 barrels a day to reduce our raw feed in inventory, and we plan on ending the end of this year, end of 2018, with minimal raw feed in inventory to get ready for the ramp-up in volume in '19 and get us to the 2020 MB-4 fractionator. Michael Blum : Got it. I appreciate the details - the detailed answer. My second question really is more of a balance sheet financing question. Just as we think about modeling going forward, is there a leverage ratio that we should think about where you'd start to then consider tapping the ATM for equity a little bit to keep that within some sort of range? Walter Hulse : Well, Michael, what I would say is that with the increased cash flow and the earnings growth that we've had in '18, we've been able to reinvest that money back into the business so it's kept our leverage at a run rate basis right now at 3.4x. So we're sitting pretty good at the end of three quarters and going into '19. We've always said that our longer-term target is to be below 4x and nothing's changed on that. But we've also said that we expected it to creep up in the latter part of '19. The rating agencies have acknowledged that. And so we're going to have to keep an eye on it. But our expectation is that cash flows keep flowing as they are, we'll be in a pretty good spot moving throughout '19. So we're keeping ourselves flexible if we need some equity, but we think there's a good chance that there won't be any equity in '18. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : I have a follow-up to Shneur's question. If you fractionated the barrels, but put it into storage afterwards as purity product, then it's booked as revenue in your income statement, is that right? So there could be inventory on your balance sheet that already has been recognized as revenue? Sheridan Swords : That is correct. If you fractionate. Walter Hulse : It's when you actually sell the barrel that we get. The thing is that we fractionate and store so many barrels on a constant flow basis that they're constantly flowing through there, Christine, and bringing in as much as we do on a daily basis. But we actually recognize the revenue when it is sold. The Barrels are fungible and they're going in and out of storage every day. Christine Cho : But I guess, when we look at the buildup in your inventory, I mean, should we - if more of that was purity product than y-grade, I'm just trying to get a sense of like whether or not most of that was already recognized versus not, if that makes sense. Walter Hulse : It wouldn't be recognized until we got it solved. But obviously, if it's purity product we have ability to sell it into the marketplace at any time. Sheridan Swords : We sell almost all our barrels every day into the marketplace. We don't take price risk on our barrels, so we're selling our barrels every day into the marketplace. Christine Cho : Okay, but I guess I'm also trying to split to, Sheridan, your comments on earlier questions that you guys are trying to reduce your y-grade inventory in storage, is that right? Sheridan Swords : That is correct. Christine Cho : Okay, but the number one up, so I can only assume that your purity product storage went up, is that incorrect? Sheridan Swords : Those aren't necessarily the same. If we fractionate our y-grade in inventory, we'll sell it into the marketplace. If we decide to keep y-grade in storage, we may still sell it in the marketplace and then sell it forward or something as we go with that. But just because we fractionate more barrels, more barrels in y-grade, doesn't necessarily mean that we have to store that barrels of purity product. We still have the ability to place it into the market. Christine Cho : Okay. And then I think you kind of alluded to this in your prepared remarks. But for the last year and change, guys have told us that we should assume that your optimization capacity would decrease throughout the year if customer commitments grew. But it sounds like we should assume that what you have now is what you'll continue to have maybe actually go up when your Sterling III extension comes online. Is that the right way to think about it? Sheridan Swords : Well, as our Sterling III expansion comes online, we will be moving - we'll have obligations to move more y-grade into the Mont Belvieu market. Not all of that y-grade that we move into the Mont Belvieu market we'll need to frac because some of the - the main contract that supported the Sterling III expansion was a transport-only barrel. So we still have that obligation to get those barrels into the Mont Belvieu market. But to the extent we have excess capacity on Sterling III and have the frac capacity and Mont Belvieu to frac it, we would increase our optimization. Christine Cho : Okay. And then how much debottlenecking can we see out of the fracs? I mean, you guys already mentioned the 20,000 barrels per day of propane plus out of the Bushton frac. Was that included in your 800 number or no? Sheridan Swords : Yes, it was. Christine Cho : Okay. But how much more could we see beyond that? Do you guys have like a general sense? Sheridan Swords : I think you can maybe able to see 20,000 to 30,000 possibly. A lot of depends on, when you get these higher levels depends, actually on the composition that you have coming into the system. So as we do different things, composition could change, they'll move around. But you could see 20,000 to 30,000 possibly. Terry Spencer : So Sheridan, this is Terry. So that 800,000-barrel a day number could be higher number particularly if the feed composition change to a lighter barrel, more ethane. Sheridan Swords : Yes. We can frac 840-plus thousand barrels a day as our nameplate if we had the right composition. And especially in the wintertime when you got colder temperatures, we can definitely get above nameplate with the colder temperatures in there. But right now, we still have some ethane being rejected on our systems, so we're still fracking very heavy barrels especially at the Bushton fractionator. So if we get live feed, we will go above that. But we're seeing we're at - at the composition we see today, we can get above 800,000 barrels a day. Christine Cho : And we wouldn't see the 840-plus unless the Conway ethane frac spread went positive, is that right way to think about that? Sheridan Swords : Yes, you need to get more ethane into the Conway fracs however that happens. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to pick up with Conway-Belvieu a bit more here, and granted, it's a very, very difficult question to answer and you're not providing guidance at the time, but I was just wondering if you could provide us with your updated thoughts on how you think that spread could kind of trend over next year? Where do you see some of the give and takes there? And as it impacts your optimization, do you see more risk to the upside or downside in 2019 versus 2018 optimization margins there? Sheridan Swords : Well, 2018 was pretty good. So if 2018 would repeat itself, that would be very good. But we think it will be volatile and - but it won't go back to historical levels or anywhere close to historical levels until we get Arbuckle II up and get more purity capacity in between Conway and Belvieu. But a lot to me depends on what the demand is in Belvieu for our exports on propane and petrochemicals on ethane, overall price, there's a lot of factors that go into that. But what we do know is it that we have volume in Conway that can't get to Belvieu due to pipeline constraints and that won't be allayed to Arbuckle II, which is what leads to a wide north-south spread. Jeremy Tonet : Fair enough. And at the risk of asking about something besides NGL, just want to pivot towards the WesTex expansion there and really just trying to dig in a little bit more and see how much of that - this build-out is getting to destinations that really kind of clear the basin. I mean, does the extension kind of connect into north of Plainview or for NGPL kind of north of Amarillo? Just trying to see how much extra this helps get past choke point. Charles Kelley : Yes, Jeremy, this is Chuck. The OGT - I'm sorry, the OWT northbound, it was pretty much designed to move the Waha gas molecules north to the Mid-Continent where the spreads were wider and they could access little different markets. So yes, you're seeing that gas up into the Texas Panhandle and potentially utilizing some of the Oklahoma assets as well. Jeremy Tonet : So it connects in north of those kind of 2 hubs on those pipes? Charles Kelley : Yes, you're looking at NGPL, Panhandle, Mid-Continent-based markets. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : We're six days out from election day, how are you guys thinking if the unlikely scenario plays out that Prop. 112 in Colorado passes? And I know you've kind of talked about it, but just how do you think this kind of flows through each of your three segments? Terry Spencer : This is Terry. Really no significant impact if Proposition 112 passes. Doesn't look like it's going to pass, it's close. But it doesn't look like it's going to pass. But even if it does, don't expect any significant impact to us, to our business whatsoever. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one other question really, just kind of balance sheet and credit metric perspective, you've got a lot of growth projects that you're going do fourth quarter this year through next year. What is the peak leverage level, the peak debt-to-EBITDA that you're willing to go to knowing that it's going to be temporary? Meaning knowing it may be just for a quarter or 2 or 2 or 3 quarters before the big backlog of projects comes online in second half of '19 through 2020? Walter Hulse : Well, I think my answer is going to be the same as I said just before is that our long-range target's 4x and we will edge above that in the latter part of '19. But we're seeing very significant cash flows from the business that we're reinvesting into the business. So we think that if things keep trending that we'll be in a good spot from a balance sheet standpoint. But if we need a little bit of equity, we have the ATM available. Operator : Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : A couple of questions for me. First, the clarification on the max frac capacity that you mentioned previously on the call, the 840,000 barrels a day and then you have 20,000 to 30,000 on top of that in composite, everything? Kevin Burdick : We would have - the 20,000 to 30,000 would be on top of both the 800,000 barrels a day that we can frac with our current composition. So the extra 20,000 to 30,000 barrels a day would be on top of that. Sunil Sibal : Okay, got it. And then on the G&P segment contract settlements, which impacted this quarter, how should we kind of think about that going forward? Is that something of a bit of an ongoing issue? Or is that kind of resolved at this stage? Charles Kelley : This is Chuck. No, that - we have approximately 2,000 contracts in the G&P segment. And from time to time, you're just going to see settlements and adjustments on some of these contracts. So no, that wouldn't be something we would anticipate going forward. Sunil Sibal : Okay. And then, lastly, on the Canadian Valley processing plant that you brought online. I was just wondering based on the activity you're seeing behind that, what's the kind of the expectation for that plant ramping up and getting full? Charles Kelley : We think - as we said in the remarks, it'll be - probably it'll ramp over the next 12 to 18 months. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Christopher Sighinolfi : Just a little nitpicky one maybe for me, Terry, if I could. On Slide 7 of the deck, you guys featured as you had in past quarters the anticipated bundled - average bundled rate by region. I just was noticing the Mid-Con, WesTex, I'm sorry if you mentioned this before, but there's now a tilde between those two ranges as opposed to a less-than symbol. So I'm just curious what sort of happened in those regions to maybe bump up modestly your view on the bundled rate? Sheridan Swords : Well, I think on West Texas pipeline, you're seeing a bump up on that because as we brought these new volumes on, they're at-the-market rate, which is much higher than the legacy rate that some of the old volume was on. And some of that old volume has left and so we fill some of the existing volume with higher-market volume. So our average rate is starting to trend up on the West Texas pipeline as we thought it would as we bring on market-based barrels, market price barrels for T&F service. And the Mid-Continent is the same thing, we've been able to contract it at little bit higher rates. As we continue to go forward, we've had some volume decrease on areas like the Barnett Shale and places like that, but some that are smaller volume - smaller-rate volume and we'll put it in STACK and SCOOP, which is higher-rate volume at the Mid-Continent. We're seeing a shift towards the higher-margin volume from the low-margin volume on our system. Christopher Sighinolfi : And is there - I guess, as you think about that then on profile forward, is there a meaningful amount of contracted volume that you guys know of that you think is going to be profiling off in the next couple of - next - in whatever period you want to define it that could cause that rate to go higher on just existing capacity? Or is this driven more of over time just by adding these stuff? Sheridan Swords : I think on the West Texas pipeline over next year and into 2020, you will see a lot of our low-rate volume leave the system in favor of market-based or a more market rate volume. So yes, you could see significant increase in the West Texas LPG system average bundled rate. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay, great. Switching gears real quickly, a lot of questions on the Bakken from a gas recoverability and processing perspective. I'm just curious if we get it to crude, you had mentioned and referenced one of the largest producers up there talking positively about the basin. There's two pipelines that have talked about expansion opportunities. I'm just wondering your view on that from a crude perspective as both a major operator and someone who formerly had a crude project in the backlog? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. Yes, we've got a lot of questions when you have a differential blow out a little bit, that was primarily due to an abnormal amount of refinery maintenance that was occurring in the upper Midwest, you've seen that spread come back in. But as you look forward, clearly you've got an open season out there right now on DAPL. You've got some other expansions being discussed. I mean, clearly, the producer yesterday was in conversations about larger expansions that they think may happen over the next couple of years. And you've also got some rail - a significant amount of rail capacity that used to be in service and now is sitting there. So with the combination of those expansions and the rail capacity, I think, as we talk to customers, they're comfortable that, that's going to absolutely bridge them to the point if you did need another greenfield project to provide additional capacity out. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay. Yes, I guess, that's what prompted my question was the discussion of significant new capacity, which seemed to be bigger than what those current expansions have discussed. So when I was just dusting off who had at prior points in time talked about projects from there, you guys being one, I was just curious if that - obviously, you have a ton in flight and I'm not saying you should add anything more at this point. I'm just curious if Bakken crude express gets dusted off at any point. Kevin Burdick : It's not on our radar at this point. I mean, we're absolutely locked and focused on providing the processing and the NGL takeaway. But you know, long term, we are a big player up there. Is it something we would consider, absolutely. Terry Spencer : Chris, it's Terry. So what I'll tell you just from our experience the last time the challenge associated with getting the kind of commitments that you need to make these large projects like Bakken Express work very challenging, the things that these producers do are innovative ways - using their ingenuity to find ways to get barrels out of that basin, and Kevin just listed off all those things. An so we've recently talked to some producers in private meetings about this very thing. And they're working on a lot of things, they have a lot of options to get crude out of the basin and we really don't have concerns about crude takeaway, certainly, over the near term and broadly over the long term really. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : One quick follow-up on West Texas LPG repurposing. I was under the impression that the expansion connecting the line and Arbuckle II kind of sets you up for twining the systems so that you don't have to have an either/or proposition, albeit maybe a couple of years out to really bring on an opportunity to enter into crude service. So can you kind of elaborate on that? Sheridan Swords : I think what we're saying there is when we complete the loops that we're starting on these expansions we've done so far, we'll have a complete system from the Permian to Arbuckle II then we'll use Arbuckle II to get into Mont Belvieu, which will open up the legacy West Texas system for some other service. As we continue to go, we've explored looking at crude and what that looks like. But we're also seeing a lot of opportunity in the NGL services that we may be able to fill, all that we have are capacity we see going forward on this Loop and Arbuckle II and need additional capacity for NGL. So it may be better to leave it in NGL service or it may be better to put it in crude service. But as we go along, we'll make that determination. But it's not a foregone conclusion that we will move it to crude service. We'll move into the right service that makes us the most money. Craig Shere : Understood. I know kind of breaking into services in the crude spaces then, along with LPG exports, has been kind of a focus for longer-term opportunities to add a leg to the stool, so to speak. If West Texas is most optimally used for NGL service for a number of years forward, is there anything else you're looking at to kind of provide additional multiple services to same producers? Sheridan Swords : Well, I think we still would like to look at the crude side of it for sure, it just may not be through this method. There's - obviously, there's other methods to get into that side from different ways starting from gathering or further down the road, it could be M&A further down the road. You don't know. On the export side, we continue to work very hard on the export side and having a lot of meaningful discussions and growing. But when we're ready to announce that one, we'll announce that one when we get everything lined up. So we still see that as opportunity to where we could grow, it just may not be through the West Texas LPG side. Terry Spencer : Craig, the only thing I'd add to what Sheridan said is that we've talked about other products, refined products, in particular, terminalling that could make some sense for us. So crude, refined products, LPGs, potentially logistical opportunities serving petrochemicals and refineries, those type of logistical assets could make some sense for us. Certainly, we don't see a lot of them popping up for sales. People covet those assets. But certainly, we're interested in those types of things and particularly bolt-on opportunities. When Sheridan indicated M&A, that's what he's referring to, just when acquiring assets that could make sense. So we're always prospecting through those opportunities, those types of opportunities. So as we think about the LPGs, we think about Mexico, we think about Canada potentially. We're actively pursuing or actually considering or developing opportunities in those spaces. So that's the kind of thing that we're in. And certainly, the export opportunity is something we've been working for years. We like where we are today and we're making progress. And certainly, when we get further down the road or ready to roll that project out, certainly we'll come out. I'd just tell you personally from the export dock standpoint, if we're not announcing something probably in the first half of '19, I'll be disappointed. But again, a lot of things have to happen in order for that to be successful. Craig Shere : I appreciate all the color. It certainly sounds like a full plate. Operator : Our final question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Just one very small follow-up. In your responses to Christine about the inventory levels and sort of the changes in value and so forth, is it fair to conclude that with NGL prices rising something like 20% or 25% from, let' say, June 30 to September 30, that, that's part of the remeasurement upwards as well also you're just booking something at a higher cost that's come in? Kevin Burdick : Yes. So I think that's the way you look at it. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. So you can have a scenario where the actual volume of inventories goes down, but the value booked on the balance sheet goes up because of the price basically, that's a potential outcome? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Just as you work through that and work that off, then yes, you could see some changes. Operator : At this time, I'd now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. This concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, VP of Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Shelbe, and welcome to ONEOK's fourth quarter and year-end 2018 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President Natural Gas. On today's call, we will discuss ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year financial and operational performance, our 2019 financial guidance and 2020 outlook and provide an update on our more than $6 billion capital growth program. 2018 was an impressive year for ONEOK both operationally and financially as volumes across our assets and our earnings posted significant increases. In our first full year of operation following the acquisition of ONEOK Partners, we announced more than $5.5 billion of new capital growth projects, experienced NGL and natural gas volume growth across our operations and strengthened our already solid investment grade balance sheet. Our long track record of earnings growth continues. ONEOK's operating income has increased nearly $1 billion over the last five years, while adjusted EBITDA has also doubled over that five-year period and has increased 50% since 2015. 2018 was a year of growth and new project announcements and 2019 will be a year where we rely on our ability to execute and position our business for continued earnings growth into 2020 and I'm confident that we will. Over the next 12 to 24 months, our focus will be set on completing our projects on time and on budget, on protecting the safety of the hundreds of employees and contractors we have working on these assets and on the safe and reliable operation of our existing assets. We continued to evaluate additional opportunistic projects that address customer needs and the increasing demand for NGLs and natural gas in the U.S. and abroad. One of these projects, which has received a lot of attention, is a potential NGL export facility. What I can say is that we're closer to a deal now than we've ever been, but there are a number of details that still need to be worked out before we announce anything further. We're optimistic about where we are in the process and believe this facility would be a great fee-driven addition to our already predominantly fee-based business model. Along with announcing 2019 guidance yesterday, we also provided an outlook for 2020 to help bridge the gap between what will be a heavy-billed year in 2019 and a large step up in volumes and earnings expectations in 2010. We expect a greater than 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA in 2020 compared with 2019 expectations. More than $4.4 billion of capital growth projects expected to be completed in 2019 and in the first quarter of 2020, will provide a foundation for significant earnings growth in 2020 and beyond. We acknowledge that we have disclosed a fairly wide range for 2019 capital expenditures with our guidance based upon a $3.1 billion midpoint. Given the volatility in commodity prices we experienced around year-end, our CapEx range demonstrates that we have the flexibility to make adjustments based on increases or decreases in producer activity. As the year progresses, we will likely tighten the range as appropriate. Walt will provide more detail in a moment. With that, I'll now turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's 2018 operating income totaled $1.8 billion, a 32% increase year-over-year. In 2018, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.45 billion, a 23% increase year-over-year. Strong natural gas and natural gas liquids volume performance helped us achieve 2018 net income, adjusted EBITDA and distributable cash flow guidance, which were all increased twice during 2018 because of better-than-expected operating results. The Natural Gas Liquids segment's 2018 adjusted EBITDA increased 25% compared with 2017. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Pipelines segments also saw impressive earnings increases of 22% and 8% respectively. The Natural Gas Gathering and Processing and Natural Gas Pipelines segments both exceeded 2018 adjusted EBITDA guidance, driven primarily by increased producer activity on our dedicated acreage and higher contracted transportation volumes on our natural gas pipelines. The Natural Gas Liquids segment ended 2018 nearly 6% above our original guidance expectations. The segment's fourth quarter 2018 earnings were impacted by lower optimization and marketing earnings as the average Conway to Mont Belvieu price differential decreased approximately $0.12 as compared with $0.24 in the third quarter. Additionally, due to maintenance at our Medford Oklahoma fractionator the segment had higher NGL inventories than expected at year-end 2018, which impacted fourth quarter earnings by approximately $20 million. We expect to recognize a $20 million earnings benefit from the sale of this inventory in the first quarter of 2019. Strong business segment performance in 2018 set a solid foundation for 2019. We announced 2019 guidance expectations with yesterday's earnings release, including our expectation for net income, adjusted EBITDA to increase approximately 10% and 6% respectively in 2019. We expect year-over-year earnings growth in all three of our business segments with Natural Gas Liquids segment expected to be the largest contributor to that growth. We expect key drivers for 2019 to include our recently completed Sterling III and West Texas LPG pipeline expansion projects. We expected completion of the southern portion of Elk Creek pipeline in the third quarter, additional third-party plant connections in our Natural Gas Liquids segment and increased volumes and a higher-average fee rate in our Gathering and Processes segment. Kevin will provide more detail on our volume and operational outlook. Total distributable cash flow in 2018 was more than $1.8 billion, up more than 30% from 2017 with a healthy dividend coverage of nearly 1.4 times. We generated nearly $0.5 billion of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in 2018, a more than 70% increase compared with 2017. This is cash we reinvested in the business to fund our capital growth program. During 2018, our total debt increased only approximately $200 million, while we spent just over $2 billion on capital expenditures. At December 31, our debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.75 times and 3.83 times on a trailing 12-month basis. We saw a significant decrease in leverage from 2017 to 2018 and ended last year with an even stronger balance sheet than we had anticipated. We entered 2019 with total liquidity of $3.5 billion, including borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and $950 million available on our three-year unsecured term loan agreement. This liquidity, plus strong anticipated distributable cash flows and excessive dividends, positions us well for completing the capital growth projects still ahead of us. Our capital spending is heavily weighted towards 2019, as the bulk of our largest projects are being placed in service this year and early in 2020. In 2019, we expect approximately $3.1 billion in growth capital expenditures, of which more than two-thirds is related to Elk Creek, Arbuckle II, MB-4 and Demicks Lake I. Another 10% is related to routine growth capital expenditures, which includes well connections and plant connections and the remainder is related to spending on growth projects being put in service in 2020 and 2021, such as MB-5, the West Texas LPG expansion and Demicks Lake II. With these announced projects, 2020 CapEx is expected to be significantly less than 2019. As it relates to the range we provided, the low-end reflects a sustained reduction in commodity prices that would drive significant slowing of producer activity, which we have not seen and do not expect to see, based on our customer activity and announcements so far in 2019. The high-end of the range reflects a significant increase in producer activity and related capital to address that growth. To reiterate, at current market conditions we feel comfortable with the mid-point of our capital guidance range. Having said all that, with our strong balance sheet, expected continued earnings growth and financial flexibility, we expect no equity financing needs in 2019 nor in 2020 based on our expected slate of growth projects and our rapid deleveraging as these projects come online. During the fourth quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.855 per share and in February, we paid a dividend of $0.86 per share or $3.44 per share on an annualized basis. As it relates to our expectations for dividend growth -- for the dividend growth rate going forward, I'll make a few comments. To start, I want to point out that many positive things have happened to our earnings prospects since we initially guided to a 9% to 11% annual dividend growth rate when we announced the acquisition of ONEOK Partners. We're pleased to have the financial flexibility to return capital to shareholders at an attractive rate, fund our growth projects and maintain a strong investment-grade balance sheet. We acknowledge that many investors and some research analysts have expressed the view that prudent capital allocation in the midstream space is more value. Accordingly, many investors do not require as higher dividend growth rate as they did in the past and that alternative approaches to returning capital maybe appropriate at some point in the future. We've received quite a bit of feedback on both sides of this issue. Going forward on a quarterly basis, our Board will continue their practice to evaluate dividend growth and alternative ways to return capital to shareholders based on the strength of our business, the commodity price environment of our producer customers, the funding needs of our growth projects, investor sentiment and our strategy to maintain a strong investment grade balance sheet. We believe that investors continue to value our ability to return capital to shareholders, while also funding our growth projects without expecting to issue equity to complete our announced capital projects. Before handing the call over to Kevin, I'll provide an update on the West Texas LPG rate case that was being reviewed by the Railroad Commission of Texas. In January, the case was settled with higher rates prospectively across the pipeline system. These rates are assumed within our guidance ranges. As we said previously, the majority of new volume commitments on the system are being contracted at market based negotiated rates, but we're pleased to have this matter resolved. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our business segment performance. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. As both Terry and Walt said, in 2019, we continue to execute on our low multiple organic growth program that is providing needed infrastructure for our customers across our operating areas. As these projects are completed in the second half of 2019 and early in 2020, we expect to see volumes and EBITDA ramp quickly. I'll walk through each of our operating areas and highlight our expected growth drivers in 2019 and into next year. Starting with the Rockies region. We continued to see strong producer activity and efficiency improvements across the Williston Basin and Powder River Basin, which is driving associated natural gas and NGL growth. NGL volume gathered on the Bakken Pipeline in 2018 increased 4% compared with 2017. Fourth quarter NGL volumes gathered averaged 148,000 barrels per day, a 7% increase compared with the third quarter of 2018. Growth has continued early in 2019 as we've gathered more than 165,000 barrels per day out of the Williston and Powder River basins on numerous days, which includes rail volume. In the Gathering and Processing segment, Rocky Mountain region natural gas volumes processed increased more than 14% in 2018 compared with 2017. Fourth quarter processed volume decreased slightly compared with the third quarter 2018 due to typical winter weather and maintenance which were already factored in to our expectations. So far in 2019, our Williston Basin processing plants are operating close to full capacity and averaged more than 1 billion cubic feet per day during January. With more than 250 million cubic feet per day of natural gas currently being flared on our dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin, we expect our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant to open full in the fourth quarter of 2019 and provide approximately 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs to the Elk Creek pipeline. Demicks Lake II also a 200 million cubic feet per day plant is expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020 and will provide additional capacity for natural gas and NGL volumes to ramp through 2020. There continues to be more than 60 rigs operating in the Williston Basin with approximately 25 rigs on our dedicated acreage. These rig counts have remained relatively consistent as crude prices have fluctuated in recent months. We connected 610 wells in the Rocky Mountain region in 2018, exceeding our guidance of 550 wells and expect to connect approximately 620 wells in 2019. We also continued to see solid rig activity in the Powder River Basin where we have approximately 1 million acres dedicated to our Natural Gas Liquids segment and a 130,000 acres dedicated to our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. There are more than 20 rigs on our dedicated NGL acreage in the Powder River Basin currently and we continue to hear positive feedback from producers in the area. The southern portion of the Elk Creek pipeline from the Powder River Basin to the Mid-Continent remains on track to be complete as early as the third quarter 2019, with the entire Elk Creek pipeline expected to be fully in service in the fourth quarter of 2019. We have clear line of sight to Elk Creek reaching its initial contracted capacity of approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020, generating its targeted adjusted EBITDA multiple of four to six times within the first few months of operation.  We included a new slide in our earnings presentation yesterday that shows the various contributors to the expected volume ramp, which includes approximately 25,000 to 30,000 barrels of rail volume, approximately 25,000 barrels from Demicks Lake I, 10,000 to 15,000 barrels of Powder River volume and approximately 25,000 to 30,000 barrels from third-party plants that are currently under construction or being expanded. The Powder River volume will be moved to the southern portion of Elk Creek once complete in the third quarter to make additional room for Williston Basin volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline. Elk Creek volumes are expected to continue to increase throughout 2020. Moving on to the Mid-Continent. 2018 NGL volumes gathered in the Mid-Continent increased 17% compared with 2017. NGL volumes gathered from the region decreased in the fourth quarter 2018 compared with the third quarter 2018 due to increased ethane rejection and approximately 20,000 barrels per day of NGLs from a third-party plant which moved to a third party NGL pipeline, as expected and as we had previously disclosed. We completed the 60,000-barrel per day expansion of our Sterling III NGL pipeline in the fourth quarter and expect raw feed volumes to ramp up over the next 12 months. Our NGL pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu is approximately 90% utilized. Arbuckle II is under construction and on schedule for an expected completion in the first quarter of 2020. Initial capacity on Arbuckle II is 400,000 barrels per day. That will be expanded to 500,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2021. We continue to expect that transportation capacity from Conway to Mont Belvieu will remain highly utilized due to growing NGL volumes, which we expect will keep spreads wider than normal until Arbuckle II is placed in service. In our Gathering and Processing segment, 2018 Mid-Continent natural gas volumes processed increased more than 18% compared with 2017 and increased 8% in the fourth quarter 2018 compared with the third quarter 2018, benefiting from the completion of several large well pads that we previously mentioned had been delayed from the third quarter to the fourth quarter. We connected 138 wells in the Mid-Continent in 2018. During the fourth quarter, we completed the expansion of our Canadian Valley natural gas processing plant in the STACK, which brings our total Oklahoma processing capacity to approximately 1.1 billion cubic feet per day. In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we recently completed expansions on our ONEOK gas transportation pipeline system, which support growth in the STACK and SCOOP. The expansions included 100 million cubic feet per day of westbound capacity and a 100 million cubicle feet per day of eastbound capacity, which are fully subscribed under firm transportation agreements. An additional 50 million cubic feet per day expansion of the eastbound capacity is expected to be complete this quarter. Now a quick update on our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast operations. NGL volumes gathered on our West Texas LPG system averaged 200,000 barrels per day in 2018, a 5% increase compared with 2017. Since the first expansion of this system was fully placed in service in the fourth quarter, we have seen volumes ramp reaching more than 250,000 barrels per day on several days in 2019. Our Mont Belvieu fractionators continue to operate highly utilized and we remain on schedule to complete our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator in the first quarter of 2020. We expect MB-4 to exit 2020 full and for MB-5, which is also 125,000 barrels per day, to ramp up quickly once it's completed in the first quarter of 2021. ONEOK's total system-wide NGL fractionation capacity remains around 800,000 barrels per day, given our current product composition and we're utilizing approximately 90% of our fractionation capacity. We're currently undergoing debottlenecking projects that could add an additional 15,000 to 30,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity in 2019. These projects are in addition to the 20,000 barrel per day expansion of our Bushton, Kansas fractionator that we discussed on our third quarter call. We continue to expect that these debottlenecking projects, our current available capacity, our storage assets and a small amount of already contracted third-party offloads will provide sufficient capacity until MB-4 is complete. In our Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we have completed capital growth projects in the Permian Basin that include a 300 million cubic feet per day expansion of our WesTex Transmission pipeline system and a project to make our Roadrunner Gas Transmission pipeline bidirectional. Before I turn the call back to Terry, let's discuss our 2019 volume guidance, which incorporates recently announced customer activity levels. We expect our NGL throughput volume to be approximately 11% greater than 2018, driven by growth in all three of our operating regions. In our gathering and processing segment, we expect natural gas volumes processed to increase approximately 5% compared with 2018, primarily from growth in the Williston Basin. Additionally, with our Demicks Lake I plant coming online in the fourth quarter, we expect our 2019 exit rate for volumes processed in the Williston Basin to be approximately 20% higher than our current processed volume level. Our 2019 NGL volume guidance was provided yesterday using a new volume disclosure. The new metric is NGL raw feed throughput volume and it represents all physical raw feed volume on which ONEOK charges a fee for transportation, fractionation or a bundled fee for both services. This is the volume metric that we use internally and we believe better represents the key drivers to our earnings. We have provided historical comparisons of the new metric and plan to provide actual gathered and fractionated volumes for a period of time for comparison purposes. Please reach out to our Investor Relations team if you have questions regarding the change. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Kevin. Good color on 2018 operations and drivers in 2019. As we sit today, ONEOK is in a great position with an extensive and integrated system of assets in some of the country's most productive basin. I truly believe that one of the reasons we've been successful over the years is, because of our focus, meaning our focus on doing what we do well and doing what is best for our customers, investors and for ONEOK in the long term. We have a large growth program in progress right now, but we're not growing just to grow. Getting bigger isn't the point. We're focused on our customers and we're growing to meet their needs. We're focused on our investors and investing in attractive return projects. We're focused on our balance sheet and growing our strong asset positions and we remain focused on growing the right way, by being mindful of the environment and the safety of our employees, contractors and local communities. The hard work of our 2,700 employees and the support of our investors have enabled us to continue to grow our operations in a way that meets the needs of our customers, stakeholders and investors. A big thank you to all of you for a successful 2018. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hi. Good morning everybody. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Mike. Michael Blum : Just a few quick questions. One, your comments on the dividend. So I, obviously, understand you're not providing a new dividend growth rate, but should we take this to mean that you're definitely signaling that you'll be lowering the growth rate going forward? Terry Spencer : No, you should not. What we've done is we've just reminded you of the process that we've always used for making a determination on what we pay each quarter in terms of the dividend. The dividend growth guidance is still out there. We haven't changed it, but we're just reminding you that given all the discussions that are out there in the marketplace today about this topic, we continue to employ the same process that we used each and every quarter. And our board, if they decide to make a change, given all the facts and circumstances that we face today, then we'll let you know. Right now, yeah, we think that the process that we use is still intact and still in place and that guidance is still out there. Michael Blum : Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you. On -- just wanted to ask you a question on leverage. Should we just think -- given that you're not going to issue equity, should we expect that leverage will kind of flex higher into 2019 and then come back down in 2020 as more of the projects come into service and EBITDA ramps up? Is that the right way to think about it? Walter Hulse : Yes, that's right Michael. But I think what I'd point out is that we're obviously entering the year at a very attractive spot to 3.75 times on a run rate basis. So, as we move through the year and CapEx as we get to the back-end of the year in the fourth quarter, leverage will peak up a little bit just as we're bringing those assets online and starting the cash flow in the fourth quarter and into the first quarter of 2020. Michael Blum : Okay great. And then I don't think -- I just want to confirm that the 2019 CapEx range is there any capital in that number for the potential LPG export dock? Walter Hulse : No, there is not. Michael Blum : Great. That's all I had. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : Thanks and good morning. My first question is for Kevin. I noticed that you didn't outline any frac volume guidance for the quarter you're going forward. Do you see any visibility for an incremental frac going forward here just given how significant in flesh your NGL volumes are within your system? Kevin Burdick : Well, Danilo I think I'd go back to -- we feel confident I mean with the volume ramp we see as we look at our volumes going through 2019. When we look at the capacity we've got today we look at the storage we've got. We look at the expansions or the debottlenecking projects underway, we have a good outlook and having enough capacity that will bridge us till MB-4 comes online in the first quarter of 2020. Does that answer your question? Danilo Juvane : No, it does. Thank you for that. And as you kind of think about your CapEx specifically the high-end of that range obviously you've said no equity for the planned year but if you do hit that high-end of the range still no plans for equity? Walter Hulse : No. If we hit the high-end of the range we'll have seen a significant increase in producer activity and be bringing on these assets with very significant cash flow when they come online. So, we're still -- we're focused on the midpoint of our range, but we want to demonstrate that we have the flexibility to flex that depending on producer activity. Danilo Juvane : Thanks. Those were my questions. Operator : Our next question comes from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Terry I just want to circle back very quickly on Michael's question just around -- I think commentary. I mean you guys had one of the more sort of heads-up negotiation process with ONEOK Partners when you guys were doing the merger. I know that at that time the 9% to 11% growth rates through 2021 was sort of important consideration for them. Clearly 2021 is also a year where everything we know that you're building will be online and it sounds like from Kevin running pretty well where leverage will come down. So, I guess are you talking -- or were Walt's comments about the shareholder feedback and dividend versus other forms of shareholder return is that to be interpreted as something that's actively discussed in the near term or more around periods around just 2021 negotiation with ONEOK Partners campus community? Terry Spencer : I'll let Walt answer that question about his comments. Walter Hulse : Yes what I would tell you is that our board's practice has been to evaluate all of those options on a quarterly basis as we move forward here. And we just wanted to acknowledge to the marketplace that we are hearing feedback from folks and that is being translated into the discussions with the board. And just be another factor that they factor in but they have always considered whether alternatives to dividend growth or other ways to give back capital to the shareholders and I'll continue to look at those opportunities going forward. And at some point in the future they may make some sense. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. If I could two questions on CapEx or I guess cash flow. The 2018 growth CapEx was just a bit light of what the midpoint of your 2018 guidance. Assuming that's timing but just wanted to check on that? And then related you did have a working capital benefit last year that was not immaterial I'm just wondering if we should assume anything for the line items like that in 2019? Walter Hulse : Yes the CapEx is entirely timing. I mean nothing has changed whatsoever in our view of the scope of these projects. So, we have -- we're on budget and on time so as Kevin mentioned. So, it's just a function of timing and timing is through kind of how we factor through 2019 and 2020 as well. From the working capital standpoint, you've got significantly lower commodity prices at year end 2018 about 25% lower than they were in 2017 which is it gets reflected in both your accounts receivable and your account payable. And we had about $50 million less in inventory at the end of the year. So, nothing other than that that's really significant. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay great. One final question if I could for Kevin I think. Just on the NGL market dynamics particularly in the Mid-Continent that obviously you guys enjoyed a very strong spread environment in 2018 forecast a nice scenario in 2019 although not as frothy. I'm just wondering how -- I guess two questions related to that. How Shin Oak coming up and any available capacity that emerges on the MAPL system focuses in on what you're thinking in this guidance? And then second to that the Williams-Targa announcement on Bluestem and their comments about being able to move volumes off the third-party system. I don't know whose third-party system that is? It could be yours. Just wondering how that factors on your market view? Terry Spencer : Okay. Chris, I'm going to let Sheridan take that one. Sheridan Swords : Chris this is Sheridan. I'll first talk about the spreads between Conway and Belvieu. Yes, we're protecting a more narrow spread in 2019 than we saw in 2018. And some of the factors of what you said was Shin Oak coming on could have some downward or squeezing pressure between Conway and Belvieu. It just depends on how much purity products they can move out of the Conway market into Belvieu. In terms of -- as we go forward past 2019, as we said, Arbuckle II, when it comes online it will open up a lot of purity capacity on our system on the Sterling system that presently is being used for raw feed which we think will bring the spreads back into more of a historical or normal level a very narrow differential between the two markets. So, any additional capacity that's put in service between Conway and Belvieu past Arbuckle II, we really won't think we'll have a very limited impact on the spreads from where they are at that time. I'd also say on this you're talking about a third-party pipeline what I would say is we do not anticipate a material change in third-party volume that we currently fractionate and exchange in Mid-Continent that comes off of OPPL for many years in the future. So, with that -- but I also say that we do anticipate volume growth from Williams acquisition of Discovery created a need for additional capacity on OPPL. In this regard, we were able to reach an agreement with Williams to accommodate this potential growth in terms that are favorable to us. Also remember that we received an immediate EBITDA uplift from both shipping our barrels on our own 100% owned pipeline and from the additional third-party volume shipped on OPPL. We are pleased that OPPL continues to show both growth out of the D-J provide ONEOK with incremental benefits. Chris Sighinolfi : Yes, thanks a lot guys. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Just want to come back to the guidance here. In the range that you provided for EBITDA for 2019, if you could build a bit more on what'll be some of the drivers for the low-end versus the high-end there? And when we look at the 2020 guide kind of the 20% plus, is there like a certain commodity price environment that's kind of baked in there? Or any of the color that you could provide on that? Terry Spencer : No. Jeremy I think the key there is as with any year, a lot of will come down to just the actual volumes that are flowing and that'll be predicated based on producer activity. This year is kind of interesting and that especially in the Bakken you look at from a gathering and processing perspective with the flared gas backlog that provides us support if you will for that volume outlook in the Williston Basin. But at the same time we're bumping up against some capacity in both the G&P segment and the NGL segment. So clearly spreads could have an impact as we move through the year that could move you up or down a little bit. But by and large we feel good about the midpoint of that guidance range, given the volumes that we have flowing today, the line of sight we've got to growth coming out of the Permian on our West Texas expansion growth coming out of the Mid-Continent on the Sterling III expansion and then just a higher month-to-month volumes coming out of the Bakken. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. Thanks. And going back to the CapEx range real quick here. I just wanted to confirm you guys hadn't seen any kind of cost overruns here? And as far as the range you're talking about, it's simply just a matter of timing between whether projects spending falls into 2019 or 2020 depending on the commodity price environment and how quickly producers want this infrastructure? Terry Spencer : That's correct. All of our projects that we've announced are on schedule and on budget right now. So it's purely a timing -- the timing that we're talking about. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Two questions. One can you just talk about some of the commentary or feedback you've gotten from your producer or shipper customers from the Mid-Con? I\u2019m just kind of generically what are they saying about the environment today? How they're thinking about the next 12 months to 24 months production and volume-wise and kind of how that flows through to you guys? Terry Spencer : We're going to let Chuck Kelley take that question. Chuck Kelley : Thank you, Michael. Good question. What we're seeing in the Mid-Continent and STACK and SCOOP primarily for this year and maybe into the early part of next year, a lot of these producers that we deal with as you know have alternatives in other basins. They completely believe in the STACK and SCOOP. The inventory is there, the rock is good. We're all firm believers in that. We're still seeing good activity year-over-year. We had a great 2018 over 2017. So as we rode into 2019, we came in with a record volume of platform for us. We still see 2% growth year-over-year. So -- and what we're seeing primarily in the STACK and SCOOP, we're seeing more activity in the SCOOP than the STACK. So what you'll see from us this year we've seen some rig movements between us and other processors on dedicated acreage we'll still average in that eight rig to 10 rig count for the year. So we feel very good about our position in the STACK from a -- and SCOOP from a G&P standpoint. We have as you know a little better than 300,000 acres. But more importantly our NGL position and Sheridan can speak to that as to how many processing plants, he's connected to and the growth that he is still seeing in the Mid-Con. Sheridan? Sheridan Swords : Yes. We're connected to over 90% of the plants in the Mid-Continent and they all the new plants we've contracted on a long-term basis 10 years to 15 years old almost all the new plants that have come up in the last couple of years. And as Chuck said, we continue to talk to those customers and see the producers behind them. A lot of them are very excited about the growth prospects they see, even though, we've seen some producers back off a little bit. And in our volume guidance that we provided for 2019, we've already incorporated all these conversations and everything we've had with our producers on the NGL side as well as with the G&P side. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one follow-up on CapEx. Just trying to think about it like you've got so many large projects underway, whether it's the fracs, whether it's Arbuckle, Demicks Lake, how should we think about not just even 2020, but even kind of beyond that 2021 CapEx? Should we kind of think that growth CapEx slows materially, which means maybe there's less growth in EBITDA from new projects coming online, but there's also a sizable pickup in free cash? Or is there another wave of kind of major sizable projects like in Arbuckle or others and they simply haven't been announced yet? Terry Spencer : So let me take the first part of that question and then Kevin can follow-up. So if you just think back historically, we've had a number of these large organic growth programs over the past several years, and it seems like every time we talk about this very question, we answer this very question the same way, and we're going to probably answer at the same way. Again -- but we'll see this growth. And then what will happen is based upon the visibility that we perhaps don't have looking into -- looking two or three years down the road, we'll have the growth capital taper off okay? And so Kevin will tell that yes, as we go into 2020 and 2021, we -- our own internal forecast are indicating less capital to be spent. However, each and every time we have continued to -- as that visibility gets closer to us, we've been able to develop more projects and continue to keep the organic growth train going if you will. And so that's -- I mean, that's just historically that's how it has happened, and I think it's very possible that there's opportunity out there we don't know about yet that will come. So, Kevin anything to add there? Kevin Burdick : Yes. That's spot on. I think one of the ways to think about it is with these two -- primarily the two big pipes Arbuckle II and Elk Creek, we've more than doubled the back bundle if you will of our NGL system from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast. And so as we move forward with the operating leverage we have on those pipes to continue to expand it through low-cost pump stations that provides us the opportunity. So really future capital needs are things like maybe another processing plant in the Bakken and another fractionator in the Gulf Coast, which are in much smaller chunks than the large multi-billion-dollar projects that we've got underway right now. So I do think you're going to see that range down over time, but as Terry suggested, we'll continue to look for opportunities to generate nice returns on other projects as well. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Operator : Our next question comes from Jean Ann with Sanford Bernstein. Jean Ann : Hi. Good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on [Technical Difficulty] Terry Spencer : Jean Ann, I couldn't understand a word you said. It's -- but we've got a technical difficulty on your transmission for some reason. Did any of you pick up? Jean Ann : Is it any better? Terry Spencer : That's much better. Jean Ann : All right. Great. So I just wanted to follow-up Chris's question on Bluestem. Outside of the third-party, the Bluestem Grand [Technical Difficulty] Kevin Burdick : I think your question Jean Ann was do those plants have the option to switch? And what I would tell you is, as I said in my statement is that, all the plants we've contracted here lately are in 10 years to 15 years. So our contract that the dedication those plants have to the ONEOK System or for many years to come. So those plants are already dedicated to us and will not come on. Terry Spencer : So they don't have the ability to switch. Kevin Burdick : Yes. So they don't have the ability to switch. Jean Ann : Okay. Thanks. And can you give a sense as to what [Technical Difficulty] Kevin Burdick : We have not hedged any of the $0.10 around the Conway to Belvieu spread. It's very -- it's difficult to get forward numbers on Conway and a lot those products. At times we will forward sell a little bit where we store one month's product and ship it in the following month a little bit of it, but it is very difficult to hedge the north-south on a long-term basis. So you just don't have the liquidity. Jean Ann : Okay. Sorry, about the echo. Great. It makes sense. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Dennis Coleman with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Dennis Coleman : Hi. Good morning. My question I guess maybe to follow-up a little bit on your discussion from the question with Michael. Should we think about sort of the next wave of projects as being tied to some of the discussion about crude oil pipeline takeaway out of the Bakken? And as we see announcements there potentially we could see you start to talk about your growth projects beyond 2020? Terry Spencer : Well, you get a long-term and maybe it would be. But if you look over the next two years or three years, we feel comfortable and as we talk to our customers that both crude and residue takeaway, there will be enough there to provide pretty significant growth over the next few years. And so I don't know that I would tie our next plant or additional capacity, we may need in the Bakken over the next two years or three years to a crude oil solution. I mean, you've got a couple open seasons out there that are being looked at. You've got some other expansion opportunities that I know people are floating around. So again right now our producers feel pretty good about their crude takeaway, and then you've always got crude by rail that can get you to the coast as they bridge, if you will to get to a pipe if they need it. Dennis Coleman : Okay. Thanks for that. I guess, then my follow-up. Can you just give a little bit of color about the debottlenecking projects that you talked about the 15,000, I guess the 15,000 to 30,000 a day of frac capacity and what's the nature of those projects are? Terry Spencer : That's just a -- there's several items in those numbers that will span just from very low-cost expansions and some different equipment that we could put in some different controls, we could put in that could squeak out at three or four different facilities an extra 5,000 or 6,000 barrels a day. Dennis Coleman : And is that something -- are these something that can happen in a month or two or second half of the year? Terry Spencer : They'll range. Some of them may happen very quickly others may take a few months if we've got to order some vessels or equipment that might have a longer lead time to them. Dennis Coleman : Okay. That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with the Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Craig. Craig Shere : Picking up on Michael and Chris' questions on the dividend. Terry Spencer : We can't hear you Craig, you're breaking up. Craig Shere : Can you hear me now? Is this better? Terry Spencer : That's better. Craig Shere : As CapEx drops materially by the second quarter 2020, wouldn't you envision capacity to both sustain up to low-double digit dividend growth and consider share buybacks? And how do you think about fair value for the shares given the really massive very low-cost organic growth built-in with completion of both of those very large NGL pipelines with massive upsizing? Walt Hulse : Well, Craig what I would tell you is that you're absolutely right that as we go into the back half of 2020 and then into 2021 and 2022, we expect to have a very significant cash flow in excess of dividends. And we basically have a three-tier approach to thinking about that. And our first approach is to try to find very attractive growth projects that we can go ahead and build. Our second approach is to make sure that our balance sheet is as strong as we possibly can have it. And then after we've done those two, we surely will put the possibility of share buybacks in the mix and think about that. And -- but that will be a discussion at the board level as we get out there a couple of years. Craig Shere : Do you have any thoughts on fair value? I mean, obviously, the leverage from continuing to fill up Elk Creek and Arbuckle II is substantial as we look beyond 2020. So one would assume that you could sustain above-average growth rates? Walt Hulse : Yeah. No, if you're asking me if I think our stock is under priced the answer is, yes. I think we've got very significant growth ahead of us. And it really comes down to the cadence with, which that growth will come on the pipes. But I think the fact that we've been able to guide you achieving our 100,000 barrels a day in the first quarter of operation in Elk Creek and the significant contracting that's gone above and beyond that initial 100,000 really leads to very attractive growth going forward. Craig Shere : That sounds good. And my last question, I don't know who wants to take it maybe Terry. But you guys built over like a decade and a half a dominant Bakken in the Mont Belvieu position that no one else has. But the Permian through Mont Belvieu to LPG export market is certainly comparatively more crowded. Certainly there's a lot of synergies from moving into LPG exports, but how do you think about the competitive landscape there? Terry Spencer : Well, certainly it's significantly more competitive than our other areas. However, we've been pretty effective competitor. When we linked the West Texas system with our infrastructure in the Gulf Coast and basically brought it into the ONEOK's system proper, it changed the game for us, and we're seeing it in the volume performance particularly in the Permian. So the exports are a natural progression for us in the value chain. And it's not something that we absolutely have to have, but we certainly believe that it's a strategic and important component for us that I think will do a great job as, if and when we get a project put together. It certainly enhances our ability to market internationally for obvious reasons. I will now tell you that we market internationally today even though we don't operate a dock. But I think if you have a dock or an export terminal, it will certainly substantiate us as a true international player year. So, all that fits together well. And on top of that it's a business that's a fee-based component. So it fits well contractually as well and so there you go. Craig Shere : Good. And how would you compare the all-in costs of that potential announcement to say a new frac or new processing train? Terry Spencer : If you think about how we're approaching the project and I'll let Sheridan make a comment after me. But if you think about how we're approaching it which is primarily with a joint venture partner that there will be the export terminal itself will have some have partial will have partial ownership in that but then also there's infrastructure that has to be built around the terminal interconnection to storage facilities, connections to markets and connections to our system proper. You're talking about a cost net to ONEOK roughly in the $0.5 billion range. So from an order of magnitude of capital that's what we're talking about. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Q \u2013 Alex Kania : Thanks for taking my questions. This is just more of a clarification question. For the 2019 outlook, are you baking in kind of a consequence related to Shin Oak coming into service this year? Or were you talking mainly about the 2020 impacts? A \u2013 Kevin Burdick : I think when we set out our guidance for what 2019 is going to be and we looked at what the Conway to Belvieu spread is in 2019, we did take into consideration that Shin Oak could possibly create some more capacity for purity products between Conway and Belvieu and I think that's why you see that our number is a little bit lower than it was in 2018. Q \u2013 Alex Kania : Okay, great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal : Yeah, hi good morning guys. Thanks for all the clarity and the call. Just wanted to go back to the balance sheet and leverage question a little bit. So it seems like there is a potential for you to kind of expand the fairway for potential projects and CapEx. I was wondering is there kind of a maximum leverage that you will look at when you think about that CapEx especially considering that some of these projects will be longer-lead projects? A \u2013 Walter Hulse : Well, I'm not going to put a specific number out there. I think you can do the numbers based on the CapEx, but we've put out the significant cash flow growth that we expect to see this year and going into the coming years. We think we'll be in line with what the rating agencies have put out there publicly and kind of the expectation in the marketplace. We'll definitely be moving above four times for a very short period of time and as we get through the construction phase. But as we come down into 2020, the significant incremental EBITDA and cash flow delevers us very quickly than in the 2021. Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal : Okay. So four and maybe 4.5x kind of max out there and then obviously 2020 cash flow growth will probably bring it on pretty quickly, is that the right way to think about that? A \u2013 Walter Hulse : I think you're in the ballpark and you can do the math yourself, but I don't think you're too far off. Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. And then one last one from me. In terms of management's view on industry consolidation opportunities especially what we've seen so far is probably more like project consolidation. Do you see opportunities for even corporate consolidations opening up in the current environment? A \u2013 Terry Spencer : Sunil I think you're right, we have seen a lot of asset consolidation and we've seen asset JVs too. But I think you're going to see more of that just I think that the corporate consolidation is obviously than other than some of the structural things we've seen over the course of the last year I think from a straight up corporate consolidation we still have time yet before that that starts to happen. I think -- again I think we're going to see it but it's going to take some time. Q \u2013 Sunil Sibal : Okay, got it. Thanks. Operator : We have no more questions in the queue at this time. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Andrew Ziola : Well thank you everybody. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extends until we release earnings in early May. We'll provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and the IR team will be available throughout the afternoon. Have a good rest of your day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Todd and good morning and welcome to ONEOK's first quarter 2019 earnings conference call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. I'll make a few brief comments and then turn the call over to Walt to discuss our first quarter financial highlights. To start, we've continued to see an improving industry backdrop since January. Crude prices have strengthened, producers remain active across our operations and our capital growth program remains on track and on budget. Project construction is progressing very well with our ability to predict expected completion dates improving every week. As it looks today, we now expect the southern section of the Elk Creek pipeline to be complete early in the third quarter of this year and the entire pipeline complete during the fourth quarter. The Arbuckle II pipeline and MB-4 fractionator are expected to be complete in the first quarter of 2020. Keep in mind, the earlier these projects are completed and are placed into service, the earlier ONEOK begins to recognize earnings on them. Based on producer activity and the progress on our projects and assuming no dramatic market change, ending the year at the low end of our capital guidance range is less likely than it was in February. To the extent that we may be above the guidance midpoint of $3.1 billion, we would be spending construction dollars in 2019 that were previously planned for 2020 and accelerating the in-service dates for some projects. Last week, we announced an extension of our Bakken NGL pipeline in North Dakota to connect with a third party natural gas processing plant. We're not only connecting an additional plant, we're reaching into a new area of the Bakken and providing NGL takeaway in Williams County, which historically has had limited transportation options. And by doing so, we are enhancing our ability to provide potential NGL transportation services to more customers. Additionally, our commercial team continues to evaluate a potential NGL export facility on the Gulf Coast. As this opportunity continues to evolve and develop, we will provide further details as appropriate. After more than a year of taking about our capital growth projects, we are nearing completion on several of them. Over the coming months, these projects will add critical NGL takeaway, fractionation and natural gas processing capacity for our customers where they need it the most, providing ONEOK with substantial long-term fee-based earnings and cash flow growth. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for comments on our first quarter results. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's first quarter 2019 net income totaled $337 million or $0.81 per share, a 27% increase year-over-year and first quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $638 million, a 12% increase year-over-year. All three business segments recorded double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth compared with the first quarter 2018. Distributable cash flow in the first quarter 2019 was more than $500 million, but more than 17% from the first quarter 2018 with a healthy dividend coverage of 1.43 times. We continued to reinvest in the business, generating more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the first quarter 2019. During the first quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.86 per share and in April, we announced an increase to $0.865 per share or $3.46 per share on an annualized basis. The dividend is payable on May 15 to shareholders of record on April 29. Our March 31, debt to EBITDA, on an annualized run rate basis, was 4.0 times and 4.1 times on a trailing 12 month basis. We ended the first quarter with total available liquidity of $3.25 billion, including borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and $750 million available on our three-year unsecured term loan agreement. As Terry mentioned, the industry environment has strengthened since the fourth quarter and construction on some of our largest projects could be completed early in the quarter as we've specified. We have clear line of sight to the ramp and timing of expected cash flows on these projects, which combined with our strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, continues to underscore our expectation for no equity financing needs in 2019 or 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operating performance. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. I'll walk through each of our operating areas and touch on a few more highlights related to operations in our projects. Starting with the Rockies region, raw feed NGL throughput volume on the Bakken NGL pipeline averaged 167,000 barrels per day in the first quarter with most of this growth attributable to increasing volumes being railed from the basin. Natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region increased to more than 1 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter, as we continued to see strong producer activity and record North Dakota natural gas production in January. We estimate more than 250 million cubic feet per day of natural gas is currently being flared on ONEOK's acreage, providing a clear backlog of volume to fill Demicks Lake I, when it begins service in the fourth quarter of this year. We expect additional flared natural gas and continued strong production to provide for a quick volume ramp of Demicks Lake II, which is expected to come online in the first quarter of 2020. Each of these plants, when full, are expected to provide approximately 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs to our Elk Creek Pipeline, not including ethane recovery. We continue to expect Elk Creek to reach approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020 with volumes increasing throughout 2020 and beyond. At volumes of 100,000 barrels per day, Elk Creek will be generating its targeted adjusted EBITDA multiple of four to six times within its first few months of operation. In addition, we now have secured contracts with natural gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region that can produce up to 200,000 barrels per day of NGLs, up from 170,000 barrels per day previously reported. The Williston Basin continues to average more than 60 rigs operating with approximately 25 rigs on our dedicated acreage. If crude prices sustain around $60 to $65 per barrel, we could see additional rigs move into the basin once NGL takeaway capacity and natural gas processing capacity are completed this year. Feedback from producers in the Powder River Basin also remains positive, where we continue to have more than 20 rigs on our dedicated NGL acreage. Moving onto the Mid-Continent, NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased approximately 4% in the first quarter 2019 compared with the same period last year. Volumes decreased in the first quarter of 2019 relative to the fourth quarter of 2018, primarily due to the impact of winter weather in the first quarter and some short-term volume we only gathered in second half of 2018. Construction on Arbuckle II pipeline is on track for completion in the first quarter of 2020 and our total contracted capacity on Arbuckle II is now 350,000 barrels per day compared with 320,000 barrels per day previously. In our gathering and processing segment, winter weather impacts and the delayed timing of several well completions contributed to the decline in natural gas volumes processed in the Mid-Continent in the first quarter 2019 compared with the fourth quarter 2018. Producer activity on our acreage in the STACK and SCOOP areas remains in line with our expectations and we're on track to be within our volume guidance range. In our natural gas pipelines segment, contracted pipeline capacity increased 10% compared with the first quarter 2018. This increase was driven by recent pipeline project completions in both the Mid-Continent region and the Permian Basin. These strategic expansions have helped alleviate natural gas pipeline constraints in these areas, as we've been able to provide much needed takeaway for our customers. Now, taking a closer look at our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast operations, NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 7% compared with the fourth quarter 2018, primarily driven by increased volume on our West Texas LPG pipeline system, including a ramp in volumes from our completed extension into the Delaware Basin. Additionally, the average NGL fee rate associated with our Gulf Coast Permian volumes increased to an average of $0.05 per gallon in the first quarter 2019. The higher rate is primarily being driven by increased bundled service volumes or transportation and fractionation volumes on West Texas LPG. Volume on this pipeline has historically been lower margin, transport only barrels, but as legacy volumes roll off, we are replacing them with higher margin transportation and fractionation volume, which we expect will cause this average rate to continue trending upward. ONEOK's system-wide NGL fractionation capacity is approximately 810,000 barrels per day, given our current product composition and this capacity remains approximately 90% utilized. We continue to look at several debottlenecking projects that could add 40,000 to 50,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity in 2019 and early 2020 and be efficiently completed at costs substantially lower than new construction. These de-bottlenecking projects are expected to provide capacity to help bridge us to the early first quarter 2020 completion of our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator, which we expect will exit 2020 at full capacity. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. We've had a great start to 2019 and are looking forward to getting a number of these projects to the finish line in the coming months. The credit goes to our employees who remain extremely focused on operating our existing assets and building new ones safely and responsibly. We'll be putting hundreds of miles of pipeline and several facilities into service later this year and into next, which will dramatically increase the scale of our operations and provide much needed infrastructure and services for our customers. Our employees work every day to provide solutions for these customers, to enhance our business and to make ONEOK even more sustainable for the long term, all while focusing on safety and reliability, limiting our impact on the environment and providing value to our investors. Again, I want to express my thanks to all of our employees. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our first question from Christine Cho of Barclays. Christine Cho : I wanted to start off with the lateral to the Bakken NGL line. I think the processor that you're connecting to their other processing plants have been connected to different NGL takeaway solutions. Can you provide us some color on what's going on with those other options and why they finally came to you? Also my guess is the capacity of the pipeline even though you guys haven't disclosed it, it's much more than the contract is. Can you give us an idea of what other opportunities you have along the line? Sheridan Swords : Christine, this is Sheridan. I think once we get Elk Creek in line that the customers up there are seeing that our alternative for NGL takeaway nets them a greater net back than going the existing route, and as they continue to expand up in that area that their existing outlets are limited and they need that extra capacity. And you are correct, we are putting in a line that could move probably over 200,000 barrels a day, the lateral going over there. We see today other processing plants in the area that this pipeline goes by are producing approximately 10,000 barrels a day. But as we talk to people in the area that 10,000 barrels a day could grow to as much as 40,000 barrels per day in the near future. Christine Cho : And then moving over to just sort of the ethane with also Permian ethane that's coming out, and I think pressuring ethane prices in the event Conway ethane frac spread remains negative. Should we think that third-party processing plants are rejecting the ethane. So there's less supply of ethane showing up at Conway for you to optimize. Just some color and how we should think about that? Sheridan Swords : I think you're right. As long as you keep Conway ethane in rejection which is sitting there today, you will have about the same amount of ethane, you have today. It may grow a little bit as we bring on couple new plants in the second quarter. But remember, not every plants can't reject \u2013 not every plant can reject all the ethane. There some ethane that has to come out naturally anyway on our system. So I think what we're seeing today is what we think we'll see going forward if we stay in a time when Conway going to stand in ethane rejection. Kevin Burdick : And Christine it's Kevin. I mean you've also got the significant amount of demand for more ethane coming on in the back half of 2019 as well. So that's going to be, that's going to pull more ethane out also. Christine Cho : And can you give us an idea of, like the utilization on Sterling I and II for the quarter? Terry Spencer : We just finished the expansion of Sterling III and we really operate those pipelines altogether they move around and we're a little bit under 90% for the total system. Christine Cho : And then last question for me, I just wanted to make sure, can you remind us on the LPG export project any partner that you guys bring on would be someone who would take the volumes, yes or might think about it? Kevin Burdick : Yes Christine this is Kevin. Well, I think it could we're exploring a lot of alternatives but yeah, especially as you think about ethane that would be a scenario that could play out LPGs might have a different approach, but we're working with the markets, on both sides. And we're working with others as well and still working through the details of what that, what that might look like. Christine Cho : When you say both sides do you mean ethane and LPG I'm sorry ethane? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Two questions from me one, some of the recent data coming out of the government and Bakken production shows a decline in the last couple of months. So I wondering if you just comment in terms of any trends you're seeing in terms of overall production trends in the Bakken? Kevin Burdick : Well Michael, this is Kevin. I mean from a gas perspective we set a record in January. So that's always a good sign February, you had quite a bit of weather, not necessarily abnormal, but that pulled production back a little bit which is, standard kind of operating procedure this time of year. There is the feedback we're getting from not only our G&P customers, but then there\u2019s already been a couple calls from some of the other processors up there, the results have been incredibly strong. So we don't see any pullback of volumes of rigs and the results seem to keep getting stronger. Michael Blum : The second question I had was on this potential LPG export project. I was wondering if you just talk to some of the competitive dynamics and return expectations you would have. I'm sure you're well aware that one of the big players in that market is out very publicly talking about basically keeping their rates down to keep competition out of the markets. So I was wondering if you could just kind of talk about the competitive dynamics and what returns would look like for a project like this. Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Michael, we are seeing it's a very competitive market out there on the LPG side and if we would get into the LPG and ethane. It would be a very strategic move that we see that we need to be able to clear our product and be able to incite more ethane to come out. So it's a bigger look and just straight economics. No doubt the economics would be more compressed than we've seen on some of the recent projects, but we think it's a long-term play if we would go that route that we would do. Kevin Burdick : So I think, Michael, this is Kevin. I think we've said and we continue to maintain that the project will - the project will stand on its own merits. So as we look at that obviously, the economics will be key but Sheridan is right it's a very competitive landscape out there for the project. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet of JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted just wanted to touch on Elk Creek and how that was going with the contracting side, if anything was added since the last quarter and kind of what enabled you to pull forward the timeframe here. It seems like pipeline project seem to be pulling backwards as opposed to be pulling forward so I\u2019m wondering what we were able to accomplish? Terry Spencer : We'll start with the contracting. As I said in my remarks that we were now 200,000 barrels a day contracted out of the Rockies region that will ultimately we believe hit Elk Creek. As for the construction and our teams just jumped, they've done a great job executing as we've gone through the first stages of the project as we move forward. We've been very open about starting with the southern section and the team has made great project even through some tough weather and some very wet weather in the winter and early spring. But still on track and got comfortable that we now think it's going to be that southern section, can be complete early in the third quarter. So just a great job of executing so far by our project team as it relates to write away acquisition and getting the pipe in the ground. Jeremy Tonet : And looking at the Mid-Con looks things have step down a little bit 1Q versus 4Q for some of the volumes you had. Just wondering how you see that kind of trending over the balance of the year. Has there been any change as far as producer communications for their activity levels are things kind of within the band of what you expect? Chuck Kelley : Jeremy, this is Chuck. I'd say Mid-Con we got a good start to the year with our 32 well connects and the number of rigs operating. On our acreage are consistent with our plan and with guidance volumes were within the band of guidance. So we feel good about our numbers balance of the year in Mid-Con and in talking with some of the producers we actually see some of the rigs movement moving to our acreage on the SCOOP later in the year end of Q2 end of Q3. So overall, I just think we're one on pace with our guidance for the year. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi of Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Thanks for your time today. Terry I am not sure this for you or if this Walt, but just wanted to follow up on the discussion we had on the last quarter call about the pace of your dividend growth. Was just, I've noticed in subsequent presentations following that discussion that the 9% to 11% rate that you previously discussed and featured. You no longer peers obviously, the pace of growth has decelerated over the last two quarters below that range unless there is a subsequent step up later in the year. So I'm just I'm not advocating for a particular range or saying that there's something optimal I\u2019m just trying to figure out how to interpret what we've seen and what you guys are thinking at this point? Walt Hulse : Well, as far as the omission I wouldn't read anything into that. We've been clear on that guidance and it hadn't changed. We established that guidance shortly after the consolidation transaction. So it's in place. So I wouldn't read anything into that. I think as the Board thinks about as we go into the balance of the year and it thinks about our dividend policy going forward, obviously we got the guidance there. But I think the most important fact they will take into consideration is just a tremendous cash flow growth that we see for the company. Business is performing extremely well and particularly with these projects coming online earlier and the growth opportunities we continue to develop, the free cash flow generation really its continuing to exceed our expectations as we look out, so that will be the key thing that they take into consideration as I think about the dividend policy going forward. Chris Sighinolfi : The baseline view is still a view around the 9% to 11% that you're talking about? Walt Hulse : Absolutely that guidance is still there, so. Chris Sighinolfi : And then I guess maybe for Kevin or for Sheridan. We had previously chatted about heat content in the Bakken as it pertains to Northern Border and the fact that, ethane rejection might not just be a economic decision, but maybe an operational one. I'm just wondering where we shake out on that a lot of processing set to come up later this year and into next year, but curious how the dynamics look today? Kevin Burdick : Yes, this is Kevin and yes, that's still something we watch very closely and stay in touch with - as you push with the basin being in ethane rejection right now you're pushing more and more high BTU content gas into Northern Border, that trend will continue and you're right, if you think about them Demicks 1 and Demicks 2 and the target has plant and Crestwood's expansion and you think about those that all the capacity there and all that residue making its way to Northern Border, clearly we're watching the BTU content at the bottom of border very closely. As we've said, we have the ability, as does the rest of the processors up there to recover ethane. Now, we need to get out Creek and service first before we would have the capacity to do that. But once we have Elk Creek in service, then we've got that's a nice option, we have as an industry, to be able to lower the BTU content on border if we start seeing downstream market impacts. Chris Sighinolfi : And kind of why have you. Just a follow-up on Michael's earlier question about the export dock. I think you said that the project would have to stand on its own. So in terms of returns you guys have talked for a while about getting into that market. Michael referenced that you are talking about aggressively pricing their capacity, we shouldn't think about there being maybe a sub-optimal return on getting access to that space made up or through later expansions or anything like that. Walt Hulse : Yes, I mean I wouldn't think about it that way that you're going to see periods of time where competition for spot space or it to the extent that there is excess capacity on these docs, you're going to see some dock on dock competition that will pressure margins. But as we think about this project, we\u2019re thinking about it long-term contracting solid returns even relative to our other investments that we have obviously, the project itself, it would be a strategic move for us, making sure that we have the ability to clear barrels. We could have the ability to clear barrels even without of dock, longer term, but it's better if we have dock. So, but as Kevin indicated, we're looking at all our options and again it's a project that we are investing a lot of time in and certainly it's a capability that would add value to our existing suite of capabilities. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lapides of Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Actually I have a couple of them. First of all, your thought for a while about the expansion capability at either Elk Creek and Arbuckle II just with pumps. How are you thinking about the timeline for when you would potentially implement that and would you do it kind of staggered or you think the market warrants like bigger leaps? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan, obviously is we're starting to get contract up to 200,000 barrels a day. That is really on our mind when we put it in. We have the ability to stagger it, you don't have to go all the way on Elk Creek to the $400,000, there's intermediate steps you can just put a couple of pumps in here in a couple of pumps and there and get incremental capacity, so we can do that in stages we go on but definitely as we reach this 200,000 barrel a day mark. We are definitely looking at when we want to expand that pipeline because we want to make sure that we have the capacity to meet the customers' needs up there and don't get into an issue where the pumps are delayed by anyway by any means. Kevin Burdick : And the only thing I would add on to that. This is Kevin, the contracted volumes that we talk about and we report really C3 plus volumes and they don't assume any ethane being extracted, so as we also think about our capacity on Elk Creek, we want to make sure we've got the ability and have some capacity available that if we back to Chris' question that if we do need to pull some ethane out because of downstream spec issues or the issues on board in the BTU content that we have the capacity to be able to do that. So we factor that into our thoughts on capacity expansions as well. Michael Lapides : And then on with debottlenecking projects for the fracs. Can you talk a little bit about how much incremental capacity you think you're adding to that and when you think you get that completed? Sheridan Swords : That's what we said, we were at 30,000 to 40,000 barrels a day of additional, we think we can get. You will see some of that maybe 10 to 20-ish and that we expect will get probably in 2019 with the balance in early 2020. Michael Lapides : And then last thing, the rates of the margin, on West Texas, meaning the Permian in the Gulf Coast, you've talked about going from $0.04 to $0.05, and more importantly you made the comment about it kind of continuing to creep higher. How should we think about that? How do you want investors to think about how much higher that could creep? Are you talking about just kind of slow and gradual are you talking about moving closer to the rates you're getting in the Mid-Con. I just want to kind of frame that a little bit? Sheridan Swords : It\u2019s Sheridan again. What I would say is that it's, I wouldn't say it's going to be slow and gradual, obviously we have the next expansion coming on West Texas pipeline that is contracted and when those volumes come up. They will almost be contracted at a rate twice as our average when that volume comes on. And then obviously we know that we will be losing some legacy volume as other pipelines come on and we have contracted that space as well. So I think there's two big leaps we will see in that rate going up. One is, when we complete the second expansion of the West Texas and the other one will be when their pipelines are completed out of there and volume comes off and we were able to replace it without volumes that we've contracted at the market rate and not at below-market rate. Operator : We'll take our next question from Dennis Coleman of Bank of America. Dennis Coleman : I guess, if I wonder if I might ask a little bit more strategic question. You talk about the export docks and how you enter that market. M&A has been the topic that's come up quite a bit in recent weeks with some of the M&A and on the producer side and just some producer activity. How do you think about the M&A market, particularly with your currency being attractive as it is for that? Terry Spencer : Yes, well, as far as the M&A market goes, we think about it quite a bit. The effect of the meant is the challenge there course is transact ability, when you think about the opportunity set that this company has heavy organic tremendous returns, low-risk projects relative to say much more strategic or exotic M&A. So we remain focused on this organic growth opportunity set that we have. So it's difficult for us to rationalize the risk associated with some of these transactions that we think that we think about, we'll look, we'll look we have investment bankers coming to us with their own ideas and what makes sense, but you know whenever seems to have a deal ready to do, so we stay focused on what we do and that\u2019s build in this infrastructure in these basins where we have these great, positions. I mean, candidly, when you look at it just purely on an accretion basis, just look at on DCF per unit accretion, these organic projects blow away any M&A transaction. So that's why we stay focused and you continue to execute heavily on the organic side. Does it help you? Operator : We'll take our next question from Sunil Sibal of Seaport Capital. Sunil Sibal : Couple of questions from me, starting out on the Permian side of things, seems like, how should we think about 150,000 to 200,000 kind of barrels per day of NGL volumes on that pipeline contracted \u2013 rolling over the next 1 to 2, 3 years? Terry Spencer : I think you will be over 200,000, yeah I think you'd be close to 300,000 barrels a day over the next couple of years on that pipeline moving. You already today approaching, 250,000 barrels, that's moving on the pipeline. So I think, we will be over 300,000 next couple of years, easily. Sunil Sibal : Actually I was kind of trying to get some color on the legacy contracts that you have on that pipeline, how should those contracts been rolling over in the next one, two, three years? Kevin Burdick : I think most of them will come off that we see coming off will come off in 2019. Sunil Sibal : And then on the CapEx side of things. Seems like on the growth CapEx side you spent close to it $850 million this quarter, how should we think about cadence of that over the remainder of the year? Terry Spencer : Yes we, I mean think about our projects, especially the big four we are in the heavy construction as we went through the first quarter. We\u2019ll continue heavy construction as we go through the second and third quarter. Every project kind of has a natural flow as far as when the capital spent and as you get towards the end it tapers off a little bit so as you see that, but what could change that is again. We're doing everything we can to accelerate these projects that purely from a timing perspective, you might see some dollars. If we're above the guidance we would be, it would just be a shift from $20 into 2019 or vice versa. It's just literally the timing of how that would play out at the end of the year. Sunil Sibal : And then just a clarification on the dividend growth policy, I think previously the policy has been 9% to 11% annual rate. Is there any thought on kind of thinking about that rate on an average basis over the next three years or so, just to kind of manage your CapEx spend, or should we just think about 9% to 11% every year through 2021? Terry Spencer : So the Board is going to continue to take it up on a quarter-by-quarter basis. But what I would tell you is that the fundamental of our business continues to strengthen, given us plenty of earnings to support our dividend growth. And we have not adjusted our dividend growth guidance and we'll let the Board look at it, but we have strong earnings to support our guidance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jean Salisbury of Bernstein. Jean Salisbury : What a Basin turnaround from the Bakken, if it is pursued the overall good or bad for what else I can kind of see both sides that would be interested in your view of the impact? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think, this is Kevin. I think clearly anytime there's addition. We don't want to be takeaway constrained right. And so we're always looking for ways to ensure that we have the takeaway for our customers up there. And so that will involve you look at residue in a couple of different ways. And so, I think it would come down to what type of rate, what type of term, and what type of volume commitments that would be required to make a project like that work versus alternatives, that the basin might have of other ways to handle the residue, which would also include handling some of the residue by recovering ethane. So I think that's still under. As we look through it and we\u2019ll be thinking through that, but clearly having. We don't want the Basin to be takeaway constrained from the producer standpoint, we want them to be able to continue to drill. Jean Salisbury : And then there's some concern by investors of a fractionation overbuild over the next couple of years, how much of your Mont Belvieu fractionation is take or pay or perhaps otherwise protected? Terry Spencer : Most of our new stuff coming on has very limited take or pay and that the market in these last couple rounds as built as not supported take or pay economics. But what I would say is that Mont Belvieu fractionation position and we anticipated the four and five being full, but under the scenario that they wouldn't we're not full we always have the option to take barrels that were fracking in the Mid-Continent moving down to the Gulf Coast and collect the additional Conway to Belvieu spread on that piece, but I don't think. What I'm seeing today with what's coming on. Now, there may be a little bit of short-term overcapacity in the fractionation market. But I think long term beaten up pretty quickly. And also remember that a lot of the players that are building these fracs today are storing raw feed and they will have to frac that off once they come on. So it's not just new production its production that's coming on. Now that we do not have enough frac capacity to today. Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Shere of Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Three quick questions around Elk Creek, the growth that we're seeing out of the Bakken or out of the Rockies is being railed and the rail volumes have, if I understand that de minimis margins currently. So when the southern leg of Elk Creek opens up and we have more capacity upstream the Bakken NGL line, those volumes kind of immediately get what$0.20plus bump in margin? Terry Spencer : Yes, you\u2019re pretty close. Craig Shere : And on the 200,000 a day ultimate capacity that's been contracted in the Rockies, two questions on that. One, how long do you think that that could take to reach full capacity on those contracts. And two, can you break it down between Bakken and DJ? Terry Spencer : I think we will ramp up to that 200,000 fairly quickly. I would say probably as we get into 2021, we will see that volume be at that rate up to 200,000 barrels. And once again, as Kevin said, that is assuming no ethane, if anything comes on your reset a lot quicker, so I think it take a little bit of time. I think the last piece will come in the delay on the last piece would be. We got to get the lateral over which will be completed the end of 2020.And then it would you repeat your last part of the question? Craig Shere : I wanted to get a sense where it's all sourcing from in terms of proportion from the Bakken or DJ? Terry Spencer : I would say about 70% to 80% coming out of the Bakken. Craig Shere : Right. And one last versus\u2026 Chuck Kelley : Craig, just before you, before you move on, really a lot of those volumes are coming out of the powder not as DJ. Terry Spencer : Yes, 80% of the Bakken and almost the almost the rest of it's all out of the Powder River. Craig Shere : And the last question I noticed DCF coverage in the quarter was aided by lower sequential maintenance like CapEx and higher sequential other income, can you touch on the repeatability of that? Terry Spencer : I think it's maintenance is just normal timing that comes and goes quarter-to-quarter and when the project gets done or not. The other was a small and non-strategic assets that we sold for a very small amount of money. So that was just a kind of ordinary course cleaning up some assets. Operator : Thank you, this concludes our questions for today. I'll turn it back to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Todd. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends until we release earnings in later July. We will provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us, and the IR team will be available throughout the day. Have a good week. Operator : Thank you, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's conference. You may now disconnect.",

Please be aware that each of your lines is in a listen-only mode. At the conclusion of our presentation, we will open the floor for questions. Instructions will be given at that time on the procedure to follow up if you would like to ask a question. It is now my pleasure to turn this conference over to Andrew Ziola. You may begin. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Shantel and welcome to ONEOK's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK.  Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas.  It's an exciting time for ONEOK as we begin placing some of the largest capital growth projects in our history into service. Our projects remain on or ahead of schedule and on budget.  The southern section of Elk Creek pipeline began employing NGLs on July 15 from the Rockies region into the Mid-Continent, with the northern section still on target to be completed in the fourth quarter.  Last week, we announced additional low cost expansion projects across our system, which continue to demonstrate ONEOK's ability to incrementally grow with our customers. These projects will help address NGL transportation and fractionation needs of producers and will further address flaring in North Dakota with added natural gas processing capacity.  All our projects, including these recent expansions, are built to meet the needs of our customers and are backed by long-term contracts. We continue to see strong producer activity levels across the basins where we operate with NGL and natural gas volume growth that is in-line with our expectations so far this year.  Now, more than halfway through the year, our confidence in our 2019 financial expectations and 2020 earnings outlook has strengthened significantly. With our projects remaining on or ahead of schedule, we expect accelerated earnings growth leading into 2020 and beyond and additional cash flow to reinvest in our business, reduce leverage and continue to return value to shareholders.  With that, I will turn the call over to Walt for comments on our second quarter results. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. Our second quarter 2019 net income totaled $312 million, or $0.75 per share, an 11% increase year-over-year. And second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $632 million a 5% increase year-over-year.  Distributable cash flow in the second quarter 2019 was $540 million up 19% from the second quarter 2018, with a healthy dividend coverage of 1.51 times. We also generated more than $180 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in the second quarter 2019.  During the second quarter, we paid a dividend of $0.865 per share. And last week, we announced a dividend increase to $0.89 per share, or $3.56 per share on an annualized basis. This increase further underscores our confidence in the increasing cash flow we expect to generate from projects we have recently completed or will complete in the coming months. The dividend is payable on August 14 to shareholders of record on August 6.  Our June 30 net debt to EBITDA on a trailing 12 month basis was 4.2 times. With the earnings expected from these projects we expect to be at 4 times debt to EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 or first quarter of 2021, with deleveraging continuing in the quarters to follow. Our liquidity remains strong as we ended the second quarter with the full $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and more than $270 million of cash on hand. We announced additional natural gas an NGL expansion projects last week that we expect to provide attractive returns for minimal capital invested. We do not expect these projects to impact our 2019 growth capital guidance range of $2.5 billion to $3.7 billion, as most of the spending will happen in 2020 and 2021. Because of the accelerated timing on some of our projects, we anticipate ending the year towards the higher end of our capital guidance range. As spending on our large pipeline projects winds down early next year, we expect capital expenditures in 2020 to be lower than 2019. Producer activity, project timing and additional committed volumes on our system, all add up to an impressive backdrop for ONEOK's growth. As we sit today, we are even more confident in our outlook that our 2020 adjusted EBITDA will increase greater than 20% with an emphasis on the greater than when compared with our 2019 guidance midpoint.  I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operating performance. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. We continue to see strong producer activity across our operations driving increases in both NGL and natural gas volumes in the second quarter. Total NGL raw feed throughput volume increased nearly 110,000 barrels per day or 11% year-over-year, and increased 80,000 barrels per day or 8%, compared with the first quarter of 2019. Natural Gas volumes processed, increased more than 150 million cubic feet per day or 9% year-over-year, and increased more than 80 million cubic feet per day or 4% compared with the first quarter 2019. Let's take a closer look at our volume growth and project timing in each of the basins where we operate. Starting with the Rockies region, producer results remain strong in the Williston and Powder River basins. North Dakota natural gas production is more than 2.8 billion cubic feet per day and there continues to be around 60 rigs operating more than 500 million cubic feet per day of natural gas being flared, and nearly 1000 drilled and uncompleted wells in inventory. All of these factors provide an inventory of growth for our natural gas liquids and natural gas segments.  As Terry mentioned, we completed the southern section of Elk Creek pipeline from the Powder River Basin to the Mid-Continent, and it is currently flowing more than 30,000 barrels per day of NGLs. With the southern section in service we have moved volumes previously railed on to our pipelines, eliminating higher rail transportation costs. This has also freed up rail capacity, which can be used to address continued NGL growth in the Williston basin until Elk Creek is fully in service in the fourth quarter. As further growth is expected, we will add pumps on Elk Creek as needed to increase capacity. These projects are low cost and can be completed incrementally to address additional volume growth, including the need for potential ethane recovery. Approximately 815 million cubic feet per day of new natural gas processing capacity is coming online basin wide between now and the end of the first quarter 2020, which translates to approximately 110,000 barrels per day of propane plus NGL production when these plants are full. With all of the NGLs from those plants dedicated to ONEOK and more than 30,000 barrels per day already flowing on the pipeline. We remain confident that throughput on Elk Creek will reach approximately 100,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020. ONEOK has now announced a total of 600 million cubic feet per day of additional natural gas processing capacity in the Williston basin, expected to come online between now and early 2021. Our latest announcement was the 200 million cubic feet per day expansion of our Bear Creek plant in Dunn County, an area that has recently experienced some of the highest production increases in North Dakota, and has a decades-long runway of well inventory yet to be drilled.  We expect volumes on the Bear Creek expansion to ramp up over a 12 to 24 month period once in service. This expansion also increases our NGL volumes contracted for natural gas processing plants in the Rocky Mountain region from 200,000 barrels per day to 225,000 barrels per day. Our Demicks Lake I plant remains on schedule to open full in the fourth quarter 2019 in conjunction with the completion of the northern section of Elk Creek. Demicks Lake II is expected to be complete early in the first quarter 2020. Moving on to the Mid-Continent, producer activity in the region remains in line with our expectations for the year. In the second quarter we saw increases in both NGL raw feed throughput volumes and natural gas volumes processed in the Mid-Continent compared with the first quarter 2019.  Large well pad completions early in the quarter drove the increase in natural gas volumes processed and two new third party plant connections contributed to the increase in NGL volumes. Arbuckle II is on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2020, and its contracted capacity now totals 375,000 barrels per day compared with 350,000 previously. Last week, we announced NGL fractionation facility expansions, totaling 65,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. These projects will increase our propane plus fractionation capacity to help address the heavier NGL barrels from the Williston basin. 15,000 barrels per day of capacity is expected to be completed in the third quarter 2020 with the remaining 50,000 barrels per day completed in the first quarter 2021. These types of projects can be efficiently completed at cost substantially lower than new construction. Recently completed expansion projects in our natural gas pipeline segment continue to drive higher firm capacity contracted in the second quarter compared with both the second quarter 2018 and the first quarter 2019. These projects increase the capacities of our Mid-Continent and Permian basin pipeline systems and will continue to provide increased firm transportation earnings going forward. Now let's take a look at our Permian basin and Gulf Coast operations. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 20% compared with the first quarter 2019, primarily driven by volume growth on our West Texas LPG pipeline, we continued to expect our average fee rate in this region to trend higher in future quarters as legacy volumes roll off West Texas LPG and are replaced with market-based transportation and fractionation volumes and as expansion of the system come online, which are contracted at market rates. The 80,000 barrel per day expansion of West Texas LPG remains on track to be completed in the first quarter 2020 with volumes ramping up quickly after it is placed in service.  And last week we announced a third expansion which will add 40,000 barrels per day of capacity to the system. The expansion is supported by long-term dedicated NGL production from processing plants in the Permian basin and is expected to be completed in the first quarter 2021. Our NGL fractionation capacity given current product composition is approximately 820,000 barrels per day and was approximately 90% utilized in the second quarter, we now expect to complete our 125,000 barrel per day MB-4 fractionator in phases. Phase 1 will provide approximately 75,000 barrels per day of capacity and is expected to be available in the fourth quarter of this year earlier than originally planned.  Phase 2 will consist of the remaining 50,000 barrels per day and is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2020 as originally announced. MB-5 remains on track for completion in the first quarter 2021.  Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. The progress on our capital growth projects this year is setting us up well for a significant volume in earnings uplift in 2020. As Walt emphasized, we're even more confident in our 2020 adjusted EBITDA growth outlook of greater than 20% compared with our 2019 guidance midpoint.  The impressive production results across our operations highlight the widespread quality of our operating basins and well-capitalized and experienced producers operating there. The volume growth we discussed today have high visibility both NGL and natural gas volumes are ready and waiting for processing and transportation now. Producers are looking to ONEOK to provide the critical infrastructure they need to connect their products with demand markets and we are well equipped and ready to grow our operations efficiently in order to do so. I'd like to recognize our large project teams and operations personnel located both at our headquarters and at our various field locations for their hard work to keep our growth projects on time and on budget and specifically to those working on our Elk Creek pipeline who are able to place the southern section in service early benefiting many of our customers.  Thank you to all our employees for your dedication to our customers and dedication to ONEOK. Your continued focus on safe and responsible operations has led to our continued reliability and operational success.  With that operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you very much. [Operator instructions] Our first question will come from Danilo Juvane, BMO Capital. Danilo Juvane : Thanks and good morning. You mentioned in the press release having significant upside in the second half of the year from the early start of Elk Creek and other projects as well. Where do you see 2019 EBITDA number was added relative to the midpoint? And to the extent it was that high to the midpoint do you still see a 20% growth rate between 2020 and 2019? Walt Hulse : No, we haven't changed any of our guidance and don't expect to do that today on this call. Obviously, as we get through the year we will continue to evaluate whether we're going to adjust that. But right now we're giving that outlook on 2020 off of the midpoint to let people have a basis on which to think about it. Danilo Juvane : Thanks for that Walt. DCF was pretty strong during the quarter. And it looked like it potentially came from Northern Border, anything going on there? Walt Hulse : Nothing really out of the ordinary Northern Border made an off cycle distribution, in addition to our normal quarterly distribution in the second quarter, but nothing, nothing out of the ordinary course of business. Danilo Juvane : We shouldn't expect that to continue going forward? Walt Hulse : I'm sorry, can you say that again? Danilo Juvane : We should expect any more off-cycle distributions for the balance of the year? Walt Hulse : Now, it's a distribution in excess of earnings for the quarter, and that catches us up. So distributions going forward will track with earnings as they have in the past. Danilo Juvane : Got you. Last question for me, to the extent that you continue to see strong production out of the Bakken for liquids, any thoughts on a potential residue gas takeaway solution? Kevin Burdick : I think I mean, clearly there, you know, it's something we're looking at, we're paying attention to, when you look at the capacity that's getting ready to come online across the basin. And, you know, we do believe we can continue to, in the basin we will continue to displace gas coming from Canada. But absolutely, there are conversations going on, you know, a variety of different outlooks and we're participating and all those conversations. Danilo Juvane : Thanks, Kevin. Those are my questions. Kevin Burdick : Thanks. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Chris Sighinolfi, Jeffries. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey, guys, good morning. Nice to see you in execution. Thanks for taking my questions. Well, I just want to circle back on that question Danilo had asked about Northern Border. Just for my own edification to understand is, I guess, what's the mechanism for that? This cash build at the JV and then you and your partner make the decision to pay that out on a periodic basis? Terry Spencer : Yes, to the extent that, overtime, we make a regular quarterly distribution, and to the extent the Management Committee believes that there's a capacity to do more than that. They have the ability to do it in one time basis. And that's what happened here. Chris Sighinolfi : And as it pertains to, DCF guidance and things of that nature, this was anticipated to fall this year. Is that also correct? Terry Spencer : Well, I think that it's fair to say that, you know, as we -- the plans to do this kind of develops throughout the course of the year. So, you know, I think on a going forward basis, we would expect distributions more in line with where they have been on a quarter-by-quarter basis. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. All right, great. And then if I could switch and just, Kevin I wanted to touch base, you guys have done a really nice job continuing to contract up Arbuckle to seemingly every quarter we get another 20,000 or 25,000 barrels a day of commitments there. And I just wanted to better understand or just I guess, review and remind myself as to where the volume slate now for that pipeline will be sourced I guess between what said to it from Elk Creek what comes from the Mid-Con plants and then what comes from third parties, is there a rough rule of thumb at this point given all the incremental contracts that you have had? Kevin Burdick : Well, I mean, it varies as we contract new plants. Obviously if you're getting a plant in the Mid-Continent and new contracted plant that's going to be tied, you know directly to Arbuckle II as we get a new Bakken plant if those barrels are going to all go all the way to Belvieu then that will be included in both Elk Creek and Arbuckle II. So that's how we break it down. I mean, you share any other thoughts on just in general how... Terry Spencer : I think that's right so definitely you can see that on a very macro sense of the difference between what we've contracted for Arbuckle II and what we've contracted for Elk Creek. That difference is definitely coming out and they call it. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. And is it fair then if I look at just the table that you guys have long provided that looks at the bundled rates on your NGL rock feed service. If I -- like I guess what I want to be careful of doing is making sure I'm giving you enough credit and appropriate credit for each of these two assets, but not double counting volume that's moving on Elk Creek that subsequently moves down Arbuckle II.  And so is it fair to just credit the Elk Creek volume with the bundled rate on the Bakken portion and then the incremental volume that I would see above that give that Mid-Continent rate. Is that fair way rule of thumb to think about it or would you advise me to do something different? Terry Spencer : No, I think that's a fair way to think about it. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. Alright. Great. Thanks for taking my question, guys. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Chris. Sure. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Tristan Richardson, SunTrust. Tristan Richardson : Good morning, guys. Just on the expansion project for Mid-Con frac capacity. You talked about that in prepared comments just about the heavier barrel. Is this purely really just optionality for you guys in the customer or just kind of curious could you talk about sort of the need for new capacity there relative to what the projects you have going on at Belvieu? Terry Spencer : I think it just came down, a lot of it just came down to we had the ability as our teams looked at how we provide more fractionation capacity, but that was a low cost option for Williston and would drive the best return. With our other pipes, clearly we'll have the ability to move those purity products down to Belvieu once Arbuckle II is up. So we do get that optionality. But it really came down to where we look at where we could provide the lowest cost, most efficient frac capacity. Tristan Richardson : Great. And then just to follow up on your -- appreciate your commentary on directionally where 2020 CapEx might stack up relative to 2019 range. Should we think about that as just sort of on the projects you have sanctioned today or does that contemplate other projects that you might be looking at that haven't necessarily been greenlit yet? Terry Spencer : No, I think that our expectation given, everything that we see going forward, both what we've been able to announce. And we're thinking we have lower CapEx in 2020, then it will be in 2019. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much. Terry Spencer : Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Christine Cho, Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi, everyone. Great quarter. What is the financial benefit going to be when rail and third party frac costs roll off? I'm assuming it's all off by first quarter next year when all your assets are online. But could you provide the cadence of the roll off between now and then as well? Terry Spencer : Well, I guess what we talked about previously, the way to think about that is the barrels that have already rolled off rail, I think we said we save about $0.20 per gallon of transportation costs. So as we put more barrels on rail through the rest of this year, then the next step will be when the full pipeline is in place and all those rail barrels move to the pipe then you'll see another uplift at that point, along with other volumes coming from processing plants when the flare start getting put out when the processing capacity comes online. Did that answer your question, Christie? Christine Cho : Yeah, I guess. Okay, but you've moved 30,000 barrels per day off right now with the southern portion coming on. But you're still continuing to rail. So I guess and I'm guessing the rail is still going to increase throughout the end of this year. So at what point does that peak, like how much are you railing today and how much do you expect to rail at the peak between now and year-end? Terry Spencer : Well the rail volume when we brought on the southern section, the rail volume at that point in time went to nearly zero. So we pulled pretty much everything down. And then that rail volume -- you have plants coming online between now and when Elk Creek comes and gets in service. So we will use rail, it will start building back up as volumes from those plants start coming online. So it will build back up and then once the full pipeline is in place, all of it will obviously move back over to the pipe. Christine Cho : Okay, got it. Christine. Sheridan Swords : Christine this is Sheridan. We think by the time we bring Elk Creek back off when we get the Northern section of Elk Creek completed, we will be railing upwards of 30,000 barrels a day again. Christine Cho : Okay. Super helpful. And then your contracted bubbles on Elk Creek is approaching capacity. Can you remind us, how long it would take to expand the pipeline, if you decide to do so. And also discuss at what point you would do that just given it's probably low cost and your numbers is too minimal ethane extraction, and I'm not sure at what point that might change? Terry Spencer : We look at it continually. Clearly those projects aren't two-year projects like building the pipe. They're measured in terms of months, not years. And we also have the ability to do things like ordering Thompson [ph] and a lot of the long lead -- time of long lead equipment and other engineering things we can go ahead and do to prepare for that. So that it drives the time required to get that done again just a matter of months. Christine Cho : Okay. And then last one for me there was an increase in Bakken processing volume, but your NGL pipeline volumes remained flat. What was the reason for that? Terry Spencer : We just drove our ethane rejection just continued to drive deeper and deeper. So to get more throughput through the plants and remain the pipe, the NGL takeaway was at capacity. So we were able to, through our plants drive deeper rejection and run more inlet but not produce as much liquids. Christine Cho : So, you are doing max rails to the quarter to then? Terry Spencer : I mean towards the year, yes, but that we were pretty much at max rail. Christine Cho : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hi. Good morning, everyone. I'm curious, if you can just comment a little bit, obviously NGL prices have been pretty volatile. I was curious for your latest views on how you see things trending for the rest of the year and into 2020. And then kind of related to that, if you have any different or updated views on how the Conway to Belvieu spread is going to trend here for the rest of the year? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. I think as we look at the overall price, if you keep crude at the level it is today, you'll see a little uptick in prices. Obviously we're seeing more export capacity for propane come online, which should create more demand and you're seeing more crackers come online. That you should see some uptick in absolute price here through the end of the year and into 2020. Not a huge spike but I think you'll see some strength. On the Conway to Belvieu spread right now, we think that where it is today is where it's going to be or in this range through the third quarter and start into the fourth quarter. Then you'll get into some seasonality issues that probably will bring that spread in a little tighter than it is today. Then of course, as we've said before, once we bring Arbuckle II online, that spread will go back to more what we have seen historically, which is much narrower than we have today. Michael Blum : Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then just this recent slate of projects that you just announced. So we just think of their returns on those projects. Would you consider those to be kind of within the normal course of your typical return profile or those would be better, because some of them are kind of bolt-on in nature? How do we think about that? Thanks. Kevin Burdick : Yeah, I think -- Michael it is Kevin. I think the plant projects are going to be in our kind of our standard 4 to 6 times, but some of the other just expansions and frac expansions that we've talked about can be done at lower costs and new constructions are going to be better than that. Michael Blum : Thank you. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet, JP Morgan. Q - Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. I appreciate that you guys are not updating guidance at this point. But just curious within the G&P and the gas pipeline segments. It seems like you guys are trending quite strong versus the ranges that you put out there. Is there anything in the back half of the year that could kind of temper this trajectory or is kind of like the high-end or above the high-end, seems like it could be possible for those? Chuck Kelley : Jeremy, this is Chuck. We can talk first about G&P. I think we could trend higher. It's going to come down through one our pipeline infrastructure, some of our field facilities come on. So it's a matter of timing, as we do towards the end of the year. And as you think about our gas pipe business, we've seen very good demand for our -- not only our interoperable volumes, but our balancing services and short-term storage services, which are kind of driving some incremental earnings that we hadn't necessarily planned on. So both of the segments are doing very well right now, demands up and we're just taking care of customers at this point. Jeremy Tonet : Great. That's helpful. And then, thinking about the balance sheet here, it seems like I think before the leverage is going to peak, I think at the beginning of 2020 with all the projects coming online. You've added some more to the backlog there and or you did more broad into what you're going to do? And just wondering how you see leverage, I guess, moving across 2020? Is that still the same peak or any color that you could provide on how that all comes together? Terry Spencer : Well, Jeremy, our heaviest spending is definitely in the third and fourth quarter of '19. So when you enter in that first quarter, we've said that, with Elk Creek coming on in the fourth quarter and the volumetric disclosed, the guidance that we've put out there as it relates to our expectations of how quickly Elk Creek is going to build its volume around that 100,000 barrels, we're going to see a significant uplift in our EBITDA in the first quarter of 2020. And throughout 2020 and that's going to deliver us right from the get go in 2020. So, as we cross over the year, that'll be our peak. The projects that we've announced to date will be towards the back end of 2020 and into 2021 from a CapEx spend and will already be well down our road to delivering and in my prepared remarks, I gave you some thoughts on where we might end the year. So we're going to see in the same trajectory and still looking for some significant delivering going forward. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. That's it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Dennis Coleman, Bank of America. Dennis Coleman : Hi. Good morning, everyone. One for me with regard to the fracs, just I'm little interested in sort of this phasing of bringing on fracs or if I understand it, right. Can you just talk -- I don't really sort of have a concept of how you bring on a frac in stages. So maybe if you could just talk a little bit about how that's happening? Kevin Burdick : Yeah, Dennis it's Kevin. Well, in this case with our complex down there, we had some spare capacity for somewhat I'd call it kind of utilities, some refrigeration, some heaters that are typically long lead equipment, long lead time type equipment items. And so we're able to leverage some existing spare capacity, we have to bring up the frac and kind of a partial mode. And then as we've installed the rest of that equipment, that's what we'll get it up to full capacity in '20. Dennis Coleman : Okay, so the vessel itself is there, and then just the -- so, I guess the follow on question is, if you're using up that capacity, would -- should we expect that to be a model for frac 5 as well? Terry Spencer : We'll evaluate it. We may not have the same type of spare utilities, if you will for frac 5. But that's something obviously we'll take a look at a variety of different things to do but I wouldn't expect that to happen for the MB-5. Dennis Coleman : Okay, okay. Thanks for that. And then -- I'm sorry about this, but just to go back to this Northern Border distribution, Danilo and Chris both hit on it, but this onetime payment, we should not -- that wasn't included in the guidance, correct? And so we should just use the guidance and sort of use this onetime payment and think of it that way. So if we add that in, we should think about the guidance is, you're going to be above the guidance? Terry Spencer : It's fair to say that that was not included in the original guidance. Dennis Coleman : Perfect. That's what I need. Okay, that's it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Spiro Dounis, Credit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : Hey. Good morning everyone. Just maybe going back to the 20% growth expectation for next year. I'm not sure we've seen you guys highlight that in a while here. Maybe not since the original guidance was provided. So getting the sense of that means you're getting pretty confident of that figure. So curious, how you are thinking about some of the underlying assumptions to get there maybe just around commodity differentials and some of the base business growth. You made some comments earlier just around the differential outlook. But if you just expand there in the context of that 20% growth next year? Kevin Burdick : Yeah, this is Kevin. I mean, I think the obviously the huge driver, there is the backlog of flared gas and the inventory we talked about up in the Bakken. And when you think about to just kind of put the math to the 100,000 barrels a day that we expect on Elk Creek by the first quarter. And you put that out over the course of the year, and then you've got a full Demicks Lake II plant running full for the entire year, you got Demicks II ramping up and then you've got growth on the Permian and Mid-Continent as well. But when you just go back to the 500 million cubic feet a day that's flaring in the Bakken across the basin, and the processing capacity that's coming online between now and the first quarter that just generates a significant amount of NGLs, which is the primary driver for the '20 number. Spiro Dounis : Got it. And so if I'm hearing that, right, it sounds like there's no real major call being made here on [indiscernible] outside of that or any sort of commodity or differential move. Is that fair? Terry Spencer : That's fair. In fact, we've been talking very openly as shared and mentioned, with Arbuckle-II we expect spreads to come back in much narrower than they are today. And that is included in that, that assumption is included in that 20% greater than 20%. Spiro Dounis : Got it. Got it. Okay, appreciate that. And then maybe just more broadly, and how you're thinking about your Mid-Con footprint longer term? And, clearly the most of your growth is really focused outside that area. And I guess lately, producer commentary, there has been somewhat lukewarm. So just curious, what sort of optionality do you have around that footprint, maybe offset some potential volume headwinds, sort of pass-2019 or if you think that's even fair to be cautious on the Mid-Con at this point? Terry Spencer : I think, just in general the Mid-Continent, like we remarked in our prepared remarks, the volumes have been in line with our expectations. Yeah, there may have been a couple producers that you've seen some things written that were off a little bit, but then you've been -- we've had some that have outperformed our expectations. And I think one of the things we continue to remind people is we have our own expectations, given the footprint and the size of our system, both in the G&P and the NGL side. So as we set our forecasts out there, we're factoring in all that information. So we feel good about it, and we do expect growth out of the Mid-Continent as we move forward. I mean, guys? Chuck Kelley : We're still planning on hooking up another, two more plants in the Mid-Continent second half of this year. So we're still seeing some need for capacity. Sheridan Swords : And what I would add from model G&P standpoint would be, I think our well connect guidance that we gave, were trending as though we're going to exceed that, and I think we probably well this year. Spiro Dounis : Got it. I appreciate that. Just one last quick one if I could and sorry if you guys touched on it, just around LPG exports, obviously has been considerable amount of new capacity announcements made recently. I imagine that factors into your market outlook. So just how you thinking about that now? Kevin Burdick : I think when we think about LPG exports, we're going to continue to engage the market to understand what the market is and what's going on there. But what we're not going to do is go out there and do uneconomic project or just build something to say we have an export terminal. So we're continuing to use our capital disciplined, as we evaluate that, but we will always be involved in engaging the market on exports. And when we get to the time that we see that we have an economic project that we want to go forward and then we will we will go forward with that time. Spiro Dounis : Got it. Appreciate all the color. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you very much. Our next question will come from JR Weston, Raymond James. JR Weston : Hey, good morning. Just wanted to ask real quick on Bakken G&P volumes. So far this year kind of relative to the guidance looks like you're tracking pretty well but it looks like you've got almost 60% of the well connects still expected second half of the year. So just kind of curious if there are other moving pieces in that guidance or if it seems like maybe you're tracking above expectations there. Terry Spencer : Well, I think we did lag early in the Q1 due to weather and there was let's face it, not only cold but there's a lot of snow. So it was difficult to get out there and connect wells. Second quarter we obviously strengthened and connected quite a few. I think the remainder the year we'll hit our guidance on our well connects some of that is just waiting on some capacity that certain compressor stations. So, I think we're in good shape to hit our guidance numbers for the year on our well connects and volume guidance. JR Weston : That\u2019s it for me. Thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Shneur Gershuni, UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning, guys. Maybe a couple quick follow ups here, just with respect to the guidance, I mean you sort of maintaining the 20%. But in your prepared remarks, you kind of emphasized greater than 20%, was the comment. Until a few days ago ethane has been under severe pressure. And if I remember correctly, you had a big ethane rejection reversal tailwind in the last two years.  Your guidance when you originally set it out and saying the plus 20%, did that includes some reversal of the ethane rejection. And is that being offset by some better Elk Creek expectations, just kind of wondering what the moving parts have been positive and negative from the time you said it versus what you sit today. Terry Spencer : What I would say in when we look at the NGL volume growth in 2019 that has exceeded our expectations. For that is we probably have not seen quite as much ethane come out of rejection as we thought but we're seeing more ethane on our system than we thought from the growth in other areas. So we are seeing that offset a little bit. But dividing the big thing is we are seeing more volume growth than we thought we would see at this time. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then secondly, with respect to announcing a third plant in the Williston, I was just wondering what your flexibility was around the spend in the in-service date, when I sort of look at the flaring numbers that you have out there on your slides for 300 MMCF a day on your acreage, sort of look at two plants, it sort of looks like it would take care of their flaring plus some growth. We've recently seen a big dip in Williston rig count, if that's just not moving around and that trend continues, do you have some flexibility around the spend to sort of push out the in-service date of this third plant? Kevin Burdick : Shneur, this is Kevin. I mean, yeah, technically, you would have that flexibility. But we see nothing right now that would cause us to do that. In fact, it's just the opposite, our customers are -- they need more capacity in this Dunn County area. The results they've seen and these are some large, well-capitalized producers with large acreage blocks, they want to drill this area out and the plants full. And the only reason they're not deploying more capital down there right now is because of capacity. So we clearly see, this is a growth area for us. And we started off looking at a smaller expansion and the more color we got from producers, about their immediate plans, we continue to push it up and decided to put a 200 million a day expansion in. Shneur Gershuni :  All right, that sounds great. Thank you very much. Appreciate the color guys. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Jean Salisbury, Bernstein. Jean Salisbury : Good morning. Could you give us an estimate of how much ethane is being projected into Northern Border today, and what the maximum you think it can handle it? Chuck Kelley : Yes, this is Chuck. Today there's roughly about 150,000 barrels a day of ethane going into Northern Border. We actually looked at this just the other day and the North Dakota pipeline authority has some information out at their website about it. With forecasts over time depending on the mix between Bakken gas and Canadian gas filling that pipe, you could see it as much as 180,000 to 200,000 barrels of ethane. Jean Salisbury : Great. That's really helpful. Thank you. And then obviously, there's a lot of create pipelines that are running open seasons out of the Bakken. Just as a general question, do you usually find the [indiscernible] when they sign up for crude takeaway tend to parent with other takeaway like for example, if they signed a new 10 year contract for crude, would you expect them to be looking for NGL takeaway to match with that? Chuck Kelley : Typically, we don't see that, where we see people come up need NGL takeaway capacity is when you're looking at building a new plant. So when they build the new plants when they'll secure the NGL takeaway capacity for that complete new plant, and then they'll grow into it as they -- on the crude on that side of it. So just because they signed up for a long crude term deal doesn't necessarily mean they're going to sign up for NGLs and vice versa.  But you really got to look at when you start seeing more plants being announced they have either are going to sign up for NGLs or have already signed up for the NGL takeaway. Jean Salisbury : Really helpful, thank you. That\u2019s all for me. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Ethan Bellamy, Baird. Ethan Bellamy : Hey, good morning, all. There is some concern by investors that the Bakken may decline in the next three to five years what's your expectation for North Dakota volumes on your acreage longer-term? Kevin Burdick : Again Ethan, this is Kevin. We continue to see growth, when you just look at the track record with rigs in that for 55 to 60 range for the basin. We have seen significant gas production growth and just remember that gas production is growing at a faster clip than crude production because of the GLR and the increases there. So there is a lot of positives about gas production, you look at some of the forecast out there. We believe there is definitely growth beyond that horizon you mentioned. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. That\u2019s a good thing. My next\u2026 Kevin Burdick : Well beyond that. Ethan Bellamy : Sorry, go ahead. Kevin Burdick : No, I just said well beyond that. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. Thank you. I was just going to ask it looks like we might need a new gas export pipe to handle that volume do you agree with that and is that a project you're getting? Kevin Burdick : Yes. I think we definitely agree with that. And again, as we discussed earlier, there are a variety of projects being discussed in different avenues to get more residue out, but clearly if we stay on a growth trend, you were -- the basin is going to need some additional takeaway capacity over the next two, three, four years. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. Moving down the south. How has the decline in NGL prices impacted, if at all the rates and negotiations with customers for frac capacity? Terry Spencer : It has not impacted them at all. We are going to reprice our services off of alternatives, also what the marketplace is. And remember that NGLs are byproduct, it needs to be taken away in areas people can't get the capacity, they are flaring with what they say. So the absolute price of the NGL does not have an impact on what we can charge for our services. Ethan Bellamy : And market's still fairly tight? Terry Spencer : Market's fractionation capacity is still pretty tight, there is a lot coming on. And pipeline capacity obviously tight because we're building new ones as we come on, as well. So yeah the market is still fairly tight in all areas. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. And then last question. There are a lot of assets on the market and a few whole partnership, what's your appetite for M&A here? Terry Spencer : Ethan, this is Terry. Not very high, candidly, when you look at the gross laid of opportunities that we have going forward. When you think about it from an accretion standpoint, we are talking dollars a share and additional earnings to come to the Company over the next several years. We can really get that from strategic M&A. Now there may be some assets from time to time that we could buy with cash that could make some sense. But right now, we really don't see anything out there that's that compelling or valuations, in particular that makes sense particularly when you think about the alternative we have to invest organically. Ethan Bellamy : Okay. Thanks you all. Much appreciated. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Congratulations on another great quarter. Terry Spencer : Thanks. Kevin Burdick : Thanks Craig. Craig Shere : On the G&P unit fee based margins, that look to be a record in the second quarter. Is that sustainable and what's driving that? Chuck Kelley : Craig, this is Chuck. We guided to $0.90 to $0.95, we are at $0.93 today. Obviously, with more Bakken gas coming out, it's higher margin relative to our Mid-Con business so that\u2019s part of the driver. In addition to that you get in the contract mix, different producers we have different fees. And so is it sustainable? I think we are solid in there range. Craig Shere : Okay, great. And I just want to understand all the system integration gives and takes as it relates to Arbuckle II and possible modularity of your system, if I could describe it that way, currently you are coming out of 400,000 and then you have an increase of 5,000 a day. You contracted 375 [ph], but if you switched Sterling III purity product, any excess wide grade that hasn't been fractionated would have to go to Arbuckle II, and then you may wind up putting all the growth this thing in West Texas LPG into the Southern Leg of Arbuckle II. So I'm just trying to think through how quickly the entire system can fill up? Terry Spencer : Well, that is a good question. We continue to look at how fast can you fill up and we're, as we said, we can add pumps fairly quickly as we go forward. But you're right, we -- if I go back to the original start of your question, the modularity and the optionality we have through our system gives us a lot of flexibility. And the first one is, is actually Sterling III is on royalty today, we will take all Sterling III's raw feed, put it on Arbuckle and open that up for purities and that's why we believe the spreads we can come when they'll be will come together. And then we will take -- we think hopefully very quickly will take Arbuckle up to 1 million barrels if all the capacity comes online as we think it's going to come online we see into the future. But we still think above that will -- we will put the pumps and go to 1 million barrels. We still have some headroom to breach that million barrels that we have not contracted for today. But we should be in the upper end of Arbuckle II and full pipelines are a good thing. And if we need to build another pipeline because we see that kind of volume come out, we'll build another pipeline. Craig Shere : So shared in a couple questions the northern section of Arbuckle II isn't the same capacity as the southern section right? So if you do take West Texas volumes and go to 1 million barrels the Canton [ph] the Northern section, right? Terry Spencer : The Northern section can do 600,000 barrels and the Southern section can do 1 million barrels. So that leads -- and West Texas pipeline is going to come in right where Arbuckle II transitions from a 24 inch or 600,000 barrels to a 30 inch or 1 million barrels.  So that leads 400,000 barrels a day that's open for West Texas to sale that does not impact the volume coming down from the north. And that's how the system was designed. That was our plan in the beginning. So you can -- we are anticipating we could see upwards of 400,000 barrels come off West Texas and go on to Arbuckle II. Craig Shere : And then if I understand it that would free the southern section of West Texas for potential crude service? Terry Spencer : That's correct. Or as we continue to get to 400,000 barrels a day on West Texas, we're going to have to have a complete new line out of the Permian to Arbuckle II which would free up West Texas from the Permian -- the legacy West Texas system from the Permian to the Gulf Coast to us for some other service, which would include crude. Craig Shere : I see. And moving the wide range from Sterling III to West Texas, I'm sorry, to Arbuckle II that's got nothing to do with a 375 [ph] a day of contract it up. The 375 is all incremental to what you have today, right? And then moving capacity over to take advantage of the purity product is just extra. Terry Spencer : That is correct. The 375 is -- does not include the volume that's moving on Sterling III today. Craig Shere : Right. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. Our next question will come from Sunil Sibal, Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes, hi, good morning, guys, and thanks for all the clarity on the call. Just one quick question on the G&P segment. Obviously, the results were fairly strong and I noticed that your OpEx in that segment actually fell sequentially as well, as much as last year despite a decent pick up in volumes. I'm just curious is there anything going on there or -- I know sometimes commodity prices, especially the gas prices kind of impact that OpEx. So I just find a little bit clarity on that. Chuck Kelley : Yes, this is, Chuck. No, the -- sequentially we are about $6 million lower and pretty much just due to timing between the quarters. So if you average those two quarters together, run rate might be a little bit higher as we as we progress towards Demicks I and II, bringing on more employees and more field cost, but that's pretty much -- those are good numbers for the year. Sunil Sibal : Okay. And gas is more like a pass through costs that natural gas prices don't really impact that number, correct? Chuck Kelley : No, it does not impact that number. Sunil Sibal : Okay, thanks for that. And then just trying to understand a little bit better on the LPG export side of things. From what I've been hearing, obviously, there've been a number of dock expansions coming online, which seems like maybe some constraints in moving those LPG volumes to the end customers, ultimately. I was curious if you have a view on that? And also, is there some way that -- and you're talking to customers on the LPG side, so in some way for you guys who taken get an opportunity out of that. Terry Spencer : I mean, again, as Sheridan kind of alluded to on the dock question. Yeah, there have been announcements out there, there's more capacity that's going to be announced. We do see some of the short term rates or spot rates have been pushed down. But like Sheridan mentioned, I think the key is, as we talk to customers, we're looking longer term, we're looking for rates are going to the economically justify a project. And that's the way we'll approach it. Sunil Sibal : Okay, got it. Thanks, guys. Operator : Thank you. Our last question will come from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. How you guys thinking about what a 2021 step up looks like versus 2020? I mean you've got a lot of projects that come online in \u201820. And trying to think about how much that 20% plus captures that for 2020 versus what drives a \u201821 step up? Terry Spencer : Michael, I think that we're definitely not going to give you 2021 guidance, and we're stepping out a little further than we usually do and give you to an outlook on 2020. So you're going to have to do your own work here. But if you just take the capital that we're investing and recognize that we're in the same multiple in some of these incremental projects or even at better multiples, 2021 is looking pretty good too. Michael Lapides : Got it. Do you still assume a 4 to 6 times multiple on most of these projects, or do you think some can even be better than that once you get a full run rate? Terry Spencer : Well, I think the frac is a perfect example of putting -- adding capacity at about half the price of build is definitely better than a 4 to 6 multiple. Michael Lapides : Got it. Okay, guys, thank you. Much appreciated. Terry Spencer : Sure. Operator : Thank you very much. Speakers, at this time, we have no further questions in the queue. Terry Spencer : All right. Well, thank you, everyone. Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October, and extends until we release earnings in late October. We will provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and the IR team will be available throughout the day for your questions. Have a good week. Operator : Thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen at this time, this now concludes our conference. You may disconnect your phone lines and have a great rest of week. Thank you.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Travis, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter Earnings Conference Call. This call is being webcast live and a replay will be made available. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued interest and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. Yesterday, we announced third quarter earnings results and updated our 2019 financial guidance expectations. The first nine months have set us up well for another year of companywide earnings growth in 2019 and have laid the foundation for continued growth next year. We also reiterated our outlook for greater than 20% earnings growth in 2020. We provided updated timing on several of our capital growth projects including our Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant in North Dakota, which was completed earlier this month and our Demicks Lake II plant, which we expect to complete in January 2020. The northern section of our Elk Creek NGL pipeline is expected to begin line fill activities in November and will provide meaningful volume and earnings growth as we exit the year. Between now and the end of the first quarter of 2020, we expect to fully complete five growth projects that will add more than 700,000 barrels per day of NGL transportation capacity, a 125,000 barrels per day of fractionation capacity and an additional 400 million cubic feet of natural gas processing capacity, including Demicks Lake plants. This critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure including assets to help significantly reduce natural gas flaring in Williston Basin, will provide immediate earnings and volume up lift in 2020 and stable fee based growth for years to come. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt's for comments on our third quarter results. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK's third quarter 2019 net income totaled $309 million or $0.74 per share and third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $650 million. Year-to-date, net income and adjusted EBITDA increased 11% and 5%, respectively, compared with the same period last year. Distributable cash flow through the first nine months of the year was $1.5 billion, up 13% compared with 2018 with a healthy year-to-date dividend coverage of 1.42 times. We have also generated nearly $450 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid through the first nine months of this year. During the first quarter, we paid the dividend of $0.89 per share and last week we announced the dividend increased to $0.915 or $3.66 per share on an annualized basis. Dividend is payable on November 14th to shareholders of record on November 4th. This latest increase results in a 9% increase in 2019 dividends paid compared with 2018 in line with our previously stated guidance. In August, we completed a $2 billion senior note offering providing increased liquidity and balance sheet flexibility. In addition to the funding capital expenditures, proceeds from the offering also were used to proactively manage upcoming debt maturities including repaying $250 million of our $1.5 million term loan to 2021 and redeeming $300 million of senior notes that were due March 2020. On September 30th, net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.5 times. We continue to expect to be at four times debt to EBITDA run rate in the fourth quarter of 2020 for the first quarter of 2021 with the deleveraging continuing in the quarters to follow that. We ended the third quarter with the full $2.5 billion available on our credit facility and more than $670 million of cash. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we narrowed our 2019 financial guidance ranges. The midpoint of our net income guidance increased to $1.28 billion and our adjusted EBITDA midpoint remain unchanged at $2.6 billion. The natural gas gathering and processing, and natural gas pipeline segments are trending toward the high-end of the previously announced financial guidance ranges, each with the ability to exceed the high-end of their range. Our performance in these segments reflect stronger-than-expected volume growth in the Williston Basin and STACK and SCOOP areas and gathering in the gathering processing segment and higher firm transportation capacity contracted on expansion projects in the natural gas pipeline segment. Our natural gas liquids segment is trending towards the low end of its previously announced financial guidance range, primarily due to lower optimization and marketing earnings from narrower than expected pricing spread between Conway and Mont Belvieu and due to the impact of increased ethane rejection on our system. Despite a vastly different commodity price environment and spreads that were one third as large as the year ago, our base business grew compared with a strong quarter last year. As we mentioned in prior quarters, we expect earnings for this segment to be heavily weighted towards the back half of the year. The Williston Basin continues to be a primary contributor to one-offs growth underscored by the fact that volume growth in the region is at higher margins relative to our other regions. We've also updated our 2019 growth capital guidance range to $3.5 billion to $3.7 billion, consistent with my remarks last quarter, reflecting the accelerated timing on several of our capital growth projects. The early in service on these projects also accelerates their associated EBITDA contributions and further underscores our confidence in our earnings growth and deleveraging next year. As Terry mentioned, we continue to expect adjusted EBITDA growth of greater than 20% in 2020, compared with our 2019 guidance midpoint and the emphasis remains on greater than 20%. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our business segments. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. We continue to see strong producer activity across our operations with NGL and natural gas volumes through the first nine months of the year already surpassing full year 2018 volumes. Overall, our projects remain on time and on budget positioning us well for continued growth as volumes on these projects ramp up over the next several months. Let's take a closer look at our operating regions starting with the Rockies. Producer activity remained strong in both Williston and Powder River basin. North Dakota saw a record natural gas production again in August of more than 3 billion cubic feet per day and the basin wide rig count remains at approximately 60. As Terry mentioned, our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant is now in service and we expect it to ramp quickly to full capacity once the entire Elk Creek pipeline s in service. With natural gas flaring of more than 550 million cubic feet per day in the basin and more than 300 million of that one dedicated anchorage, the volume growth is immediately available to capture. We also expect to complete our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake II plant in January of 2020, which will help further alleviate flaring in the basin. Third quarter natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mount region were nearly 1.1 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 7% year-over-year and 2% compared with the second quarter 2019. This puts us on track in 2019 for the higher end of our volume guidance range. We now expect to connect between 525 and 550 wells in the Rocky Mount region this year compared with prior well connect guidance of 620 wells. Better-than-expected well performance and higher gas to oil ratios have contributed to the growth even with producers temporarily delay in completion to avoid additional flaring due to lack of processing capacity and NGL takeaway. This has translated into a rising drill but uncompleted well count, which is reached approximately 1,000 basin-wide with more than 400 on our acreage. We expect producers to begin working this inventory off once Elk Creek and additional processing capacity come online providing further support for our expected growth in 2020. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in the Rocky Mountain region increased approximately 7% compared with the second quarter 2019 due primarily to the Southern section of Elk Creek pipeline coming online in July. In addition to our Demicks Lake I plant, more than 300 million cubic feet per day of third-party processing capacity which recently completed with an additional 750 million cubic feet per day of capacity expected to be completed in the Rockies region by the first quarter of 2020. At full capacity, these plants are capable of producing a total of approximately 160,000 barrels per day of propane plus when full. We are already seeing additional NGL volumes from the region in October with throughput averaging more than 190,000 barrels per day, which includes the already full 140,000 barrel per day Bakken NGL pipeline. Line fill activities on the Northern Section of Elk Creek are expected to begin in November and volumes will continue to ramp through the remainder of the year including approximately 25,000 barrels per day currently being railed that will transition to the pipeline and reduce our rail cost. We expect exit 2019 with more than 215,000 barrels a day of raw feed throughput for the region and reach more than 240,000 barrels per day in the first quarter of 2020. As a reminder, each 25,000 barrels per day of incremental volumes results in nearly $100 million of adjusted EBITDA. We also continue to see increased producer activity in the Powder River Basin as production results remain strong and some rigs have relocated there from other basins, benefitting both our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. Moving onto the Mid-Continent, natural gas volumes processed increased 8% year-over-year and are tracking above the midpoint of our guidance expectations. Total NGL raw feed throughput in the Mid-Continent region decreased compared with last quarter due to higher Mid-Continent ethane rejection, specifically during July and August. We had approximately 50,000 fewer barrels per day of ethane on our system in the third quarter of 2019 than the second quarter of 2019, but saw an increase of approximately 30,000 barrels per day of propane plus volumes in the region, which demonstrates strong core supply growth. We since seen ethane on our system increase in the fourth quarter, but continue to expect fluctuation through the remainder of the year as we near the start of the new petrochemical facilities on the Gulf coast. Through the first nine months of the year, we've connected 98 wells to our natural gas gathering and processing system and connected five new third-party processing plants to our natural gas liquid system in the Mid-Continent. Two previously connected third-party plants on our system have also been expanded in the region. NGL volumes from these new connections and expansions in addition to growing Rockies volumes will drive the volume growth on our Arbuckle II pipeline, which remains on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2020. We continue to stay in contact with our customers in the region about their plans and forecasts, and this information has been incorporated into our growth outlook for 2020. Now taking a closer look at our Permian Basin and Gulf Coast operations, NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 26% year-over-year and the average fee rate increased by approximately $0.05 compared with the second quarter 2019. This was driven primarily by a ramp in volumes on completed West Texas LPG expansion projects and the replacement of lower rates legacy volumes on the system with market-based transportation and fractionation rights. We expect average rates to continue to increase as our 80,000 barrels per day expansion and 40,000 barrels per day expansion are completed in the first quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021 respectively. System wide NGL fractionation capacity remains highly utilized. Phase 1 of our MB-4 fractionator which will provide approximately 75,000 barrels per day of capacity is expected to be completed by the end of the year. Phase 2 of the project which will add the remaining 50,000 barrels per day of capacity remains on schedule for completion in the first quarter of 2020. MB-5 remains on track for completion in the first quarter of 2021. Terry that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. Our operating performance, system-wide volumes strength and execution of our capital growth program with a very strong balance sheet had clearly exceeded many expectations. But while the operational and earnings growth is important the way in which we operate conduct ourselves in business and construct our project is equally important and it is important that we place on sustainable and responsible operations that is the foundation for all of the successes we discussed today. You can find more detailed information related to our environmental, social and government focus priorities and programs in our most recent corporate sustainability report which can be found on our website. The report is our 11th Annual ESG Report, and with each version of this report, we prioritize increasing disclosures, content and relevance for one of many stakeholders. I encourage you to review the report on our website. We continue to focus on improvements in these areas, and welcome your feedback to help us do so because our goal is to build and grow business that is profitable, safe and environmentally responsible for the long-term. Thank you to all our dedicated employees for your hard work and contributions this quarter. We're only a couple of months away from closing out another year of companywide growth and were about to enter an exciting year of new asset operations and additional project completions. With that operator were now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] First question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to start off with the project ramp, you have a lot of moving pieces here, a lot of project coming online over the next couple of quarters and you've talked in your remarks, but just Demicks Lake I and II, how should we think about those plant ramping up especially as you need Elk Creek online to kind of perform the way you want to perform there. Just how should we expect EBITDA to ramp over the next few quarters with all these different projects coming online? Kevin Burdick : Jeremy, this is Kevin and then I'll let others jump in. But clearly, Elk Creek is kind of the key project that we need to get done. The basin is short NGL takeaway capacity. Right now, but as Elk Creek comes in service, then all the processing plants up there not just Demicks Lake I, but you've got some third-party processing plants that are up now and you've got another one that's going to come online in the fourth quarter, all those plants will be able to ramp. And clearly there is substantial flaring behind not just our system but other company systems as well. So, you would expect it's going to ramp very quickly from the flared gas inventory. Then as you move through 2020 early 2020, and the flares get put out, you still see the strength in rigs, we're seeing up there, and you've also got growth coming out of the Powder as well. So you'll see an immediate step up as we put out the flares and you'll continue to see a ramp given the rig counts in the activity levels we're seeing. Jeremy Tonet : That's very helpful, thanks. Just turning to CapEx, you guys have a very deep portfolio projects and it seems like it's kind of peaking right about now. Just wondering, what -- how you guys think about the balance of capital with great opportunities versus capital discipline that the market seems to be focused on? How do you see capital trending next year? Any color or thoughts you could provide there? Walt Hulse : Jeremy, this is Walt. We've got several projects that we've already announced that include Demicks Lake II, MB-5, Arbuckle II [Later changed by the Company] and West Texas expansion. All of those will be completed throughout the course of 2020. So you can kind of do the math on what we've already got ticked off. So we'll see a meaningful step down in our CapEx next year from what we have in 2019. Going forward, we think the vast majority of everything that we see on horizon has been announced. There will other growth opportunities that will come, but remember we've built the backbone of the system here with these two pipes. So, we have significant operating leveraging going forward. So if we had another processing plant or something along those lines, order of magnitude is significantly less as we go forward and then also I would point out that anything that we would announce in the coming quarters would really get spend over the couple of years. So our 2020 CapEx at this point is something that you can get a pretty good look just based on what we've announced today. Operator : Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni, UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Wondering if we can sort of talk about a couple of things here. Just you've sort of mentioned in your prepared remarks about the reduction in expectation for Bakken 12 expects for this year, but what's interesting in your commentary indicates that it's the function of the infrastructure delay, which in theory would imply a higher inventory for next year, but at the same time you also noted that the liquid component is higher so your volume expectations are unchanged. So what I think about next year, does it now mean that you to have potential for even higher inventory connection? And with the higher cut that you're seeing coming from the liquid side as you would think that 2020 could be even better than what you are originally vision for 2020? Or might not be thinking about that correct? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. I mean yes. I think that conceptually you're on the right path. We were able to --producers were clearly they were button up against unflattering constraints right because the basin with short processing capacity and NGL take away was full. So rather than going ahead and completing those wells knowing they're going flare they backed off and that's been going on for several months. So yes, that increase was the result of that. And yes, that gives us some tailwinds as we move into 2020. And then on the other side of that there just producers continue to deliver strong results which even though we connected fewer wells than we had anticipated we were still able to get more towards the higher end of our volume guidance. Terry Spencer : Yes, Kevin, it's fair to say that producers have consistently exceeded our expectations particularly in Williston. I think there we benefited from their own capital discipline and certainly finding ways to enhance the productivity of their well. The gas all ratios have been a big deal for us up there, which in turn has increased in our liquids and be available to our plant. So, I think just all in all, the backdrop is that producers have really done a superb job, not only delivering on what we expect them to deliver, but exceeding those expectations. Shneur Gershuni : And then just two quickly follow-up, one just the clarification you talked about more ethane recovery 4Q 19. Is that a function of the fact that there is a challenge to take away gas out of the basin right now and you just need to make more room on the gas line, so it make more sense to recovery of the ethane. Is that kind of the reason or is there something different? Sheridan Swords : Yes, this is Sheridan. So, I think you're right. You really need to look at the gas issue especially in the Permian and in the Mid-Continent. And when the Permian gas goes really, you see a lot more ethane come out of the Permian basin versus the Mid-Continent, we saw that in the third quarter. But now the gas prices during the fourth quarter have moved up in the Permian, a little bit and gas prices in the continent moves down, which allows more ethane to come out of Mid-Continent. So you really need to look at the gas price because the TNF out of the Mid-Continent and the TNF out of the Permian are fairly close together. So, it's not on that side of it. Shneur Gershuni : And one final question. In your conversation with Jeremy about CapEx and you've talked about it's being materially lower in 2020 versus 2019. So, there should be some sort of free cash in fruition. And I would expect there'll be an improvement in leverage, but when is the right time for us to start discussing return of capital options with free cash flow where you look at options like buy backs? Do you change dividend policy? And I\u2019m just kind of curious kind of what your thoughts on when the free cash flow starts to material next year? Walt Hulse : We said that we were get to four times debt to EBITDA by Q4 of 2020 or Q1 of 2021. We expect to continue to delever after that and we'll proceed down through into that 3 to 5 range, which is kind of aspirationally where we like to be. So, we still have some time, we're going to -- that's going to take through 2021, maybe into 2022. So, we're going to continue that delevering as our primary focus. And then going forward, we always are on the hunt for good growth opportunities. And to the extent that the commercial team finds those growth opportunities, we're going to pursue those, but keeping that leverage in that on a going forward basis, in and around that 3.5 times. Terry Spencer : The only thing I would add to Walt's comments are that the priority continues to be fund those, these attractive growth projects and we continue to have a runway of growth in front of us, albeit we don't have any of those great big infrastructure projects or backbone projects like Walt mentioned earlier, but the priority will continue to be around these great return organic projects. And certainly, we think about it as we have if and as we have cash available, certainly, retire debt, and then share backs could come into the equation, but I don't see it, but it's certainly something that we think about. If we get to a point where we're running out of growth projects and we're forced to look at other ways to invest our capital certainly share buybacks are something that we would consider. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Cho, Barclays. Christine Cho : Hi everyone. If I'm to back out the Rockies volumes that are feeding into the Arbuckle II contracted capacity. I still estimate that over 100,000 barrels per day is supposed to come from Mid-Continent and I know the outlook for 2020 and be at least more than 20% over 2019 is driven primarily by Bakken. But how should we risk the need Mid-Con volumes to show up to hit numbers? Do you need it to be flat at a minimum? Or can it sustain a decline and we can still have those numbers? Kevin Burdick : I mean, Christine, this is Kevin. Just looking kind of holistically at the Mid-Con, clearly, there has been some pullback recently by producers. We've factored all that in. We're probably thinking of the Mid-Continent in a flat to slightly declining type of environment as we factor in that to our 2020 growth outlook. So, we don't need significant or really any growth coming out of the STAKE and SCOOP to meet the growth outlook we provided for 2020. Christine Cho : And then, moving over to CapEx, you guys are very transparent in providing CapEx for each of the individual projects. But how should we think about the range of annual spending you guys do on ancillary CapEx that isn't included in the project CapEx you've disclosed or maintenance CapEx so like well connects, I don't know, maybe adding a compression -- compressor pump somewhere here? Kevin Burdick : Just looking at kind of what we would consider kind of that routine, growth routine CapEx that we're going to see on a year-in and year-out basis, that's probably in the $400 million to $500 million range. You throw some processing plants like Walt alluded to earlier on top of, it raises up a little bit, but that's kind of ranges just for that normal blocking and tackling type growth that we'd see. Walt Hulse : Christine, hang on a second. The only thing I would add to that is well connect, makes up the bulk of that routine growth, right. Kevin Burdick : Absolutely, yes, just connecting wells. Walt Hulse : And then probably plant connections and then other miscellaneous gathering infrastructure both on gatherings processing side as well as liquid side. Operator : The next question comes from Tristan Richardson, SunTrust. Tristan Richardson : Good morning, guys. Appreciate the commentary on direction of 2020 capital deployment, but just thinking about the flexibility you have for some longer dated projects that 2021 timeframe, that MB-5 Arbuckle expansion et cetera. Just talking about just your ability to flex of the timing of those either based on volume trajectory or producer plans, et cetera? Kevin Burdick : As we -- I guess, as we think about the big one there would be MB-5. With the volumes, we have coming and have line of sight to for MB-4 you're going to fill it up extremely quickly, so any growth at all, MB-5 is going to continue on. So I mean, could you do something if something went south in a hurry, potentially so, but again we don't see that again just with the line of sight, we've got to volumes that are going to hit us in the next few months here. Walt Hulse : Yes. Obviously, from the well connect and that sort of routine, if we saw a significant downturn in producer activity. We have some flexibility on our -- but we don't see it as it relates to MB-5 and Arbuckle II will be done in the first quarter of 2020. Tristan Richardson : And then just one small follow-up, just can you talk about the performance of the joint ventures, and why you saw the cash distributions from joint ventures expected to be much higher this year than you previously thought. Is that one-time event or is there just general outperformance on Northern Border or OPPL's old direction there? Terry Spencer : Yes, we've pretty robust discussion about this on our Q2 call. We had a one-time, kind of, catch-up $50 million distribution at our Northern Border and expect it to go back to its normal course in the quarters going forward that's in line with where it's been. So that was the only one, other than that the joint ventures are all performing very well. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Can you just give us an update on where the -- where things stand in terms of the potential expansion of Northern Border? And then, kind of, related to that, what's the timing for when you would need to see a new gas pipeline of capacity out of the Bakken before you would need to start effectively, I would call it force recovering ethane, because a BTU limits? Chuck Kelley : Michael, this is Chuck. As far as Northern Border expansion or any other residue takeaway out of the basin, we're actively working with parties on these residue projects frankly we're under non-disclosure agreements. But suffice it to say that there will be expansion opportunities out of there, and we realize that those takeaways needed to take care of our customers. So, we will definitely be part of that solution. As far as your second question on BTUs, BTU changes, could you please repeat your second question for me? Michael Blum : Yes, just one question about timing like when do you have to have new gas pipeline capacity to avoid basically reaching the limit and having to extract ethane? Chuck Kelley : Okay, those are really kind of two questions; one, is on the BTU limits on Northern Border. Northern Border is currently in discussion with customers and point operators about a potential BTU change in their tariff. And that would be forthcoming, we would believe in 2020 and anything beyond that will defer to our TransCanada operator on the asset. However, as far as more ethane recovery being necessary, it really comes down to how quickly the Bakken continues to grow and we have line of sight in 2020, it's kind of real quickly with these gas plants coming on. So as we continue to displace Canadian volumes that BTU will rise and obviously, the way to mitigate that is to recover more ethane. So I think 2020, you will see more ethane recovery. I can't give you a number on that. Longer term, we will need some residue takeaway relief. And I think that's more in the '22 timeframe. Operator : Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, Credit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : First question on the Mid-Con, just wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your ability to connect more third-party plants. It looks like you guys connected a few more this quarter and maybe seems to be a bit of a step-up. So, just curious, if there is an enhanced push to do more of that maybe as a way to kind of bridge you through next year, and alleviate some of that pressure, we're expecting to come from some of the rig count reduction? Sheridan Swords : Yes, this is Sheridan. We don't really have that many more plants in the Mid-Continent to connect. We've kind of connect all the ones that are out there, we saw a big push in 2019. A lot of those plants, we've seen some increase in production from those plants and we expect to kind of stay at that level through next year, the level we're at today on a C3 plus basis. So, and I think right now there is plenty of capacity out there what's to process the gas that's there. Spiro Dounis : Got it. And second question, just with respect to the narrow bands for 2019 guidance and imagine you have considerable visibility at this point. So just curious what could maybe flex full-year EBITDA results from here towards the high or low end of that range? Sheridan Swords : It's primarily going to be really just the specific timing of these projects and we look at the biggest levers we have, that would be number one. We've talked about spreads it can fluctuate up and down that could be a little bit of a driver, but we've got pretty good line of sight at this point to where we're going to end the year. Spiro Dounis : Understood. Thanks, it really helped. I'm sorry. Sheridan Swords : No just to -- Walt jumped in, weather is always, it could be a factor, if you get earlier or know whether that could be an impact as well. Operator : Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury, Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi, good morning. As you referenced a lot of Bakken processing capacity starting up in theory enough to eliminate flaring. Can you share what your estimates for flaring levels once there is enough processing in Elk Creek or like down to the 12%, say target something much lower or possibly something a little higher? Terry Spencer : Jean Ann, the way I would answer that is, if you go back to few years or actually just with probably 12 to 18 months ago. The basin was down into for several months down into single-digit. So easily, I think with this processing capacity, once everybody, once we get Elk Creek up and once everybody gets, kind of, everything debottlenecked, I think you're going to see flaring get back down below the state targets or above the state targets for capture. I think that's going to -- that will happen. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay, that's helpful. And then can you just -- around your connects flexibility, you have to move volumes between the existing Bakken NGL pipeline and Elk Creek once it starts up? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. We'll operate those systems, kind of, in tandem to make sure that we optimize, variable costs, optimized going into OPPL and going on Elk Creek Pipeline. So we have a lot of flexibility to move product back and forth between the two pipelines to maximize capacity. Operator : Your next question comes from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I won't even get into the upcoming LSU game here. But real quickly figured and one you all would like that. Real quick good items; one, I assume there is -- should we think about, and I know 2021 is a long way off in the world can change seven times between now and then. But I assume there's still a pretty decent step up in '21 off of 2020. You've talked about 2020 EBITDA being up 20% plus, but is there still another pretty decent size step up coming in 2021, that's first question. Second question, you guys have talked about a desire to -- want to have export capacity. Just given all that's going on in the world, ethane prices down a lot more, China trade war still going on. How are you thinking about that opportunity and where that fits in the landscape of things you're targeting that do over the next year or two? Terry Spencer : So Michael, first of all, I'll take LSU and 14 points. And then the next question is yes, as we think about 2021 double-digit growth is certainly in the cards and how this business is continuing to be set up and we still got obviously organic growth projects that will be coming on through '20 and critical projects in 2021. So we're still set up nicely there. I think as far as the export dock project goes still a project we're very interested in doing. We continue to work it pretty hard. If the economics make sense, we'll certainly do a project, but if they don't make sense, I think we're in good shape with our business in terms of clearing barrels, we have arrangements in place that gives us some certainty that -- of course over the next handful of years we can clear barrels. So we're not really concerned there, I think, the export dock is a great complement to our fee-based activities. So we're going to continue to work it and when we get to a point where we can announce it certainly we'll let you all know. Operator : The next question comes from Elvira Scotto, RBC Capital Markets. Elvira Scotto : Hey, good morning everyone, thanks for the commentary around the 2020 EBITDA growth, and it sounds like the confidence level and hitting that greater than 20% growth is pretty high, especially given the comments that you made about your view on the Mid-Con, but if I can ask the question another way, what would have to happen for you to walk back that outlook? Kevin Burdick : Elvira, this is Kevin. And I'll start again we -- the thing we have stressed for the last several months. We continue to focus on this is with the flared gas in the Bakken, we've got incredible line of sight to these volumes, a similar situation occurred back in the '16, '15 or '16 timeframe where we saw the flared gas, we had projects and we immediately captured it and turned it into EBITDA. So with the flaring that's occurring in the basin, with the dock count that's out there, with the productivity and the returns, the producers are seeing we've just got a lot of confidence if that's going to be the substantial driver to that growth in 2020. And that's not even getting into the growth we're seeing out of the Permian, the Powder and other places. So we just have a confidence because we have that line of sight, we can reach out and touch these volumes. Terry Spencer : Kevin, probably the only thing else I'd add to that is we don't have a whole lot in here baked in for ethane recovery. So with the ore spreads, so we're at seasonally low spreads with -- you're typically low this time of the year. Ethane economics are marginal for recovery, if those things turn, there is actually more upside probably did this number than downside. Elvira Scotto : Great. And just very quickly though, how does commodity or crude oil price factor into this view. I mean, are you looking at anything as long as we're about $50 or do you think even you get to somewhere below $50 you're still fine with this outlook? Kevin Burdick : Well, we go back to when rigs really came back to the Bakken, they really start coming back in earnest it at around $45 per barrel from the conversations we have with our customers most are planning for a $50 environment more from a cash flow perspective, but the improvements they've seen in the productivity of the wells. Again, the returns on the well aren't be challenged, it's solely just living within their cash flow, which has been the consistent theme we've gotten from our customers. So I think easily, if you stay north of $50 probably even if you go down to the $45 range, you're still -- this things good to go. Elvira Scotto : Great. That's perfect. Thanks on that. And then just one quick follow-up on the capital allocation discussion, where does M&A fit in all of this, I mean, are you guys are you open to looking at various assets or are you kind of set on just your organic growth and M&A just has to be super compelling? Terry Spencer : You just answered it, we're focused on the organic growth and M&A has to uber compelling and most likely, it would be smaller bolt-on types of acquisitions. Operator : Our next question comes from Derek Walker, Bank of America Securities. Derek Walker : Just had a quick clarification, I think you said in your formal remarks, but I just want to make sure I heard it right. I think believe in the Rockies the NGL volumes were expected to be 240 in 1Q '20. Is that assuming 140 for Bakken NGL and then 100 on Elk Creek that seems no rail, is that correct for the 25, that rail that you're seeing today that should you just transfer over to the pipe that I'm hearing it? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. Yes, you are correct, and we're starting to transition to -- away from specifically talking about what's on Elk Creek to what's coming out of both the Rockies region, which is Williston and Powder River Basin. Because of the flexibility we have between moving between pipes. So that 240 is basically over 100,000 barrels a day increase from where we were when we just had the Bakken pipeline coming in. So that's the new plants that we talked about coming online, rail coming off and then ramp up on to those volumes and actually we said we think will be above 240 coming out of the first quarter. Derek Walker : And then, maybe I'll just get one in on ESG, I mean, you guys announced in September that you got added to the Dow Jones Sustainability Index. Can you just talk a little bit about some of your ESG Initiatives and have you any conversation specifically with investors around that, and they focused on any particular metrics? Terry Spencer : Well, there are always focused on getting more information and certainly probably what we've done, where we've made incredible progress is certainly in the disclosure of our emissions and various environmental impact data, that has -- we had a lot of discussion, obviously from a governance perspective, I think, we've been lauded for the -- for our efficiency from a governance standpoint. When you really think about our broad thoughts around reducing our impact to the environment, that's certainly an area where I think it's resonated with investors. I think the fact that we've done this now for 11 years in a row and at this -- and this work product continues to improve each and every year. I think certainly that has resonated with investors as well. So disclosure, disclosure, disclosure and as we continue to move forward, we will continue to disclose more information and certainly around emissions targets and that type of outlook will certainly something that's top of mind and that will hopefully be in a position where we can do and provide those types of disclosures in the not too distant future. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Terry when you highlighted ethane was only further upside as a catalyst over and above the 20% year-over-year 2020 EBITDA growth guidance. But then you all comment of that 2021 is prime for another year of double-digit growth. When we're looking out two years like that. Are we kind of taking it some of the ethane eventually? Or does that kind of remain an opportunity? Kevin Burdick : Yes. No we're really, over the course of the next handful of years not expecting or at least we've not got in our base forecast internally much ethane baked into it at least for the next two or three years. Craig Shere : And what kind of market dynamics do you expect would be necessary to kind of, it start to realize -- I mean, would be ethane exports or what do we really need to start to get more value there? Kevin Burdick : Well, obviously we've got more petrochemical facilities coming on domestically. And then you've got additional petrochemical facilities coming on internationally. So I think the continued development of international exports, whether that's at the Gulf Coast or in the Northeast, I think continues to be key drivers. And obviously ethane economics and dependent upon net gas to -- where net gases and if net gas and we continue to have some sort of a conservative view on that gas going forward. I think if you see net gas remain relatively weak. The likelihood if you're recovering significantly more ethane certainly improves. But as we think ethane economics are so volatile that we've really -- we felt it appropriate not to bake a whole lot in -- into our internal forecasts. Sheridan you've got anything add to that? Sheridan Swords : Well, that continue to say what's going to drive ethane. Also, as we talked earlier about the relative gas price in the Mid-Continent versus the Permian to see which one moves ahead of the other one to pull the ethane out for the demand that is there. Craig Shere : Sure. Are you still considering ethane when you're looking at these export project opportunities? Terry Spencer : Absolutely. Craig Shere : And I presume that if you did that, it would be something kind of semi long-term contracted and take out some of that volatile in and out of economics. So you'd have somewhat certainty about pulling through the system? Terry Spencer : That's correct. I mean, the way we're thinking about it is the contracts that you would enter into with respect to ethane on the sales standpoint, which certainly underwrite the dock a fee-based type arrangement, if you will, or perhaps the sale with a fee-based component built into it. Craig Shere : Great, thank you. Terry Spencer : The macro ethane economics are going to be what they're going to be, broadly speaking. But as we think about the dock, if the dock and as it relates to ethane fee-based, it's a fee-based business. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kania, Wolfe Research. Alex Kania : Hey, good morning. Just thinking a little bit more about the prospects for ethane recovery in the Bakken just next year either for price reasons or I guess physical constraint reasons, just with respect to Northern Border. How do we really think about those ethane volumes getting handle. Does that -- do you think of that is like incremental to what is it being contracted on Elk Creek and further south already? Or does it -- could it cover like existing contracted volume levels that you've kind of our established right now, just again, kind of, it sounds like you've suggested it was incremental, but I just wanted to confirm? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan, when we look at and is quoted volumes coming out of the Rockies. We do not consider ethane in any of those volumes. It's all C3 plus, so any ethane that we would get, due to be enforced out because of constraints or the very unlikely that it becomes economical will be upside to our volume numbers that we've given. Operator : Okay. Our final question comes from Sunil Sibal, Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Hi, good morning, guys and thanks for all the color on the call. I just wanted to understand a little bit about the balance sheet management. So it seems like you will hit the ForEx, kind of, leverage metrics in early 2021. I was kind of curious how should we think about that on a more kind of longer-term basis. Do you want to be closer to ForEx or should we be thinking more like between 3 or 3.5 excess longer-term target? Terry Spencer : Well, we expect to continue to the left to delever past to 4 times and aspirationally we like to be around that 3.5 that gives us a lot of borrowing flexibility going forward for these smaller type of CapEx that would come out in the future. So we use 3.5 is an aspirational target and just think about going forward. Sunil Sibal : Okay, got it. And then just one clarity on the CapEx side, so obviously you guys have given a pretty good kind of breakdown of CapEx for various projects. When I bake all that into my numbers etc, it seems like you will be in a pretty good spot to get 35% to 40% reduction in CapEx in 2020 versus where you've end up in 2019. I was just curious, is that number seems reasonable or if I may be off somewhere? Terry Spencer : No we're not going to guide to our 2020 CapEx But I think you can just take the projects we put in service and kind of subtract out what we still have to do and build up to a pretty good number. So the base will come up with your expectation is readily available, we'll leave that to you. Operator : Okay. At this time, I would like to turn call back over to Andrew Ziola. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you, Charles -- excuse me, our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in early January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us this morning and the IR team will be available throughout the day. Have a good week.

Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. 2019 was an outstanding year, a year of project execution and record-setting safety performance for ONEOK, positioning ourselves for exceptional growth in 2020 and 2021. Yesterday, we announced fourth quarter and full year 2019 results, announced our 2020 guidance and provided a 2021 outlook. We also announced 3 expansion projects that will further strengthen ONEOK's position in the Williston and Permian Basins, and increase the needed natural gas processing and NGL transportation capacity for our customers. It is important to point out that these high-return projects build off of our existing assets. These projects include the Demicks Lake III plant in the Williston Basin, the full expansion of the Elk Creek pipeline to 400,000 barrels per day and the fourth expansion of the West Texas LPG pipeline since October 2017. Our growth program is providing critical natural gas and NGL infrastructure to our customers, including assets to help significantly reduce natural gas flaring in the Williston Basin and provide increased connectivity all the way to the Texas Gulf Coast. Upon completion, our announced projects will expand the backbone of our NGL business and will add processing capacity to further strengthen our position as a leading midstream service provider. As for project updates, we announced that Elk Creek was completed in mid-December, Demicks Lake I and II were completed in October 2019 and January 2020, respectively, and the first phase of the MB-4 fractionator was completed in late December. Kevin will provide more color on the projects that are slated for completion here in the first quarter. Our last earnings call in late October, I made a comment that 2021 is setting up to be another year of double-digits growth. With many of our projects being completed this year and into next year, we are confident in our 2020 [Later changed by the Company to 2021] earnings outlook of adjusted EBITDA increasing approximately 20% compared to our 2020 guidance midpoint. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Terry, ONEOK's 2019 net income totaled $1.28 billion or $3.07 per share, an 11% increase compared with 2018. In 2019, adjusted EBITDA totaled $2.58 billion, a 5% increase year-over-year. Natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth, higher average fee rates and increased transportation capacity contracted, all contributed to a strong 2019 performance. The natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipeline segments ended the year with adjusted EBITDA increases of 11% and 12%, respectively, compared with 2018, exceeding the high end of the 2019 guidance range in both segments. The natural gas liquids segment adjusted EBITDA increased 2% compared with 2018, about 4% below the low end of the 2019 guidance range, due primarily to narrower-than-expected NGL price differentials. Distributable cash flow for 2019 was $2.02 billion, up 11% compared to 2018, with a healthy full year dividend coverage of 1.38x. We also generated nearly $560 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid in 2019. Our annual dividends paid during 2019 were $3.53 per share, a 9% increase compared with 2018, in line with our previously stated guidance. And in January, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, also an increase of 9% compared with the first quarter of 2018. Our December 31 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.8x. We continue to expect to be at 4x debt-to-EBITDA run rate in late 2020 or early 2021 with deleveraging continuing thereafter as volumes ramp and additional projects come online. We ended the year having no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and $220 million of commercial paper outstanding. As Terry mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement, we provided detailed 2020 financial and volume guidance and a 2021 outlook. Our 2020 guidance includes increases in our earnings per share and adjusted EBITDA midpoints of 16% and 25%, respectively, compared with 2019. We expect double-digit year-over-year earnings growth in our natural gas liquids and our natural gas gathering and processing segments of 15% and 11%, respectively. Our natural gas pipeline segment had a strong 2019, and we expect another solid year of performance for the segment in 2020. Key drivers to achieving our 2020 financial guidance expectations include volume growth expected from the Elk Creek pipeline and the Demicks Lake processing plants, and contributions from the Arbuckle II pipeline, the MB-4 fractionator and the second West Texas LPG expansion, all projects that we expect to be completed here in the first quarter. Our 2020 growth capital guidance range of $2.25 billion to $2.73 billion is a significant decrease compared with our peak CapEx spend in 2019 and incorporates the projects we announced yesterday. As a reminder, what we call routine growth capital such as well connections and plant connections is included in this number. Our 2021 outlook of an approximate 20% increase in adjusted EBITDA compared with the 2020 guidance midpoint is driven by continued volume growth on Elk Creek resulting from the increased volumes from plants connected in 2020, the Bakken NGL pipeline extension and the Bear Creek expansion. Volume growth in the Permian Basin and the Gulf Coast from the completion of the MB-5 fractionator and the third and fourth expansions of West Texas LPG pipeline will also contribute to the 2021 increase. With these project completions this year and early next year, total capital expenditures are expected to decrease significantly in 2021 relative to 2020. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at each of our operating segments. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. 2019 was an impressive year with strong producer activity across our operations, driving NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processed volume increases of 7% compared with 2018. We expect volumes to continue to increase in 2020 and our earnings to remain more than 90% fee-based. As Terry said, we completed our Demicks Lake II plant in the Williston Basin in January and expect to complete 3 additional NGL projects by the end of the first quarter. Overall, our projects are on time and on budget, positioning us well for continued growth as volumes on these projects ramp up. Let's start with our Rocky Mountain region, which includes the Williston and Powder River Basins. Producer activity remains strong in both the Williston and Powder River basins. North Dakota continues to see natural gas production of more than 3 billion cubic feet per day, and the basin-wide rig count remains in the 50 to 55 range with approximately 25 rigs on our dedicated acreage. Rig counts have remained consistent in this $50 to $55 WTI crude oil price environment, which we expect to continue. Natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky Mountain region increased 11% in both the fourth quarter and full year 2019 compared with the same periods in 2018. Processed volumes averaged 1.05 billion cubic feet per day for 2019, above the midpoint of our volume guidance range. We expect processed volumes from this region to increase more than 25% compared with 2019 due to the completion of the Demicks Lake plants as we significantly reduce gas currently being flared. We connected 526 wells in the Rocky Mountain region in 2019. Better-than-expected well performance and higher gas to oil ratios contributed to volume growth even with producers temporarily delaying well completions until our Demicks Lake plants came online. We expect to connect between 575 and 625 wells in 2020. Our 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake I natural gas processing plant that was placed in service in the fourth quarter is expected to be full by the end of the first quarter. We expect our Demicks Lake II plant to ramp to full capacity over the next 12 to 18 months. With the latest reported natural gas flaring data of approximately 500 million cubic feet per day in the basin and approximately 300 million of that on ONEOK's dedicated acreage, we now have the capacity available to capture a significant portion of this flared gas. Our Bear Creek plant remains on schedule to be completed early in the first quarter of 2021, which will provide much-needed processing capacity to the highly productive geographically isolated Dunn County area, where we have substantial acreage dedications. The Demicks Lake expansion will provide an additional 200 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity when it is completed in the third quarter of 2021. With the completion of these 2 facilities, ONEOK will have approximately 1.9 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Williston Basin. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, which consists of Elk Creek and the Bakken NGL pipeline, increased 9% compared with the third quarter 2019 and 23% compared with the full year 2018. We expect our Rocky Mountain NGL volumes to continue to increase as approximately 850 million cubic feet per day of processing capacity from ONEOK and third-party plants has come online since the third quarter 2019. We recently reached more than 230,000 barrels per day of raw feed throughput on Elk Creek and the Bakken NGL pipeline combined and continue to expect to exit the first quarter of 2020 with more than 240,000 barrels per day. Yesterday, we announced an expansion of the Elk Creek pipeline to its full capacity of 400,000 barrels per day. The expansion is supported by well over 240,000 barrels per day of long-term dedicated production from ONEOK and third-party plants, excluding any incremental ethane. Of the 160,000 barrel per day expansion, approximately 60,000 barrels per day of the capacity is expected to be available in early 2021 and the remaining 100,000 barrels per day by the third quarter of 2021. We also see -- continue to see growth in the Powder River Basin as production results remain strong, benefiting both our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments. Moving on to the Mid-Continent. Natural gas volumes processed increased 3% year-over-year, above the midpoint of our guidance range, connecting 117 wells to our gathering and processing system. Based on recent discussions with our customers, we expect our natural gas volumes processed in the Mid-Continent region to decrease approximately 10% this year compared with 2019 and expect to connect 40 to 60 wells. Total NGL raw feed throughput in the Mid-Continent region for the fourth quarter decreased slightly compared with the third quarter, due primarily to spot volumes in the third quarter that did not carry over to the fourth quarter. Outside of ethane rejection, we expect relatively flat Mid-Continent volumes on our system in 2020 compared with the fourth quarter 2019. During 2019, we connected 5 new third-party processing plants to our natural gas liquids system in the region, and 2 previously connected third-party plants on our system were expanded. Our Arbuckle II pipeline remains on schedule for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2020. Arbuckle II will play an important role in transporting incremental supply from the Williston and Powder River Basins, the Mid-Continent and the Permian Basin to the Gulf Coast. Arbuckle II is the lower end of the NGL backbone and will be our fifth pipeline that can funnel supply from across our entire system to the Gulf Coast markets. Finishing with the Permian Basin and Gulf Coast. NGL raw feed throughput volumes in this region increased 22% year-over-year, and the average fee rate increased compared with the third quarter 2019. We expect average rates to continue to increase as we bring on new volumes with bundled rates from our completed expansion projects. We announced our fourth expansion of the West Texas LPG system, 100,000 barrel per day fully contracted expansion with long-term dedicated production from third-party processing plants in the region. We now have announced approximately 260,000 barrels per day of expansions on West Texas LPG to support volume growth in the region. Our system-wide NGL fractionation capacity remains highly utilized. Phase 1 of our MB-4 fractionator, which was completed in December, has increased our capacity by 75,000 barrels per day. Phase 2 of the project, which will add the remaining 50,000 barrels per day of capacity, remains on schedule for completion by the end of the first quarter of 2020. And our MB-5 fractionator remains on track for completion in the first quarter 2021. Our overall NGL segment raw feed throughput volume guidance is expected to increase 15% in 2020, driven by a full year of operations of Elk Creek and the completions of the Arbuckle II pipeline, the MB-4 fractionator and 80,000 barrel per day West Texas LPG pipeline expansion, all expected in the first quarter of 2020. Continued growth from plant connections and expansions completed in 2019 will also contribute to higher volumes in 2020. We expect 6 to 9 new third-party plant connections or expansions, including the connection already completed with Demicks Lake II. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. 2019 was another successful year for ONEOK, and I'm proud of our employees who continue to focus on safety, reliability and the execution of our growth projects. Operating our integrated network of assets in the manner for which ONEOK has a strong reputation remains our focus and is the foundation for all our successes we've discussed today, and will continue to be as we move forward as we transition from this build cycle to a period of significant cash flow generation. Thank you to all our dedicated employees for your hard work and contributions in helping us achieve another year of company-wide growth in 2019. And 2020 is off to a great start as we are in the middle of many project completions and new asset operations that will position us well in the coming years. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. And our first question comes from Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate all the commentary on the expansions. Could you talk -- just a quick one. The difference on the CapEx side between Demicks III. It seems like you've got a lot of efficiencies versus the first 2 as well as the Bear Creek expansion. Just the difference in costs, should we think of that as an opportunity for enhanced return profile for Demicks III versus the others? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Tristan, this is Kevin. Yes, that's -- I mean, that's the way we think about it. The reason for the lower capital is, again, kind of more expansions when -- as we've constructed Demicks I and Demicks II, things like power, a lot of the inlet handling for the plant, some of the pipeline infrastructure, we're doing -- we're expanding existing compressor stations rather than building new compressor stations. So all those things contribute to that capital being lower than the previous projects. Tristan Richardson : Helpful. And then -- and just on the Elk Creek expansion, in terms of the volumes behind that, should we think of that as primarily there to serve Demicks III as well as Bear Creek? Or are there -- could you talk about the quantity of other third-party plants that could be behind the latest expansion? Kevin Burdick : Yes. I mean, that's the way to think about it. As we continue to ramp volumes with more than 240,000 barrels a day now of contracted on the pipe, we needed to expand it. We also wanted to make sure we had the ability to handle any ethane that needs to come out incrementally. But again, the economics are really based more on just the traditional, the classic C3 plus volume growth that we see. We still have a lot of opportunities, and we're in late-stage negotiations with several customers north of the river as we build that lateral that's going to connect over to the Hess plant. So there's still opportunities out there in front of us. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : I was just wondering if we can dive into the 2021 plus 20% EBITDA guidance a little bit. Just trying to understand what it assumes, I guess, with -- obviously, it's -- what part of it is a ramp-up of Elk Creek, but how much ethane recovery are you assuming from the Bakken? Is it full ethane recovery? Also I was wondering if you can talk about kind of the margin uplift? If you can sort of like walk us through what is the delta between '20 and '21 in terms of what's going into your assumptions? Kevin Burdick : Sure. Shneur, this is Kevin. Clearly, it is a Bakken-driven story. I think you start and just kind of go down the list of projects that are coming on either late this year or early, early in '21. So you've got Bear Creek II, that expansion, which, again, there's going to be some flared gas behind that facility when it's up. We've got 4 large, well-capitalized producers that are just dying to go drill down there, but there's just no capacity currently. So there's growth there. We've talked about the north lateral from our -- on our -- in our NGL segment that will go connect to the Hess Plant that will be completed in Q4 of this year. So we'll have a year of volumes on that. You've got continued just core growth in -- of our existing plants, the Demicks Lake facilities that will continue to ramp up, and then we'll have a little opportunity for Demicks III towards the end of the year. And then you mentioned the ethane opportunity that -- yes, we do have what we would consider a modest level of ethane. If you look at the production growth, that -- just from capturing the flared gas and as these other -- ours and third-party plants ramp up, it's just some math that determines we're going to need to pull some ethane out. So we've got around 25,000 to 40,000 barrels per day of ethane that we believe will come out in '21 and that is a result of the BTU heat content issue on Northern border. Permian and Gulf Coast, we've got the 3 expansions that are coming on between now and the middle of '21 that will provide additional volume growth, and we have a full year of the MB-5 fractionator in '21 as well. So you pull all that together, we see, both our NGL and G&P segments, volume growth continuing to increase, and it's going to be well into double digits. Shneur Gershuni : That was very helpful. Really do appreciate that. Maybe as a follow-up question, kind of a two parter, if you don't mind. With your CapEx activity, I mean, despite the fact that you've announced these new projects, it is definitely lower than where it's been and you sort of see slowing producer activity. I was just wondering what are the opportunities for ONEOK to pivot and optimize on the cost side? Are there costs that you can now strip out now that you can sort of see where your business is running? And also, are you able to potentially pursue an asset-light strategy? When I sort of think about your Elk Creek expansion as well as the West Texas LPG brings a lot more volumes into -- on the NGL side, which would suggest you would need a frac. But given their excess frac capacity out there, are there ways for you to sublease others -- other fracs and sort of take advantage of that in pursuing asset-light strategy? Just sort of wondering if you can sort of talk about other ways to optimize for further earnings growth beyond 2021? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Kevin, again. I think we -- I believe we have been doing that already in a lot of ways. The previous question about Demicks Lake, that's a great example of a brownfield expansion to where we put it there. And again, we're able to significantly reduce the capital for that capacity. As we think about the fracs, I think we've done that as well. We have clear line of sight to MB-4 being full and significant volumes, if not MB-5 being full. But if you remember, the other thing we've done is we've announced like 65,000 barrels a day of, again, expansions at our existing facilities that our team was able to go find for much less capital than building another greenfield frac. And so that has delayed any discussion of an MB-6 because our team has been able to find those types of debottlenecking and expansion opportunities. So I'd like to thank our team. We've done that. And we -- that's part of our DNA as we think about how we provide the capacity for our customers. And I know you made a comment at the very beginning, I would like to just give you my point of view, and I don't think we have seen slowing producer activity on our acreage, especially when you talk about the Bakken and the Permian. Yes, the Mid-Continent has pulled back, but we haven't seen any slowed activity in the Bakken or Permian at all. Shneur Gershuni : No. Fair enough. I do appreciate the color. Maybe one final question. When do you guys expect -- when is your next projection for ONEOK to be a cash taxpayer? Walter Hulse : Shneur, as we've said in the past, when we did the acquisition of the partnership back in '17, we said we wouldn't be a taxpayer through 2021. We've built between $6 billion and $7 billion worth of assets with bonus depreciation that we've been able to take advantage on top of that. So we have a good runway here before we will become a taxpayer at all. And then, at some point, there will be a limitation on the utilization of the NOL that was put in place with the last tax act. But that would -- at that point, going forward, we would have kind of a 4% to 5% marginal rate somewhere out there in the future. So we don't see a full tax paying situation well into the future. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : If I could actually start as a follow-up to the ethane extraction in the Bakken. Should we think of this -- the ethane extraction that you'll potentially do next year as a temporary dynamic until another pipeline comes on and more Canadian gas can come back to blend with the Bakken gas? Or do you think it will be more of a permanent thing? Kevin Burdick : Christine, this is Kevin. I think we believe it's going to be a long-term thing. Because if you think about new capacity, any new capacity that's going to come online in the Bakken, it is highly likely it's going to have a BTU spec on it also because it's not going to have other gas to blend down with like currently is going on Northern border. So at least the various projects that we've looked at and been involved with, all of those contemplate a BTU spec. Christine Cho : Okay. That's what I thought. Just wanted to confirm. And then could you give us a breakdown of where the 6 to 9 third-party plant connections are regionally? Sheridan Swords : Christine, this is Sheridan. Those are going to come in -- as you'd expect, in the Bakken and in the Permian. And the 6 is pretty much half and half on each one of them. The growth is going to be some plants that will be coming on at the end of 2020 that could either be in 2020 or 2021. Christine Cho : Okay. And is the growth primarily Bakken? Or that's also split between Permian and... Sheridan Swords : It's split. Christine Cho : Okay. And then can you give us an idea of the cadence and the magnitude of the third-party frac costs and rail cost roll off in 2020? Sheridan Swords : Yes. Christine, we won't see any third-party rail costs in 2020 or we haven't predicted any since Elk Creek coming online, that has been reduced to 0. But the third-party frac will be about the same level it was in 2019 as in 2020 as we get ready for MB-5 coming online. Christine Cho : Okay. So those costs are not going to go down this year? Sheridan Swords : Third-party frac costs won't go down in 2020 from 2019. And that's baked into our guidance. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to follow-up, I guess, with your conversations with producers in this environment and given how the commodity price has declined a bit here. Just wondering if you could relate with us, I guess, expectations for drilling activity. Has that been moderating? Or it seems like it'd all be firmly baked into your guidance at this point, but anything that you can share with us, I guess, on this topic? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. Yes, we're looking at the commodity environment very similar to our producers. Really, we focus on the crude side. We don't -- we have reduced our direct commodity exposure so significantly that really it's not that big a deal just when you get into the NGL prices or the nat gas prices. Most of the producers, our customers are telling us they're planning for a $50 crude environment. And therefore, that's the activity levels we're kind of assuming of the activity levels that you're seeing in the Bakken and the Permian in the current landscape. So that's the way we're thinking about it over the next couple of years, which we believe is very consistent with the way our customers are thinking about it. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. And just a couple of cleanup questions, I guess, with the NGL logistics side. How do you guys sit on the storage side at this point? Do you think that there's more expansions that are needed there to kind of do what you want to do in Belvieu? And then in the 2021 guide, I guess, the Conway-Belvieu spread, any thoughts you could share with us on how that lands at that point? Sheridan Swords : Well, I'd just say on the storage side that right now, we are in the process of constructing two new storage wells, both are 1.5 million barrels. And we're also putting in a 3.5 million barrel brine pond. So right now, we do see the need to expand our storage facilities, and we are doing it, and those will come up -- one of those will come -- one of those wells will come up this year. The next one will come up next year. So we think that puts us in a very good position on our storage side to be able to handle our growth. And then on the Conway to Belvieu spread, as we said, with the Arbuckle II pipeline coming online, for sure, the spreads are going to be very narrow. And in our 2020 and 2021 guidance, we are predicting a historically low spread or very narrow spread between Conway and Belvieu. Jeremy Tonet : Got you. Great. And just to confirm, I think you had said $50 to $55 is kind of the price deck that you guys are employing when you think about this guidance going forward? Walter Hulse : Yes. From a crude activity perspective, that's the level we're thinking about it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : A couple of questions. First of all, when thinking about flaring and flaring limits, just curious do you think there's potential for North Dakota to tighten the flaring limits further? And if so, what would have to happen for that? And second, do you have any read-through or read into the recent report put out by the Railroad Commission in Texas regarding flaring there? Kevin Burdick : Michael, it's Kevin. I'll start and then let Chuck jump in. I mean, the flaring -- the gas capture targets or the flaring targets in North Dakota do step down at the end of this year. They step down from 88% capture or step up from 88% capture to 91% capture. So clearly, that is one step-up in conversations we have with the state and our producers. Obviously, we want to drive that number well below that. We have experience. When you look back at '15 and '16, when we -- when midstream kind of got caught up, we drove flaring to lower levels than that. So I think that's the goal. As it relates to Texas, yes, we saw the report. I think any -- just from a regulatory perspective, I do think we'll see continued discussions around flaring. As to where that goes from a regulation standpoint, I don't know that I'd have a point of view at this point. But Chuck, anything? Charles Kelley : Yes, I guess what I would add, in North Dakota, Michael, is that the -- kind of the interested stakeholders up there between the state, the producers and the processors have been meeting fairly regularly over the last, let's call it, 2 quarters, looking at the current flaring rules, flaring exemptions, how the interested parties can work more closely together to mitigate flaring. And there's some discussion of potentially changing some of these rules going forward, but there's nothing concrete as of yet. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then... Terry Spencer : Michael, let me just make one quick comment to -- I'll follow-up. So with the Texas report, I think it's just indicative of the fact that the heat on producers is really going to be stepping up in terms of flaring. And I think for midstream companies, I think that actually creates, obviously, opportunity. And in particular, we're going to see, I think, a step-up in terms of infrastructure getting built or maximized in order to reduce the flaring. And obviously, when we maximize that throughput from that rich gas, we're going to create more NGLs coming out of the basin sooner rather than later. So I think that's going to -- I think it's really going to step up. And I think the step 1 was the fact that the Texas Railroad Commission acknowledged what was happening. I think they did some really -- kind of took a unique look at it in terms of intensity of flaring. I think it really showed a picture that it's going to have to be addressed. And the regulators are going to have to address it and midstream's going to be a big part of that solution, of course. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one follow-up just on the guidance. The growth CapEx range is a pretty wide range to give in February of the prompt here. Just curious what anchors the low and the high end of that range? Kevin Burdick : Michael, it's Kevin. Similar to last year, when we had an even wider range, it really comes down to timing. You look at the number of projects we have -- we're expecting to come online in the first quarter. If we're always looking for ways to pull those back, if those get pulled back and we start realizing the EBITDA sooner, we'd love to do that, but that may pull a little capital that would move you towards the high end. Conversely, if some of these things, if they go the other direction for whatever reason, it could slow down some of the capital spend in '20 that would move you towards the low end. So it's really just going to come down to timing. Operator : Our next question comes from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Colton Bean : So just to follow-up there on the 2020 capital program. Can you clarify how much of that is attributable to the $900 million of backlog additions you slated for 2021? Kevin Burdick : Yes. About half of the $900 million we announced is 2020 spend. Colton Bean : Got it. That's helpful. And then with Demicks Lake III announced slated for '21, how are you evaluating absolute residue gas takeaway, understanding the comments earlier on heat content, but just in terms of absolute dry gas capacity? Charles Kelley : Yes. Colton, this is Chuck. What I could say, I mean, obviously, you're going to need residue gas takeaway. We've said before some time in '22, perhaps 2023. We're currently in late-stage negotiations, negotiating a proceeding agreement with the project coming out of the Bakken. We're under an NDA, so we can't go into that any further. However, we believe some time in the next month or two, you should see some information come out publicly. Colton Bean : Understood. And just a final one from me. On the Elk Creek expansion, is that effectively an all or nothing type process? Or could you add horsepower more ratably as it's needed? Sheridan Swords : Well, Colton, this is Sheridan. As you said -- we said in our remarks that we will get some of that early in 2021 and then the later will come in later 2021, so we are ramping up that capacity as we go through the year. And if some reason we could slow it down if we needed to. We don't see that happening, but we could. We will get some as we go through the 2021. So we are ramping up the capacity. Operator : We'll take our next question from Derek Walker with Bank of America. Derek Walker : Just a couple of ones for me. Maybe I'll follow-up on the growth CapEx. I think you've talked to sort of the routine CapEx before around well connects and plant connects. How much of the 2020 growth CapEx is considered routine CapEx? And then similarly, kind of going into '21, you mentioned a step down in growth CapEx again. Should we kind of think of a similar run rate for routine CapEx in '21? Or should we think of that directionally up or down? Walter Hulse : Yes. Over the years, we've said that our growth -- our routine growth CapEx is somewhere between $250 million to $400 million or so. It varies depending on where the plants are that we have to connect or the wells we're connecting, but it always is in that range. It's included in our guidance for 2020. From a growth CapEx standpoint, it wouldn't be significantly different in 2021, but we expect a meaningful step down in CapEx from 2020 to 2021 in the range of $1 billion less in 2021 than we will have in 2020. Derek Walker : Got it. And then maybe I'll just ask a quick one on the dividend policy. You hit 9% last year. Should we think about 9% again in '21? Or should we think about kind of a normalized sort of rate relative to either the dividend [indiscernible] or perhaps some of the larger midstream names in the space? Walter Hulse : Well, we've guided pretty regularly since 2017 that through 2021, we would pay in that 9% to 11% range. We've been at 9% throughout. And we don't see anything at this point that will change that view through 2021, and we're not going to give a view pass that. Operator : We'll take our next question from Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Christopher Sighinolfi : Kevin, I just wanted to go back maybe to something Michael was asking, but ask it slightly differently. And that's on flared volumes on the Rocky's footprint today, I believe, in your January update, you'd noted, for November, it was about 300 million cubic feet a day net to your acreage. I'm just curious, I guess, as a starting measure, where that is today? And then if we look at the growth in gathered volumes you've modeled or anticipate for 2020 versus what you did in the fourth quarter, how much of that is like phasing growth versus how much of that is flared capture? And I ask just to better understand the walk, but also where is that -- sort of as a set up to where that leaves us in '21? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Chris, clearly, the -- I mean, the latest number -- we have another month, it was basically flat, maybe a little bit -- our flaring on ours was a little bit less, but we're still in that 300 range. As we look going forward, we -- sorry, there's an echo here that's kind of messing with me. But as we look going forward, the volumes of the flared gas capture will drive -- especially as we move through the early parts of the year, we'll drive that flaring down significantly. But again, with the DUCs, with the rig count that's still running, as we kind of get towards the back half of '20 and going to '21, you still got just straight production growth at the rig counts we're currently seeing and the productivity of the wells being drilled. And then the other -- again, I mentioned earlier that another key volume dynamic for the growth is Bear creek II, that there's going to be some flared gas behind that system because it's geographically isolated. And we fully anticipate, as we get capacity down there, you're going to see some rig movements into that region to drill that area up. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay. That's very helpful. I guess, as a related point, Kevin, for those watching, I guess, inlet volumes at this creek plants, are we likely to see volumes sort of wheel to your newer facilities for processing before the aggregate footprint more broadly fills up? Are there efficiencies in having, I guess, an expanded plant portfolio where you're not -- where certain plants maybe are not isolated, but connected? Or, I guess, a longer-dated question, when you start to recover as staying on the plan for '21, are we likely to see that sort of disproportionately affecting certain plants and not others? I'm just asking because I know some people track individual facilities. Kevin Burdick : Yes. We look at our system in total. Again, with the exception of Bear Creek, that area, the rest of our system, we look at it in total. And absolutely, we'll see some gas move from, say, Garden Creek to Demicks Lake and from Lonesome Creek to Garden Creek as we optimize our system. We'll push the gas to the plant and the facility that we believe we can get -- do it for the least cost and take advantage of our assets. So you will see some of that go on, but it really doesn't impact ethane recovery. Again, it will be a similar argument or discussion. If we start recovering -- or need to recover a little ethane that will ultimately come down to what the -- how the tariff is worded from a Northern border standpoint if there is a change there and how we want to operate our facilities. Christopher Sighinolfi : Okay. Great. And if I could ask one final question, totally different. Can you just remind me some of the drivers of outperformance for the nat gas segment -- pipe segment in '19? I noted a modest EBITDA reduction that I think you're guiding for '20. It looks like you remain very well contracted on the capacity there. So I'm just, I guess, wondering if it's a rate or a cost issue? Or if it's something entirely different? Charles Kelley : Chris, this is Chuck. So our 2019 outperformance was really driven by the capturing -- or the -- excuse me, the interruptible volumes that we flow. There was great demand particularly in Texas and Oklahoma on our interruptible capacities. But within the Permian Basin, they're being less takeaway capacity alternatives. And certainly, we had a real strong Q3 with very, very good cooling and relative generational load for the heat generating cooling. So that was 2019, the uplift. As you compare it year-over-year, what we did in looking at 2020 guidance, we typically will normalize our spring and summer electric generation loads. So as you look at our midpoint in 2020, we do have some upside in there should there be a repeat of a good strong summer, so our interruptible volumes can help us to the upside. And I might add that, recently, Permian Highway has indicated that they will be delayed until Q1 of 2021. So that potentially presents another opportunity for our Texas intrastates to capture some more interruptible transport services. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Question on the 100,000 barrels a day West Texas LPG expansion. Is that -- are those new plants that are sort of fueling those commitments? Or are you taking market share from others? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. We're doing both. We're getting plants -- new plants that are being connected, and we are getting volume off of the existing plants that are going to other pipelines. Michael Blum : Okay. And then just turning to the '21 guidance, how much of the growth coming out of the Rocky Mountain region is contingent on Powder River Basin development versus just continued growth in the Bakken? Kevin Burdick : Michael, both segments. It would be a very modest level of increase. It's not a driver. The driver is the Bakken and the Permian. Terry Spencer : But Michael, don't let that be an indication of how we feel about the Powder, okay? We think the Powder has got a lot of unrealized potential. It could be -- it could -- and it just needs a little bit of price help, and we're certainly well positioned to be able to exploit that if, in fact, it -- the Powder does get a little bit of price help. Operator : We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Alexis Kania : I guess, just a follow-up question with respect to West Texas LPG. With the expansion, more or less set, how do you think about the timetable with respect to your options related to conversion or repurposing of the legacy pipe? Sheridan Swords : Alex, this is Sheridan. We -- with this latest expansion that we announced, we still have a little bit more expansion to do before we can free up one of the pipes to go into an alternative service. We did contemplate making a full expansion of the pipeline to open up the legacy pipe into a different service, but with -- we want to have better clarity and better line of sight into additional volume that we predict will be coming on later before we would go ahead and do the full loop -- complete the full loop of the West Texas pipeline, freeing up the legacy system for a different service. Operator : And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : I got on the call late, just a couple of clarifications. I know you might have touched it. On the leverage side, I think you mentioned that you expect to get to close to 4x leverage some time in 2020. Is that correct? And if so, any -- if you can talk anything about funding assumptions that go into that? Walter Hulse : Well, what we said in the prepared remarks was that the expectation that we've said before remains the same that we expect to be at 4x debt-to-EBITDA on a run rate basis either in the fourth quarter of 2020 or in early 2021. So that doesn't change. And then we expect to continue to delever further as we go beyond that period in 2021 as these projects come on, CapEx goes down and cash flows increase. So nothing's changed. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. And then one kind of broader question. I think in the past, you've talked about corporate M&A and the industry environment not being that conducive to that. I was wondering if you're seeing anything different in the industry environment right now? Terry Spencer : No. No difference. Still a tough environment from an M&A perspective. We're going to stay focused on this organic growth strategy. If we do take advantage of some M&A opportunity, it'll more be in the area of the strategic bolt-on asset type acquisition. So our thinking really hasn't changed. Operator : Our next question comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays. Harry Mateer : Sorry, first, just a follow-up on the last question. But you guys previously have talked about a 3.5x aspirational leverage target. And just want to confirm if that's still the case? And have you given any consideration to making that less of an aspirational target and more of an actual target potentially with some firmer time guidelines, just given how shaky the macro backdrop feels? Walter Hulse : Well, if you just do the projections out based on the guidance that we've given you, you'll see that we go towards and through that 3.5x pretty quickly. What we said is that we thought aspirationally, on a going-forward basis, that we would be around that 3.5x as we saw continued growth going forward. If we don't see additional growth from where we are today, we will be well below 3.5x. Harry Mateer : Got it. Okay. And then financing needs this year, if you could just talk about what your plans might be? Your next bond maturity is until 2022, but you do have a 2021 term loan that's prepayable. And you guys will outspend cash flow this year, again, after all the CapEx and dividend. So just curious how you're thinking about possible debt capital needs, especially given that 10 years almost at 1.3% right now? Walter Hulse : We'll obviously build some short-term debt as we finish up this construction program. And you're right. We do have the term loan out there coming due in 2021. So we'll keep our eye on the market. And when we think it's appropriate, we may access the debt market. Obviously, we have no equity financing whatsoever in our thoughts. Harry Mateer : Got it. Okay. And then last one for me, just putting different parts together in terms of your EBITDA growth for '21 and then the indication you gave about $1 billion of less CapEx in '21 versus '20. It seems like things are aligning for you to be at least free cash flow neutral after growth CapEx and the dividend. So -- and there are a number of other -- of your large-cap midstream companies that are trying to get there next year as well. So is that something like true free cash flow generation that you're thinking of targeting as a matter of policy? Or is it really, at this point, still just dependent on what other projects you might find? Walter Hulse : Well, we're not going to give forward guidance out there. Again, if you do the math on what we've had out there, it will be a reality that that's where we'll be going forward. And we'll see what the future brings. But we're in a position where, on a going-forward basis, the company is going to generate a very significant amount of cash, well above dividends. Operator : And our next question comes from Danilo Juvane with BMO Capital Markets. Danilo Juvane : A quick question for me. Did you guys outline what price assumptions you have for the gathering and processing business for NGLs and natural gas included? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Danilo, this is Kevin. Yes, we're -- like we mentioned, we're looking at the crude environment in that $50, $55 type environment. Again, we're not that -- the direct commodity exposure we have is very limited, but we're thinking about nat gas prices and NGL prices not out of the -- not significantly different than like we look at the strip over the next year or so. Danilo Juvane : I guess, so your guidance is premised on this basically strip budget for the entirety of the year? Kevin Burdick : Yes. When you look at our guidance, that's the way we're thinking about those prices. Operator : We'll take our final question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Congratulations on the new project announcements. Apologies, I was on the call a little late. So if you already addressed, we can skip it. But any comments on the export opportunities. And Walt, as you kind of have answered 2 or 3 questions about leverage, is there a downside limit where it just doesn't make sense to let that ratio fall any further, if you don't have sufficient growth CapEx and M&A available, a point where you have to think about new dividend or share buyback policy? Walter Hulse : Well, as it relates to the second part of your question, obviously, as our debt gets paid down to the levels that I was just discussing, it opens up a lot of alternatives for us, whether it be share buybacks or dividends or whatever. But I think the key is that it will be -- we'll have the flexibility to do what we think is appropriate at that time. And as for the docks... Craig Shere : Like, are you willing to go under 3x? Walter Hulse : I'm sorry. Craig Shere : Are you just willing to go under 3x? Walter Hulse : Craig, we'll cross that bridge when we get there and see what the market environment is. But we're not there today. And so we're not going to speculate as to what the market is going to be at that point going forward. Kevin Burdick : And Craig, this is Kevin. On the dock, similar as we have been communicating. It's still part of the business we would love to have. It's not something that we think we have to have, but we have a team working it very hard. Again, we're very confident that our barrels will continue to clear. We're not directly -- we don't have the price exposure to determine what the relative that -- or what that real value of the prices are on the Gulf Coast. But we'll keep working that opportunity. When we get the markets -- when I say the markets on the customers that we would be selling to, we have a lot of conversations around the globe with them, at the same time having conversations with people in the Gulf Coast about what are the dock and partnership opportunities there. So we'll keep working those. And when we get it all lined up, that's when we might make an announcement. Terry Spencer : Craig, I'll just [indiscernible]. Craig, let me just make one follow-up comment to Walt's comment, the company has historically always managed the balance sheet in a very prudent way with an emphasis toward being investment grade. I mean, that's -- if you want to look for some -- hard line somewhere, that will be a hard line for us. And so as we think longer term, the company is always going to do what makes sense and is prudent, okay? And we've shown a long history of doing that. So that's what you can hang your hat on. That there's my speech. Craig Shere : Okay. Just as my last follow-up. I was just wondering -- I don't know if Kevin wants to come back. But if LPG's, ethane or anything else was looking like the strongest horse in the race in terms of your ideal opportunities? Kevin Burdick : In regards to export facility, Craig? Craig Shere : Yes. Kevin Burdick : Okay. Yes. It would be -- LPGs is where the significant focus is right now. And we're not ignoring the ethane opportunities that may come our way. But I think LPGs are the ones driving the majority of the conversations at this point. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in early April and extends until we release earnings in late April. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Again, thank you all for joining us, and the IR team will be available throughout the day for your questions. Have a good rest of your day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect your phone lines.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Paula and good morning everyone, and welcome to ONEOK's First Quarter 2020 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. During the Q&A session, we would appreciate it, if you\u2019d limit yourself to one question. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President Natural Gas. On behalf of ONEOK, we hope you, your families and your colleagues are healthy as we all navigate and cope with the uncertainties surrounding the COVID-19 pandemic. As an essential critical infrastructure business, our employees continue daily work. We remain focused on operating safely and responsibly and on providing the essential services that our communities and customers rely on us for. We've asked all employees to work from home who are able and we've increased safety protocols for those critical employees continuing to work on site. We've offered additional support to employees through temporary benefit adjustments and human resources programs and are prioritizing open communication with employees, our Board of Directors and the financial community related to our COVID-19 response efforts. The current environment and worldwide impacts of this pandemic are clearly unprecedented. But as you know, COVID-19 is not the only challenge facing the energy industry right now. The commodity price collapse and resulting recent pullback in crude oil production across the country is greatly impacting our industry. As described in the earnings release, we did not provide what one would call a traditional guidance update, but we did provide a range of possible outcomes for 2020. Providing specific volume and commodity price guidance would not be appropriate for us due to the number of potential variations of outcomes that are possible for price forecasts, curtailment quantities and the duration and pace of economic recovery on a worldwide basis among other factors. That said, we have performed a scenario analysis and based on currently available information, we believe the range of possible 2020 adjusted EBITDA results will likely be between $2.6 billion and $3.0 billion. While this wide range indicates potential challenges, it also has opportunity and as we are well positioned to realize earnings growth in 2020 and 2021 as NGL markets remain resilient and storage capacity is at a premium despite the challenges our industry faces. Now, I'd like to comment on the recent dividend announcement, which we prudently held flat at $0.935 per share for the quarter. As we look to the future, we expect our business to generate sufficient cash flow to pay the dividend. Our decision to significantly reduce capital spending until growth opportunities return puts us in a good position to continue returning value to our shareholders. As we always do, each quarter we'll work with our Board to assess our forward views of future cash flows and the dividend as appropriate. We've been through cycles before and we have a long track record of delivering on expected results. And most importantly, the fundamentals of our business have not changed. Our strong balance sheet and liquidity provide important financial flexibility. Our extensive and integrated assets including available storage in key market centers are competitively well positioned. Our fee-for-service business model mitigates our direct commodity exposure, including the stability of our natural gas pipelines business, which has nearly 100% take-or-pay contract structures with primarily financially strong, electric and utility customers. Our customers are some of the most resilient and well capitalized in the industry with decades of proven reserves. And the demand for NGLs in the U.S. and abroad remains and there are signs that international demand is beginning to recover. All these factors provide the foundation for a resilient business that we believe is built to weather these kinds of uncertain market conditions and provide a platform to resume growth when it makes sense. The natural gas and NGL reserves in the basins served by our systems haven't moved. The reserves are still there and we believe our ability to serve them is stronger than ever. Many of our capital growth projects have recently come online or are nearing completion. These projects have driven volume growth across our businesses including reducing the amount of flaring in the Williston Basin as we expected up until the pandemic. And as we have done in previous commodity cycles, we're able to adjust the scale and timing of our growth projects to best fit the needs of our customers. We made proactive adjustments early on in this cycle to better align our capital investments with our customers' needs and we will continue to be flexible and responsive to those needs as our view of the market evolves. Kevin will provide more detail on these projects in a moment. As history shows, how you react in markets like this will have lasting impacts for quarters and years to come. Swift financial and operational decisions made at ONEOK in 2015 and 2016, while difficult at the time, set us up well for a transformational period of growth over the past few years. We're now in a great position with available integrated capacity across our system once market conditions improve. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. I'll start with some brief comments on our first quarter financial performance, our liquidity and then our capital allocation strategy as we move forward. ONEOK reported a net loss of $142 million in the first quarter of 2020, which includes a non-cash impairment charge of $642 million or $1.17 per share. Excluding these non-cash impairment charges, ONEOK's EPS was $0.83 per share for the first quarter. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $701 million, a 10% increase compared with the first quarter of 2019. Natural gas liquids and natural gas volume growth, higher average fee rates and higher contracted natural gas, transportation capacity, all contributed to year-over-year earnings growth. Distributable cash flow for the quarter -- for the first quarter 2020 was $522 million, up 7% compared with the fourth quarter of 2019. And we reported healthy dividend coverage of 1.35 times. We also generated $136 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Earlier this month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis. We recorded impairment charges in the first quarter of 2020 related primarily to long-lived assets and goodwill in the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Our asset impairments charges related to gathering and processing assets in Western Oklahoma, Kansas and the Powder River Basin. The timing of these charges was triggered by significant adverse changes in the market environment during the first quarter. From a liquidity standpoint, in early March, we completed a $1.75 billion senior notes offering and used a portion of the proceeds to repay amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program, providing us increased liquidity and balance sheet flexibility during this uncertain market environment. Our March 31 net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.86 times, and we ended the first quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and more than $530 million of cash. We are still targeting leverage of four times or less, but due to the current environment the time line for reaching target leverage from operating cash flows has been pushed out. As Terry mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement we provided a 2020 outlook. The 2020 net income is now likely to be in the range of $500 million to $900 million, which reflects the impairment charges. And adjusted EBITDA is likely to be in the range of $2.6 billion to $3 billion. As Terry said, the range of possible results from our multivariable scenario analyses led us to this 2020 outlook to give our investors a sense of what we view are likely outcomes in the current environment. As the industry recovers, we will update if appropriate. From a capital allocation perspective, in early March we suspended an additional expansion on the West Texas LPG pipeline, the Demicks Lake III plant and reduced the scope of the expansion on Elk Creek pipeline. Yesterday, we announced that we paused several projects and reduced our 2020 growth capital expenditures further. So far in 2020, we have reduced forecasted capital expenditures by $900 million compared with our original 2020 guidance provided in late February. Kevin will discuss these adjustments to growth capital in a moment. We now expect growth capital to range between $1.4 billion and $1.8 billion this year, which includes more than $900 million that we've already spent in the first quarter, as we completed Arbuckle II, Demicks Lake II, MB-4 and 45,000 barrels per day of the West Texas LPG expansion. Only approximately 40% of our 2020 capital expenditures is left to spend over the remaining three quarters. Looking ahead, we can continue to significantly scale back capital. If commodity prices remain depressed and producer activities remain low, we could potentially operate in a $300 million to $400 million annual capital expenditure range, which would include limited routine growth spent in alignment with our producers' needs and maintenance capital. Our flexibility to scale back capital and to adjust to our customers' needs is a significant financial tool we can use in this environment to help preserve balance sheet strength and liquidity. On the other side of the equation, we stand ready to resume these projects as producer activity returns. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our completed growth projects and operations. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. We saw volume growth across our system in the first quarter of 2020, compared with the first quarter 2019. NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 6% and natural gas processed volumes increased 5% year-over-year. The natural gas pipeline segment continues to deliver strong fee-based earnings as our total capacity reached 100% contracted in the first quarter. This segment, which represents more than 15% of ONEOK's EBITDA, provides solid fee-based earnings and stability, even through volatile commodity price environments. As Terry and Walt discussed, the volatile commodity price and demand environment makes predicting our future volumes or segment-level performance very challenging, but we can provide certain data points based on the information we have at this time to help frame up the current volume and activity levels that we're seeing across our operations. Let's start with an update on our growth projects. During the first quarter, we completed and placed into service the Arbuckle II Pipeline and the remaining capacity of our MB-4 fractionator in Mont Belvieu which is 100% contracted. We also completed 45,000 barrels per day of our fully contracted 80,000 barrel per day West Texas LPG Pipeline system expansion. The remaining capacity of the expansion, which was delayed due to weather during the first quarter, is expected to be completed in May. We completed our Demicks Lake II processing plant in January, bringing our total processing capacity in the basin to more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day. The projects that were completed in the fourth quarter 2019 were ramping, as expected, until the commodity collapse in March. Demicks Lake I, which was completed in October of last year, reached near full capacity of 200 million cubic feet per day in the first quarter. Total NGL raw feed throughput volume from the Rocky Mountain region, which includes volume on both the Elk Creek and Bakken NGL Pipelines, reached 240,000 barrels per day in March prior to the collapse. Compared with the fourth quarter of 2019, we saw a more than 7% increase in Rocky Mountain region raw feed throughput volumes, as new processing plants and plant expansions were connected to our NGL system. The volumes we reached in the first quarter combined with the quality of the basin and our customer base give us confidence that growth will resume once demand recovers. These assets put us in a great position to capture natural gas and NGL volumes for our customers when that occurs. We announced yesterday that we are pausing the majority of construction activities on several of our remaining capital growth projects including the expansion of our Bear Creek processing plant in the Williston Basin, construction of the MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, additional Mid-Continent fractionation expansions and the third expansion of the West Texas LPG Pipeline system. The decision to pause these projects reflects the changing needs of our customers and our ability to be flexible through this uncertain commodity price environment. The projects we paused can all be restarted quickly when our customers' activity resumes. Now let's take a closer look at our current -- at the current activity across our operations. As we sit today, the production plans of our customers continue to evolve as market dynamics shift. Many of our customers have announced a reduction in rig activity and in some cases are curtailing existing production. In the Williston Basin, there are currently approximately 30 rigs operating with around half of those on our dedicated acreage. Many of the wells that have been curtailed on our acreage to date have been older vintage wells that produce lower volumes at a higher cost to producers. Other wells taken off-line by producers were previously flaring, so they have not reduced our volume. We have also seen wells curtail that have opened up capacity for wells previously flaring to flow onto our system. These three factors have resulted in less volume coming off our system than you would expect. And given the significant backlog of flared gas, total production won't have to recover fully for our processing capacity to be highly utilized. Based on the latest reported natural gas flaring data out of North Dakota, approximately 400 million cubic feet per day was flaring in the basin with more than 200 million of that on ONEOK's dedicated acreage. As Terry mentioned, our customers in the Williston Basin are some of the most stable and well capitalized in the industry. We've had one customer this year file for bankruptcy protection. However, they continue to flow volume. We do not foresee additional significant bankruptcy risk among our largest customers in the region. And smaller scale private producers make up approximately 15% in aggregate of our total production from the region. In the Permian Basin, approximately 70% of our NGL volume is from the Midland Basin, one of the most resilient basins in the U.S. As our West Texas LPG Pipeline expansion is fully completed in May, we will continue to transition volumes away from offloads, we currently have with third-party NGL pipelines onto our pipeline. We are currently offloading approximately 50,000 barrels per day and we expect to move 20,000 barrels per day over to our system in the third quarter of this year with the remainder in the first quarter of 2021. As these volumes move onto our system, we'll be able to collect full transportation and fractionation fee rates on that volume. Additionally, our system-wide propane plus fractionation capacity remains highly utilized at approximately 85% to 90% and over half of our 27 million barrels of underground NGL storage is available to capture opportunities in the market. We're adding 1.5 million barrels of storage in the third quarter of this year and expect to complete an additional 1.5 million barrels of storage in 2021. We have also added 3.5 million barrels of brine storage in Mont Belvieu, substantially increasing our capacity. In the NGL markets, we are seeing seasonally strong demand for propane in Conway at our rail racks and on our north system from wholesalers, as well as in Mont Belvieu from exporters. This demand is contributing to the strong relative price of propane to crude. Petrochemical facilities in both Conway and Mont Belvieu continue to have strong demand for ethane driving the price to near recovery economics in the Mid-Continent. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. Our recent project completions and the volumes we've seen materialize prior to this downturn provide confidence in the growth behind our system that is available to capture once demand recovers. ONEOK's strong record of delivering on our expected results combined with our competitive, integrated asset position and high-quality customer base and the best resources plays are fundamentals of our business that provide us with a foundation for stability, even through difficult commodity cycles. We have been through downturns before, and we know how to position ourselves for success as conditions improve. To our employees, both those continuing to work remotely and those who are still reporting to a facility or field location, thank you for your continued work, flexibility and dedication to our company. We're focused on maintaining essential services for our customers and your commitment to continuing to operate responsibly are exceptional. During a very difficult time, you have risen to the challenge by remaining committed to the health and well-being of our company, families and communities. While the near-term view of the world is changing every day, the long-term fundamentals of our strategic business remains strong and well positioned for continued growth, when global energy demand recovers. With that, operator we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will come from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi. Good morning, guys. Thank you very much for a lot of the color today. I just wanted to start-off with the \u2013 I guess, we'll call it an outlook or guidance. I do appreciate a lot of the color that you gave in terms of some of the inputs when you're talking about why your system will be impacted less and the offload opportunities. I was wondering, if you could share with us your views as to how you get to the upper end and conversely to the lower end of that outlook? What conditions in the Williston or elsewhere needs to play out to basically end up at your higher end or end up at your lower end? Kevin Burdick : Sure. This is Kevin. Yeah. I mean, there's a variety of things that's \u2013 as we kind of laid out the permutations you look at, when you consider the variability of all the inputs we're looking at that's the reason for the outlook. So obviously, if you get to the upper end demand \u2013 for example demand comes back more quickly. Prices recover more quickly. Producers respond more quickly. So at the end of the day, you're getting the volume on your system quicker. On the low end of the range, it's just prolonged. And by prolonged, it could be anything from just how producers respond to how the demand recovers. Shneur Gershuni : Do you have anything specific with respect to like when shot is come back and so forth is there any sort of cadence that we should be thinking about? Kevin Burdick : No. I mean, we're not going to \u2013 again, we're not going to provide specifics on that, because there's a variety of ways you could get to each \u2013 to the high end and there's a variety of ways you could get to the low end as well. So we're not going to get into how long, because that would just be kind of factoring in one variable. Operator : And moving on we'll go to Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Thank you. Good morning. Maybe we could start with the NGL segment, the Bakken rate. It looks like it came down. I'm guessing that's partly due to Elk Creek coming online, which I think has a lower rate. But should we think that you moved some more volumes from Bakken NGL Pipeline and Overland Pass onto this line, or was there anything else we should factor in? And is this $0.28 level a good run rate going forward or should we expect that it could trend a little lower through the remainder of the year? Sheridan Swords : Christine, this is Sheridan. I think, there's two factors in there. One is, while we were railing volume out of Bakken, we were charging customers a higher fee for that service, especially the ones that were came on for Elk Creek. And as Elk Creek has come on, they've come back to a rate that we contracted with them, which was lower than the $0.30 rate. So I think that as we go forward the $0.28 rate, we see today is a good going forward run rate. Our rates are not determined by which pipeline we use if we put barrels on Bakken or Elk Creek or what we put on OPPL, because the rates you are seeing are -- we charge our customer from a bundled service from a transportation and fractionation. So it's not impacted by which pipelines we use. Christine Cho : Okay. So even though the rate came down the margin is higher that's how we should think about it? Sheridan Swords : Well, as the rate came down obviously we aren't railing as much volume. So our costs have come down as well, but I think going forward $0.28 is what you will see going forward. Obviously, that does have some impact on how much is coming out of the Powder River Basin on that line, which is at a lower fee and how much is coming out of the Bakken. Christine Cho : Okay. Great. Thank you. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Terry Spencer : Good morning. Jeremy Tonet : I was just hoping that you could share a little bit more as far as Northern Border kind of key content there and any thoughts you guys could provide with regards to the need or lack of need to extract ethane going forward this year just given kind of the mix shift between Bakken gas going on the price and Canadian gas going on the price. Just trying to get a better sense of what's going on -- what could be going on there? Thanks. Chuck Kelley : Hey, Jeremy, this is Chuck. So as you know TransCanada is the operator of Northern Border. So I'm going to answer your question based on our 50% of ownership of Northern Border Pipeline as a partner. So we've been watching over the past quarter in particular as volumes have kind of changed a little bit between Bakken and receipts coming in from Canada as volumes have changed a little bit in the Bakken into the pipeline. So obviously, the pipeline is concerned about anything above 1,100. And this is a fluid situation. As that ratio changes and the mix between Canada and the Bakken you'll see that BTU blend mix in Northern Border and then consequently downstream. So, where the pipeline is today, we understand they're going to go ahead and file their tariff and set an upper limit. I believe it's 1,100 to start June 1. And Northern Border has held numerous formal meetings with shippers, markets, downstream pipes all interested parties regarding that limit. And frankly, the limit -- the BTU spec just needs to be put in place to meet the downstream deliverability requirements in Chicago. Jeremy Tonet : Yes. Makes sense. Thanks for that. And then maybe going to the GP segment just with the average fee kind of moving lower there quarter-over-quarter and it seemed like there was a POP influence there that kind of drove that. I was wondering if you could provide a little bit more color on kind of what were some of the drivers and how you might expect that to change in this environment? Chuck Kelley : Sure. So as we've discussed in our 10-K and our 10-Qs under a certain percentage of proceed contracts with fees our contractual rates or percentages may increase or decrease. And these are based on several thresholds in the contracts production volume commodity prices system pressures that we're obligated to provide or the producer's obligated to meet. So our average rate can be impacted by those factors and also impacted if volumes increase or decrease on contracts that have different POP percentages or fee rate. So for example we have several large producers who may have contracts that are more fee-based than POP and if they're currently curtailing, you'd see the impact of that on our fee rate. Consequently, it would come down. Again, we can't speculate what kind of contract mix we're going to see over time as producers are making decisions frankly weekly as to what wells are going to be produced and certainly at what production level volumes. So we can't necessarily forecast that average rate, but that gives you the understanding of what's behind how that average fee rate is developed and thought about. Operator : And moving on we'll go to Tristan Richardson with SunTrust. Tristan Richardson : Good morning guys. Appreciate all the commentary on operations as well as the liquidity and capital and how the balance sheet is preparing for this. Can you talk about the investment-grade profile? It seems like the rating agencies are willing to take a long-term view, I mean looking out past the short-term disruptions of 2020. But to the extent leverage remains elevated can you talk about just the priority of the investment-grade profile? Chuck Kelley : Well we speak regularly to the rating agencies. And while we've had a market imbalance and it's delayed the pace of our leverage reduction, it hasn't reduced our expectation or desire to reduce leverage. We believe our assets are in a position to support the growth in the basin we serve once the imbalance is rectified and that the rating agencies recognize that. Our credit ratings are very important to us and we've demonstrated by our actions in the past that if the current demand reduction -- end up being longer in duration, we have several tools at our disposal to reduce leverage. And we've already taken the first action in this regard by pausing our capital projects to preserve cash flow. We continuously evaluate our options to manage the balance sheet and look prudently to maintain our credit ratings going forward. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much. Operator : Moving on we'll go to Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : First question just on growth and the durability of earnings here and forgive me for asking about 2021 just given the tough visibility right now. But as we talk to investors that's still where a lot of the focus is at this point, so just wondering if you could talk to some of the high-level drivers of growth or even what a flat scenario would look like in 2021 versus 2020 and if you could maybe tie that to your ability to cut CapEx to those baseline levels you mentioned. So in other words is it really a heavy lift to maintain EBITDA levels next year? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. When we think -- I mean we start talking 2021 granted that is -- that's out there given the uncertainty today. But the key I'd come back to is, where our assets are located we've got tremendous confidence in the basins where we operate. Those resources are still there. As we look forward when you consider the flare gas that's still available to capture as production comes back up online in the Bakken, that's going to drive additional volumes for our natural gas processing plants and the NGL segment. And I think you hit on the other key point is, with this available capacity, we can do that with extremely minimal capital as we think about 2021 as these volumes come back and the environment improves. Terry Spencer : And Kevin I think -- the only thing I'd add to that is we've been in this situation before where we had built up some headroom in our businesses and we're able to harvest cash flow. And so with the prospect of 2021, CapEx spending being very low we'll be right back to that particular situation. So when you start looking at that the free cash flow generation of the business is pretty significant. Spiro Dounis : Okay. Understood. And then\u2026 Walt Hulse : I guess the only other comment that, I would make as you think about these ranges that we've put out there and the durability of the business we -- in this range of potential outcomes there are built into some of these numbers pretty significant curtailments, okay? And so you have to think about the lower end of the range and I'm not going to give you specifics because then I'd be giving you financial guidance, okay? But as we look at the potential outcomes, there's a pretty significant percentage of production that we've assumed to be curtailed in one of these scenarios and that's reflected in these numbers. So I think that just in and of itself explains the durability of the business. And unfortunately we can't give you specific \u2013 specifics. We'd like to but we can't. Probably as I said in the call, it wouldn't be appropriate for us to do that. But we feel really good about how well positioned in spite of all the things that \u2013 the headwinds that the industry faces we're in a pretty darn good position. Spiro Dounis : Yes. And I can appreciate a tough question to answer now. So I appreciate you all taking a swing at it. Second one just to follow up on the CapEx. Can you just talk a little bit about why the Arbuckle extension expansion are still in the backlog? Is that something that can still come out at some point, or is that really needed as part of the broader network right now? Kevin Burdick : I'm sorry. You were \u2013 this is Kevin. Could you repeat that question? You were a little jumbled as it came through. Spiro Dounis : Yes. Sorry. I'm sick of using this cell phone. So just wondering if you guys could walk through the decision to lead the Arbuckle extension and expansion in the backlog. Is that something that can still come out at a future point, or is that really needed at this point for the broader network? Kevin Burdick : Okay. Yes. The extension remained in as we think about that. That pipeline was important because it allows us to move Bakken barrels all the way to Mont Belvieu. So we wanted that connectivity. And also keep in mind these projects kind of proceed at different paces and many of them are further along or not further along. So that goes into our consideration as well and why that one is still in the schedule. Spiro Dounis : Got it. Thanks, everyone. Operator : And moving on we'll go to Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Kevin Burdick : Good morning. Michael Blum : I just want to talk a little bit about the dynamics in the Bakken, particularly as it relates to the flared gas. So \u2013 and I guess my question is like as you get shut-ins and reduced drilling activity, will you see a reduction in flared gas as well just naturally? And will that generally going to quantify or any rule of thumb to think about how that would impact the number of well connects you would need to do based on that change in flared gas? Kevin Burdick : Michael, it's Kevin. I'll start and Chuck or others may have some comments. But yes, like we said in our prepared remarks, there's multiple dynamics that could go on impacting flared gas. We have seen some wells shut in that had previously been flaring. So that doesn't impact our volumes obviously. We've also seen some situations where some gas was taken off-line. But other gas that was flaring due to some pipeline or compression constraints started flowing on the system. So effectively it was replaced which would bring flaring down. So yes, I do think these \u2013 the curtailments will bring flaring down in a couple of different ways. But the key point there is I think with our capacity \u2013 and we had continued to build out some gathering lines as we move through the first quarter. As those volumes come back, we believe we're going to have the capacity to capture the gas much more fully than we did say in the January or February time frame. Michael Blum : Okay. Great. Thank you very much, guys. Operator : And next we'll go to Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : If ethane price were to rise to the $0.30 or $0.40 range next year, would that be enough incentive for you to recover the gas in the Bakken, even if it didn't cover your full midstream tariffs? And do you have the contractual capability to do that? Kevin Burdick : Did you say $0.30 to $0.40 ethane values? Jean Ann Salisbury : Yes. Yes for ethane. Yes. Terry Spencer : We always have the ability to flex our rates if we need to to be able to bring ethane on, on an economic basis. So that is always out there that we have the ability not only in the Bakken or Williston, we also have that ability in the Mid-Continent. So if we see the opportunity to be able to flex our rates a little bit to bring volume on we will do that. We also have to be cognizant of is if the market is bounced at certain prices, if we bring more volume on from another basin, it could push out volume from a basin that is flowing today. So we take all those things into consideration. But to answer your question, we do have that ability to flex our rates -- our NGL rates out of the Williston Basin. Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. We could add to that to your comments about ethane is what you're seeing in the Mid-Continent with the strength in ethane prices today and natural gas prices being as weak, what could affect us in 2020 fairly significantly if this continues is we could see producers and processors begin to extract ethane in the Mid-Continent and other places as well, right? Terry Spencer : That's very true, because the numbers right now are very, very close to recovery economics in the Mid-Continent. And if you take everything into consideration increased propane recoveries when you're in, ethane recovery you could make an argument that in May, we could see some more ethane come out of the Mid-Con that we hadn't predicted. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. Thank you. Terry Spencer : Yeah. Thanks. Operator : Next we'll go to Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Colton Bean : So, just really a quick one. I think last quarter, Chuck, you may have mentioned that you guys looking at a proceeding agreement for residue gas takeaway out of the Bakken. Can you just update us on where you stand with that, and if that project has been impacted at all by the production outlook? Chuck Kelley : Sure, Colton. Yeah. I mean with everything evolving, our producer forecast evolving and what have you in the basin like anything we've kind of taken a step back and we're trying to determine when we see the full need for that project. The way it sits today, I was looking -- we were looking at potentially fourth quarter of 2022. I'm not quite sure honestly, if that's been moved out yet or not. We're still evaluating that. Colton Bean : Got it. Appreciate that. Operator : And next we'll go to Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hi, guys. Thank you for taking my questions and glad to hear everybody and their friends are all well. Can you just talk -- Shneur mentioned this in the first question, just the cadence within your guidance for 2020. And the only reason I ask that is first quarter you did around $700 million of EBITDA. The midpoint of your guidance would imply you keep doing around $700 million of EBITDA each quarter. But the first quarter impact was before all the shut-ins and before all the production cuts. Just kind of what's offsetting that? Like what keeps you kind of at that $700 million quarterly run rate? Can you just high level kind of the puts and the takes a little bit? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. Michael the way I guess I would think about that is, you got to remember in the first quarter we always have a winter impact and we were bringing -- we are bringing a lot of these assets online. And so we moved -- as we think about January and February, it wasn't really till we came out in early March that we saw some of the volumes pick up like we expected. Clearly, if you see curtailments as we move through April, May and June, obviously, you're going to see a step down as you move through the second quarter, but then recovery back as we move our way through the back half of the year. So yes, you would expect to see a step down in the second quarter with that recovery in the back half. Michael Lapides : And is that recovery predicated on Bakken producers, re-ramping up production starting in the fourth quarter? And at the current strip price, does that give them the economic incentive to do so, so quickly? Kevin Burdick : Clearly Bakken volumes would be a component of that. But again with our West Texas expansion, with the other assets we brought online, with what we're seeing in the NGL markets and for marketing inventory storage type opportunities, there's a lot of things that I think could -- as we move through the second quarter that could play out for the back half of the year. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one last one. Just curious, if you're thinking about the potential for any repurposing of any of your existing assets? I mean lots of moving parts across oil gas NGLs. Just curious if there are opportunities whether in storage, whether in existing older pipe to repurpose things given what's just going on in the marketplace. Sheridan Swords : Michael, we can -- this is Sheridan. We continue to always look at that. And as we expressed earlier, we thought there was always an opportunity to maybe repurpose West Texas Pipeline for crude oil that was -- if that opportunity would manifest itself. So we continue to look at those opportunities as we continue to go forward. Obviously, storage right now is a big commodity that everybody is looking at with the shape of the prices right now that we continue to evaluate. Right now we do think our storage is better used as NGL to play that part of the structure of the market than it is in other product, but we do continue to evaluate the ability to repurpose assets into other service. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciate it. Operator : We'll go to Chris Sighinolfi with Jefferies. Chris Sighinolfi : Hey. Good morning, everybody. Thanks for taking.. Terry Spencer : Hey, Chris. Chris Sighinolfi : I have two questions, Terry if I could. The first you followed I think from Tristan's your line of inquiry just about credit rating. I don't know if that one's for you or Walt maybe it involves more of a Board readthrough. But can you just walk us through how you guys think about leverage and the rating? You've talked about capital declines that are possible. Certainly, I think, I was reading into that like how low could the spending be next year. But I guess what I'm getting after is at what point does the dividend come into conversation? Walt, you had mentioned sort of multiple levers and you talked about CapEx first. And I'm just curious how everybody thinks about those components put together. Walt Hulse : Well because -- I think it's fair to say that we continually evaluate all options available. But I think it's really important to understand that with the CapEx that we've reduced that we will be cash flow positive definitely in the third and fourth quarter and into 2021. So deleveraging will happen. It's just a question of the pace if there are things that we might do to accelerate that pace. If that makes sense we'll go down that path. But I think Terry addressed our view on the dividend while we look at it on a quarterly basis we will be earning cash flow to pay it going forward. That's our expectation. Chris Sighinolfi : Okay. I'm sorry, if I missed that in the prepared statement. And then I want to follow up -- I appreciate the NGL conversation. We've been thinking about it. Similarly to Sheridan some of the things that you and Kevin have talked about. I'm curious and there's a lot of focus on crude storage. We obviously get purity product NGL storage reported. There's Y-grade capacity, obviously, that's significant behind that and fungible. And I'm just wondering if there's anything that you're seeing that would lead to concerns around an NGL storage situation. And as it pertains to that any update you guys can give as we start to get Mid-Con or Rocky shut-ins what Belvieu Conway might do? Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Chris, this is Sheridan. I would say in terms of NGL storage capacity we feel we are in a great position on our NGL storage capacity. One is we're at a seasonal time when storage capacity is low where you'd see more building in a normal year. Obviously, this is an abnormal year. But also at this time right now we are seeing great demand for the NGL products. Propane is really being demanded from exporters. Even at times in Mont Belvieu we can't supply with our current production all the needs from people buying product down there that we typically sell to. So propane -- that's why we're seeing propane trade so well versus crude. And we also are seeing that phenomenon on the ethane market that the petchems are still having a very good demand that we've actually had to turn some people away for that we typically supply ethane to because we don't see that we'll have that product in the next month. Now if more ethane comes on through recovery we will be able to satisfy those needs, but we are seeing very good demand for our two biggest products which leads to that we think we have plenty of storage capacity not only for regular operations, but also to be able to capture some of the opportunities that the market are giving us in the contango market that we're seeing. Walt Hulse : So Chris, I'm just going to add -- reiterate one thing that Sheridan said earlier in his answer was with respect to propane storage inventory is at a seasonal level. The capacity is -- actually we've got plenty of capacity. So this is the time of year when propane retailers start putting product in hold. And -- so I just want to make sure that was clear. Operator : And next we'll go to Dan Lungo with Bank of America. Dan Lungo : Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. Sorry to push on the dividend a little bit. But when it comes to maintaining the investment-grade ratings, based on your current projections if you're at the lower end of your EBITDA range, you're going to be above that all important five times marker which is a trigger for downward high yield if it's sustained for a longer period of time. So without a serious recovery in EBITDA or -- in 2021, it just seems like you only need to be pulling additional levers to maintain that investment-grade rating if things end up being worse than expected. So I'm just wondering how do you weigh in maintaining a dividend versus staying in the investment-grade rating? Kevin Burdick : Dan, I would tell you that we speak to the rating agencies regularly. I don't know that I necessarily agree entirely with your expectations of where leverage will be on a long-term basis here. And we've spoken about the dividend three times now. So we're not going to get back into it. Dan Lungo : All right. Thank you. Operator : And next we'll go to Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : Good morning guys. I'm still confused about this page five the footnote. Is it -- is the change in the drop from $0.92 to $0.85 tied to NGL prices crude prices? With the decline in NGL prices from Q1 to Q2 and the increased shut-ins are we going to see that rate drop further? Is it a good run rate to use? Kevin Burdick : Becca this is Kevin. Chuck spoke to that earlier to the earlier question about what drives that fee rate change and that disclaimer. So yes, there are thresholds that he mentioned that are dependent on a variety of things. And we're not going to provide an update at this point of what we think that range would be. But we can tell you that as we've factored in all those scenarios that various outcomes have gone into the $2.6 billion to $3 billion EBITDA range that we provided. Becca Followill : Thank you. Operator : Moving on we'll go to Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets. Elvira Scotto : Hi, everyone. Thanks for taking my questions. So it looks like you've done a lot of really good work here on the scenario analysis. And with respect to this kind of $2.6 billion lower end of EBITDA kind of outcome, I think it seems like you have pretty good confidence that that's the low end. What would have to happen in order for that EBITDA to be below that end? Kevin Burdick : We're not -- Elvira, we're not going to go there as far as providing that information. Like we said, we ran a variety of scenarios that considered a variety of different price, volume, producer activity outcomes. And we believe that the EBITDA is likely to fall within that $2.6 billion to $3.0 billion range. And that's what we're providing at this point. Walt Hulse : Elvira, as I indicated earlier, the numbers consider substantial curtailments and a significant duration of this downturn. So I think that's about as much as we can give you. Elvira Scotto : No. That's really helpful. And then just my last follow-up question here is in some of these conversations that you've had with some of maybe your Bakken producer customers, at what point would you expect activity to pick up? And when I say that I mean, at what commodity price? And maybe you can kind of -- you can think back to that 2015, 2016 time period? Kevin Burdick : Well this is Kevin. And I think there's a couple of dynamics there. One is, if they're curtailing gas, what price does it take to have them bring curtail gas back. And without giving a specific number, obviously they're looking at what their variable cost to produce is. That will vary by producer and it'll vary by location. So that's what will go into that. So clearly, that's a lower price. As we think about the next tranche would be completions. There's still 400-plus DUCs in the basin. So that we -- that's going to have a price -- that activity would come back. So, as we move -- as prices improve, those are the things that we'll watch as the curtail gas will come back first and then you'll start seeing completion crews added and producers work off their DUCs. Terry Spencer : Elvira, I think -- thanks. Terry. I think it's fair to say that if we see a -- this continued downturn, the faster producers curtail and correct the supply and demand imbalance the faster there'll be a recovery. That's how we look at it. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. First, let me just congratulate you on holding off on the less-economic initial forays in the long desired crude gathering and export terminal opportunities. Sometimes what we don't do is more important than what we do. With respect to in-flight growth projects that are now on hold, do you see a pecking order among them in terms of what might come online first or resumed first? Kevin Burdick : No I don't know that we would look at it that way. I think it'll be -- as we talk to our customers in each of our basins, we'll -- that's what we'll look at. So, if we continue to see -- we've seen some really strong growth out of the Permian up until the collapse and if we see that continue, then obviously the West Texas expansion would be back on the table. And similarly in the Bakken, if we saw certain areas. And remember with Bear Creek, it is a very -- it's a geographically isolated area. So, it would be specific producers, showing a desire to get activity back in a certain area of the Bakken. So that's the type of thing that would cause Bear Creek to come back online. But it'll be producer-by-producer, processor-by-processor type discussions that will drive those projects. Terry Spencer : Craig I think the other thing that you could see and I've been through this -- through these cycles so many times I can't count. But I think the thing we've seen in the G&P space over the years is that when you get into these down cycles, people start talking that is midstream companies start talking about asset consolidation and shutting underutilized facilities down and underutilized gathering systems and doing offloads. And you could see those kinds of things that it's going to matter which side of the coin you're on could brought by either revenue benefit or cost savings benefit. So, we could see some of those discussions happening as we go forward. Craig Shere : Terry, I'm sorry. So you could see yourself as a potential consolidator on some distressed assets? Terry Spencer : Sure. Well we could potentially -- there might be facilities that we believe make more sense that we could idle for a period of time and deliver volumes to somebody who has available capacity. Walt Hulse : So just to say I hear a thing that in an operational way, there's an opportunity to consolidate and find good economic outcomes between multiple different companies. Terry Spencer : Exactly. You do that through offload processing deals or onload -- if you're the receiver you do that through an onload processing deal. It doesn't involve ownership. Thanks Walt. Craig Shere : I got you. And I don't know if Walt wants to chime in again and sorry for beating a dead horse. We've had some questions about dire worst-case leverage conditions and potential additional levers. I want to focus more on patience. So, if credit isn't deteriorating to untenable levels, but lower for longer lasts much longer than perhaps envisioned today, is there a limit to how many years you're willing to wait for organic improvement in your targeted net debt-to-EBITDA ratio? Walt Hulse : Yes, Craig. That's a quite hypothetical question. I would tell you that -- I would point you to talk to the rating agencies about their view on timing. I think for investment-grade companies, it tends to be a little bit longer view than quarter-to-quarter. And so, as we see this playing out, we see ourselves naturally delevering and we're going to look at other opportunities that might help that along. But I would say if you get out years into this sure everything is on the table. But you're -- that's pretty hypothetical. Operator : And this concludes the conference call and I'll pass it back to Mr. Ziola. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you everyone. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in early July and extends until we release earnings in late July. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Again thank you all for joining us and the IR team will be available throughout the day and the week in case you have more follow-up questions. Thank you, very much and have a good day. Operator : And once again, that does conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time I'm about to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning, everyone, and welcome to ONEOK second quarter 2020 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. During the Q&A session, we would appreciate it if you limit yourself to one question and one clarifying follow-up so we could fit in as many of you as we can. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President Natural Gas Liquids and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President Natural Gas. I'd like to start by commending our employees who are continuing to operate safely and responsibly and remain focused on providing extra customer service in a challenging environment. In recent weeks, we've seen cases of COVID-19 increase across the country. In response, we've asked employees who are able to continue working virtually. For those critical employees who are reporting in person to operating sites, we continue to ensure that enhanced safety protocols are in place for their safety and for the safety of their families and communities. Second quarter results were interrupted by the pandemics effect on worldwide crude oil demand, extensive production curtailments across our operations and low commodity prices. After bottoming out in May and June, volume trends across our operating areas have sharply increased in recent weeks as customers have started to bring production back online with the recent stability in commodity prices providing positive momentum as we enter the second half of 2020. As a matter of fact, many of our facilities during July have returned to pre-COVID levels. For example, our July average total NGL raw feed volumes are exceeding first quarter average NGL volumes, benefiting from higher propane plus volumes in the Permian Basin and increased ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent. Williston Basin volumes have also strengthened significantly off the lows experienced in May. The earnings impact we saw in the second quarter reflects significant production curtailments in the Williston Basin where our earnings on a per unit of throughput are some of the highest due to the broad level of services we provide our customers. As curtail volumes recover to more normalized level, so too will our earnings. While volume trends are greatly improving, there remains continued global demand uncertainty due to COVID-19. We expect 2020 earnings to be at the low end of our previously provided outlook ranges, which Walt will discuss shortly. Despite these challenges, we continue to deliver value to our investors through the prudent management of our large strategic and integrated assets located in the most prolific NGL rich basins in the U.S. These assets are supported by strong, stable customer base and growing demand for the products we deliver. There have been many reports written on the possible implications of a DAPL shut down for ONEOK so I'll get right to it. Many producers in the region are developing contingency plans to address their oil transportation needs. While DAPL does currently provide meaningful crude takeaway capacity from the region, there are alternatives through other pipelines and substantial rail capacity. It wasn't long ago that nearly 800,000 barrels per day of crude were leaving the basin on rail. Specific to ONEOK we estimate 30% to 40% of DAPL crude oil volume is from the producers whose gas volumes are dedicated to our gathering and processing business in the Williston Basin. About half of those volumes have alternate methods of crude transportation currently available. This means that approximately 200 million cubic feet per day of nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day currently connected to our system is associated with crude oil production that may not have an immediate alternatives takeaway options. From the constant conversations we have with our producer customers in the basin, they remain committed to finding solutions to take away constraints. In our view, any impact from a DAPL shutdown would mostly impact 2021 providing some time for more solutions to develop. Even in an extended shutdown scenario, we estimate our 2021 Wilson basin natural gas processing volumes could approach our first quarter 2020 average of more than 1.1 billion cubic feet per day due to curtailed volumes returning, the capture of flared gas and the completion of drilled but uncompleted wells. Kevin will provide some additional data points during his remarks. At the beginning of 2020, we had all the assets in place to produce annual EBITDA of more than $3 billion. Our extensive infrastructure that now has substantial available capacity is still there, providing significant operating leverage to the upside, and no additional capital spending is needed to realize that earnings potential. As it relates to our dividends, with our business improving and volume strengthening, we don't see the need to take action on the dividends. We do recognize that it is a lever we could if our deleveraging expectations are not being met. Financially, we've taken the proactive steps to provide ample liquidity and protect our investment-grade credit ratings during the pandemic while continuing to return long term value to our shareholders. Our employees and management team are doing an excellent job in unusual conditions and I have tremendous confidence in them to see us through to the other side of this downturn. They found ways to successfully navigate industry challenges before and they will again. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. Instead of a typical run-through of our quarterly financial performance, which was well detailed in yesterday's news release, I'll walk through a few of the strategic financial decisions we made during the second quarter and how those have positioned us for the remainder of the year. We completed two proactive capital market transactions, raising capital of more $2.4 billion during the second quarter, providing us additional liquidity and balance sheet flexibility in a still uncertain market environment. In May, we completed a $1.5 billion senior notes offering and used the proceeds -- a portion of the proceeds to repay the remaining $1.25 billion of our term loan agreement which was maturing in 2021. In June, we completed a public offering of common stock resulting in net proceeds of $937 million. Both of these transactions were undertaken to strengthen our balance sheet and provide a clear and accelerated path towards equity leveraging goals. We still intend to manager our leverage below 4x as business strengthens to pre-COVID levels and to maintain 3.5x as our long-term aspirational goal. Both transactions were successful in that respect. As we sit today, we have ample liquidity and balance sheet strength and flexibility at the end of the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding and our $2.5 billion credit facility and more than $945 million of cash. Interest expense increased in the second quarter primarily due to the settlement of interest rate hedges related to the earliest repayment of our term loan, resulting in a one-time impact earnings per share of $0.09 in the second quarter. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we certainly expect 2020 net income and adjusted EBITDA results to be at the lower end of our previously provided outlook ranges. As we return to volumes achieved during the early March 2020, we expect our earnings run rate to be in line with our previous expectations and to provide a continued path to deleveraging. We also expect total capital expenditures including maintenance capital to range from approximately $300 million to $400 million in the second half of 2020. Total annual capital expenditures including maintenance and growth of $300 million to $400 million will be maintained until producer activity levels provide visibility to volume growth warranting expanded capacity, but we remain flexible with the ability to scale capital back up quickly as our customers' needs. Last week, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis. We continue to look for cost efficiencies across our operations. So far this year, we have implemented measures across our systems, including optimizing assets, power savings, and discretionary spending reductions totaling approximately $50 million. We expect additional cost-saving measures in the second half of the year to result in total 2020 savings of approximately $120 million compared with our 2020 plan. I'm now going to turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, all. The backdrop we're seeing related to activity in volumes across our system has greatly improved since second quarter lows in May and June. Our recent conversations with producers have been focused on bringing wells back online, resulting in increasing volumes on our system and in some cases, producers are beginning to add completion crews and door rigs. Comparing our lowest average total monthly volume levels in the second quarter with our highest volumes reached so far in July, we've seen increases of more than 25% in NGL raw feed throughput volume and 20% in natural gas processed volumes. Our natural gas pipelines segment continues to provide stable fee-based earnings with firm contracted capacity totaling nearly 95%. The importance of these segment stable and predictable earnings is highlighted during times of market uncertainty and underscores the strong demand for natural gas we continue to see from our customers including electric generation facilities, utilities and industrial markets. Now let's take a closer look at current activity across our operations. In the Rockies region, we've seen a sharp increase in volumes in July, as Terry mentioned. Total NGL raw feed throughput volume from the region has reached more than 200,000 barrels per day in July and nearly 50% increase from May lows. Natural Gas volumes profits in the region have reached 945 million cubic feet per day in July, and nearly 35% increase from June lows. There are approximately 10 rigs currently operating in the basin, with about half on our dedicated acreage. Drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin total more than 950 with approximately 400 on our dedicated acreage. Our customers in the basin are some of the most well-capitalized producers in the industry and if communicated they're positioned to resume activity as commodity prices and the demand outlook improves. We're frequently asked what price it would take for producers to bring rigs back to the basin. But the important point right now is the price it takes to bring curtailed wells back online. We believe that if current market condition is sustained the remaining curtailed production will come back online during the third quarter of 2020. In the Williston Basin, we had approximately 1.5 billion cubic feet per day of natural gas connected to our system in March, which includes volume that had been captured on our system in volumes being flared. The latest data shows 220 million cubic feet per day was still flaring in the basement with 125 million of that on ONEOK's dedicated acreage, which provides a continued volume uplift opportunity for us in 2020. Our completed infrastructure is in place to capture this volume and no new drilling activity is needed to reach our pre-COVID volume levels. We are on track to complete the extension of our Bakken NGL pipeline in September of this year earlier than our previous target date of the fourth quarter. This new lateral will connect with an expanding third-party plant and will provide NGL takeaway in an area of Williams County which historically had limited NGL transportation options. We expect the lateral will provide additional NGL volume to our system as we enter 2020 and it includes a minimum volume commitment. During the second quarter, curtailments varied greatly across our producers. Some curtailed nearly 100% of their production and some curtailed virtually none. The percent of proceeds and fee components also vary across our customer contracts. Curtailments on large producer contracts with higher fees and lower PLP components were the primary contributor to our lower average fee rate. Another factor was that we experienced greater curtailments in our higher fee Rockies region compared with our lower fee Mid-Continent region. Given what we see today, with curtailed volumes continuing to return, we expect the average fee rates for the gathering and processing segment to reach pre-COVID levels of approximately $0.90 per MMBtu in the fourth quarter of 2020. In the Mid-Continent region, second quarter average NGL raw feed throughput volumes of 521,000 barrels per day increased compared with the first quarter 2020. Volumes from this region had reached over 600,000 barrels per day in July, a 15% increase compared with the second quarter of 2020 average. Ethane volumes in the Mid-Continent averaged 260,000 barrels per day in June 2020, compared with the second quarter 2020 average of 210,000 barrels per day, a more than 20% increase driven by nearly all our Mid-Continent plant connections entering recovery during the quarter. We expect ethane recovery on our system to continue through the remainder of the year due to strong petchem demand and favorable ethane extraction economics. In the Permian Basin, the connection of two new third party processing plants in the first half of 2020 and the full completion of our 80,000 barrels per day, West Texas LPG pipeline expansion in June position as well for future growth in the basin. With the expansion complete, we will continue to transition volumes away from third party offloads on to West Texas LPG. We are currently offloading 25,000 barrels per day, which will provide full transportation and fractionation revenue when they move on to our system in the future. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. With a challenging quarter behind us, there are opportunities ahead. What we've seen proven time and time again is that producers in the midstream industry are resilient, innovative and able to find solutions when market conditions are tough. We saw it in 2015 and in 2016 when producers were able to drive significant efficiencies in their drilling programs, and again in 2018, when the midstream industry worked together to add Gulf Coast fractionation capacity. From the ONEOK perspective, our management team will continue to be proactive and innovative in how we can become even more efficient. We remain focused on creating value for our stakeholders and continue to prioritize the long-term sustainability of our businesses. The events of 2020 have certainly been disruptive but have not distracted us from focusing on the right things. I'm proud of the resilience and focus with which our employees have approached the last several months in keeping our employees and assets safe and I am inspired by the way our employees and the company are navigating important social issues within our communities with compassion, understanding, empathy and generosity. We will provide more detail on these important issues and many others in our upcoming environmental, social and governance report, which will be available on our website in the coming weeks. This report is particularly important in times like these and staying focused on the right things is more important than ever. The report includes expanded disclosures in each of the ESG categories and will mark an adoption of the savvy sustainability reporting standards. While ESG reporting isn't new to us, this report will be our 12th annual publication. Our sustainability journey continues and we remain committed to continuous improvement of our ESG performance and disclosures to our stakeholders. With that operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning. This is Charlie [ph]. Appreciate all the color in the opening remarks. Just as you noted with your updated guidance reflecting potential Apple headwinds there, curious if it also takes into account the High Plains pipe that could be shot. And also, secondly, I was curious, should Apple shutdown commence, can you address the possibility to temporarily repurpose an NGL pipeline to crude service, if that would make sense, and kind of what the puts and takes of that would be? Kevin Burdick : Yes, Jeremy. It's Kevin. The first question, as far as the Apple shutdown, we really don't see much impact at all to 2020. As we said, we see that more as a 2021 issue as curtailed production comes back, we believe there will be another pipeline capacity in rail transportation to handle the volumes that are currently being curtailed. And as it relates to the second question, yes, we physically could convert the smaller Bakken NGL pipeline in the crude service. We're evaluating that, and looking at all of our options, and watching that closely. But yes, that is something that's physically possible. Unidentified Analyst : Thank you. And then looking at the second half guidance here and trying to parse one half to the second half, how should we kind of think about Rockies and mid Conway connects relative to the first half, given the sort of rig count pricing environment we're in? And then maybe secondly, specific to GMP, what sort of pricing assumptions go into point you towards to what you gave us on guidance. Maybe said differently, that $30 million decline you saw related to the pop exposure contracts, would you expect that to reverse in the back half of this year? Terry Spencer : There's a couple questions in there. I'll answer your last and first. And yes, like we said, we do believe that if we see this environment sustained, you'll see that that fee rate improved. And obviously, that's going to help on the pop side if you get some pricing strength as well. And what was the first question in that second grouping? Unidentified Analyst : It's about well connects in the second half relative to what we saw in the first half, just given what we're seeing on the rig count side and the pricing environment. Kevin Burdick : Yes. We are seeing -- I mean, we -- again, the 2020 numbers really aren't dependent on well connects as far as new rigs and things like that. That's more again of a 2021. In fact, we -- again, recent conversations with producers. We are there having conversations in this environment about completing ducks, potentially bringing completion crews back. So, we don't have -- it's not like we've got rig counts going there 40 in the next two months or something. Chuck, do you have anything to add to that? Chuck Kelley : Yes, I mean, what I did was based on producer discussions, as Kevin mentioned, if we see on the drill schedules that are provided by our producers to us, ducks are currently being completed here in Q3, as Kevin mentioned. We've also got some line of sight to Q4 with additional completions. And what producers have told us is they want to complete these wells before winter in anticipation of more demand. And in addition to that, some of our larger producers have indicated to us that they're going to run one to two rig programs through the remainder of the year on our acreage. So, we've got some line of sight to increase ducks\u2019 completions as well as increased well connects forthcoming. So, hope that gives you a little more color Unidentified Analyst : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : [Operator Instructions] We'll take our next question from Tristan Richardson. Tristan Richardson : Good morning, guys. Just appreciate all your commentary on the new range for EBITDA. But I guess just thinking about higher LPG prices and the volume improvement we've talked about in July, as well as teaching recovery and enhanced well completions, do these timing itself add up to really support a run rate EBITDA as we look towards the end of this year, somewhere much closer to the high-end of that range of outcomes you provided last quarter, namely the $3 billion type of EBITDA range? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin again. And yes, I do think it supports that. If you think about where we were, not necessarily first quarter average, but you think about where our volumes were right as we entered into the COVID and the OPEC situation, those types of volume levels was what supported that -- kind of the upper end of that range that we talked about. So, as we get to curtail production to come back online, and I think a key point in that is those March numbers included substantial gas that was flaring. Since that time, we put additional infrastructure in place, and if the volumes come back, we would expect the flaring numbers to go down. So, that's why we have the confidence in those numbers. If that's what you choose to that run rate that we're looking at, towards the upper end of the range. Tristan Richardson : Great. And then you were talking about -- on the 2021 CapEx opportunity being just generally no lower than 2020. Now, we're kind of halfway through the year, so we think of that spend opportunity next year is something sub $1 billion? Or is there kind of a bookend way to speak about how you're spent? Kevin Burdick : I just said in my prepared remarks that we would be in that $300 million to $400 million range for 2021, including maintenance and growth. And we will sustain that level of CapEx as long as producer activity, indelible producer activity, is generating growth that we need to expand capacity. It's very nudging. We have all the assets in place to get us back to ready to that EBITDA north of $3 billion. And so, we're in a great position here where you don't have to jump on the CapEx level until producer activity warrants that for growth. Tristan Richardson : I appreciate it. Sorry, I missed that figure. Thank you, guys, very much. Kevin Burdick : Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning, everyone. Good to hear everyone is well. Just maybe wanted to just start off with your dividend comments that you made in the prepared remarks. You'd mentioned that it could potentially be another down the road and so forth. When you sort of think about things, you've got a lot of headwinds obviously with COVID, potentially with Apple, which can impact CapEx for the basis of your producer customers. I was wondering if you can give us the case studies or scenarios as to how you think about the dividend, either being maintained or potentially being reduced in the $2.6 billion guidance range for this year enough to maintain the dividend. What levels are you thinking about would become an area where you would become concerned as a $2.4 billion run rate? How much does SMP re-reviewing your rating matter? Just wondering if you can sort of give us different paths and different outcomes as to how you're thinking and would be recommending the dividend to the board. Terry Spencer : So Shneur, this is Terry. So, I'll just make a comment, and then Walt can follow up. As we think about 2021, I think this gets to the core of your question is, how do we think about this business going forward? And we've looked at a number of scenarios when we've been -- and the key variable -- a key variable, of course, is Apple. What happens to key questions? Is Apple going to be shut down? Is it going to continue to operate? As we think about that scenario, and we think about 2021, and even with the Apple shutdown, we could see 5mid to high single digit growth in EBITDA over what we've experienced or expect in 2020. So, in 2021, we could see that mid to high single digit. If we're fortunate, and Apple doesn't become an issue for 2021, we could see a 12% to 15% EBITDA growth over what we experienced or expect in 2020. So, in both of those scenarios, we don't see a need to have to take a dividend action. And as Walt indicated, capital spending would be very, very modest $300 million to $400 million range. So, given that outlook, certainly we don't think it's appropriate to take any action at this point in time. Walt, anything to add to that? Walt Hulse : We obviously stay in touch with the rating agencies. They saw that the activity definitely equity that's a proactive step to accelerate the leveraging from other real benefit not on that, and we're focused on cultivating, and we're pleased to see the strength that we're seeing in the -- from the producer activity bringing retail volumes back on the trend that that's showing us in this point in time. Sheridan Swords : It's Sheridan. The only thing I would emphasize, and we've said it a couple of times in our opening remarks, but that is this BPF and a half a day, particularly in the Williston basin, that deliverability is connected to our system and doesn't really depend on a whole bunch of rigs coming back into the basin. As we think about 2021, our growth that is our throughput growth on our GMP business is a function of capturing and accelerating that capture of that BCF and a half a day. So you think about this first quarter 2020 volume of about 1.1 BCF a day in the BOC, and as you think about 2021, that number we expect to grow as we move throughout the year. And it's a function of capturing that BCF and a half a day of deliverability. That's already there. That's a that's the point we can't emphasize enough today. Shneur Gershuni : Well, I really appreciate that. A better answer than I expected. Maybe it's a good way to transition. You've answered this a little bit in the prior questions to some of the questions you've received in the prepared remarks. But when we talked about the drivers for a strong second half recovery, and as we sort of think about '21, as just talked about, if I remember, and I'm dating myself a little bit here, back to the '13, '14, '15 cycle, in Bakken they did something, [indiscernible]. In the most recent cycle, the Bakken, do you see that trend on efficiency continuing and that may be worth zeroing in on the wrong type of rig count for the Bakken to be able to generate enough ducks for you to be able to maintain and potentially grow production? Could you see something where 30 is really been one normal run rate that conserve run, 1.4 million, 1.5-million-barrel tech market? Just kind of wondering what you're seeing in terms of thoughts on efficiencies and how things are moving around. Kevin Burdick : Shneur, it's Kevin. I'll start. You were a little muddy, so I'll make sure -- if I don't answer your question, make sure you jump back in here. I mean, we continue to -- the reserves have been fantastic in the Bakken, and producers have been year-over-year delivered better and better wells. The rigs have gotten more and more efficient. So, they continually had shown they can deliver more volumes and less capital is what that ultimately goes to. So, I think that's part of the story that over time, you won't need as many wells or completions to keep your volumes at certain levels. I think we've talked about it in that one, four to one five type range of all BCF a day volume. You're probably 30 to 40 completions per month on our acreage. And we think that's absolutely doable. And we do believe the quality of the wells will continue to improve. Chuck Kelley : Another data point I'd add, Shneur, is we work closely with all of our producers, and a couple of them have been the past six months or so, I wouldn't say experimenting, but working with longer laterals as long as three miles. And based on the results of this, we're being told that less wells will be needed for the increased deliverability that they're seeing through those longer laterals. So for that part of your question, regarding continued either technological enhancements or efficiencies, I would say to producers didn't dialed anything back and we're really seeing some good results from some of these folks with a much longer laterals now. Kevin Burdick : One last thing on this topic, and I apologize. I should have brought this up sooner because we haven't mentioned it in our remarks either. Just to remind everybody, the gas to oil ratios continue to strengthen. So, look at crude oil forecast and you've got to apply the strengthening gas to oil ratios, and you can see some of the materials we provided on the presentation that shows what that's done over time, and it's continued to strengthen to where now it's more 2.2. So, that's another factor. We look at the basin of what's going on the GAAP side. Don't just focus on what's going on the crude oil side. Shneur Gershuni : That makes perfect sense. We really appreciate the color today guys. That was very helpful. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt, and Company. Colton Bean : Appreciate the comments around from the green shoots of activity and how you might return to those marks level. So I think we will be getting back to the 1.5 BCF a day, understandably, a reversal of shut-ins is a large component of that. But I think the other ATP [ph] that the market's struggling with is what base declines with like. So, can you update us on how the wells that you've had still connected to your system producing over the last couple of months out of the chair -- how does it fare? Chuck Kelley : This is Chuck. Could you repeat the last part of your question? I didn't quite hear it; from the decline on? Colton Bean : Yes, Chuck. I think in terms of understanding what level of completions we might need to see to get back to something that looks like a more stable [indiscernible] and ultimately growth, I think the basic line has been to some there. Interested to see if you guys have a view on when a PDP profile might work across your system. Chuck Kelley : So, similar to other shale plays, but we see typically or what we run in our models -- and you're wondering 50%, 55%, decline rate year two, and that's 20% to 25%, year three, 15% and then and then just maintaining stuff down from there. So your first year is your -- obviously, as you know, is your larger trial decline in a shale plays. We run at a 50%, 55% range. Colton Bean : Okay, and you all feel comfortable that 30 to 40 completions a month would be sufficient to fully offset that base? Chuck Kelley : We do. Colton Bean : And on planning side of things, I think we've heard from producers that wells that were flaring were preferentially shut in. So if you looked at that $125 million that's been flare on one of the acreage today, would you expect that to increase as you bring wells back online? Or alternatively, have you still been connecting to wells that are actually shut in today to accelerate that gas capture? Chuck Kelley : What we've done here in the second quarter to help people flaring -- you won't really see that until third -- we expect to see the results here in third quarter relative to our flaring percentages, as we've completed some pretty good sized trunk lines into an area air flow that's been very, very limited and been able to get gas egress. So, put a couple of 20-inch trunk lines completed and tied in wells that had been flaring, as well as some new wells that were getting ready to come on. So, some of our infrastructure obviously is going to help on that 125 million a day. Colton Bean : Understood. Appreciate it. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Great. Thanks, everyone. Appreciate it. One question I wanted to ask was just about ethane recovery. Can you talk about -- I'm assuming you're not seeing much increase in the vacuum, but really wanted to talk about that? And also, to the extent you are seeing increased recoveries in the mid-con, how that's trending and any way to quantify that. Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. You are correct out of Bakken where -- and their targets are not improving, and the economics at this time don't warrant that. But we have, as we mentioned, seen good ethane recovery increases in the midcontinent. And what I'd tell you today is that in June and July, the average percentage of ethane in a wide rig 45%. We are up over 60,000 barrels a day more ethane in the mid-comments than we were in the first quarter, and over 50,000 what we experienced in the second quarter. That's for June, and July is continued on that. So I think we -- as mentioned in our remarks, all the ethane or substantially all the ethane within the mid-continent that can come out is coming out of the sun. And we do predict that and continue through the rest of the year. Michael Blum : Great. And then a somewhat related question. There have been a lot of discussions about the gas dynamics in the Balkan, given the BTU issues. Obviously, that's obviously changed a bit. But just curious, your views, if you think any of the proposed expansions, including how the northern border -- are any of those still in play, or do you think that whole expansion discussion's kind of shelved here for a while until Bakken levels recover? Chuck Kelley : Michael, this is Chuck. We answered a similar question in Q1. And at the time, again, with things in flux and trying to forecast, we're kind of -- as far as we were experiencing or working on expansions, kind of pushed that out a little bit. I think it's fair to say that an expansion should be forthcoming. I just can't tell you when. I would say it is pushed out probably 12 months anyway. We just need a better line of sight on some longer-term forecasts, but I think that expansion will definitely be needed in time. Michael Blum : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury, Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Good morning. Just a follow-up on the Bakken NGL to create conversion potential; recognizing that it's still in early development, but would this require overland pass to convert to create as well? Chuck Kelley : Be able to move through the Bakken pipeline, physically possible, we would probably move it into the currency area. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. So, it would just be before you hit ever like that [ph]? Chuck Kelley : Yes. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great, thank you. And then just a quick one. What's the latest estimate of when you would be a federal cash taxpayer? Chuck Kelley : Well, nothing really changed from a tax standpoint, other than the fact that obviously, the rate of the EBITDA is going to be lower than expected in 2020. So, if anything, it smoothed out a little bit because the assets that we ultimately will complete, [indiscernible] down the road, when growth is back and those are needed, that depreciation will come at a later date and we'll be able to optimize the economy. So, we don't expect to be a LIFO taxpayer for several years. And eventually, we'll get into a situation where there are some limitations that are currently out there on the utilization that allows, but that's still a few years down the road. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. That's all for me. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sunil [ph] of Seaport Global Securities. Unidentified Analyst : Hi. Good morning, guys. Can you hear me? Chuck Kelley : Yes, we can hear you. Unidentified Analyst : So, thanks for all the clarity on the call. I just had one follow-up question on the leverage metrics. In the press release yesterday, you indicated the covenant based average tracking at 4.5x. So, it seems like to me that the fear bit of project EBITDA baked into that based on projects, which did not contribute to EBITDA yet, first, is that correct? And secondly, when you baked that EBITDA into the covenant metrics, is that based on cash flows, which are contracted, or is it more driven by your expectation and then frequent is that expectation kind of revised? Thanks. Chuck Kelley : Could you repeat the first part of your question? Unidentified Analyst : So, in the press release, you had indicated that the covenant-based leverage was tracking at 4.5x. So, when I look at your debt balances, [indiscernible] EBITDA, I come up with a higher number. So, I'm just trying to reconcile that disconnect. Chuck Kelley : The covenant calculation does not trust exactly to GAAP under the bank covenant. There is a provision that allows for an EBITDA assumption associated with CapEx that's either come into service or will come into service down the road, and that scaled down over a period of time. So, there's a there's a mismatch. There always has been a slight mismatch between the GAAP and the covenant calculation. At this point, the covenant calculation is at 4.5 times versus the covenant at 5 times. Unidentified Analyst : Okay, got it. Thanks. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. Can you comment a little bit about what you're seeing in back volumes at Bellevue? And I'm kind of going back a little bit to kind of what the trend that could be. Can I call that data out a little bit about what you've seen frac-wise. And are you saying does not having export capacity, especially given LPG exports have kind of held up relatively strong during the last three or four month period, does not having a dock capacity or export capacity actually impact you at the price levels, our volumes relative to maybe what you think or what you're seeing your competitive peers one faction that has helped you as well? Chuck Kelley : Right now, because the way our system setup, all our fracs can be a Bellevue frac. So, when you look across our system, we have plenty of frac capacity because any volume that we frac in the midcontinent with the sterling system, we can make that volume show up in Mont Bellevue. But right now we look -- well, we have plenty of frac capacity through 2020, or until we see a much better improvement into producer productivity that we would need to bring me back on. So, we're in pretty good shape on the frac capacity side. In terms of do we need to export the author? Does that impact us on the frac side? It's just not at this time. Right now, there's more export capacity than the interact capacity really, and so we are able to contract and have contracts with a lot of our volumes in a short period of time to exporters, because they need that volume to fulfill their commitments across the dock. So at this time, we don't see that it's a hindrance not to have a dock. Of course, as we look into the future, that's still something on our list that we would like to look at a period of time when we see more supply come online that would warrant additional capacity. But this time, we do not see it as a hindrance or as a disadvantage Michael Lapides : No, that's super helpful. Can you talk a little bit about what you think utilization rate in the quarter was for your fracs and how July's looking? Chuck Kelley : Could you repeat that again? We're having difficulty hearing you. Michael Lapides : Guys, could you talk a little bit about what you think your frac utilization rate was in the quarter and what you're seeing in July? How big of a step up? You kind of gave a lot of detail about what July looked like or cost set-up, throughput across multiple basins and in gas. I'd love to just kind of a same level of detail on the frac side. Chuck Kelley : Right now, we are over 80% on our frac utilization. We've seen a big step up on that because we've bought more ethane on,5 and that doesn't -- that capacity has always been there. But we're sitting about a little over 80% of what our frac utilization would be. And so, as we continue to grow into the third quarter, we have already seen that volume increase that we talked about in July. We still move closer to that -- maybe closer to the 90%, the 85%, 90%, which still leaves us plenty of frac capacity. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then one final one, if I may. Terry, with you in the board, kind of evaluate capital allocation -- I know you talked today about not needing to do anything with the dividend. How do you think about the balance between evaluating the dividends versus evaluating the incremental equity issuances if needed? You kind of have to shell out screening for the forward sale agreement. I'm just trying to think about how you and the board think about what's the light source of equity capital if equity capital is needed. Terry Spencer : A couple of different aspects. It's related to deleveraging any dividend action that would have been considered from a deleveraging standpoint would have taken quite a bit of time to actually have an impact wherewith the equity offering there was an immediate impact from the credit standpoint. The other side of that also as well is that as we see the business going forward in that the COVID has a defined period of time that it will take to play through and provided we know exactly what that defined of time is that to the extent that it's measured in quarters, we didn't believe that that meant that we should be adjusting our dividend for a quarter or two or more disruptions. We needed to make a positive step on the deleveraging standpoint and the quickest way to do that was to do the equity offering. Then as we see the strength of the business coming back and that would be there to support that dividend in the long term we continue to get on that path. Walt Hulse : Michael, the only thing I'd add from a priority standpoint, maintaining that investment-grade credit rating is extremely important to the company and important to this board so it remains a high priority. Certainly, that was in the mix in terms of the capital allocation decisions we were making. Michael Corbin : Got it. Thank you, guys, much appreciated. Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Thanks for taking the question. It sounds like a wonderful artwork heading into the second half here. That's great clarity. On potentially repurposing the dock and NGL pipeline, how long would that take and would any concurrent upsizing needed on outreach be done in the same time frame? Kevin Burdick : Very good Shere. We're still evaluating all the aspects of that turning them into crude or [indiscernible] what needs to be done. So we continue to look through that. As we continue to evaluate that more, we'll have a better understanding of what it takes to convert its crude. Craig Shere : Are we looking at something that could be a couple of years, it could be comfortably quicker than that if you had to go that route the market needed? Kevin Burdick : I don't think it's a couple of years but it will take some time. Craig Shere : All right, thanks. Walt, I apologize. I guess I'm a little confused about the CapEx guidance. I thought I read the second half will be an absolute $300 million to $400 million, but then do I understand that's ongoing until there's a lot of more clarity on COVID and upstream volume that the annual rate in the 2021 will be $300 million to $400 million? Walt Hulse : That's correct. As we finish up the 2020 is that for you guys [indiscernible] the commitment we're finishing up and we have enough of such projects but as we get into 2021, we won't be able to continue to keep that $300 million to $400 million range including maintenance CapEx. In order to pick up in volume will get us above the level that we had been originally forecasting for 2020 so we've got some significant headroom there and obviously prioritizes cash flows as we grow into the deleveraging goals. Craig Shere : Very good. Last question on storage and ethane recovery was spoken of a lot on the first quarter call. I think we already addressed ethane. I know storage is only maybe 10s of millions of uplift but I don't know Sheridan, maybe you want to talk about when exactly that might be hitting. I know it's a hedged position. What should we be looking for into the second half? Sheridan Swords : I think the contango that represented itself will present itself in the second quarter because of how we sold that product out for and we will see that benefit show up in the second half of the year. You'll see that in the Isom unit as well. Craig Shere : Should we see most of that in the fourth quarter? Sheridan Swords : Yes, you could see some of that in the fourth quarter. We've sold it throughout the third and fourth quarter so you can see it through the remainder of the year. A lot is going to happen on this week in prices through that period of time but it will be spread through the second half of the year if I can think so far. Craig Shere : Great, thank you. Operator : We'll take our final question from Derek Walker with Bank of America. Derek Walker : Thank, you guys. Wishing you a good new year. Maybe just a couple of clarification questions if I heard it right here early in the Q&A portion referencing a DAPL impact. I believe we referenced if we extended the intended shutdown it would be mid to single EBITDA growth year-over-year and 1% down of the 12% to 15% year-to-year. A lot of the EBITDA growth rate and that also the $2.6 billion number for 2020 before mature. Is that right? Walt Hulse : That's correct. That's what you base it in. Those percentages that I provided earlier are based upon the lower end of the range that we provided for 2020, the basis of that. Derek Walker : Okay, perfect. Then I think the formal market definition proficiencies was it coming from Rodney Vegas with his opposition to power saving captured 50 million for the year and you talk about 120 is relative to your 2020 plan. Like I say, if you start to see things we recover in the second half do you feel most of that profit is sustainable or do you see some not coming back? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. Yes, we absolutely believe those cost savings are attainable. As we move through the year we've taken -- our team has done a fantastic job of finding opportunities and some of those opportunities you identify them but it takes a little bit of time to actually get in and we've been doing that so. So we do believe, even with the volume strengthening that we'll realize those savings in the back half of the year. Derek Walker : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : That concludes today's question and answer session. Mr. Ziola, I'd like to turn the conference back to you. Andrew Ziola : Well, thank you, Sara. Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in early October and extends until we release earnings in late October. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

At this time I'm about to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Sarah, and good morning and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s third quarter 2020 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, and Executive Vice President, Strategic Planning and Corporate Affairs and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President Natural Gas. Third quarter results were driven primarily by curtailed volume returning to system and increased ethane recovery. The majority of volume across our operations has now exceeded pre-pandemic levels and better represents our volume expectation prior to the widespread production curtailments seen last quarter. We\u2019re in a much improved position today than we were on our second quarter call. Back in July we discussed the expectation for curtailed volume to return in the third quarter. Now just three months later not only has essentially all of the curtail volume on our system returned, but returned at a faster rate than expected. This momentum especially from September is expected to continue with the fourth quarter being just as good if not better than the third quarter which also sets a good baseline into 2021. Additionally, we've successfully captured more previously flared natural gas in the Wilson basin leading the effort to reduce flaring even as production has returned in the region. In August we captured a higher percentage of gas than the statewide average of 92% and opportunity we've discussed for numerous quarters. Infrastructure put in place earlier this year and the hard work of our employees allowed us to help producers in the region decrease flaring allowing both our customers and ONEOK to benefit from previously uncaptured earnings. This is just one example of our continued focus on customer service, safety and environmental responsibility despite the challenges of operating and conducting business during a global pandemic. Operating conditions have greatly improved from second quarter lows but there is still uncertainty around the pandemic and the economic recovery. Despite that uncertainty we remain focused on continuing to meet the needs of our customers. Our conversations with producers are increasingly positive as commodity prices have shown some stability and demand has shown positive signs. These conversations have now shifted more towards 2021 indicating the potential for an improving pace of drilling and completion activity next year. As curtailed volumes have recovered so have our earnings. We now expect 2020 earnings to approach the midpoint of our previously provided outlook ranges which Walt will discuss shortly. On our last call I shared outlook for 2021 and today the backdrop is even stronger. Volumes in the Bakken ranch throughout the third quarter setting us up for a strong fourth quarter in 2021. We expect to achieve double-digit earnings growth in 2021 compared with our new and updated 2020 outlook. As it relates to our dividend distributable cash flow this quarter exceeded the dividend by $125 million. With earning strength expected in the fourth quarter and into 2021 we expect distributable cash flow to cover both the dividend and our 2021 capital expenditures as we continue on our path to deleveraging. As always has been the case the dividend remains a potential lever we could pull if our deleveraging expectations are not being met. This quarter demonstrated the reliability of our assets, the unwavering dedication of our employees and the resiliency of our extensive and integrated businesses. While the second quarter was challenging our employees remain focused on serving customer needs and preparing our assets for the eventual return of curtailed volume. The key infrastructure projects we completed prior to the pandemic create substantial capacity for future growth as markets continue to improve. With that I will turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you Terry. ONEOK's third quarter 2020 net income totaled $312 million or $0.70 per share. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $747 million a 15% increase year-over-year and a 40% increase compared with the second quarter of 2020. Distributable cash flow was more than $540 million in the third quarter, a 12% increase year-over-year with a healthy dividend coverage of 1.3 times. We also generated more than $125 million of distributable cash flow in excessive dividends paid during the quarter, an 11% increase compared with the same period last year. Our September 30 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.6 times as we saw a significant step up in EBITDA in the third quarter from the return of curtailed volume across our system. We continue to manage our leverage towards 4 times or less and maintain 3.5 times as our long-term aspirational goal. The end of the third quarter with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion credit facility and nearly $450 million in cash. Last week the board of directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis unchanged from the previous quarter. We took proactive steps earlier this year to provide ample liquidity and protect our investment grade ratings. We've demonstrated our ability to access the capital markets even during challenging market conditions and have been able to use our balance sheet flexibility to help guide financial decisions throughout this period of uncertainty. We've proactively paid off upcoming debt maturities and have been opportunistic in repurchasing more than $200 million of debt through open market repurchases in the first nine months of the year. From an upcoming debt maturity standpoint we have no maturities due before 2022. As Terry mentioned with yesterday's earnings we announced that we now expect 2020 net income and adjusted EBITDA results to be higher approaching the midpoint of our previously provided outlook ranges. Our improved outlook is supported by the volume strength we're seeing across our assets, the pace that curtailed volumes returned and our ability to capture previously flared gas results in an earnings run rate more in line with our original 2020 expectations and providing a clearer path to our continued deleveraging. Yesterday we also announced the early completion of our two remaining active projects the Bakken NGL pipeline extension and Arbuckle 2 pipeline extension which were originally scheduled for completion in the fourth quarter 2020 and first quarter 2021 respectively. Third quarter CapEx included dollars pulled forward from the fourth quarter and 2021 for these projects and routine growth capital primarily for well connects and maintenance activities. We have now substantially completed all of our active capital growth projects. We continue to expect a run rate of total annual capital expenditures including maintenance and growth of $300 million to $400 million. This base level of annual capital will be maintained until producer activity levels provide visibility to volume growth warranty expanded capacity. But as always we remain flexible with the ability to restart projects quickly as customer needs change. Recent conversations with producers particularly those who have substantial positions in the Dunn County area of the Williston basin are indicating that more rigs will return in 2021 resulting in a potential need to restart [indiscernible] 2 construction if this activity materializes. Even in this scenario our 2021 capital expenditures would likely be in the $500 million range. We now expect our cost saving measures to total approximately $130 million this year compared with our 2020 plan. Well, through September we've recognized approximately $100 million in savings and continue to look for additional efficiencies. From a financial perspective we remain well-positioned with ample liquidity and balance sheet strength to withstand additional market uncertain should it arise and to be opportunistic in the event of a faster-paced recovery. I'm now turning the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations. Kevin Burdick : Thank you Walt. With nearly all curtailed production back online by the end of the third quarter we saw a large step up in NGL and natural gas volumes across our system compared with the second quarter. NGL volumes across all of our operating areas exceeded pre-pandemic levels in the third quarter and natural gas volumes processed in the Rocky mountain region have reached more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in October. I'll start with the natural gas liquid segment. Third quarter NGL raw feed throughput volumes across our system increased 7% year-over year and 15% compared with the second quarter. In the Rocky mountain region which is our highest margin business volumes are averaging approximately 245,000 barrels per day in October; a 14% increase over our third quarter 2020 average and a more than 50% increase from the second quarter 2020. The return of curtailed production, completion of ducts and increased flared gas capture have contributed to higher volumes. As the primary NGL takeaway provider from the region our natural gas liquid segment not only benefits from the gas captured on ONEOK's dedicated acreage but also from many third-party plants across the basin. With more than 130,000 barrels per day of available capacity out of the region and the ability to expand capacity with minimal capital if needed there is a long runway to grow with our customers. We expect NGL earnings in the region to see additional benefit from two other areas as we move into 2021. First the early completion of our Bakken NGL pipeline extension in August. This lateral extension connects our system with an area of Williston county which has historically had limited NGL transportation options. In addition to the original contract with an expanding third-party plant in the area we've also contracted two additional third-party plants near the pipeline. Volume has already started flowing on the extension and we expect a continued ramp into next year. As a reminder this project is also supported by a minimum volume commitment. Second we expect to transport all of our Williston and Powder River Basin volumes exclusively on our Elk creek and Bakken pipelines beginning very early next year once we complete a low-cost pump expansion on Elk creek which will reduce our transportation costs paid to overly fast pipeline. In the mid-continent region, we completed the Arbuckle 2 pipeline extension in August earlier than our target date of the first quarter 2021. This extension improves connectivity from our Elk creek pipeline to the Arbuckle 2 pipeline allowing increasing Rocky mountain volumes the optionality to be transported to the Mont Belvieu market hub. Increasing petrochemical demand and favorable ethane economics resulted in significant ethane recovery across the mid-continent region through a good portion of the third quarter. By raw feed throughput volumes in the region increased 9% compared with the second quarter 2020 largely due to ethane recovery. Ethane volumes in the mid-continent averaged more than 245,000 barrels per day in the third quarter 2020 compared with the second quarter 2020 average of 210,000 barrels per day. A more than 17% increase driven by nearly all of our mid-continent plant connections recovering ethane in July and August. In September we saw a reversal back to ethane rejection as pricing and volumes were impacted by decreased petrochemical demand due to hurricane Lora. We have seen some plants in the mid-continent return to recovery this month that expect ethane volumes on our system to fluctuate for the remainder of 2020 and into 2021. In the Permian Gulf coast region, third quarter NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the second quarter 2020 benefiting from returning volumes and approximately 30,000 barrels per day of short-term fractionation-only volumes. Even without the additional short-term volume, raw feed throughput in the region still increased more than 6% compared with the second quarter. As we've mentioned previously we continue to offload 25,000 barrels per day on third-party NGL pipes. This firm contract will expire at the end of the year which will eliminate this expense as we move these barrels to our integrated system. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Total natural gas volumes processed increased 13% compared with the second quarter 2020 and processing volumes in the Rocky mountain region have reached more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day in October; a more than 16% increase from our third quarter average. The return of curtailed volumes to our system in the Williston basin drove the third quarter average fee rate to $0.94 per MMBTU compared to $0.71 in the second quarter as a number of high fee percentage, large producers brought production back online; some sooner than expected. Going forward we expect the average fee rate to remain around this level. There are 13 rigs currently operating in Williston basin with eight on our dedicated acreage which is an increase from the past few months. Drilled but uncompleted wells in the basin totaled more than 850 with approximately 400 on our dedicated acreage. We said previously that it takes 15 to 20 well completions per month to maintain our processing volumes around 1.1 to 1.2 BCF per day. This is a relatively small number of well completions considering we have averaged 28 completions per mark through the first nine months of 2020. When we factor in our current volume level a significant duck inventory that is profitable to complete in this price environment, the rigs currently on the system and some additional flare gas opportunities we have ample inventory to support current volume levels through 2021 assuming no increase in producer activity during that time frame. Of course, any additional producer activity in the basin would present upside resulting in more wells drilled and/or completed driving higher volumes and ultimately earnings for ONEOK. Slide 7 in our earnings presentation has been updated to illustrate the ability to maintain current natural gas processing levels with minimal well completions. This slide is meant to be a representation not guidance or an indication of our expected future volumes. For reference there are four to five frat crews in the region today each with the capability to complete five to six wells per month. In addition to the substantial inventory of wells on our system other volume tailwinds in the basin include rising gas to oil ratios and additional gas capture opportunities. [indiscernible] have continued to increase and remain well over two to one the result of activity concentrated in the core of the basin and maturing wells. This level of gas production suggests that even in a flat or slightly declining crude oil production environment we could still see stable to increase in gas volumes in the region. The latest North Dakota data which is for the month of August showed 215 million cubic feet per day still flaring in the basin with approximately 80 million cubic feet per day of that on ONEOK's dedicated acreage. Statewide flaring in August decreased to 8% compared with nearly 20% at the same time last year. As Terry mentioned flaring on ONEOK's acreage was below the statewide average; a reflection of the infrastructure that our employees have worked hard to construct and operate in the region over the last decade and specifically over the last couple of years. With 1.5 BCF of processing capacity we will continue to push to capture even more of the gas produced as we move through 2021. In the natural gas pipeline segment we reported another strong quarter of stable fee-based earnings the firm capacity remaining nearly 95% contracted. The segment continues to be a stable fee-based earnings driver for the company providing essential natural gas to end-use customers. Terry that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks Kevin. That was a great overview of a strong quarter headlined by the expected return of volumes and a solid demonstration of the resiliency of our businesses. This quarter was not only marked with volume related milestones and accomplishments. In August we issued our 12th annual sustainability and ESG report and just recently we received notable ESG related recognition including being recognized by just capital for the second year in a row as the industry leader in the energy equipment and services sector and receiving an award for environmental excellence from the Environmental Federation of Oklahoma. We're always valuing ways to improve our ESG related performance and enhance our long-term business sustainability. This includes planning and preparing for potential changes to our industry, customer needs or the broader demand for energy. There has been much discussion about the future state of the energy industry and we get asked frequently what our role could be in a low carbon world. The answer is simple ONEOK has always promoted a business culture prioritizing safety, environmental responsibility and profitability in all that we do and as we always have we will do our homework to gain knowledge and prepare diligently for the future as our industry continues to meet the world's energy needs in an environmentally responsible way whether it's actively evaluating the use of renewable energy at our facilities, developing carbon capturing projects or accepting the feasibility of using our extensive assets for hydrogen transportation and storage. Our commitment to environmental stewardship remains steadfast. Our assets, their location and our midstream skill set is compatible with many of these types of projects, but they still need to make strategic sense for our business. In many cases technology or large scale application may be further into the future but we'll continue to evaluate opportunities that fit within our businesses. Because we absolutely believe that our large and extensive infrastructure has a vital role to play in the long-term energy transition and while we evaluate new and future opportunities, I want to thank our employees for doing what they do best operating our assets safely and responsibly and transporting the essential NGLs and natural gas that are used to heat your home, generate electricity and create the many end-use products that help us lead healthier, safer and more productive lives. With that operator we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And we'll go ahead and take our first question from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : It\u2019s James on for Jeremy. I just wanted to start with the \u201821 guidance here for double digit growth and just given where the strip is today, what are the price assumptions built into that guidance and then just looking at the -- with the well completion guide is, it's kind of the ballpark for well completions needed to kind of maintain flat volumes of Bakken? Kevin Burdick : Well, Jeremy you were a little hard to understand there. But let me take the first question about growth into \u201821. We talked to producers in this price environment, they clearly the ducks are profitable to complete. I mean, I think that's the focus especially as we look as you move through the rest of this year in the early parts of \u201921, you've got that substantial duck inventory in the Bakken and you've seen some rigs come back. So as we've said before in a $35 to $40 environment the ducks work well as far as the economics, you get north of 45 that's when we saw rigs come back in material ways in 15 and 16 and I think our conversations with customers today that would still hold. So if we think about \u201821 we're absolutely not thinking about it in the context of a $55 environment. It's more in-line with what the strip would look like today. Chuck do you want to add there. Chuck Kelley : No, I would agree with those prices and as far as what you referenced with producers, we've had discussions with our Bakken producers and looking at their 2021 forecasts and drill schedules and what they've provided the expected pace of completion the first half of the year to be duct-driven as Kevin mentioned however they anticipate adding rigs in the spring. So I think as you look at the strip in \u201821 that pretty much supports that statement. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks for the color. So [indiscernible] understand my next question here you're just looking at the kind of 15 million in the G&P segment that was kind of captured here from improved commodity prices. I guess it's a higher level can you talk about how much of that is an element of an improved volume and kind of fee component there. If there's any color you can apply there I appreciate the color on the GPC going forward assuming that $0.94, but any color you could provide there? Kevin Burdick : Jeremy we're struggling. Did you, was your question about the fee rate in the G&P business. Unidentified Analyst : Yes. Sorry. Just basically what is the kind of breakdown of color provided in terms of how much that is attributable to improved volumes versus kind of the improved commodity prices? Terry Spencer : Jeremy this transmission is really bad. It must be a bad connection. So we're having real difficulty understanding and just hearing the question. So what we could do is try to get to you offline, but I think Chuck if you've got any commentary around the fee rate that might be helpful for Jeremy. Chuck Kelley : Sure. We can talk about pretty much what drove our increase in the fee rate quarter-over-quarter. If you think about it's really a combination of two things, basin mix and contract mix. So as we saw our Williston basin curtailed volumes returning our system particularly from our large producers, these producers have contracts that are fee only or have a high speed with a lower percentage of proceeds component and at least curtail volumes came back on. Then what happened was the mix of the basin contribution to that average fee changed. In Q2 it was more toward a 50/50 mix between mid-continent and Bakken with of course mid-continent being the lower fee margin business. So here in Q3 we saw our Rockies volumes contribute upwards of approximately 60% of that calculation. So combination of large producers, higher fee, higher fee levels, top components all lowest in volume related and roughly 60% of that basin mix in the average of the basin weighting in the average drove that fee rate to $0.94. Operator : We'll go ahead and take our next question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning guys. Hopefully my connection is okay. Just to clarify before I ask my questions, you were basically saying the makeshift of where the volumes came from is part of the reason why the rate went up is that way to characterize your last response? Chuck Kelley : Yes. That I mean again, it's a shift in both the volume of from the mid-con kind of declining in the higher percentage of Williston volume and then also the mix of contracts that we had a lot of our larger higher fee based customers brought gas back online in a sizable way in the third quarter. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. Thank you for that. Just moving on to my questions here. First of all, thank you for providing all the incremental data on well connections and that slide 7 where I kind of feel like I can choose my own adventure. So when I think about slide 7, I just want to understand how to utilize it correctly here, suggest 15 average well completions in months sort of keeps you flatter I guess that's about 180 completions for the year for 21. And to grow you've got the 25, 35, 45 scenarios and then as you mentioned in the call you've got 400 ducks that are in the money right now but maybe they're not all in the right areas. So when I sort of piece that together if I see let's say half the ducks get completed and you mentioned that you have eight rigs running on your acreage which gives you what two wells per week per month. It sort of seems like you can be materially above the 28 average well completion that you sort of highlighted and that you saw in September. So when I think about that all else equal that you can have a material increase in production year-on-year. Am I being too simplistic in my analysis here or is that the way to be thinking about that? Kevin Burdick : No. Shneur this is Kevin. I think that's exactly how we're looking at it. I mean that duck inventory that provides you a substantial runway for growth and when you add the rigs on top of that and we do expect to capture a little more gas and that gives you that volume strength that we foresee. Shneur Gershuni : In prepared marks I believe Terry mentioned that double digit growth for \u201821 versus \u201820 which one of those scenarios are you assuming? Is it 25, 35? Just trying to understand that. Terry Spencer : We're thinking about this in the context of a $40 to $45 type environment as we look at \u201821. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And then maybe it's a follow-up question one of your peers yesterday sort of was talking about Williston in general that the producers are becoming significantly more efficient, more stages per frac, longer laterals and so forth and sort of intimated [indiscernible] are going to continue to go up and maybe even faster than they had previously. Is that something that you're hearing from your customers as well too? Is that something that you're seeing as well also? Chuck Kelley : Yes. This is Chuck. We are seeing that from our producers, I think we mentioned on last call lateral lengths we're seeing pushing out to the three mile level. We're also seeing increased frac stages. So we're seeing greater production efficiencies and of course the GORs continue to rise in the basin so when you look at those three components it's all painting a pretty good picture for these new wells coming online. Terry Spencer : And Chuck that the bottom line to that is that break-even costs continue to come down significantly. Chuck Kelley : That's correct. Shneur Gershuni : Yes that's super helpful and maybe one final question if I made for Walt and I sort of think about the results for the third quarter by annualizing and look at your leverage compared to that you start to get down to the 4.6 zone and so forth. As we move into next year what's the leverage ratio on an annualized basis that you would like to get to before you would consider buybacks? Walt Hulse : Shneur I would answer that question in a couple of ways and I think that we will continue to see that leverage ratio trend in the right direction. We had when we originally gave 2020 guidance, we gave some expectations of what we thought leverage would get to at the end of 20 early 2021 and that kind of got moved out 12 to 15 months based on the pandemic. So I think we'll still trend in that range towards four times and whether that happens on a run rate basis at the end of \u201821 or early 2022 we'll be headed to the right direction. Shneur Gershuni : Perfect. Thank you very much today for all the color. Operator : We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclay. Christine Cho : Good morning everyone. I'm going to apologize in advance, but I also want to discuss slide 7. When you talk about the 15 to 20 wells a month in the Bakken volume flat at the 11 or 212 BCF a day level. When I combine that with your comments that you expect to be at least 3 billion in EBITDA next year that would to me at least imply Bakken volumes would have to hold at least from current levels. Does your CapEx of 300 million to 400 million next year indicate that level of well connects of 15 to 20 per month in the Bakken or how should we think about that? Kevin Burdick : Yes Christine this is Kevin. Yes, I think we would expect to be able to do that. Again we've got available processing capacity so all we're talking about and that we would need would be well connect capital to go connect well we might need to add a compressor or the station or something like that and that would be within -- Christine Cho : And then if I could actually move over to [indiscernible] pass and I appreciate the comments that you made in prepared remarks about taking your Powder River Basin over to Arbuckle but pass earnings were down in 2Q and that level continued into 3Q. Did you guys move volumes from the Bakken NGL and [indiscernible] path to Elk creek or did a large customer get off the system and I thought the pipe was previously full so should we think that there is available capacity on that system going forward? Sheridan Swords : Christine this is Sherdian. We did move some volume off of OPPO onto the Elk creek Bakken system in both the second and third quarter and probably the run rate you're at today is what you'll see through the fourth quarter and then once we get into 2021 we will, our plan right now is to remove all the volume off that system. Once we get into 2021 by moving that volume off the system and moving on our own system, we think due to costs savings that we will see we should see approximately a $40 million or $50 million uplift in earnings. Christine Cho : Okay. To do that is you going to have to expand Elk creek? Sheridan Swords : As Kevin says the earnings call we have a low cost expansion that we will complete by the end of the year and that will allow us to move all the volume off of OPPO onto Elk creek. Christine Cho : Got it and sorry one follow-up. Did you have to pay anything to take your volumes off of [indiscernible] for the last quarter, this quarter and next quarter? Sheridan Swords : Well we have some contractual obligations that we can't get into at this time, but any obligations or any contracts we have will not extend into 2021. Christine Cho : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Tristan Richardson : Hi good morning. I really appreciate all the comments on \u201821 particularly clarifying some of the assumptions in an especially uncertain environment. I mean you've noted that customer conversations are encouraging and rigs could potentially return in the spring which would presumably accelerate that completion activity. So to the extent of return of rigs occurs as you noted any of that return would be upside to the general assumptions driving the 3 billion plus 2021 expectation? Kevin Burdick : I mean I think there's clearly the potential for that. I mean that's what we talked in our opening remarks that would be upside. I think that it just will boil down to how the producers and our customers determine to deploy that capital as far as completing ducks and rigs coming back. The other thing that rigs coming back if you think about the lag of those rigs coming back that also then would start supporting growth into 22 as well. Tristan Richardson : Really helpful and then I guess just conversely, do you see outside of a reduction in completion or pace of completion activities? Are there headwinds out there that would prevent you to that sort of $3 billion number in 2021? Kevin Burdick : I mean that's the, again just other than you said that the activity levels and we all know the risk that would come with that might drive that but other than that the thing I think we just keep coming back to is, we've got plenty of processing capacity. We put a lot of compression and field infrastructure in place to get the gas to the plant. We've got an NGL system that's got available capacity. So we're sitting in a good spot to be able to grow with our customers with very little capital. Chuck Kelley : Right. Kevin I think the only thing I would add to your comments is that as we talk to the producers certainly they're making their decisions based upon a longer term view of commodity prices. Now certainly you could have, you've got OPEC risk out there you've got COVID-19 risk out there in the universe that certainly could impact these numbers as we think about 2021. But the fact of the matter is the industry has done some things not only the way they operate but also in the way they manage their markets and you've got new pricing indices in the gulf coast that could mitigate and ensure that the phenomenon we saw in the springtime in terms of negative crude prices does not happen again. But we're pretty certain we're not going to see that type of scenario materialize. But certainly we'll see month-to-month or quarter-to-quarter volatility and commodity prices like we always do but we don't anticipate even if we see some of these other phenomena other things happen like OPEC or the COVID. We don't think we're going to get back in a scenario like we saw in the springtime which was a huge impact to what transpired in the second quarter seeing those negative crude prices. Operator : We'll take our next question from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Thanks good morning everybody. I wanted to ask about ethane for next year really. Do you I guess what ethane price do you think you need to see recoveries in the Bakken and would you consider, are you considering a lower tariff to incentivize some of those ethane recoveries next year and then apologize for the multi-part question here. But did any of that in any ethane recovery assumed in your forecast or expectation for double digit growth in \u201821? Sheridan Swords : Michael this is Sheridan. What I would say on your first question the ethnic price that we would need in the Bakken obviously depends on what the gas price is in the Bakken, but it'd be fair to say that we would need to be in the $0.40 per gallon range at current fee structure that we have today. We always have the ability to flex our fees or change our fees to incent that thing to come out, if we think that's the best thing to do. But a lot as it depends on obviously we have to get still half the price with fees be higher than the gas price in the area. If we look into 2021 we are not assuming any ethane recovery out of the Bakken in our double digit growth. We are only assuming a partial ethane recovery through the year in the mid-continent for the double-digit growth as well which is where we could see some upside as we go into next year based on the volume happens. But nothing does represent kind of a call option that we have that volume doesn't show up that would force people to go into different areas to extract that thing where if volume does not show effect like we think it is next year you could see I think the economic coming out of the Bakken which would support our growth rate for next year. Chuck Kelley : And Sheridan we do see some additional demand coming as well right. Sheridan Swords : That's right. There is a one cracker that's to be completed here in the fourth quarter of 2020 and then we also have an export duck that is to complete and that has been completed and we'll start exporting full capacity into next year. So we see good demand coming on for next year and that's why we're I think we could see some ethane recovery for partial of the year in 2021. Michael Blum : Got it. Thank you very much. Operator : We'll take our next question from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : Good morning guys. First question for Walt, just with respect to leverage and getting to that 3.5x aspirational targets. I think I heard your response to the scenario that the strategy at this point is maybe steady deleveraging with cash over time which sounds like obviously that's been pushed out a little bit. Just curious beyond some of the repurchases you guys have done in the open market well maybe there's less opportunity there going forward and the appetite to get more proactive here and specifically what I'm thinking about is just on the M&A side and using M&A as a tool to maybe both delever as well as do something strategic not sure if anything screens for you on that front? Walt Hulse : Well, we think we're going to naturally delever and I think we're shooting for four times first 3.5 aspirational over time, but I think getting to that four-time goal is the near-term target. We obviously are going to look at opportunities that come along the way and if something was attractive from a delevering standpoint that would be a positive but I don't think that would be a driver for us to do a transaction for sure. Terry Spencer : Yes. This is Terry. So while we always think about acquisitions and opportunities to add assets or businesses to a business that's just an ongoing process. It's really not our top priority right now and managing the core business, managing the balance sheet is our priority and we're just going to stay focused on that. We'll stay focused on our operations. We're going to stay focused on serving our customer needs and optimizing our business where we can. The fact of the matter is as I've said before M&A opportunities are kind of few and far between and particularly those that are actionable, so we don't spend a whole lot of time worrying about that. So right now in this environment stay focused on core business. Operator : We'll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi good morning. What drives the flaring that is so happening on your acreage and in the Bakken more broadly and what would need to happen next year to get it even lower or is it just kind of a bit of a depth? Kevin Burdick : Okay. Jean its Kevin. I think you look at the flaring that's left there, we'll still have some isolated pockets of wells and/or pads that haven't been connected and/or we have some maybe pressure limitations. We're working to continue to put in some infrastructure. Obviously, we've taken out a lot of that flared gas as productions come back online. As we've said before you're always going to have some level of flaring especially when you look at IP rates and if a producer brings on a very large pad and we're not building for the peak 30 days or things like that. So those are the types of you've got operational disruptions that could cause some flaring from time to time. So we'll continue to work to obviously look for ways to capture all the gas that's out there connect a few of these and continue to watch the pressures on our system. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. So maybe a little bit lower, but not I shouldn't put in like a tiny number. Okay and then I just wanted to follow-up on a question that was asked previously. Ethane price would not have to get all the way to $0.40 for you to start sort of recovering and getting some benefit from the Bakken right? I think that for your sort of portion that you market yourselves you could do it at a lower price and make money. Kevin Burdick : Yes. We could always assure it and we could always lower our fees to make it economical to recover ethane. We always have that option and that's not only with our own volume coming off of our plants, but that would also be with a lot of third-party volumes and this is something that times we've done in the mid-continent when we think ethane may be coming into rejection to get it to come in earlier, we've reduced our fees at times to four months to allow them to come in. So we have that option and if we see the opportunity to do that and we think that it makes sense that it's definitely within our wheelhouse to do that ethane to come out. Operator : We'll take our next question from Gabe Moreen with Mizuho. Gabe Moreen : Hi good morning everyone. If I could ask maybe a little bit about what you're seeing with the [indiscernible] for gas here being northeast through the Bakken. If you're in the kind of legacy areas like the mid-con you're seeing maybe some refracts or producer interest and some stuff like that how discussions are happening? Chuck Kelley : Gabe this is Chuck. With that last question regarding mid-continent producer discussions I didn't quite hear. Gabe Moreen : [indiscernible]. Chuck Kelley : Yes. That's a good question. We have seen some refracts here this year particularly last quarter and I understand there's a couple scheduled here in our Q4. Other than that mid-con producers we've spoken with and have shared their preliminary plans for 2021 and they're indicating a restart in activity in both the stack and the scoop. We're seeing two to three rigs they're talking about next year for us right now on our acreage maybe there might be a fourth and what they're citing is strengthening mid-continent gas prices for some of the gas your place particularly in the stack. I hope that gives you a little bit of color of what we're hearing in the mid-con. Gabe Moreen : That was helpful. Thank you and then two quick clarification housekeeping questions from you. One is kind of what the expectations now are for total second half 2020 CapEx given future spending I think some of that pulled forward and then the other is just the guidance on double digit growth for \u201821. Well, I think last quarter you sort of [indiscernible] being on or off are there any sensitivities of being on or off? Kevin Burdick : Gabe this is Kevin. I'll start and Walt can chime in. If you think about CapEx yet clearly with what we spent in the third quarter with the acceleration of some of these projects and the activity levels we saw, we are at the high end and capital usually tapers off in the fourth quarter especially with weather and other things. But we'll definitely trend towards the upper if not slightly above the top end of the range there just given what we've spent year-to-date. But when we think going forward about capital the notion that we can continue to spend the kind of a run rate to continue to grow with the customers in that $300 million to $400 million range would be solid. Absolutely, we're thinking about DAPL and continue to think about it our outlook remains consistent with what we said before that if you would experience or the industry would experience a DAPL shutdown, we still believe it would be a mid single digit type growth for DAPL even in that scenario because our customers as we talked to them, they definitely have been exploring alternatives. Some of them have been securing some rail. Some of them have been moving some volumes to other pipes and getting allocation there. So, we do feel we could, we'd be able to support volume growth even in DAPL shutdown scenario. Gabe Moreen : And Sheridan you have anything to say in the event of DAPL shutdown could happen you got the potential to be a crude transporter out of here with some of the pipe you currently operate? Sheridan Swords : Yes. We still continue to look at whether or not we would take the Bakken the 12-inch pipeline into crude service. As Kevin said, producers out there have really looked at alternatives and there is a lot of alternatives beyond ours as well. Rail being one of them and all the other pipes that may be in a better position to start up quicker than our Bakken pipe could be to convert. But we still continue to investigate that to make sure it's ready to move if we need to do that based on that DAPL shutdown. Operator : We'll take our next question from Elvira Scotto with RBC Capital Markets. Elvira Scotto : Hey good morning everyone. So recently we've seen an acceleration of upstream M&A. What are your thoughts on this trend I mean clearly having larger better capitalized shippers on your system would be a positive if you see any potential impacts of contracting and do you think that the larger more integrated midstream companies like 10 that can offer services across the value chain benefit here? Kevin Burdick : Elviro, its Kevin. I don't know that we see, I don't think we definitely don't see that as a negative. We've got a lot of very large customers. I don't see it as a contract issue at all. We've got the vast majority of our contracts are long term. They are locked in and we like those contract structures. The companies typically, the larger companies we deal with many of them have a long-term view of this play especially as we think about the Bakken and they're looking at the reservoir over the next 10 to 20 years, not over the next three to four. So that can help from the standpoint of just good strong weighable growth over time. But I don't know that we see it as a significant pro or con either way. Elvira Scotto : Got it. Thanks and then quick follow up to that M&A question. I appreciate the comments that you made on one M&A, but I'm interested in your thoughts on overall trend that you think you can see in midstream M&A potential? Kevin Burdick : Well, -- that there's going to be significant consolidation this year and I've been wrong every time. But we do see some potential for private equity to potentially look at placing assets into the market. The fact of the matter is that most of those assets don't really make a whole lot of sense for us, don't fit with the bigger picture. We've done a lot of work in trying to manage our risk as it relates to well head risk and so we've done a real good job there contractually as well as how we operate our businesses. So really if to the extent we do see some things in mid-stream space specifically in gathering processing most of those as I see the landscape today don't really fit that well and certainly carry with it some risk that we don't like. But broadly speaking on a large scale for midstream that there is some, there you see some assets that are being spun out from other companies and utility companies and some of those assets are assets that look pretty good that could make some sense. But certainly we're going to look at the landscape and be diligent and disciplined in the way we consider acquisitions just as we always have. Operator : We'll take our next question from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes, hi, good morning. I just had question and if you could remind us in terms of your volumes or the cash flows explorer with a drilling on federal/Indian lands? Kevin Burdick : I'm sorry I couldn't make out your question the connections kind of garbled so maybe try the next question. If we can hear that and understand that one the connections really the audio is really poor. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. So my question second question was related to the capital allocation strategy. I was wondering if you have had any recent questions with the rating agencies and how does that trigger in terms of your temporary allocation strategy? Thanks. Kevin Burdick : We have regular conversations with the rating agencies. We have throughout the pandemic, we had regular conversations even before the pandemic. I think they've been supportive. You can talk to them directly. We have been pretty clear about our view on the dividend that it's part of the capital allocation process that our Board thinks about every quarter. But we really see the strength of the business and given in coverage we saw in this quarter and what we think about moving forward is supportive of the delevering that we're seeing and that the rating agencies have been looking at as well. So I can't speak for them, but we have a very regular dialogue with them. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Thanks for that. I'll take my other questions offline. Kevin Burdick : Thank you. Operator : We will take our next question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Yes. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a great quarter. Real quick we've had lots of M&A questions and they've all been at that acquisition or company acquisition driven. I kind of want to take it on the other side. Is there anything within the ONEOK portfolio that might not necessarily be quarter ONEOK, you have a pretty integrated system but just curious how you're thinking about that as a potential path to accelerating the deleveraging process. Kevin Burdick : Yes Michael we always think about that. We're kind of constantly thinking about asset rationalization. The fact of the matter is that we really don't materially have any assets that we don't consider to be core to our business, but we may have assets that certainly don't generate quite as high a rate of return as others. So we'll always think about those and we'll look at the landscape and the market opportunity and to determine if ownership of the whole value for somebody else is greater. So we're always thinking about those kinds of things that as we sit today our asset collection all fit together pretty well. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then two data questions just on the third quarter first of all, in the Bakken what were the well connects in September like what was the cadence I know you did 55 during the quarter. But what was the well, what was the cadence of that through the quarter? Was it significantly higher in September as an exit run rate relative to what it was at the beginning of the quarter? Chuck Kelley : Michael this is Chuck. I know our quarterly number was 55, frankly I don't have the monthly breakdown in front of me. So really can't speak to how it broke out over the quarter. We do have line of sight here in Q4 to a similar type number. Operator : We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Hi guys thanks for taking the question. Congratulations on terrific quarter. First based on conversations with producers any color around the magnitude of potential wells and recovery that you can see on your dedicated acreage from the spring and kind of dovetailing with Terry's comments about break-even costs falling are you getting body language that $40 is the new 45 that like what we saw in 2015/2016 as far as spurring material rig count recoveries? Kevin Burdick : Hi Craig this is Kevin. Yes the conversations with producers has gone great they continue to get better and better. Chuck reference lateral links and the frac the completion technologies, etc. In addition to that they have figured out spacing and they know exactly what they're going to get. I think one of the charts we provide not in our quarterly materials I think in our investor decks shows year-over-year how the type curves have improved every year and numbers right now are about increasing activity not about shutting activity down. Craig Shere : Great. Thank you. And last question sorry I just saw a dig deeper into your insights and environmental comments. I mean some things we kind of vaguely heard of is lithium extracted from oilfield brine hydrogen perhaps cheaply derived from old oilfields and in-field liquefaction perhaps assisting with flaring in certain basins acknowledging there is a lot of uncertainty over the next five to ten years are there any areas of transition that really stand out more for you or you could potentially participate? Terry Spencer : Well let me just hopefully this will answer your question. I think when we think about our participation in a low carbon environment it comes in basically three buckets. The first is reducing the impact from our existing assets and reducing our emissions. We've got opportunities to do that in terms of enhanced pipeline integrity and leak protection or leak prevention. We also have opportunity with electrification of existing natural gas-fired equipment and in particular compressors and so we've got it. We've done some of that work. We've got a lot electric drive machines in service and that's growing and we're looking at continuing to do that as we go out over a 10-year time frame that can and will have a significant impact in lowering our emissions. It also gives us the opportunity to consume solar and wind derived electricity which obviously is good thing to do. The other bucket is the transportation and storage and logistics for hydrogen as you mentioned CO2 carbon capture we've got some projects that we're looking at this pretty low hanging fruit to reduce the amount of CO2 emissions and then we're thinking about renewable fuels and other inert types of commodities or substances. So that fit very well with our existing capability and assets and then we're thinking about other low carbon projects that just make strategic sense for our business and that could be investing in some new technologies potentially hydrogen fuel cell technologies we could have investments in those types of projects direct investments in some of those. So the thing so profitability, business strategy all these things have to make sense with that broader objective to be a profitable company and to make us better and to reduce our impact on the environment. So that's kind of how we think about it. We're probably not going to invest in projects that absolutely don't have a fit or don't connect in some form or fashion strategically with our core business and our core capability as a midstream company. So that's I think a long-winded answer to your question. Hopefully that helped. Operator : We'll take our next question from Derek Walker with Bank of America. Derek Walker : Thanks everyone. I know we're over the hour and I appreciate you squeezing me in here. I'll maybe ask one and ask the other questions offline. But if I heard you right during the formal remark, I believe you said captured 100 million cost reductions this year up to this point and I know there is some commentary around costings with shifting volumes around it was kind of 40 million to 50 million. Does that 40 to 50 is that incremental to that 100 or have you excused some of that already and I guess a very general sort of cost reduction target that you have going into next year. I think you had 120 last year, but I just wanted to make sure that's not incremental to what you've already talked about? Kevin Burdick : Now this is Kevin. The $40 million to $50 million I believe you're talking about that Sheridan reference that's related to kind of margin in our NGL business and so that would not be included in the $130 million we expect to save from a cost savings. So those are two separate things. Derek Walker : Got it. Thank you. Operator : We'll take our next question from [indiscernible]. Unidentified Analyst : Hi thank you for taking my question. Just following up on Derek's question on the cost. We saw a meaningful step down in the OpEx in the G&P segment just wanted to understand if there was something unique happening this particular quarter or if this is a decent runway to think of from a total OpEx perspective going forward? Kevin Burdick : With the step down you're referring to the compared to the second quarter or you compared to last year? Unidentified Analyst : Both actually because I guess you have many more plants that are online this year than last year and yet your numbers were meaningfully lower. So just curious if there is something happening unique to this quarter if this is the new normal in terms of cost structure? Terry Spencer : No. I don't know that I'd say it's a new normal, but clearly when we have worked really hard over the last several months really since the beginning of the pandemic to cut costs out wherever possible. So we are doing things like there is we have compressor stations that we can reroute gas and shut down compressor stations and there is a couple of plants in the mid-con that we have temporarily idle that pulls costs out. You don't need as much materials and services and probably the biggest driver is our contract labor. We are doing most everything ourselves at this point with our employees as volumes have left. So with some process improvements and other things we found we expect that some of that will be sustainable but you would also expect that as our volumes pick back up the cost will go up a little bit just from that additional volume. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thank you. That's all I had. Operator : That concludes today's question-and-answer session. Mr. Ziola at this time I'd like to turn conference over back to you. Andrew Ziola : All right thank you Sarah. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in January and extends until we release earnings in late February.

And at this time I\u2019d like to turn the floor to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Greg, and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter year-end 2020 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be available to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today\u2019s call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer; also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. Before we discuss our 2020 results and 2021 guidance, I want to first express my deep appreciation for our employees who have been working tirelessly through recent extreme winter weather in the U.S. from North Dakota to the Gulf Coast. They have continued to meet the needs of our customers, while faced with personal challenges of their own homes, losing power without water, freezing pipes, you name it. I continue to be amazed by all that they do to provide exceptional customer service under very challenging circumstances. After a year like 2020, and so far in 2021, it\u2019s understandable to want to focus on what\u2019s ahead. But first, I\u2019d like to highlight several operating financial and ESG related accomplishments achieved during the challenging 2020. ONEOK\u2019s adjusted EBITDA grew 6% year-over-year, despite a global pandemic reduced worldwide energy demand and depressed financial markets. Our resilient business, the advantages of our integrated assets and the dedication of our employees has never been more evident. The credit goes to those employees who have continued to prioritize the health and safety of their communities, families and fellow employees. Whether continuing to report on site in order to monitor assets and systems or juggling the complexities of working from home, all of our employees are critical in keeping natural gas and natural gas liquids flowing on our systems. And these energy products are critical for the economy to quickly recover from this pandemic. From an ESG perspective, we received numerous recognitions this year, including recently being named an industry mover in the S&P Global Sustainability awards and the only North American energy company included in the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index. ONEOK also was the only Oklahoma-based company to receive a perfect score of 100 in the 2021 Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index. We formed a standalone environmental sustainability team back in mid 2017 that accelerated our ongoing environmental stewardship efforts. In collaboration with those efforts, we recently created a group charged with the commercial development of renewable energy and low carbon projects. The team is actively researching opportunities that will complement our extensive midstream assets and expertise, and not only lower our greenhouse gas emissions, but also help enhance the vital role we expect to play in a future transition to a low carbon economy. Opportunities under evaluation include the further electrification of compression assets, potential carbon capture and storage opportunities, sourcing renewable energy for operations and other longer-term opportunities such as hydrogen transportation and storage. As we develop these opportunities, we\u2019ll remain disciplined in our capital approach, applying similar project criteria in terms of return threshold, contractual commitments and operational fit, just as we do on other projects. We accomplished a great deal in 2020 and financially, we ended the year stronger than we started it, with improved leverage and a more solid balance sheet. Strategic financial decisions and strong operating performance has positioned the company for another year of earnings growth in 2021. Yesterday, we announced our 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance range of $2.9 billion to $3.2 billion, which is a 12% year-over-year increase compared with the midpoint. As the fundamentals of our business continue to improve, we\u2019re more likely to end the year at the higher end of our earnings guidance range, and we\u2019ll likely adjust guidance upward accordingly. Earnings growth in 2021 isn\u2019t dependent on significant increases in producer activity or on sustained higher commodity prices, although we have seen both in recent months. The earnings power of our assets and available capacity from completed projects enables growth, even in an environment continuing to rebound from 2020. Kevin will talk more about the key operational drivers of our guidance shortly. Let me touch briefly on the Dakota Access Pipeline. Since we provided our original outlook in July, we believe that the potential impact to ONEOK, if DAPL were shut down has significantly decreased. Producers have had time to secure alternative crew transportation and we\u2019ve seen crude oil prices increase making rail transportation, even more feasible. We believe that even if DAPL is shut down quickly after a ruling in April, the earnings impact to ONEOK in 2021 would be less than $50 million of EBITDA, assuming the pipeline was shut down for the remainder of the year. We remain confident in the long-term resiliency of our business are well-positioned in integrated assets and especially our employees in these challenging times. While world events have resulted in volatile times, ONEOK\u2019s businesses remain resilient and will continue to provide essential services for decades to come delivering much needed natural gas liquids and natural gas to our customers. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2020 adjusted EBITDA totaled $742 million and $2.72 billion respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 12% for the fourth quarter and 6% for the full year. Distributable cash flow was nearly $520 million in the fourth quarter, a 6% increase compared with 2019. We also generated more than $100 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our December 31 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.6 times compared with 4.8 times at the end of 2019. Proactive financial steps taken through 2020 and earnings contributions from completed projects enabled us to improve our leverage metrics, despite challenging market conditions. We continue to manage our leverage toward 4 times or less and maintain 3.5 times as a longer term aspirational goal. We ended 2020 with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility and approximately $525 million of cash. ONEOK is now rated investment grade by three major credit rating agencies. As Fitch issued a first time rating of BBB with a stable outlook in November, additionally, Moody\u2019s and S&P both reaffirmed ONEOK\u2019s investment grade ratings in 2020. We proactively paid off upcoming debt maturities and we\u2019re opportunistic in repurchasing nearly $225 million of debt through open market repurchases in 2020. We currently have no debt maturities due before 2022. We ended up achieving cost savings of more than $150 million last year, compared with our original plan and would expect a good portion of that to carry over into 2021. Last month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. As Terry mentioned, with yesterday\u2019s earnings announcement, we provided 2021 financial guidance, including a net income midpoint of more than $1.2 billion and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.05 billion, a 12% increase compared with 2020. Earnings expectations are supported by increasing producer activity, ample capacity and efficiency gains from recently completed projects and the continued opportunity for flared gas capture and strong gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin. Additionally, due to a higher natural gas and propane prices driven by extreme weather across our operating areas over the past two weeks, our Natural Gas Pipelines and Natural Gas Liquid segments benefited from our ability to supply increased demand to meet critical needs during this time. We expect benefits from these short-term opportunities to be partially offset by decreased natural gas and natural gas liquid volumes from well freeze offs, that will still represent upside to our guidance midpoints. Our 2021 guidance assumes first quarter WTI crude prices at the current strip and assumes a range of $45 to $50 for the remainder of the year. From a producer activity standpoint, we are also assuming volume levels that correspond with a $45 to $50 WTI rage. Sustained higher prices could lead to a hooker volume ramp and drive earnings towards the higher end of our guidance range. Total capital expenditures for 2021, including growth and maintenance capital are expected to range between $525 million and $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020. This range reflects improved crude producer activity levels and volume expectations, including capital to complete the Bear Creek plant expansion and associated field infrastructure later this year, which we referenced on our third quarter call. Conversations with producers in the Dunn County area of the Williston Basin remain extremely positive. And the likelihood of needing this additional capital this year is high. The original adjusted EBITDA multiple of four to six times still holds for this project with the multiple and incremental remaining capital being much lower. In terms of 2020 capital expenditures, we completed an expansion of our Elk Creek pipeline in December. Another example of low capital operating leverage on our system, a $100 million expansion increased capacity by 60,000 barrels per day, and provides added transportation capacity on our most efficient pipeline out of the Williston Basin. As we like to remind people every 25,000 barrels per day of NGLs from the region contributes approximately $100 million of annual EBITDA to ONEOK. Financially, our priorities in 2021 remain largely unchanged with our primary focus on debt reduction and investing alongside our customers. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. I\u2019ll start with a quick recap of fourth quarter operations and then discuss 2021 growth drivers. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, fourth quarter raw feed throughput from the Rockies region increased 13% from the third quarter of 2020 and 24% year-over-year. In January, propane plus volume from the region exceeded our fourth quarter average, despite typical winter weather challenges. In the Mid-Continent region, ethane on our system decreased nearly 40,000 barrels per day in the fourth quarter, compared with the third quarter, primarily due to high ethane inventories from hurricane related petrochemical outages in the third quarter. In the Permian Gulf Coast region, raw feed throughput volumes were lower in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter due to a short-term fractionation only contract that rolled off as well as a third-party plant outage and reduced ethane on our system. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segments. In the Rocky mountain region, fourth quarter volume \u2013 fourth quarter processed volumes increased 16% compared with the third quarter and 11% year-over-year as nearly all curtailed volume came back online. The return of volume with a high fee percentage in the Rockies combined with lower volumes in the Mid-Continent drove the segments average fee rate to $1.04 per MMBtu compared with $0.94 per MMBtu in the third quarter. In the natural gas pipeline segment, we reported another strong quarter of stable fee-based earnings with strong capacity 95% contracted. The segment continues to provide ONEOK with from fee-based earnings driven by end-use demand. You can try and more detailed information on our fourth quarter and full year 2020 results in our earnings materials. Now moving on to 2021, as we sit today, the operating environment is much improved from even a few months ago. Conversations with our customers remain positive and we\u2019re seeing increasing producer activity across our operations. Our 2021 volume guidance at the midpoint would result in a 7% increase in total NGL volume and a 5% increase in total natural gas processing volumes compared with 2020. In the natural gas liquid segment, we expect the volume growth to be driven by projects completed in 2019 and 2020, continued growth from well completions and the ramp of new plant connections and expansions completed in 2020 and 2021. In the Williston Basin, the recent low cost expansion of our Elk Creek pipeline increased its capacity to 300,000 barrels per day and increased our total NGL capacity from the region to 440,000 barrels per day. With this expansion, we had ample capacity to transport our Williston and Powder River Basin volumes exclusively on the Elk Creek pipeline at the beginning of this year, which reduces transportation costs paid to Overland Pass Pipeline and is expected to result in $40 million to $50 million in additional earnings in 2021. The Elk Creek expansion provides added capacity, which is also available for potential ethane recovery if needed. Our current NGL volume guidance does not assume Williston Basin ethane recovery, but does assume partial Mid-Continent ethane recovery. We currently have approximately 100,000 barrels per day of incremental ethane opportunity in both the Mid-Continent and Williston Basin. As we look forward domestic and international petrochemical demand and export dynamics look strong, but we continue to expect ethane volumes on our system to fluctuate throughout 2021. With available pipeline capacity between Conway and Mont Belvieu, the differential between the two market centers is expected to be near the historical average of $0.02 to $0.03 per gallon for ethane. However, so far in 2021, we\u2019ve seen prices for several of the NGL products fluctuate outside of this range, recent extreme winter weather, and the resulting increase in propane prices in the Mid-Continent created opportunities for both our optimization and marketing business, as we utilized our pipeline and storage assets to meet market needs. In the Permian Gulf coast region, our firm contract to offload 25,000 barrels per day on third-party NGL pipelines expired at the end of 2020. And these volumes are now flowing on our system, eliminating the additional transportation costs. From the federal lands perspective, we estimate that less than 10% of our NGL volume is from acreage on federal lands, primarily in the Permian Basin. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segments. Higher 2021 volumes are expected to come from the Williston Basin. There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin with eight on our dedicated acreage. Our conversations with producers indicate that in the current price environment, they expect to bring more rigs back to the region once weather improves in the spring. There also remains a large inventory of drilled, but uncompleted wells in the basin with more than 650 basin wide and more than 375 on our dedicated acreage. The capture of additional flared natural gas in the region remains an opportunity. The latest North Dakota data, which is for the month of December showed the state achieving a record of 94% gas capture. This leaves approximately 185 million cubic feet per day still flaring in the basin with approximately half of that on ONEOK\u2019s dedicated acreage. Increasing rig activity, flared gas capture, DUCs and continually increasing gas to oil ratios provide solid tailwinds for volume growth in the region. At the midpoint of our guidance, we expect a 17% increase in 2021 processed volumes compared with 2020, which would result in an average volume greater than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day. We expect to connect between 275 and 325 wells in the region this year, which would be 25 completions per month at the midpoint, the segments average fee rate is expected to range between $0.95 and $1 in 2021 based on our volume mix assumptions for the year. As we said previously, nearly 80% of our dedicated acreage in the Williston Basin is on private lands. The smaller portion on federal land is primarily outside of the cooled basin acreage, where little to no activity was expected. In the Mid-Continent region, we expect to connect 30 wells in 2021. The same amounts connected in 2020. Flat rig activity and natural production declines in the region are factored into our volume guidance for the year. However, producers have indicated that was strengthening commodity prices, particularly natural gas and NGL, they are evaluating adding rigs in the stack and scoop areas. In the natural gas pipeline segment, we expect transportation capacity to be approximately 95% contracted in 2021. As we\u2019ve experienced recent extreme cold temperatures across our operating areas, we\u2019ve continued to transport natural gas on our extensive natural gas pipeline systems to the markets that need it most. Our well-positioned assets and connectivity within these customers have enabled us to provide services on our pipelines to meet higher demand during this critical time. When both the Permian and Mid-Continent areas were experiencing a significant reduction of supply due to well freeze-offs ONEOKs more than 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage assets, which are primarily located in the Mid-Continent were able to bridge the supply shortfall by providing natural gas to meet critical needs. Some of the gas provided from storage is owned by ONEOK, which we retain through our transportation contracts and sell as part of our normal course of operations. While these were short-term weather events, our preparedness and our ability to quickly react and adjust services for customers highlights operational flexibility and financial upside in an already financially stable segment. Terry, that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thank you, Kevin. We\u2019re in a good position, both financially and operationally as we\u2019ve begun 2021. And the current market environment is showing positive signs of increased producer activity and increasing demand for our products. As we said many times before, we will remain focused on delivering value to our shareholders in a profitable, safe, and environmentally responsible way. Thank you again to all of our employees for the work you did in 2020 to prepare us for growth in 2021. Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first from Wells Fargo, we have Michael Blum. Michael Blum : Great. Good morning, everybody. Just wanted to go back to just the comment you made earlier about the guidance that you thought, you perhaps trend towards the high end of the guidance range. I just want to make sure I understood that correctly. Is that just based on year-to-date pricing versus what\u2019s baked into your guidance? Are there other factors\u2019 that\u2019s leading maybe is that conclusion? Terry Spencer : Yes. I think \u2013 well, I think your primary \u2013 what you\u2019re looking for right now is what are producers going to do in 2021? And they\u2019re providing us pretty good indications and given the stronger backdrop in the commodity price, prices that we\u2019re seeing, they\u2019re giving us good signals, but it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time for them to commit the rigs and do the things that they\u2019d like to do in response to those prices. So let\u2019s take a little bit of time. Right now, the body language is very good and as Kevin indicated in his comments, it looks really positive. But as we see these prices, now we\u2019ve got crude with a six handle on it. Our producers even further going to increase their activity. And we think that they will. But it\u2019s going to take a little bit of time to sort through that. Kevin, you got anything to. Kevin Burdick : No. I think that, that\u2019s what we\u2019re hearing. The feedback from producers continues to be positive about strengthening activity, given these prices. So we\u2019ll just watch that play out. Terry Spencer : So Michael, I\u2019ll just make a comment. You remember where we were last year at this time. We issued guidance in February and two weeks later, we got hit with a global pandemic. So you might understand, a bit of conservatism here in the guidance that we put forward. But we\u2019re certainly giving you a pretty good body lane and what we think is going to happen in 2021. And we\u2019ll adjust it accordingly. We won\u2019t wait till the end of the year to adjust the guidance. We\u2019ll jump on it pretty quick, if we continue to see the strength that we\u2019re seeing today. Michael Blum : Great. I appreciate that. And then probably a little greedy with this question, but I think historically at this point of the year, you have given kind of like a soft directional guidance for the following year. So in this year would be 2022, you obviously haven\u2019t done that this year. But just some \u2013 based on some of the data that you provide in your own slides, I think you\u2019ve said you can kind of back into that. I think you need kind of low-20s rig count to keep production flat in 2022. So I think we\u2019re right now, we were about 15 rigs in the backend. So if that\u2019s still the right math, and it sounds like based on your prior comments that, you think you\u2019re heading in that direction, but you\u2019re just not sure yet? Terry Spencer : I\u2019ll let Kevin take that question. Kevin Burdick : Michael, I think that \u2013\u2013 I guess I think that the 20 counts probably a little high based on \u2013 now that may hold crude flat, but again, with the rising gas to oil ratios and our ability to continue to capture more and more of the gas that number, is to me, is probably somewhere a little bit less than 20 of rejuvenate. Michael Blum : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Good morning guys. Just wanted to get a follow-up on the 2022 kind of impacts, kind of a two-part hypothetical question here. So given the plan to finish building the Bear Creek 2 plant, all else equal, then I realize in a hypothetical situation or scenario. Is it fair to assume that there will be incremental EBITDA going into 2022 versus kind of where you\u2019re standing with respect to 2021? And then, in terms of how it goes through the plant, but then also when we think about Elk Creek and we think about the heat rate at Northern Border, does the possibility exists that you get incremental recovery of ethane that ends up on to Elk Creek as a result of hitting limits on the Northern Border? Terry Spencer : Yes. So in general, like a Bear Creek first, and yes, you\u2019re thinking about that, right. I mean, I think when we paused it originally we were probably thinking more of the 2022 timeframe, but now that we\u2019re looking at it by the end of this year, that would absolutely add incremental EBITDA into 2022, if we go forward and finish it by the end of the year. So that is absolutely an upside to how we were thinking about 2022 previously. As it relates to Northern Border and potential for ethane, yes, that potential still exist as you see volumes continue to increase in the basin. On the gas side that high BTU gas is going to go into the Northern Border. And so the map just continues to work that the blended content of that, heat content is going to go up, which over time is going to drive the need to pull that back down a little bit. Northern Border proposed the tariffs, forecast him to go back and work with shippers and producers and other stakeholders in the region. Those kinds are understanding \u2013 those conversations are underway at this point. So we\u2019ll watch that for an official tariff that might get filed, that I would expect that process to continue over the coming months. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. And maybe it\u2019s a follow-up to the first questions that were asked. I was just wondering if you can give us a little bit around sensitivities and just clarify one of your responses to Michael\u2019s question. Is there like an EBITDA percent of NGL that we should be thinking about that you can share with us in terms of how we think about modeling? And then just in answering the question about the rigs, you said it was below 20. If I do my math, you needed 25 wells to stay flat per month, when I divide that by two, as I think about two wells per rig that should bring you more to around 13 or 14 rates. I\u2019m just wondering if you can clarify those points. Terry Spencer : Okay. What was your first question again? Sorry. Shneur Gershuni : Just wondering, when I think about changes in NGL prices and impact to changes, and even unless they\u2019re like a 5, 10 change at NGL would equal X amount of dollars in EBITDA, as we sort of think about your guidance range. And then the second part was about how many rigs you need specifically to keep yourself flat versus growing. You said below 20, but it sort of sounds like it would be the low teens if I do my math correctly. Terry Spencer : Okay. So on the first \u2013 and on the just commodity pricing, given how heavy fee-based we are and how much hedged we are, there\u2019s really not as massive or a significant move in pricing just with our \u2013 we\u2019re so fee-based at this point. Yes, with an improving, commodity backdrop, you are going to get pick up a little bit, but it\u2019s not \u2013 we\u2019re not talking about hundreds of millions of dollars there. On the second question, I do believe, I do agree that it\u2019s \u2013 the number of rigs we believe we\u2019ve made is in more of that mid-teens-ish, is what we\u2019re thinking there is we look at that in our owns material, we have kind of a different \u2013 it shows different completion rates and what that would do to our gas production over time. And I think that\u2019s the key. So much is written about, what the basin needs to hold production flat. All that is typically crude oil-based and again, with the strengthening gas to oil ratio is the number of rigs we need to hold gas production flat is quite a bit less than that. But we\u2019ve put that number in the mid-teens. Shneur Gershuni : Great. That makes perfect sense. If I can slip the one last one in. The timeline on the green investments that were mentioned in the prepared remarks, is that something that can happen relatively soon, or do you need some sort of tax incentives to be passed. Is it kind of like a three-year view or is this something that can happen in the next 18 months? Walt Hulse : Yes. It\u2019d be more near term. I mean, we\u2019ve got that is worth thinking about that some of the smaller investments in these projects that Terry mentioned. But as opportunities present themselves on a larger scale, we\u2019ll consider them and with the appropriate return thresholds. Shneur Gershuni : Perfect. Thank you very much. I really appreciate the color today. Operator : We\u2019ll move on to the next question. It\u2019s Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Thanks for taking my question. Maybe if I could start with the fee-based rate for G&P assumed in guidance is $0.95 cents to $1. You came in above that in 4Q and I would think Bakken production only increases while Mid-Con decreases this year. So shouldn\u2019t that support a fee-based rates similar to what we saw in 4Q if not better. So is that just conservatism, and is there a cap on this fee-based rate at some point? Chuck Kelley : Christine, this is Chuck. I\u2019d say when we put our forecast together, we go ahead and we breakdown, what\u2019s the mix of our producer volumes by contract. So as we did that, these different contracts have varying levels of fee as a component of total value. So based on this projected mix of volumes, we feel comfortable in the $0.95 to $1 range. We may have quarters word in fact, exceeds that because the mix may be a little bit different than what we originally assumed. And we\u2019ve seen some of that obviously here in Q4. So you could see some to the upside above the dollar, but we feel pretty confident in the $0.95 to $1 range. Christine Cho : Okay. And then if I could also move on to some of the prepared remarks talk about some tailwinds, which sounds like it\u2019s going to materialize first quarter, or at least first half, you talked about the NGL spreads, providing opportunity for the NGL segment, but then you also talked about, 52 Bcf of storage that you have in the Mid-Con. And you talk about retaining some of that and selling it as part of your normal course of operations. Just to clarify, does that mean you are selling gas into the grid? And if you could also give us some color on, what\u2019s the max deliverability rate on the storage? Like how much gas can you take out of the storage each day? Terry Spencer : Christine, I let Chuck handle that question. Chuck Kelley : So, Christine, the storage is we\u2019re referring to are located in Kansas, Texas, and Oklahoma with the largest of that 52 Bcf, call it, 46 Bcf in Oklahoma, remaining fields in Texas are about another four or five in the balance up in Kansas. So yes, as we transport gas, we do retain some fuel that becomes equity for us. And we have an ongoing normal course of business. We go ahead and we\u2019ll store that gas. We have a sales program portfolio where we look in the forward strip relative to weight cogs as anyone would. And choose our \u2013 how we want to monetize that equity gas. We also keep some gas available, obviously for unexpected situations, market movements and what have you. And we setup each way \u2013 each year this way. So it happens this year, we setup and this event occurred. So we were able to participate in these market prices that you may have seen here in Oklahoma and Texas. And I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll talk more about that in the Q1 earnings call. Christine Cho : And any color on max withdrawal rates? Chuck Kelley : I don\u2019t know if we publicly have provided that in the past, but just generally in Oklahoma, when we\u2019re fully pressurized you could see us withdrawing as high as 1.4 Bcf, 1.5 Bcf a day. Our Texas numbers, obviously the caverns are smaller, so you\u2019re more in that $350 million to $400 million a day again, when they\u2019re pressurized. Christine Cho : Great. Thank you so much. Operator : Next question will come from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Tristan Richardson : Good morning. I appreciate all the commentary around the assumptions for 2021. Just wanted to follow-up on a previous question with respect to rigs in the Rockies, I think just on the range of completions you guys have talked about for the year. Do we need to directionally seen any improvement in rigs from your customers to achieve the range? Or should we think about ranges, that\u2019s a range of outcomes or just the current state of race today? Kevin Burdick : I think the way we look at it again, back to the original remarks, as we\u2019ve talked to our customers and in a lot of these conversations were taking place with crude in the $45 to $50 environment. That\u2019s the activity levels that we kind of have baked in. Very recent conversations with the strengthening of the commodity strip, those conversations are starting to get stronger as far as the amount of activity. So that\u2019s the way, I guess we would think about this in our remarks around the range and Terry\u2019s comments about us trending towards that upper end, if we see the current commodity environment hold because we do believe customers will bring more activity at the current price environment, if it holds. Tristan Richardson : Sure. Thank you. And then just on the CapEx. I think in previous quarters, you guys have talked about $300 million to $400 million a year as a potential kind of new run rate. And can you talk about the current guide and what\u2019s embedded in that. Should we think of that maybe that incremental spend is purely the Bear Creek expansion? Or just at least you bridge that gap between the previous range you guys have talked about hypothetically? Walt Hulse : Sure. So if we just kind of put the $300 million to $400 million discussion in context that was initially made back when crude use, back in the summer, when crude was in the $30s. So even at a $45 to $50 level assumption, you expect a lot more activity, which is built in. So that\u2019s one part. Bear Creek 2, you\u2019re right, yet that\u2019s probably little over $100 million of that number. And then the rest, if you think there\u2019s another $100 million where we\u2019ve found opportunities, for example a compression replacement and expansion project on one of our interstate pipes. That\u2019s not only going to provide additional capacity, more reliability and reduce our emissions footprint. We\u2019re doing some work down on Mont Belvieu to expand our storage position. That\u2019s a good project. We\u2019re also doing some work in Belvieu to expand our distribution network and get more direct connected to a few customers. So those are things, again, none of them by themselves, each one is, $20 million, $30 million, $40 million, but you had three or four of them together and there\u2019s another $100 million. So they\u2019re all good projects, they\u2019re strong return projects. And we found those opportunities. So we\u2019re going to go execute on it. Tristan Richardson : I appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Operator : And moving on, we have Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Good morning. Just wanted to dig into the guide a little bit, is some of the buildup there. When you talked about kind of the potential for increased activity, if current commodity prices hold or these producers more on the public side or the private side? Just trying to get a feeling for who might be increasing activity here? And just curious if the GOR ratio is that continues to improve over time, kind of \u2013 how \u2013 do you have any thoughts quantify as far as how you think that ratio kind of improves over time, that\u2019s at least in your forecast? Terry Spencer : I will let Chuck handle it for both those question. Chuck Kelley : Yes, Jeremy. So to your first question, I\u2019m sorry, I was thinking about the GOR question. Give me your first question one more time, if you don\u2019t mind. Jeremy Tonet : Yes. Just as far as a commodity price is holding, there\u2019s the activity tick up. Is it more from the public or private, larger or smaller, just trying to get a feel for who could be increasing activity here? Chuck Kelley : Sure. No, it\u2019s a combination. I mean, obviously, you\u2019ve seen a couple of the public say that the CapEx position that they said, they\u2019re going to hold that for 2021 pending, some of its dapple, some of it at the time, but they said that we run a $45 to $50 crude environment. So they\u2019re rethinking that a little bit, obviously. But it\u2019s a combination of the large capitalized publics plus some of the privates up there. And then as far as the GOR question, GOR has increased in the past \u2013 just in the past year, a 15% year-over-year. And I think we point out in our slide, 63% since 2016. So pretty significant increases, particularly this last year, seeing that 15%. So when you think about it, they\u2019re rising over time as pressures decline. So more of that trap gas is released relative to crude and producers have confirmed this for us as well. But they think the implied GOR will continue to rise. And I can\u2019t say, it\u2019s at 15% year-over-year, but it\u2019s definitely rising. Terry Spencer : Pretty significant tailwind for us. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just, if I think about the CapEx as you guys outlined there. Does that include Bear Creek right now, or if the current commodity price holds and there\u2019s these upside opportunities, where would you expect kind of CapEx to fall out? If these things come to fruition, as you outlined here, Kevin Burdick : Bear Creek is included in that CapEx number, of the midpoint of $600 million. Terry Spencer : And Jeremy, this is Terry. The only comment I\u2019ll make about that about Bear Creek is way you have to think it. The two-thirds of the capital to complete Bear Creek 2s it\u2019s stuck, it\u2019s equipment, it\u2019s material, it\u2019s a lot of labor and that we incurred that\u2019s on cost. And so this small amount that Kevin is referring to the returns on an incremental investment are huge. And so it makes a lot of sense, given the specifically in Dunn County where we\u2019re seeing this activity, it makes sense to address it. And so I just can\u2019t stress enough how outstanding the economics are, how compelling the economics are in completing that project. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. And so maybe just to clarify, if the upside opportunity emerges, as you said, the CapEx as you budgeted it now kind of covers that being able to service that production, or would CapEx move up a little bit more from here to kind of cover that higher activity level? Terry Spencer : It would just move up. It would just move up just a little bit, because you\u2019re only talking about well connect capital at that point, which is the most efficient capital we spend in the portfolio. Jeremy Tonet : Understood. That\u2019s helpful. Okay, great. Thank you. Terry Spencer : You bet. Operator : All right. Next from the Tudor Pickering Holt & Co., we have Colton Bean. Colton Bean : Good morning. So just circling back to some of the comments on throughput. It looks like for the midpoint of the gathering guide at falls, just below Q4 2020 levels. Can you frame the expected trajectory over the course of the year? Or asked differently, does that assume exit to exit declines or that we\u2019re entering the year a bit softer and then rebounding thereafter? Walt Hulse : Up in the Bakken, we exited 2020 at a very good level, right, at 1.2% range. Of course, here in Q1, you typically see weather and we\u2019ve seen the effects of weather throughout February and back-half of January, primarily February. So if you think about the shape of the volumes throughout the year, Q2 and 3 have always been very strong for us at the beginning of Q4 equally strong December is kind of dicey again for weather. Colton Bean : Got it. And then just sticking on the GMP side, there\u2019s a little bit wider gap between gathered and process volumes in Rockies in Q4. Based on the guide, it looks like that actually closed in 2021. Where you offloading more volumes during the quarter or anything else to point to? Kevin Burdick : I\u2019m sorry. I missed the last part. I couldn\u2019t understand that. Colton Bean : Yes. Just interested if you were potentially offloading some volumes to third-party processing or what drove that gap in the Bakken? And then why exactly that would close over the course of 2021? Kevin Burdick : No. We weren\u2019t offloading. So I\u2019m not \u2013 I just can\u2019t answer what gap you\u2019re referencing because frankly I didn\u2019t see it. There was nothing from a business perspective, there was nothing going on. So it would just be kind of normal course in fluctuation of the gathered versus process. I mean, protect going on, it could have impacted it. Colton Bean : Understood. Yes, it was just a little bit wider than historical, so one of the follow-up. Appreciate it. Operator : All right. Next question will come from Mizuho, we have Gabe Moreen. Gabe Moreen : Good morning, everyone. I just kind of want to follow-up on the events of the last week or two. And I\u2019m just wondering from your perspective, I know it\u2019s early days here, you think there\u2019d be conversations with customers in terms of the guys winterizing assets, clear there\u2019s only so much you can do about well freeze offs, but just wondering in terms of processing plant liability. And then kind of as you look at the portfolio overall, whether it\u2019s gas pipeline capacity coming out of Canada, or whether it\u2019s some of your gas storage assets, where do you think there\u2019ll be some upper pressure, maybe on some of the rates you can charge for those services. Chuck Kelley : Gabe, this is Chuck. In the Williston, obviously we purchased winterize packages for everything. I mean, we\u2019ve got heat tracing equipment in our plants, we\u2019ve purchased Arctic packages for our compression. So this is a normal course of business in the Bakken. We\u2019ve seen minus 30 and our amazing people are still out there running these assets. It\u2019s incredible. And we don\u2019t have very high utilization, very rarely offline. What freezes is the wellheads come on down to Oklahoma and Texas, and frankly, that\u2019s just a value proposition for producers and frankly processors and pipelines. If you go ahead and winterize and spend whatever that percentage extra might be for a small event, and I\u2019d say going forward, people are going to really look at those costs and see if in fact somebody is willing to pay for that service. Kevin Burdick : Gabe, this is Kevin. The only thing I would add is when you think about the last several weeks, our pipeline assets performed incredibly well. I mean, they ran and they were up virtually the entire time and our field folks did a fantastic job, keeping those assets available and reliable, whether it was pipeline, compression, dehydration, all the equipment that we needed to run, they ran virtually uninterrupted. Our processing plants ran extremely well too, even in the mid-continent. Really the only disruptions we had was when power \u2013 when we lost power, which was really, there was \u2013 that we could do about that. But I do think, obviously with all \u2013 there\u2019s been a lot of conversation about how the market should respond and the availability and having storage assets and having pipeline assets. We\u2019re always looking for those opportunities to expand those \u2013 expand that footprint. And we\u2019ll be there if some of the customers need some additional services we can with our integrated assets, we can provide them. Gabe Moreen : Great. Thank you. And then maybe if I could just follow-up sort of on the \u2013 I appreciate the initial DAPL comments in the opening remarks. Just as a follow-up to that, I was wondering how warm or not warm conversations on potentially converting Elk Creek would be with producers. And I don\u2019t recall you ever having put out a CapEx figure on that conversion, is that something you\u2019d be willing to kind of take a stab at? Sheridan Swords : Yes, I think you referred \u2013 Gabe this is Sheridan. I think you are referring conversion to Elk Creek to a crude oil system. Right now we continue to see really good volumes on the NGLs on Elk Creek system that I don\u2019t think a conversion is in the cards at this time. In fact, through this whole February, as Chuck said, that Bakken Basin performed the best out of all the regions on the NGL system, their volume dropped the least amount. And it\u2019s already almost back to pre-winter or pre-storm level at this time. So I think right now we don\u2019t see a case where we\u2019re going to convert Elk Creek to crude oil system, and then talking with the producers up there, a lot of them are securing space on other pipelines in anticipation of a DAPL going down and on rail terminals. And as we talked to the customers, they really don\u2019t see an impact to their volumes if DAPL would go down at this time. Terry Spencer : And Sheridan, they\u2019re hesitant to sign up for long-term capacity to underwrite and then the crude line or this is crude conversion. So I think that\u2019s a factor as well. Sheridan Swords : Yes, that\u2019s the main factor. I mean, they don\u2019t want to sign up for a long-term deal to convert this system when they already have viable outs today. Gabe Moreen : Got it. Thanks, everyone. Operator : Next question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. Good morning. On Slide 10, the wedge that you\u2019re calling the flared gas capture opportunity, what level of flaring would that represent on your acreage if you did capture it all? And is it realistic to capture it all? What do you see as needing to happen for you to get it? Kevin Burdick : Jean, this Kevin. We\u2019ve gotten that question a lot. Clearly, we think we can capture more gas then \u2013 capture some of the gas that\u2019s still flaring. Even with the percentages coming down well into the single digits, we think there\u2019s more room to drive that even lower. A lot of our conversations that we\u2019re having with customers now, especially some of the larger ones, they\u2019d like that number to be zero. Now that ultimately is going to require some \u2013 would require some kind of changes in the way we work together and in the way, some of the equipment on the wellhead is structured. But again, it can be done and we\u2019re encountering those conversations with the customers. In total, does it go to zero? Probably, not. With operational disruptions, et cetera, but we\u2019ve got many customers now working with us, wanting \u2013 just from a variety of perspective, from a value capture, from an emissions perspective just bringing that number as low as we possibly can. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. Thank you. And then Bluestem starting up and energy transfer suggesting they may try to connect some of enables NGL production to their own system. It seems like there may be some challenges to one of the dominant mid-con NGL system. Can you comment on the medium term pressure that you see here and how much it could kind of erode your business? Terry Spencer : Well, what I would say about the energy transfer enabled deal is that in the Mid-Continent, our \u2013 the volumes on our system are tied up under long-term contracts, which had many years left on them. We don\u2019t specifically talk about contract terminations or volumes on the system that we think our contracts right now for the immediate future are very well secured. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. Thank you. Operator : All right. Next we have Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. And thanks for all the clarity on the call today. I just had a clarification \u2013 yes, can you hear me? Terry Spencer : Yes. Sunil Sibal : So my question was on the sensitivity you provided in case the DAPL was shut down sometime in April $50 million for 2021. I was curious, how would you characterize that impact say in 2022, if DAPL were to remain shut down and we were in at $45 to $50 WTI price environment. Terry Spencer : Well, we haven\u2019t gotten into trying to speculate what would happen beyond that. They\u2019re well into the EIS process. I mean, I think we believe that they\u2019ll ultimately be successful, even if it gets shut down that they would get the proper easements and permit approvals. But again, you could maybe do a little extrapolation if you wanted to think about 2022. But again, that\u2019s going to be dependent on if you\u2019re in this type of price environment it\u2019s going to be \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be a big number because again, rail is continues to be very attractive at these commodity prices. Sunil Sibal : Got it. And then on the \u2013 sorry, go ahead. Then my second question was on the Elk Creek expansion that you completed in fourth quarter. I was curious, was there any MVC commitments tied to the season or it\u2019s just the original MVC is kind of a hole for the expanded capacity also? Terry Spencer : I think the answer is expanding Elk Creek to 300,000 did a couple of things for us. And when we mentioned on our calls is that ensures that we can move all our volume off of OBDL on to Elk Creek and still have ample capacity to be able to bring ethane out as the Bakken if that is needed as well, that was the preemptive stuff, why we did the expansion of Elk Creek. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Got it. Thanks. Operator : All right. And then moving on, we have Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thank you for taking my question. Just real quick high level. How are you thinking about the path to de-leveraging and kind of the balance between using incremental cash flows and at the high end of your guidance, your free cash flow positive after the after the dividend it seems. How you\u2019re thinking about allocating cash flow between dividend growth between new growth projects or between paying down debt. Walt Hulse : Well, Mike, what I would say about that is that we always want to make sure that we have \u2013 if we have a good project that is going to serve our customer\u2019s needs, that we\u2019re going to make that investment. As Kevin mentioned, we\u2019ve got smaller projects here that we\u2019re kind of adding to our system around. We don\u2019t have any larger capital plans on the horizon in the near future. It\u2019s really more additive to our existing system. So you\u2019re going to see the bulk of that free cash flow go to debt reduction here in the near-term and our de-leveraging plan is right on track. And these commodity prices hold at this level it\u2019s to do nothing but accelerate. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Walt Hulse : Thanks, Mike. Operator : All right. And everyone looks like our last question is going to come from Derek Walker with Bank of America. Derek Walker : Hi, guys. Can you hear me? Walt Hulse : Yes. Derek Walker : Got it. Yes, just on the levered one. Just wanted to \u2013 what\u2019s your confidence in kind of hitting the 4 times versus the 3.5 times, I was going to kind of get into that 3.5 number. Is it more growth \u2013 incremental growth projects? Is it just the operating leverage you have in your existing systems? Just any color you can provide there would be helpful. Walt Hulse : Well, I think that what\u2019s going to take us to 3.5 and 4 is definitely going to be the continued growth that we see on our system that obviously is going to produce cash flow and help us from a debt reduction standpoint. So we\u2019ll try to do it from both sides of the coin. But it\u2019s the continued growth that we see on our system over time. And the fact that we have so much headroom within our asset base, these pipes have lots of capacity, so that we\u2019ve got great operating leverage going forward. Derek Walker : Got it. And then maybe just one on the mid-continent talks about, I think pretty well connected this year with potential, I think you talked about some customers\u2019 actually adding activity. Do you see that kind of plateauing into 2022 or how do you kind of think about the mid-continent kind of coming out of 2021? Kevin Burdick : From a well connect and activity perspective and I think as we move through 2021, we\u2019ve had a lot of conversation about that. As you move into 2022, it\u2019s going to be a function of commodity price. I mean, if we\u2019re still sitting in this, if you\u2019re still sitting in a $55 million to $60 million type environment then you\u2019re going to see an increase in activity. And I believe that activity will sustain. There\u2019s a lot of drilling locations up there left, a lot of inventory debt and I think you\u2019ll see that sustained through 2022. Terry Spencer : Kevin, it\u2019s not all just about crude price. I mean, obviously NGLs and natural gas are a big driver for the activity up there. And you\u2019ve seen stronger natural gas prices, particularly as we come through the polar vortex as we come out the other side of this thing, I think fundamentally \u2013 the fundamental backdrop is we\u2019re going to see a higher values for nat gas and certainly for liquid. So those will also be important drivers for producers, particularly in Oklahoma. Derek Walker : Got it. And then maybe last one for me. Yes, definitely I think recovery, I think in guide [indiscernible] Williston, I think some in mid-con, but kind of mentioned there could be some volatility. So I guess, how do you think about the ethane recovery throughout the year? Terry Spencer : Well, what we see for the ethane recovery in the mid-continent we do feel we\u2019ll see some ethane recovery this year probably maybe a little bit more in the second half of the year. Obviously, what we see now is in February, a lot of the petrochemical facilities have gone offline due to loss of power and gas. So in February, we did see a lot of ethane rejection across our system. Ironically, even as we come out the other side and the drop of gas prices today, we are starting to see an increased amount of ethane recovery in the mid-continent. But we do think throughout this year, it will be a little lumpy, which more weighted towards the back half of the year. The fundamentals for the petrochemical industry are very good right now, as we see the price of propylene and ethylene very high. And as these plants come back, get it back on, they\u2019re going to run at very high rates. So we think we\u2019ll see more ethane recovery potentially in the first half of the year, which would drive us more to the upside of our guidance. Kevin Burdick : So complete recovery from the hurricane impact like last year, we\u2019re through all that. Terry Spencer : We\u2019re through all that piece and now just got to get them back up after the storm. Derek Walker : Great. I appreciate it, guys. Thanks for the time. Operator : All right. And everyone that looks like that\u2019ll conclude our Q&A session today. I\u2019d like to turn the floor back to Andrew for any additional or closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Okay. Thank you, Greg. Our quiet period for the first quarter of 2021 starts when we close our books in April and extends until we release earnings in later April. We\u2019ll provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and have a good week. Operator : And once again, folks, that does conclude our call for today. We do appreciate you joining us. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead sir. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you, Travis and welcome to ONEOK's first quarter 2021 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. A reminder that statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Our first speaker this morning is Terry Spencer, President and Chief Executive Officer. Terry? Terry Spencer : Thank you, Andrew. Good morning and thank you all for joining us today. As always, we appreciate your continued trust and investment in ONEOK. Joining me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. ONEOK's solid first quarter results are providing positive momentum as we enter warmer operating months. Volumes on our system and our outlook for the year continues to improve supporting the increase to our financial guidance, which we announced yesterday. Even without the weather-related earnings impact in the first quarter, our base business earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter. But while the quarter's results were positive, winter storm Uri did provide us with significant operational challenges that I want to highlight. Our employees' preparation before the extreme weather event and hard work during it enabled us to operate with very few interruptions. Operations teams ensured our assets were weatherized for extreme conditions and that our employees were on-site and prepared to make the necessary adjustments to keep our assets running. Many of our employees were faced with challenges of their own, including limited or no heat, running water or electricity at their own homes, but still worked to help ONEOK provide essential natural gas and NGLs when needed most. Despite these extraordinary winter -- weather conditions, we continued to meet the critical needs of our customers, including natural gas utilities and electric power plants. Our natural gas pipeline and storage assets were particularly well-positioned to address the needs for natural gas. The segment's ability to continue providing reliable service helps meet increased natural gas demand and contributed to higher adjusted EBITDA during the quarter. Kevin will provide more details in a moment. Despite weather-related volume impacts across our operations, strength in our base business was evident in our Rocky Mountain region NGL and natural gas volumes during the quarter. The Williston Basin continues to outperform expectations and provide us with solid and stable earnings. As I've said before, ONEOK's earnings growth in 2021 is not dependent on increased rig activity or increasing commodity prices. The opportunities available to us are from a robust drilled, but uncompleted well inventory, increased natural gas capture and rising gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand. The opportunity for earnings growth without the need for significant investment is unique to ONEOK and our strategic assets in key operating areas. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we raised expectations for 2021 and now expect adjusted EBITDA growth of more than 17% compared with 2020. Our higher guidance expectations include the latest producer forecasts and drilling plans and our earnings range also includes the potential impact from a shutdown of the Dakota access pipeline. Increasing producer activity, higher commodity prices and strengthening energy markets have further enhanced our view of 2021 and are setting up to provide positive momentum as we exit the year. As we look toward 2022, high single to low double-digit growth in EBITDA appears reasonable in the $50 to $70 per barrel price range, when you adjust 2021 for the approximately $90 million weather impact to revised guidance. We also continue to look for opportunities outside of our traditional growth drivers to enhance our businesses. Our sustainability and renewables teams continue to actively research opportunities that will complement our extensive midstream assets and expertise. They're focusing on opportunities to lower our greenhouse gas emissions, while enhancing profitability, further strengthening the vital role we expect to play in a low-carbon economy. Opportunities under evaluation include the further electrification of compression assets, potential carbon capture and storage projects, sourcing renewable energy for operations and other longer term investments such as hydrogen transportation and storage. And as always, we'll remain disciplined in our capital approach as we develop these opportunities. Demand for the products we transport remain strong. The pandemic and recent weather events have further highlighted the importance of natural gas NGLs and the many end-use products they help create, which all play a vital role in helping us to lead safer and healthier lives. Our ability to transport these products safely and responsibly to markets is key to their ultimate end use. This quarter once again proved our ability to do that even in the most extreme conditions. With that, I will turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance and updated 2021 guidance. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Terry. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2021 net income and earnings per share guidance 10% and adjusted EBITDA guidance 5% compared with our original expectations provided in late February. We now expect a net income midpoint of $1.35 billion or $3.02 per share and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $3.2 billion this year. At the segment level, we increased 2021 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas pipeline segments, primarily due to increasing producer activity from higher commodity prices and incorporating the results of the first quarter. Adjusted EBITDA guidance for the natural gas liquids segment decreased slightly, primarily due to reduced volumes and lower ethane demand in the first quarter related to Winter Storm Uri. Total capital expenditures for 2021 including growth and maintenance capital remain unchanged from our original expectations of $525 million to $675 million, a more than 70% decrease compared with 2020. This range includes capital to complete the Bear Creek plant expansion and associated field infrastructure in the fourth quarter of this year and a low-cost expansion of the Arbuckle II pipeline in the second quarter. Now a brief overview of our first quarter financial performance. ONEOK's first quarter 2021 net income totaled $386 million or $0.86 per share. First quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $866 million, a 24% increase year-over-year and a 17% increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2020. Distributable cash flow was more than $660 million in the first quarter, a 27% increase year-over-year and a 28% increase compared with the fourth quarter 2020. First quarter dividend coverage was nearly 1.6 times and we generated more than $245 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our March 31, net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.98 times compared with 4.6 times at the end of 2020. We ended the quarter -- the first quarter with no borrowings on our $2.5 billion credit facility and more than $400 million of cash. Earlier this month, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis unchanged from the previous quarter. Healthy earnings in the first quarter provided momentum for 2021 and helped to accelerate our deleveraging efforts. As Terry mentioned, increasing producer activity, ample capacity on our systems and the continued opportunity for flared gas capture and strong gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and increasing ethane demand continue to support our base business and increase financial expectations this year. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a closer look at our operations. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Winter Storm Uri impacted operations across all three of our business segments in February. Reduced volumes due to well freeze-offs, especially in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions increased electricity cost and customer facility outages presented challenges during the quarter. However, our ability to meet increased demand for natural gas and NGLs during the period helped to more than offset the volume impacts. Volumes across our operations returned quickly following the extreme weather with NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region in March, exceeding our first quarter 2021 averages. Let's take a closer look at each of our businesses, starting with the Natural Gas Pipelines segment. The safe and reliable operations of our pipeline and storage assets through the storm provided critical transportation services and storage withdrawals for our customers. In addition, we sold 5.2 Bcf of natural gas, which we previously held in inventory into the market in the first quarter 2021 to help meet the increased demand. This compares with 1.2 Bcf that we sold in the first quarter of 2020. Our ability to provide reliable service throughout the extreme weather conditions highlights the importance of market-connected pipelines and storage assets and the value of these vital services. Since the storm, we've received increased interest from customers seeking additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system. This morning we initiated an open season for more than one Bcf of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, first quarter 2021 earnings increased compared with the fourth quarter of 2020, despite the volume impact from Winter Storm Uri. System-wide volumes were reduced by an average of approximately 64,000 barrels per day during the quarter with the largest impacts in the Mid-Continent and Gulf Coast Permian regions. During the first quarter, increased optimization and marketing activities in the segment related primarily to higher commodity prices and wider spreads between Conway and Mont Belvieu prices, presented opportunities to utilize our integrated NGL pipeline and storage assets to meet market needs, helping to partially offset volume and cost-related impacts. First quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 4% compared with the fourth quarter of 2020 and 20% year-over-year, despite an 11,000 barrel per day impact from Winter Storm Uri. As we sit today, volumes from the region have reached more than 300,000 barrels per day. During the quarter, ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the fourth quarter 2020 as we incented some ethane recovery, which we have talked about in the past. On a short-term basis, we were able to incent recovery by purchasing ethane at several gas plants at a premium value to natural gas, selling it into the Mont Belvieu ethane market and collecting the difference while increasing producer netbacks and NGL volumes on our system. Continued ethane recovery from the region will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing and is not included in our updated guidance. Economics in the Mid-Continent region also provided the opportunity to incentivize ethane recovery and we continue to expect partial recovery in the region throughout the remainder of the year, which is included in our guidance. In the Permian Basin, we saw increased ethane rejection in the first quarter. Overall, petrochemical facility outages related to Winter Storm Uri, reduced demand for ethane during the quarter. We expect ethane recovery in the Permian Basin to continue ramping back up, as petrochemical demand returns, following February storm impacts, with a return to near full recovery in the second half of 2021. Discretionary ethane that can be recovered on our system in both the Mid-Continent and Rocky Mountain regions remains approximately 100,000 barrels per day. In the Rockies region, full recovery would provide an opportunity for $400 million in an annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. Our opportunity for recovery in either region at any given time will fluctuate, based on regional natural gas pricing, ethane economics and potential incentivized recovery. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, first quarter processed volumes increased 5% year-over-year, despite colder-than-normal weather in February. In March, volumes exceeded 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, a level we can maintain even without increased producer activity. Our ability to capture additional flared gas, rising gas to oil ratios and a large inventory of drilled, but uncompleted wells on our acreage are the key drivers of our 2021 volume expectations. Recent producer M&A activity in the Williston Basin has highlighted new drilling plans on acreage that in some cases may not have been developed in the near term, but now likely will be. And indications from several of our producers in the basin, point to increasing activity in the second half of 2021, particularly in Dunn County. In response to this, we've resumed construction on our Bear Creek processing plant expansion and expect it to be complete in the fourth quarter of this year. Once complete, we will have approximately 1.7 Bcf per day of processing capacity in the basin and we'll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital, as producer activity levels increase. In the first quarter, we connected 38 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and expect to connect more than 300 this year. Based on very recent producers completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second and third quarter, as completion activity picks up with improved weather. There are currently 16 rigs operating in the basin, with eight on our dedicated acreage, and there continues to be a large inventory of drilled, but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin-wide and approximately 350 on our dedicated acreage. With eight completion crews currently operating in the basin, no additional activity or crews are needed to hold natural gas production flat on our acreage or reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance. As the current DUC inventory gets worked down, we expect producers to bring rigs back to the basin to replenish the inventory levels, providing tailwinds as we move into 2022. Additionally, as of February, approximately 100 million cubic feet per day of natural gas flaring remained on our dedicated acreage, presenting a continued opportunity for us to bring this volume onto our system and help further reduce flaring in the basin. The gathering and processing segment's average fee rate remained $1.04 per MMBtu during the quarter, unchanged from the fourth quarter 2020. Winter Storm Uri reduced Mid-Continent volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter, causing the average fee rate mix to shift more towards the Rocky Mountain volumes, driving the higher average rate. We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average close to the high end of our $0.95 to $1 per MMBtu guidance range. The segment's 2021 guidance does not assume increasing producer activity levels in the Mid-Continent region or the Powder River Basin. However, both areas have received attention, as commodity prices have strengthened. Any increasing activity in those areas would be an added tailwind to our 2021 expectations and provide volume momentum into 2022. Terry that concludes my remarks. Terry Spencer : Thanks Kevin. Good overview of a challenging, but encouraging quarter that has positioned us well for the rest of 2021. With volumes trending upward and strength in our base business, our outlook continues to improve. But we remain disciplined in our approach and focus on what matters most for the long-term sustainability of our business. Enhancing our financial stability, participating in the innovation necessary for a transition to a low-carbon economy and serving our customers' needs safely and responsibly continue to be our focus. The first quarter showcased many of these focus areas and we have many more great things to look forward to in the remainder of this year and beyond. Thank you to our employees for all that you have done this quarter and over the past year to focus on customer needs and continue operating safely and responsibly. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. Terry Spencer : Good morning, Michael. Michael Blum : A couple of questions for me. One, the T&F rate out of the Bakken I mean it's not a big deal, but it did fall by $0.01 versus last quarter to $0.27 from $0.28. Just wanted to know if that was -- that has anything to do with the ethane recovery incentivized -- incentivization program? Or is there something else there that we should be thinking about? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. You're right. The tick down in the average rate was due to the amount of ethane that we incentivized to come out of the Bakken and the lower rate that was received for those barrels. Michael Blum : Great. And then second question I apologize if I missed this, how many rigs are running on your acreage today in the Bakken? Chuck Kelley : Michael this is Chuck. We've got eight of the 16 rigs in the basin on our acreage today. Michael Blum : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Jeremy Tonet, JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : Hey, good morning guys. This is James [ph] on for Jeremy. Maybe just wanted to start here on the Bakken outlook. You mentioned the 350 DUCs on the acreage and the unchanged G&P completion guidance here. So maybe just looking out into where you see the DUC inventory by year-end? And also just cadence for completion activity in the remainder of the year, you mentioned 2Q and 3Q you expect to see a ramp, but is it safe to kind of assume with only 38 wells completed in the first quarter maybe an average out for the remaining quarters here to meet the well completion guide? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin here James. The -- yes absolutely. Like we said in the remarks, we expect a significant increase in the completions. Chuck and his team these conversations we're having with producers are literally days and just a couple of weeks old. And we anticipate a pretty sizable step-up in Q2 and Q3. Q4 is always a little dependent on the weather as you think about that, but we still feel really good about our 300 guidance. So yes it would need -- we'll see a pickup in the summer. Chuck Kelley : And James this is Chuck. What I would add to what Kevin said is, we completed the 38 in Q1 but a lot of that planning was done back in Q4 and a lot of the producers still had some uncertainty over stability of crude pricing what was DAPL going to do. So we didn't anticipate Q1 will be strong. But as Kevin said, the ramp is extremely good starting here in Q2, we're already seeing it and certainly into Q3 and these are recent conversations. Unidentified Analyst : Sounds good. I appreciate the color there. And then ESG is, obviously, topical with emissions these days. And maybe just looking across your nat gas pipeline footprint, have you guys looked at opportunities there to reduce carbon emissions? And what maybe is that project set? And if you have -- have you guys allocated a set dollar amount there yet? Or are you still kind of in the initial stages there? Terry Spencer : Yes, James, this is Terry. So certainly, we have remained very focused over the years and in particular in the last couple of years reducing our emissions impact across our asset footprint not just in natural gas, but in liquids as well. And so that remains a key focus for us. The types of things that we're looking at that -- can be big needle movers in terms of reducing our greenhouse gas emissions, things like electrification of compression, natural gas-fired compression being converted to electrics, which then can consume or be in a position to consume renewable power. That's a key focus. We have done some of that. We've got a lot of electric compression operating today, particularly, in the Williston Basin. But we also have some big units down in Oklahoma. So we know how to do it and we expect to continue to steadily increase our fleet of electric compression. So that's a key focus. And obviously the renewables team is working on a lot of other things on the energy transition front taking advantage of our skill set and taking advantage of the pipeline processing capability or expertise that we have. So that's kind of it in a nutshell. Kevin, anything you can add to that? Kevin Burdick : No. Terry Spencer : I guess as far as capital, yes, we have allocated some capital not just on the compression front, but also we're doing some work on the carbon sequestration front as well. So we've allocated some meaningful capital there. It's not a huge amount of capital as we're just getting started in this. But as we move forward, we expect that capital to pick up. I think the key emphasis is that projects that we work on or that we're considering in the sustainable -- area of sustainability they've got to make economic sense. They've got to generate a return a reasonable return. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. That makes sense. I appreciate that. Just last one for me if I can sneak one in. Do you guys have a number you can share or just color you can share on where you see gas/oil ratios trending post 2021? I know, you mentioned higher, but is there any more detail you can share there? Kevin Burdick : No. I think the thing to do is I just go back over the time. We provide the information of the trend that's happened over the last -- what is it 70-plus percent over the last four years or something like that. And we have no reason to believe that's going to taper off. Chuck Kelley : Yes, it's increased over 15% just here in the past year. You can see that in our chart. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Thanks for questions. I will leave it there. Chuck Kelley : Thanks, James. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Shneur Gershuni, UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Thanks for taking our questions today. Just -- Terry I just kind of wanted to focus on some of your prepared remarks that you made around momentum building towards the end of the year. And that ex-storm you're, sort of, intimating that 2022 can grow by high single-digits or low double-digit. I guess, kind of, back of the envelope that sounds like about $3.4 billion. I was wondering if you can talk about the momentum a little bit. And in the answers to your previous questions you have talked about the completions towards the end of the year and so forth. So kind of understand the cadence with respect to 2021. But how have the conversations changed with producers with oil now in the 60s for some time? Like how they evolve since February? Is that where some of the momentum is coming from? Or is it strictly related to gas/oil recoveries and NGL recoveries? Terry Spencer : Well, Shneur, Kevin in his remarks, he mentions momentum. He uses that word. Because he used that word I'm going to let him answer that question. Kevin Burdick : Thanks, Terry. No, Shneur it's all the things that you mentioned. Conversations with customers not just our G&P customers, but as Sheridan and his team work with their customers across all the basins. It's just that we anticipate increasing activity. We've seen prices stabilize here appear at a nice level. Clearly, that can generate fantastic returns in most every basin we're in. The gas to oil ratio increasing in the Bakken gives us more confidence that you're going to continue to see those volumes tick up. So there's just a lot of factors that go into that. And I think a key -- as we have conversations with the producers particularly in the Bakken, the note is as they're going to work the DUC inventory, I know a lot's been written about well where are the rigs? Well, they're going to work their DUC inventory down first, and then as that declines and it gets back to more of a normalized rate then we'll probably see and we expect to see rigs come back based on our conversations with them. So all those reasons are why we think in the back half of the year, you will see an increase and a tick up not necessarily in completion crews but in rigs. And that will provide the momentum as we go into 2022. Terry Spencer : The only thing, I'd add to Kevin's remarks is just when you just think about the worldwide recovery from the pandemic certainly that's providing a lot of momentum to us. And we see it not just in the commodity prices that are relatively strong, but also we're seeing it in pet chem demand. And we've got hammered -- the pet chem space got hammered here in the Gulf Coast, obviously, due to weather. But we've seen that pick back up and those operation's restore. We're also seeing new petrochemical plants being built across the global space. So, pet chem demand showing no signs of letting up and certainly that's why ethane is a big part of our story. And certainly, it's a big part of our story as we think about 2022 and beyond. Shneur Gershuni : I really appreciate the color there. I was wondering, if we can also expand on the conversation from the prepared remarks about ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountains. You sort of described how you were purchasing in a premium selling in Mont Belvieu. And I think you stated that the potential from this is not currently in your guidance today. I was just wondering, if you can walk us through this? Obviously, you're providing incentives so it would be less than the 400 million that you kind of outlined as the upside potential, but are you -- is it kind of like a day-to-day decision where this is occurring? Or are you signing some more smaller term contracts in the three, six, nine, or 12-month nature? I'm just trying to understand, whether it's day-to-day or could there be some momentum on some smaller term type contract deals? Sheridan Swords : Shneur, this is Sheridan. We are doing this day-to-day to be able to capture the most spread between the markets. So we saw that in February, where the price of gas spiked really high then we shut down the incentive program and did not buy ethane out during that period of time. So it really is a day-to-day decision that, we can make. So we're looking at both the regional gas price in the Bakken and the price of ethane in Mont Belvieu to make those decisions. And we didn't bring out the whole 100,000. We only brought out a small portion of ethane during this period of time. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. Are any of the producers interested in doing some smaller term deals at all? Or is this just going to continue to be a day-to-day decision? Sheridan Swords : Really right now as we see it we think we are better served by doing it day-to-day instead of -- because we get to capture the full -- we get to capture the spread for what we buy it on the gas price and what we sell it for ethane. If we lock in a longer term, we'd have to lock in that spread and we think that that spread is going to continue to widen. So we'd rather do it on a day-to-day basis at this time. Shneur Gershuni : All right. Perfect. Thank you very much guys. Really appreciate the color today. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Cho, Barclays. Christine Cho : Thank you. I actually wanted to also touch upon the 2022 comments. Is there any more color you can provide on the different basins? Like, what your -- what you're thinking about growth in the Bakken versus Mid-Con versus Permian? Just kind of in context of how you guys say that you're not anticipating an increased activity in the Mid-Con in 2021 results, but curious how that and the Permian looks for 2022 especially in a $50 to $70 price environment? Kevin Burdick : Christine, this is Kevin. I mean, we're not going to provide a lot more color at this point because it's an outlook. But clearly, when you look at our footprint, we feel pretty strong about the Bakken. We think there's going to be growth there. We've got a good -- great position in the Permian. We've seen activity levels pick up there as well. And -- but no I don't think, it's going to -- from a Mid-Continent perspective, it's -- we don't have a lot of growth baked in to that basin. Christine Cho : Okay. And then, I wanted to also touch upon Bear Creek. I know in your prepared remarks you talked about Dunn County seeing a lot of activity. And I know there have been some big wells there. And I know that, you have a plant there but is that full already? Or are the producers currently flaring the gas there or building a DUC inventory? I just wasn't sure if you were able to move those volumes to be processed at your other plants in McKenzie if necessary? Kevin Burdick : No. Christine, this is Kevin. We've talked about that plan. When we built the first one there, that was geographically more isolated than our other facilities. So we have a small amount of ability to move gas around to other plants. But effectively that plant is near full at this point. But producers are working closely with us to align their timing to the timing of when our infrastructure not just the plant but also some of the field infrastructure necessary to gather the gas to get it to the plant. So we've mentioned the four large producers down there in Continental in Marathon in ConocoPhillips and XTO, large acreage positions and they are coordinating with us extremely closely on the timing, so that we don't flare gas down there. Christine Cho : So should we expect like kind of a stair-step, in volumes when that plant comes on? Or is it still going to be more a slow ramp? Kevin Burdick : I think the way a lot of the developments occurring nowadays is it will be a little lumpy, I mean as they bring on pads. But yes, you're not going to see some massive step change the day the plant comes up. Because again, producers we all are extremely concerned and want to reduce flaring as much as possible. And so the coordination among us and our customers is very tight on the timing of when the capacity will be available. Christine Cho : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis, Cr\u00e9dit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : Hey, morning guys. Two questions for you on CapEx, first one just thinking about Bear Creek II being official now. I think that was already contemplated in the original CapEx range. So, just curious does that sort of push you up towards the higher end of the range? And if not, what are the drivers that would actually get you to that high point? Kevin Burdick : Spiro, this is Kevin. Yes. The Bear Creek facility and the related field infrastructure is included in that forecast. The things that would get you to the higher end is really more activity. I mean if you look at that CapEx, you've got our maintenance cap which is pretty static. And then, the rest of it is Bear Creek II and routine growth, which are things like well connects and some small projects in the other segments. And so to the extent, we see increased activity and that comes sooner. And we would need some more kind of that standard high-return well connect capital. That's what would take you towards the higher end. The rest of it is just going to be timing as far as how the capital is spent over the course of the year. Spiro Dounis : Got it. That's helpful. Sticking with CapEx it sounds like a lot of the growth you guys are contemplating in 2022, won't require CapEx. It sounds like very much a continuation of a lot of the trends you're seeing in 2021. So I guess, as we think about the trajectory into next year for CapEx, is it fair to assume more or less in line with 2021 if not maybe even below these levels? Kevin Burdick : Yes. The key thing to me about our capital spend as we look forward is the available capacity or the operating leverage, we have across our assets. We referenced in our remarks, about the capacity we'll have in the Bakken from a processing perspective. We recently completed an expansion on Elk Creek to bring it up to 300,000 barrels a day. And we've still got the legacy Bakken NGL line, combined with OPPL that we could always use. We talked about the minor expansion on Arbuckle II. We've got capacity in West Texas. So we can grow our EBITDA without a significant uptick in capital. So yes, you're probably going to think of it more in lines of 2021, if you're talking about 2022 more in line of that versus we're not going to have to add another long-haul pipeline or something like that. Terry Spencer : I think Kevin that's a good point. Spiro, let's hang on with me for a second. I mean that segues into an important point to make that with this excess capacity that we have available the fact that all of this infrastructure is pretty well in place for the next three or four years without any sort of major backbone type transmission project needing to be built in the NGL space. I mean you could see this business from an EBITDA perspective hit a $4 billion type of number in the right pricing environment without having to expend a heck of a lot of capital. So -- I mean I think that expands on that headroom concept or that available capacity concept that we keep trying to express to the market to understand about our business that we built a lot of that major infrastructure is already in place and the rest of this stuff is smaller routine growth. So -- and that's what puts us in a position. In the right pricing environment, right activity levels, I mean we could see a $4 billion kind of EBITDA number here. Spiro Dounis : Okay, appreciate those comments Terry. Thanks Kevin. Kevin Burdick : Sure. Operator : Our next question comes from Tristan Richardson, Trust Securities. Tristan Richardson : Hey, good morning guys. I really appreciate all the commentary on completion activity and what you're seeing -- thinking about for 2022. Just on 2022, as you see -- start to see well connects accelerate throughout the year, should we think of 1022 as a kind of well above that 300 well connects type of mark that you're talking about for 2021? And you noted potential for rig additions. Are rig additions something we could see as early as the second half? Or is this more of a -- based on conversations that you're having this is an exiting the year type of event? Chuck Kelley : Tristan this is Chuck. I'd say that the rig activity we anticipate certainly would start to -- you would start to see rigs showing up here toward the end of spring and the beginning of summer. It's definitely a second half activity. As Kevin referenced earlier, our producers have told us that they're going to work through their DUC inventory first then bring the rigs in like they traditionally do midyear and ramp that up. And with -- we've got one good indicator up there right now. We've gone from two to eight completion crews in the basin. And you think about completion crews and the well connects that we have for the balance of the year; we're pretty excited about hitting that 300-plus number. And as we look into next year, certainly see no less than that obviously. So, without really getting into 2022 specifics, we think we're going to have a lot of tailwinds behind us this year and going into next year. Tristan Richardson : That's helpful. And then just a clarification question. Kevin I wanted to go to your $400 million in EBITDA comment with respect to ethane. Is that sort of the potential opportunity in a full rejection to full recovery scenario? Or is that sort of where you're at today moving to full recovery? Kevin Burdick : No, that's just -- we provided the information previously that ever 25,000 barrels a day of volume coming out of the Rockies is worth about $100 million of EBITDA. So, that's just doing the math there of 100,000 barrels a day of ethane if it all came online at full rates would be worth $400 million of EBITDA a year. Tristan Richardson : Okay, great. Super helpful. Thank you guys very much. Appreciate it. Kevin Burdick : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury, Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi, good morning. I have two questions that may actually be the same question. But the first one is about on slide 10, it looks like February flaring ticked up a bit from the declining trend that we had seen in prior months. Was that a one-off due to weather or some other reason? Or does it suggest that we're hitting a gas constraint somewhere and that flaring could creep up more? Chuck Kelley : Yes, Jean Ann, this is Chuck. That was pretty much due to weather and then a little bit of drilling in some areas that are a little hard to get to right now, but it is not -- it's not an indication of increased flaring forthcoming in the basin. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. Cool. Then I guess my questions are different. My second question was also about the incented ethane from the first quarter. Was that that there were sort of some temporary gas blowouts in the basin or something more structural like gas basis is like gradually widening there? It's hard to tell because northern border kind of takes some from the Bakken and some from Canada. But is this sort of the fact that now it's in the money for you to do and before it wasn't suggest something structural is changing in terms of gas takeaway getting limited? Sheridan Swords : Jean-Ann, this is Sheridan. No, I don't think it has anything to do with gas limited takeaway. What has to do with is we're seeing strength in ethane demand on the Gulf Coast and we saw a spread between gas in the Bakken and ethane prices on the Gulf Coast that we want to take advantage of. And we continue to see that grow especially now as we head into May, we're seeing a lot of increased demand for ethane in the Gulf Coast from our assets down there, probably as strong as we've seen in the last three or four years going into May. Jean Ann Salisbury : Perfect. That's all for me. Thanks. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Shere, Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. Congratulations on the good quarter. Terry Spencer : Thanks, Craig. Craig Shere : Trying to understand better the roughly 10% year-over-year 2022 EBITDA uplift outlook. If I understand correctly, the 2021 updated guidance includes up to $50 million of headwind on adaptable shutdown. What if anything are you incorporating into 2022 when you say maybe roughly 10% uplift for DAPL? And then if I understand correctly the answer to Tristan's question, while you're assuming a recovery in rig counts to fill in the DUCs, there is no assumption in your 2022 outlook for an increasing frac crew deployment. Is that correct? Kevin Burdick : Craig, I think there's a couple of things in there. One you referenced DAPL. If you think about we've talked previously about the impact we believe to DAPL at this point and talking to our customers is quite small. Given the time that's now passed, we're well into the year, and the pipeline is still operating, and there's still not a clear path of what's going to happen to it. The EIS is supposed to be complete by the, I think, March of 2022. So even in the scenario where it would get shut down, I don't know that there's that much impact to 2022 as everybody believes that process is going to -- will ultimately get the permit. So from that standpoint that's how we're thinking about DAPL. Just -- and on the rig counts, we kind of answered that previously that we absolutely believe there will be an uptick in rigs and activity levels in the second half of this year, as to what that exactly looks like as we move into 2022 that remains to be seen and that's why the range is provided. Terry Spencer : And Craig, we wouldn't have said it if we didn't have visibility to it. You know us too well. Craig Shere : Absolutely. I guess, I'm trying to get at if you're kind of saying that you expect at least maybe 300 well connects next year that doesn't sound like it's -- that comments assuming any healthy uptick in frac crews. Rig counts to fill in the DUCs, yes. But if we get another two or three frac crews that could add to what you're talking about. Is that correct? Terry Spencer : Yes. Craig Shere : Great. And one other question. Can you elaborate on prospects for realized Permian pricing to ramp with increasing bundled NGL services? Kevin Burdick : Craig, could you repeat that? We didn't get it here. Craig Shere : Just your Permian realized NGL pricing is lower, because there's still a lot of legacy just transport only, and trying to get a sense for the outlook of being able to switch to more and more integrated services that will give a higher bundled rate. Sheridan Swords : Well, what I -- this is Sheridan. What I would say is that I don't see a whole lot of uplift in that average rate. One is we are seeing a lot of pressure on rates for new volume out in the Permian that's out there right now that's putting pressure on that. So our legacy volumes are going to be where they're at, because they're on long-term contracts. But I think as we bring new volumes on they will be at a lower rate. So I don't see a whole lot of uptick in the average rate on the West Texas system. Craig Shere : What about the ability to combine the transport on West Texas with fractionation to get higher all-in pricing? Sheridan Swords : Well, right now we've seen sometimes there's been some new rates done, that is basically at our average rate today for both transportation and fractionation. Craig Shere : Really. Okay. Thank you very much. Operator : Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal, Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. Good morning, guys. And thanks for all the color. My first question was related to your comments previously regarding how you're looking at clean energy investments. I think you referred that you're going to hold those projects to same kind of economic returns. Now most of the recent projects you did on NGL pipelines, et cetera, were more like 4x to 5x EBITDA multiples. So I was just curious when you think about these new investments risk versus reward, how should we be kind of thinking about any incremental investments in that area, especially if you look at CCS and all those kind of technologies? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. I mean, as Terry mentioned earlier, as we evaluate these projects, we are going to maintain our financial discipline, our economic thinking and the return standards that we have. Does that mean it's a four times project like some of our others, probably not. But is it going to earn a reasonable return? Yes, we believe they will. So, we will definitely -- if we're spending capital, we're going to be looking for a return on that capital. Sunil Sibal : Understood. Any clarity on time line on those decisions on those evaluations? Kevin Burdick : We are -- our team is working it hard. I mean, there is a lot of opportunities out there and we are evaluating them to look and see how they fit with our footprint, with our capabilities and the need for us to get involved and the opportunities. So, we're not going to rush it. It's important to us. We're working hard at it, but it's not something we're going to do just to say we've got a project. We're going to again make sure, it's the right strategic and financial fit for us. Sunil Sibal : Understood. And then I had one kind of book-keeping question with regard to the act on recovery. So, those margin uptick, does that show up mainly in the gas G&P segment or should we expect that in the NGL segment? The reason I ask is, I noticed that with this guidance update you moved up the G&P segment guidance EBITDA whereas the NGL segment EBITDA guidance has moved down a little bit. Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. You will see the uptick from incentivized ethane showing up in the NGL segment. But in our forecast for the remainder of the year, we do not -- we did not forecast any incentivized ethane in that forecast. So that will all be upside if we find the opportunity to bring more ethane out of the Bakken. Sunil Sibal : Okay, got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Alex Kania, Wolfe Research. Alex Kania : Thanks very much. Maybe just another question on the renewals. Does it -- and thinking about the economics and how you want to make the investment, does like a conversion to electric or even ultimately renewables mean like a lower cost basis for you? Or is that something that maybe kind of a value-add that you can kind of upcharge existing customers really for lack of a better term kind of ESG-related matters? Just trying to think of what the investment of the return could be, and ultimately as well from a renewable investment standpoint is that something where you would really contract? Or is it maybe even investment in some of these facilities? Kevin Burdick : It may be any of those or all of the above. I mean we have situations where we may -- if we can secure power for a lower cost and it's a cleaner renewable energy, we'd absolutely do that. And we -- and have the opportunity to benefit in that. In other parts of our business that gets -- those power costs may get passed along. So we would help out our customers. We may be in a situation where we can provide the power to the assets. So we're not constraining ourselves one way or the other and how we're thinking about providing renewable power to -- for our assets. Terry Spencer : I think the other thing, I can add to that Kevin is that on an ongoing basis, we're needing to replace compression in our footprint as we have -- as machines become antiquated or as they wear out, we need to replace that compression anyway. So sometimes some of that -- those opportunities can be additions to the rate base. So that -- they can be in our regulated assets where they can -- we can earn a guaranteed return. The only difference is we'll put in electric compression as opposed to fossil fuel compression or by field compression or some of the things that we're considering. So it could take that form as well. Alex Kania : Makes sense. And then maybe just a follow-up. Just given the kind of the backdrop of the growth potential it probably isn't a big priority, but just with respect to M&A, is there any maybe desire to kind of diversify geography a little bit more kind of balance it Bakken relative to the Permian? Are there any assets that might be interesting? Or is it just tough to compare that relative to what's internal? Terry Spencer : Well I mean, we're always thinking about those types of things. I can tell you right now the appetite from a large-scale M&A standpoint is not very high, but we are always thinking about what opportunities are out there that we could bolt-on to the asset footprint that could make it better. So we're always thinking about those things. But certainly they've got to be strategic got to make a lot of sense. They've got to be accretive from an earnings and credit standpoint. All of those things are going to be required on the M&A front. But I will tell you candidly, the prospects are kind of few and far between, but we're always looking. Alex Kania : Great. Thanks so much. Terry Spencer : You bet. Operator : Our next question comes from Timm Schneider, Citi. Timm Schneider : Hey, guys. Just a quick one. I didn't see this in the release, maybe I missed it. But in your initial guidance, I think the rate for -- in the G&P segment was $0.95 to $1. Came in at $1.04 this quarter. So does that directionally imply we should be assuming that rate to go down throughout the rest of the year? Chuck Kelley : Timm, this is Chuck. I would -- we gave guidance earlier this year on the average fee being $0.95 to $1. It's been $1.04 the past two quarters. I'd just say you could probably hang your hat on $1 and we're going to have quarters where we're above it. And there might be just $0.01 or so below it. But I think $1 is a good number. You might see a couple of cents above that throughout the year. Timm Schneider : Okay. Got it. And the follow-up is, I'm going to assume if I ask you for fixed and variable cost on your system to get ethane down to the Gulf Coast, do you want to answer that? But what are the kind of main fixed costs and variable costs to think about as you think of that ethane coming down to the Bakken? And how does that vary from the Mid-Con to the Bakken, if at all in a big way? Sheridan Swords : Timm, this is Sheridan. I would say yes you're right. I'm not going to answer what it is. But the variable cost is just the top cost to pump it from the Bakken and to run it through a frac. Just electricity and gas to do that. That's the only difference. The difference between bringing it out of the Bakken versus the Mid-Continent is just that the Mid-Continent is closer to Mont Belvieu than the Bakken is so you have less pumping capacity -- less pumps you have to run to get it down there. So not that big a variable cost. Timm Schneider : Okay. Got it. No. that make sense. And that is -- that's it for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides, Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Thank you for taking my question. One or two easy ones. First of all, in the G&P segment in the quarter, I didn't see you all call out any volumetric impact due to Winter Storm Uri. Was there any? That's kind of the first question. The second question a lot of your peers or several of your peers that benefited in February from what happened with gas are now tied up or caught up in efforts to try and actually recover the cash from their customers some of which has sparked litigation already. Just curious, do you have the cash in the door for all of it? I didn't see a big accounts receivable balance buildup. So just wanted to see and maybe check on those two items? Chuck Kelley : Yes. Michael, this is Chuck. Second question first. No we've been paid for the gas sales that we made in February. So there are no accounts receivable out there for that. Secondly, your volume question on impact of Winter Storm Uri, it was primarily a Mid-Continent impact for us. As Kevin mentioned in his remarks, it was 30 million a day for the quarter, so 30 x 90, 2.7 Bcf. So essentially, if you had a 10-day event in the Mid-Con, 270 million a day for 10 days, so our plants -- our producers behind those plants obviously have well freeze-offs. Plants had some power issues. So, it was primarily a Mid-Continent issue for us in G&P. Had a little bit of an impact in the Bakken, but February is always tough in the Bakken. Michael Lapides : Got it. And with all the debate going on in the Texas legislature over the last couple of weeks or so really last -- almost two months now -- little over two months now, how do you think about the concept of weatherizing your Permian infrastructure? And not just you and Terry, this may be a conversation you're having with your peers. How does the industry do that? Terry Spencer : Well, I mean -- right. I can speak for ONEOK. We've weatherized, okay? I think where a bulk of the problem was is back in the field, where it's very difficult. It's difficult to weatherize wellhead production. It's been done in the Bakken. Obviously, the Bakken had marginal impact from the severe conditions. But down in Texas and even in parts of Oklahoma, we don't quite -- we don't do it as robustly as we do in Williston. So I think there's a lot to be learned from producers, who operate in a hostile environment all the time. A lot can be shared with producers down in Texas and how to weatherize. But -- I mean a lot of issues stem from the fact that it's difficult in terms of wellhead production to weatherize. And especially, if the electric power is getting shut off on you too if you're a producer and you're trying to -- you've got heat tracing and insulation that requires electric power and then, your power is getting shut off it makes -- you're froze up. So, I can speak for ONEOK. We did a great job weatherizing and that's how we were able to continue to operate. We had very few facilities go down due to freezing and we had large volumes of gas coming out of storage that made up for the wellhead supply that froze off. We just continued to make deliveries. And those deliveries and the market demand was going up dramatically. So even in the face of rising demand because of the cold temperatures, we are able to rock and roll and maintain deliveries. And fortunately, this cold snap only lasted about 10 days. But anyway, that's -- it's a challenging undertaking to make sure everything is weatherized. I can speak for ONEOK. We did a great job. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you, guys. Much appreciated. Terry Spencer : Thank you. Operator : Our last question comes from Robert Kad, Morgan Stanley. Robert Kad : Thanks so much. I was wondering if I could just ask quickly on Northern Border and the Btu spec limit discussion. Now, you have a bit of distance from the technical conference and response from FERC last year. So, I was just kind of wondering where the process stood at this point. Whether it's discussions with producers or any next steps with FERC? Thank you. Chuck Kelley : Yes. Robert, this is Chuck. TC Energy is the operator of Northern Border. And in discussions with them, we understand they're still working with the customers up in the Upper Midwest as well as the downstream pipelines that they interconnect with, looking to develop a tariff solution that addresses the operational concerns and balances the interest of parties from the Bakken on into Chicago. So more to come. Robert Kad : Great. Thank you. Operator : At this time, I'd like to turn the call back over to Andrew Ziola. Andrew Ziola : All right. Well thank you everyone for joining us. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in July and extends until we release earnings in early August. We'll provide details for the conference call at a later date and the Investor Relations team will be available throughout the day. Thank you for joining us and have a great week. Operator : Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today's teleconference. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you, Casey, and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s second quarter 2021 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder, before we turn it over to the conference coordinator for Q&A, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in order to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. For 32 of my almost 40 year career, I had the good fortune to work with the assets in the people through various companies that are now a part of ONEOK. I\u2019m excited and honored to be back. This company has a strong experienced management team and a talented workforce, and we are all looking forward to the future. On today\u2019s call we\u2019ll be discussing ONEOK\u2019s strong performance in the second quarter. And I\u2019ll provide a few of my initial thoughts as to how the management team and I will continue to build on the accomplishments of those that preceded me in this role. I\u2019m also looking forward to reacquainting or meeting many of you in the near future. Joining me on today\u2019s call is, Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelly, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. I\u2019d like to first start off this call by recognizing and congratulating Terry on his retirement and thanking him for his availability to advise me in my new role. ONEOK has seen tremendous growth and success under Terry\u2019s leadership the last seven years as he\u2019s navigated the company through several growth cycles and industry challenges, including delivering strong results during a pandemic. Terry championed many companies\u2019 successes. The transition to higher fee based business model with less commodity price exposure, significant improvements in company-wide safety and environmental performance. The successful ONEOK partners merger transaction and the completion of more than $10 billion in capital growth projects, to name just a few of his many accomplishments. The company has grown in many ways since I was here last, and I\u2019m looking forward to building on what Terry the Board, the leadership team and ONEOK\u2019s 3000 employees have achieved. It\u2019s been extraordinary. During this first month on the job, I\u2019ve been re-familiarizing myself with our business, holding strategy and planning meetings with the team, and most importantly, listening. I\u2019ve met with my leadership team and many employees to hear more about their focus areas. These introductions and conversations are very important and we\u2019ll continue. What you can expect from me as a CEO is that we will be disciplined and intentional in all that we do and continue to encourage a culture that promotes safety, reliability, employee engagement, value creation, and environmental responsibility. These principles have served ONEOK well for decades and will continue to be a key element of our daily operations and business decisions going forward. The energy systems today were designed to operate on the consumers\u2019 requirements for affordability, reliability, and resiliency. We will continue to focus on meeting our customers\u2019 needs while also transforming these energy systems to drive the overall lowering of greenhouse gas emissions. Yesterday we reported a strong second quarter financial result, supported by increasing volumes across our systems. The energy and economic backdrop continues to improve, with producer activity accelerating in demand for NGLs and natural gas strengthening. Kevin will talk more in detail about how we\u2019re addressing those needs, but first, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Walt to discuss our financial performance. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. With yesterday\u2019s earnings announcement, we updated our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our view of 2021 continues to improve as we now expect 2021 adjusted EBITDA to be above the midpoint of our guidance range of $3.05 billion to $3.35 billion that we provided back in April. Our outlook for growth in 2022 has continued to strengthen. Higher commodity prices, accelerating producer activity, and the rising gas-to-oil ratio in the Williston Basin, provide a tailwind into next year. With available capacity across our operations and the completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion later this year, significant earnings power remains across our assets without the need for significant capital investment. The strengthening momentum going into 2022 makes us confident that we will achieve or exceed the 2022 outlook we have discussed on previous calls. Now for a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOK\u2019s second quarter 2021 net income totaled $342 million or $0.77 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $802 million, a 50% increase year-over-year, and a 3% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 after backing out the benefit from Winter Storm Uri. We ended the second quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs, due to planned and unplanned outages at some of our fractionation facilities. We expect to recognize $12.5 million of earnings in the second half of 2021 as our current inventory is fractionated, and so the majority of which will be recognized in the third quarter. Distributable cash flow was $570 million in the second quarter, and dividend coverage was nearly 1.4 times. We generated more than $150 million of distributable cash flow in excess of dividends paid during the quarter. Our June 30 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 4.3 times, and we continue to work towards our goal of sub four times. We ended the second quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility, and nearly $375 million in cash. In July, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of $0.935 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. Our strong balance sheet, ample liquidity, and increasing EBITDA from volume growth in our system providing solid financial backdrop and flexibility as we enter the second half of the year. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Our second quarter NGL raw feed throughput and natural gas processing volumes increased compared with the first quarter 2021 driven by increasing producer activity, ethane recovery and gas-to-oil ratios that continue to rise in the Williston Basin. We expect these tailwinds to carry into the second half of the year and into 2022. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, total NGO raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% compared with the first quarter 2021. Second quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 18% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 85% compared with the second quarter 2020, which included significant production curtailments resulting from the pandemic. As a reference point volumes reached approximately 330,000 barrels per day in this region early this month. At this volume level, we still have more than 100,000 barrels per day of NGL pipeline capacity from the region, allowing us to capture increasing volumes on our system, including volume from a new 250 million cubic feet per day third party plant that came online in early July, and expansion of another third party plant that is underway and our Bear Creek plant expansion, which is expected to be complete in the first half of the fourth quarter this year. Total Mid-Continent region raw feed throughput volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021 and 10% compared with the second quarter 2020. The Arbuckle II expansion was completed in the second quarter, increasing its capacity up to 500,000 barrels per day, adding additional transportation capacity between the Mid-Continent region and the Gulf Coast. In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 16% compared with the first quarter 2021, primarily as a result of increased ethane recovery and producer activity. Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen and is seen support from a continuing global pandemic recovery. This led to increased ethane recovery across our system in the second quarter. Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the first quarter 2021 as we continue to incent some ethane recovery on a short term basis. Continued ethane recovery in the Rockies in the second half of 2021 will depend on regional natural gas and ethane pricing. We have not included ethane recovery from the Rockies for the remainder of the year in our updated financial guidance. Ethane volumes on our Mid-Continent system increased compared with the first quarter 2021 due to both favorable recovery economics and some incentivized recovery. We continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in our guidance for the second half of the year in this region. Ethane volumes in the Permian Basin increased in the second quarter compared with the first quarter 2021. We continue to expect the basin to be in near full recovery in the second half of the year. Discretionary ethane on our system or said differently, the amount of ethane that we estimate could be operationally recovered at any given time, but is not economic to recover at current prices without incentives is approximately 225,000 barrels per day. Of that total opportunity, 125,000 barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and 100,000 barrels per day in the Mid-Continent. Full recovery in the Rockies region would provide an opportunity for $500 million in annual adjusted EBITDA at full rates. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment; in the Rocky Mountain region second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.25 billion cubic feet per day, an increase of 6% compared with the first quarter 2021 and more than 50% year-over-year. An outage at one of our plants, which has since come back online decreased second quarter volumes by approximately 15 million cubic feet per day. Toward the end of June volumes reached 1.3 billion cubic feet per day and we have line of sight to even higher processed volumes later in the year given the recent increase in completion crews and rigs in the basin. Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels in the second half of 2021 and 2022 particularly in Dunn County, where construction on our Bear Creek processing plant is on track for completion in the first half of the fourth quarter of this year. Once in service, we will have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the basin, and we\u2019ll be able to grow our volumes with minimal capital. In the second quarter, we connected 84 wells in the Rocky Mountain region and still expect to connect more than 300 this year. Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we expect a significant increase in well connects in the second half of the year, with some producers aligning the timing of well completions closer to the completion of Bear Creek. There are currently 23 rigs operating in the basin with nine on our dedicated acreage and there continues to be a large inventory drilled, but uncompleted wells with more than 650 basin wide and approximately 325 on our dedicated acreage. We expect the current DUC inventory to get worked down before we see producers bring back more rigs to the basin to replenish inventory levels. As we said last quarter, the eight completion crews currently operating in the basin is enough to reach our well connect guidance for the year. Any additional completion crews would present upside to our guidance. Rising gas-to-oil ratios and natural gas flaring in the basin continue to present opportunities for volume growth without the need for additional producer activity. Since 2016, GORs have increased more than 75%. Recent projections from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority show that even in a flat crude oil production environment, GORs could increase an additional 45% in the next seven years. This could add 1.3 billion cubic feet per day of gas production and approximately 150,000 barrels per day of C3+ NGL volume to the basin during that same time period. Again, this growth in natural gas is only based on increasing GORs and assumes flat crude oil production. Any growth in crude oil would be upside to those projections. We\u2019ve added a new slide in our earnings materials to show these latest North Dakota projections, which include various production scenarios. During the second quarter, the gathering and processing segment average fee rates increased to $1.06 per MMBtu driven by higher Rocky Mountain region volumes. We now expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu. Mid-Continent region average process volumes increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2021 as volumes returned following freeze-offs in the first quarter. While the region has received some attention as commodity prices strengthen, producer activity has been more moderate than other areas. In the natural gas pipeline segment, the segment reported a solid quarter of stable fee based earnings. The decrease in earnings year-over-year was driven by a onetime contract settlement that provided a $13.5 million benefit to earnings in the second quarter of 2020. We continue to see increased interest from our customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system, following the extreme winter weather events earlier this year. Since the first quarter, we have renewed or recontracted additional long-term storage capacity in both Texas and Oklahoma, including a successful open season for more than 1 billion cubic feet of incremental firm storage capacity at our West Texas storage assets. We\u2019ll continue to work with customers to contract additional long-term capacity as we head into the winter heating season. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Kevin. The results achieved so far this year, only 12 months removed from the unprecedented conditions in the second quarter of 2020 are nothing short of amazing. Resiliency of our assets and our employees and the caliber of our customers, we\u2019re able to work with and provide a long-term runway of many opportunities. But key to our success will continue to be operating safely, sustainably and responsibly with the health and safety of our communities and employees at the forefront of all that we do. To learn more about our commitment to responsible operations, I encourage you to review our most recent corporate sustainability report, which was just published to our website last week. The report details our most recent environmental, social and governance related to performance and programs and highlights key initiatives under way across the company. Its ONEOK employees, who carry out these initiatives every day, and who prioritize the safety and well being of their fellow employees, customers and the public. Thank you for your continued hard work and your dedication to safety to this company. Again, I\u2019m excited to be back at ONEOK, and I\u2019m looking forward to the opportunities and the challenges ahead. Operator we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] We\u2019ll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning everyone. Pierce, nice to hear your voice on a different conference call and I\u2019d like to send a congratulations to Terry on a very successful career and congrats on starting a new chapter. Maybe to position and so Pierce to put you on the hot spot, hot seat right off the back here. But I was wondering if we can talk about your thoughts around buybacks in CapEx for 2022. I imagine there\u2019s not much on the CapEx front, just sort of given where you are at this point right now. Maybe a completion of the frozen frac is two inches with the higher ethane recovery that in Kevin\u2019s comments about C3+, with respect to GORs, but outside of that doesn\u2019t appear to be much on the CapEx side, when it\u2019s different take the soft outlooks that have been presented in the past $3.5 billion to $4 billion has kind of been thrown around into potential 2022 run rate. It sort of suggests it\u2019s the leverage for what I was going to be some four times leverage ratio target. This is set up for buybacks in 2022? If so, how should we think about execution around buybacks? Or if I got the thought process online on CapEx? Just curious on your thoughts. Pierce Norton : So, Shneur, first of all, thank you for the welcome back. And we will certainly pass on your comments to Terry. And I think we all echo those as well. And we\u2019ll make some kind of a broad comment, and then I\u2019m going to let Walt kind of answer kind of more specifically. But we\u2019re in the process of looking at our strategic plan and our earnings projection, not only for 2022, but also for the next five years. As a part of that, we\u2019ll be assessing what I would consider, our capital allocation opportunities. So, I don\u2019t have a specific answer to, exactly for the buybacks for next year. But I would say that\u2019s all a part of our capital allocation plan and the strategy that we\u2019re actually currently talking about now. So, I\u2019d like Walt to kind of weigh in on any more particulars that any insights that he might have. Walt Hulse : Sure. Thanks Pierce. Well, Shneur basically, I would agree with your assessment of the tailwinds that are behind our business today. And we\u2019re excited about the opportunities that are forward and the cash flows that will generate from that we\u2019ll continue to enhance our de-leveraging strategy that\u2019s been in place for quite some time. And we\u2019re starting to see some of our end goals in the near term coming forward. And as we get closer to our goals of sub four times leverage, then obviously, we will expand the horizon of things that we\u2019ll look at from a capital allocation. And I think we spent time with Pierce, we\u2019ll look at all of our options. As we go forward. You\u2019re right that there isn\u2019t any major CapEx project on the horizon here are we really doubled the capacity of our long-haul pipes and the NGL business over the last several years. And that gives us a lot of running room going forward, you highlighted that we have a couple of projects that we pause back with a pandemic. And over the course of, next year or two is, as producer activity picks up, I would assume that we\u2019ll likely clean some of those up and finish them up to meet our customers\u2019 needs. But it\u2019s really going to be routine growth than some smaller growth projects that are very attractive going forward. So, we\u2019ll have plenty of free cash flow to continue to de-leverage and then look at all of those capital allocation opportunities over the next couple of years. Shneur Gershuni : Really appreciate the detail color there. And maybe as a follow up question here, just given the fact that that Terry\u2019s been at the company for so long, and so effective [ph] strategy and so forth Pierce you\u2019re coming in now, how are things going to change? How are they going to stay the same with respect to strategy? Would there any specific marching orders that were given to you from the board upon your arrival? Just kind of curious if you can sort of talk to that kind of holistically? Pierce Norton : Sure, I\u2019ll be glad to answer that. I think it\u2019s not so much about, what\u2019s going to change immediately in the company. I think it\u2019s more about what\u2019s changing in the energy industry, I think we can probably all agree that the energy systems across the United States, it\u2019s going to be very important that we continue to transition into a lower carbon energy system across United States. So really, it\u2019s about how we at ONEOK and the assets, and the people in the skill sets that we have, are actually going to transform with that energy system. I view that as a three step process, first of all, you got to understand, what the transformation of the energy systems look like then you prepare for that, for what you\u2019ve learned and what you understand. And then you innovate. And I think that\u2019s the three focus areas that I would say that we have going forward is understanding, where we are preparing and innovating for the future, while at the same time continuing to grow the base business that we have in the use of natural gas and natural gas liquids, because I think the global poll, most countries are not where we are in the United States as far as the maturity of our systems and the transparency that we have in the energy systems here in the United States. So think that\u2019s going to continue to pull for natural gas demand as well as natural gas liquids growth, while at the same time we\u2019re going to be able to use the skill sets and the talents that we have in our company to transform. I do think transformation is a better word than transition. Transition, to me indicates that you\u2019re going to leave one thing and go to another transformation. In my opinion, it means that you\u2019re going to use something that you have, and maybe use it a little bit slightly different, in the future to meet some of the problems that we have, I do think it\u2019s important for the United States to lead in the effort of lower carbon, because I think the other parts of the world can learn from what we do, although there\u2019s only 6.6 gigatons of CO2 emissions in the United States versus 51 gigatons over the globe. So we\u2019re a small percentage, but I think it\u2019s important for the U.S. to lead in these efforts. And, and I do feel like that, ONEOK is positioned. Over a long period of time, a lot of these things, as you look at CNG and hydrogen and LNG for long-haul and carbon sequestration and capturing methane, those are all going to be opportunities that we experienced over the next several decades. Shneur Gershuni : Great. Really appreciate the color and congratulations on the new role. Pierce Norton : Well, thank thanks again. Operator : Our next question comes from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Thank you, Pierce. Welcome back to this side of ONEOK. I thought I would maybe start with an ethane question. This quarter, you guys took out more ethane in the back end. And you talk about 25,000 barrels a day of ethane extraction being an incremental $100 million. But that\u2019s predicated on you collecting the full $0.28 TNF. You haven\u2019t been collecting that when you\u2019re doing it more opportunistically and when you do provide more ethane to the market this way, it sort of puts a lid on what prices can be so curious, how do you balance this and make sure you don\u2019t provide too much supply that it negatively impacts a frac spread economics and other basins that you\u2019re in? And what really has to happen in order for producers to sign up for long-term contracts for ethane TNF out of the back end? Is it really only a firm Btu resolution on northern border? Pierce Norton : Christine, thanks for the Welcome back. And I think Kevin and Sheridan can probably add more pillar to your question. Sheridan Swords : Sure. Christine this is Sheridan. I think in your first question on how do we determine how much ethane to bring out of the Bakken and what\u2019s the right amount before putting a lid on ethane prices, really, when we try to understand is, where the next incremental ethane will come out and is that coming off our system or somebody else\u2019s system. And so if we don\u2019t bring it out of our system that somebody else can bring ethane out of their side of the system when we will lose the whole uplift that we\u2019ll have from buying it at gas and selling it at ethane value. So it\u2019s an ongoing process that we look at every month and we try to make that determination that\u2019s why we don\u2019t bring all the ethane now at the Bakken that we could. We could incentivize more. But we just bring what we feel is the right amount of ethane to come out. And really on your question of what would it take for producers sign up for ethane they have already signed up for ethane. They have the option today whether or not to bring ethane on the system or not to bring ethane on the system, we have the capacity for them. And they signed up for a certain amount of capacity. What it really comes down to now is what is going to drive the price high enough that we get a full TNF rate or the full $0.28 to bring that the ethane would come out. And what\u2019s going to need to happen for that as you\u2019re going to need to continue to have a strong ethane to ethylene spread like we have today very, very widespread. So that ethane can continue to rise, prices continue to rise. And the petchems can continue to make money off of that. The second thing is you need to have more demand. And then we need to see more exports coming out there is more export capacity out there and we need to see more crackers and in the second quarter of next year, the ExxonMobil, SABIC crackers going to come online as well. So that\u2019s going to bring on more demand. And I think the third thing you need to look at is you need to look at regional gas prices between the Bakken and other areas. So, if we would see the Bakken gas prices dip down like we typically see in the summer, I think all those things together if they work that you have the possibility of an opportunity to see ethane come out that Bakken at full prices. Christine Cho : Got it. That was really helpful. And then I guess just moving over to I guess guidance. On a prior quarter call you guys kind of gave us off 2022 guidance of about $3.4 billion. Are you guys still feeling good about this? And what sort of ethane extraction assumptions or are you including in that? Pierce Norton : So Christine, I\u2019ll start by saying, we haven\u2019t issued our 2022 guidance yet. We\u2019re in the process of looking at that. But I will let Walt or Kevin chime in on that past comment. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Christine. I mean, I think, when we were still that number still out there that we talked about it as far as where we\u2019d be in 2022. And since the last quarter, nothing, we\u2019ve \u2013everything strengthened since that time. I mean, prices have strengthened, the comments and the feedback we get from our producers have strengthened so that\u2019s the way I would frame 2022 up is, it is definitely more constructive today than it was three months ago. Christine Cho : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Tristan Richardson : Hey, good morning, guys. Really appreciate the comments and kind of what you\u2019re seeing in the second half. And particularly the comment on July, I think you noted, maybe at one point in time the system touched 330 a day is that including some recovery or at least incentivized recovery. So, are you seeing some recovery in the Rockies starting in the second half? Kevin Burdick : Yes, Tristan, this is Kevin. Yes, that would include some incentivized recovery, which we talked about in the remarks. Tristan Richardson : Okay. I appreciate Kevin. And then lastly, Walt I think you in the past have talked about the earnings engine at ONEOK and the potential for this business to produce EBITDA, the four handle? I mean, without asking you about a timeframe or anything, can you talk about some of the conditions necessary to hit that type of potential? And are you seeing some of that, as you look out over the near and medium term? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think that the way we\u2019d frame that up in the past was that we have the assets in place, especially in the Bakken to achieve those types of earnings levels without any meaningful need for CapEx. As you continue to see gas volumes there, maybe at some point in the future, a need for another plant up there, but that\u2019s not in the near term, we\u2019ve got plenty of capacity and McKenzie County and now we\u2019re going to have capacity down in Dunn County. So, we\u2019ve got room to run, and we\u2019ve got room to run on the NGL side. As we get closer to those numbers that would start with a four, we\u2019re probably going to have to have some downstream additions that, like MB-5, and things like that, that would need to be completed. But none of those are major dollars in the scheme of the earnings power of the company. So, we\u2019re pretty excited about, kind of the operating leverage that we have in the company, and the ability to continue to grow significantly with modest capital needs. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it. Thank you guys very much. Pierce Norton : Welcome. Kevin Burdick : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Pierce Norton : Good morning Jeremy. Kevin Burdick : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I also want to send Terry our best going forward into retirement their best of luck. Maybe picking up on energy transformation, as you laid out there, RNG Biofuels, Hydrogen CCUS. Just wondering if there\u2019s any specific initiatives that ONEOK is working on right now seems like there\u2019s some things done the RNG side, but just wondering specifically right now, if there\u2019s anything, near medium term opportunities that ONEOK is focused on. Pierce Norton : Thank you. I picked up on probably the one that is probably the most likely the quickest. And that is the renewable gas opportunities primarily coming from; these are kind of listed in order of agriculture, wastewater and landfills. I\u2019m going to kick it over to Chuck there just a second, because he can give you some updates on what we\u2019re doing, as it relates to some of the RNG efforts, but the CNG and LNG for the long-haul, I think is another thing that could be a possibility. Hydrogen is probably out into the future because primarily in right now, you can\u2019t take a certain amount of hydrogen based on the tariffs on the interstate and intrastate assets across the United States. But I do think that\u2019s a developing opportunity left to be seen, economically, how that stuff plays off. And then you got carbon sequestration, because 24% of all the carbon emitted of the 6.6 gigatons actually comes from electric generation from coal, oil and natural gas, primarily, coal and natural gas. So, I think that\u2019s going to be important to solve that equation. And of course, transportation has about 28% of that 6.6 gigatons. So, if you converted all the cars today to EVs, then you just switch the problem from transportation over to electric generation and then so you didn\u2019t really solve the problem. So Chuck, I\u2019m going to let you kind of talk a little bit about our RNG opportunities and what we\u2019ve already done and are doing. Chuck Kelly : Sure, Pierce. So, it\u2019s a little color, Jeremy on our interstate pipes, particularly if you think about where they\u2019re located Upper Midwest, we\u2019ve got, as you know, quite a few dairy farms up in that area. So, you have agricultural waste, we\u2019ve connected three RNG facilities that are originated from dairy farms already up there, looking at another one. And then here on our intrastate business, particularly in Oklahoma, we\u2019ve already connected a large landfill waste site recycling facility, looking at another and then of course, there\u2019s some large feedlots in our Texas intrastate markets. So, we\u2019ve been involved in connecting RNG and bringing that gas into our stream, delivering it to customers downstream. So this has been ongoing over the past three years, and we\u2019re seeing that accelerate, so excited by the RNG aspects that we see out there. Pierce Norton : So and I just kind of summarize that by saying that, as part of our strategic plan, we look to develop, business plans around all these different aspects of these opportunities. But I think, more importantly, as far as it what these opportunities do? Is they make the existing natural gas pipelines in the United States, relevant. Instead of just moving methane that you traditionally get from the wellheads, you\u2019re actually capturing methane that is emitted to the air, which is 25 times more potent than the CO2, so you get to see, uplift in the CO2 equivalents. And so you get the extra benefit of removing that. And you\u2019re using existing assets to help other industries reduce their environmental footprint. So the relevancy of it is the important part as opposed to some great business opportunity, to boost your EBITDA. It\u2019s really designed around the relevancy of making essentially 2.6 million miles of pipelines in the United States are very important to the energy transformation future. Jeremy Tonet : That\u2019s very helpful. Thanks and just want to follow up a little bit as it relates to CCUS because it seems like North Dakota is kind of separate themselves, from what all the states given the multiple initiatives there for CCUS with power generation, for actually having primacy on the classics wells, and really kind of solving that problem, streamlining it, and then kind of really proving up quite a sizable sequesteration resource within the state. And just given your positioning in North Dakota was wondering if you see an opportunity for ONEOK to play a role in all these development teams, like, since it seems like things are moving more real time in North Dakota, than other parts of the country. Kevin Burdick : Definitely. Interesting. This is Kevin, we absolutely see that as an opportunity. And our \u2013 and it started and it\u2019s been in with our presence up there. We\u2019ve got strong relationships with state university systems, et cetera and are involved in projects and analysis to understand the Class 6 permits, that that much of the storage has up there, the ability that that puts you further ahead for those opportunities. So, we are definitely involved in those conversations and have a long history and track record of partnering with the state and would expect that to continue as it relates to CCUS. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Great this Jeremy, thank you so much for taking the questions. Pierce Norton : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Thanks. I just want to add welcome back, Pierce as well. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Michael. Michael Blum : I wanted to go back to the Bakken for a minute. And you kind of touched on some of this, but just ask them more directly. How much ethane are you voluntarily recovering in the Bakken today? And it looks to us at least like the Btu limits are either closed or have been returned northern border. So, do you envision at some point here in voluntarily recovering ethane out of the Bakken. Kevin Burdick : Michael, this is Kevin, we\u2019re not going to, we said last quarter, we\u2019re not going to get into and talk about the actual volume of ethane we\u2019re recovering. Other than to say we have incented some methane to come out. That\u2019s been economic driven, with that ethane recovery, that\u2019s actually pulling down the Btu level on Northern border. So it\u2019s maybe pushing that out a little bit. But if you just go back to the gross kind of production growth, that rather it\u2019s GORs or activity levels that are both increasing. At some point, we continue to believe it\u2019s just math that blended Btu rate is going to go up and become a problem. Northern border or TransCanada continues to have discussions with the various partners and counterparties up there, both on the supply side and the demand side, to understand what a Btu spec might look like. And we expect those conversations with the counterparties and FERC to continue and hopefully we\u2019ll have something, resolution here in the next several months. Michael Blum : Got it. Thanks for that. The other question I wanted to ask was about the Mid-Continent NGL volumes, it looks like they were up sequentially. Just want to make sure I understand is that being driven by just the Arbuckle II expansion because the G&P segment there in the Mid-Con. You cited production decline. So, I just wonder [ph] understanding the dynamics there. Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. Obviously the Arbuckle II expansion helps us move those volumes. We\u2019re really what we\u2019re seeing is we did incentivize the methane in the Mid-Continent more in the second quarter than we did in the first quarter, but we\u2019re also seeing some increased producer activity. So, we\u2019ve seen our C3+ volumes increase as well, and we\u2019re probably back to a level that on the C3+ volumes that is equivalent to pretty close to where we were in the fourth quarter of 2019. So, we\u2019ve seen some pretty good recovery from the pandemic, recovery from the ice storm and some growth. We\u2019re seeing a little bit of activity there. Now, we\u2019re predicting that the Mid-Continent will stay relatively flat this year going forward, that we have seen a little uptick in volume. Michael Blum : Great, thank you very much. Operator : We\u2019ll take our next question from Becca Followill with U.S. Capital Advisors. Becca Followill : Hi, Guys, and welcome back, Pierce. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Becca. Becca Followill : Thank you. First question is on the fee rate on GMP, it\u2019s up to $1.06 keeps ticking higher. It looks like the mix continues to be where and I realize its mixed dependent. But it looks like the mix continues to be where the Bakken\u2019s going to grow faster than the Mid-Continent. So should we expect that to continue to take higher or is $1.06 kind of a cap here? Chuck Kelly : Becca, this is Chuck. I think in Kevin\u2019s remarks, we talked about $1 to $1.05 range, we still believe that somewhere in that $1.05 ranges is a probably a good number for the balance of the year. The $1.06 was a little stronger than we thought it would be frankly, and it was driven really by the contract mix on the Bakken. Becca Followill : Okay. Thank you. And then the second one\u2019s on LPG export facilities. You\u2019ve talked, I think pre-COVID it was you talked about it. But we\u2019ve got NGL that hit record levels in May in the U.S. Any current thoughts on an NGL export facility for you guys? Kevin Burdick : Becca it\u2019s Kevin. We continue to look at it, it remains a priority for us it is continued there. Clearly the pandemic and the pullback in production, slowed down, some of those discussions, but like you mentioned with exports continuing to be very strong through this and production picking back up. So have the conversation. And so we will continue to look at that. And once as we said before, rather we\u2019re talking LPG or ethane. If we get the right counterparties, the right project and then we\u2019ll announce something, but still looking at it. And it\u2019s still a priority for us. Becca Followill : Thank you. Operator : Our next question will be taken from Spiro Dounis with Credit Suisse. Spiro Dounis : Good morning team. First one well, sorry, if I missed that [Technical Difficulty]. Pierce Norton : Spiro you breaking up a little, if you could say whatever you\u2019re saying over again, please. Spiro Dounis : [Technical Difficulty] CapEx range curious that\u2019s trending in a direction either. But imagine a lot of the higher activity levels are pushing that higher, but maybe not the case. Pierce Norton : Okay, I think I got it that you\u2019re looking at CapEx in 2021. We continue to stay within our range. Obviously, as producer activity picks up, we\u2019re going to spend a little bit more on well connect. So that might move us towards the higher end of the range. But we\u2019re very comfortable with the 2021 range that we have out there at this point. Spiro Dounis : Just M&A will be helpful here. I know in the past, you\u2019ve expressed interest on some of the gas assets that were being marketed by some of the utilities out there. We\u2019ve seen some of those change hands at this point. So, curious if there\u2019s still assets out there that could enter [Technical Difficulty] Pierce Norton : So screw up, just make a broad comment about M&A, it\u2019s been about 30 years in the midstream business, and there\u2019s always been some level of M&A activity. It did slow down during the years where most of the assets were into the MLPs. But I guess, what I would say about that is, I\u2019ve only been back for 30 days. And I\u2019d point you back to the comments that that I made on the \u2013 in the original opening that whatever we do its going to be intentional. It\u2019s going to be disciplined. So, whether or not we do or don\u2019t participate in the M&A market that\u2019s going to be our guiding principles. Spiro Dounis : Understood. So Pierce, congrats and good luck to Terry. Pierce Norton : Thanks. Operator : Our next question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Is there still any ethane being rejected and the Mid-Con? Or is this number for the volume kind of all potential ethane from the Mid-Con, but as you know that 100,000 of it is sort of discretionarily being recovered? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. There still is some ethane being rejected in the Mid-Continent. But here\u2019s we get into August, that number is quite low. We think we\u2019re at are getting close to full ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent right now. But for the second quarter, we did still have quite a bit of ethane off in the Mid-Continent. And so we did incentivize some in the Mid-Continent. In the second quarter in August, we have very little that we are incentivizing out. Jean Ann Salisbury : That\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. And then that new Slide 9 with the gas production at flat Bakken create, is really interesting. This would suggest an ad of like a Bcfd, from here over the next five years, even if oil production is just flat. But there\u2019s obviously not anywhere near a Bcfd of gas takeaway left out of the Bakken. How do you see this has been resolved? And would you participate in this solution for that, if that\u2019s what it took? Kevin Burdick : Yes, Jean Ann this is Kevin. Yes, that\u2019s something we\u2019ll absolutely keep an eye on. I mean, the good thing there is, we\u2019ve got time. You still got some capacity on northern border that can be you can displace Canadian gas. Going back pre-pandemic, we had talked about looking at other avenues out whether that was expansions on northern border, or moving gas to the west and taking advantage of existing assets that are in the ground, to go to the west and south. So, my guess is those things would come back up, we\u2019ll have those conversations as we see volumes materialize. But the good thing is, we do have some time. And we\u2019ve got some available capacity to get us to that point. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Morning team. Pierce, welcome back, and congrats to Terry on retirement in job well done. Historically, there was some interest in getting into the crude gathering and transportation. Are you just so gangbusters on the wet gas and NGLs that this is kind of off the table at the moment? Or how does this look going forward? Pierce Norton : So Craig, I think our core business is pretty well defined with natural gas and natural gas liquids. And that\u2019s the direction I would see in the future. Craig Shere : Very good. And just what kind of running room do we have for increased Mid-Con firm capacity demand to avoid further winter market dislocations, in terms of maybe ongoing steady state EBITDA with that could reduce volatility in the Mid-Con. Pierce Norton : Let me kind of rewind this back to Winter Storm Uri, because I saw that up close and personal. And the Mid-Continent area, which is defined as Southwest Kansas and the Texas Panhandle and Oklahoma, is a net exporter of natural gas, even during the month of February during the middle of winter to the tune of about three Bcf a day. That turned back between the demand that we saw in the Mid-Continent and the lack of production for various reasons to basically only 5% exports. So, the real issue is to talk about resiliency of the supply chain and how we can potentially get gas in those kind of situations back from maybe the South East, up into the Mid-Continent if it ever happens again. So those are things that that we would be looking at, but it really is looking at not necessarily the capacity that\u2019s there today or the contracting of that capacity. We are addressing a little bit of that which is some uptick in storage and some additional volumes there. But that\u2019s not going to get you through a second Winter Storm Uri. So it\u2019s going to have to be a holistic approach between the exploration and production folks, the midstream folks and the utilities to really get us to a point where we can take on another Winter Storm Uri. We\u2019ll say volumetrically, there were very, very few customers lost in the state of Oklahoma. And so that volumetrically was a very positive force. The issue was where the price went to, not necessarily the stability and the reliability of being able to perform. So, I think the focus needs to be on resiliency and there\u2019s going to be a lot of people that\u2019s going to be involved in that process. Craig Shere : Can this process de-risk some of the Mid-Con EBITDA? Kevin Burdick : Craig, this is Kevin, I think, those assets are highly contracted and have been highly contracted for a long time. And we would expect that to continue. So, I think what this does is maybe provide opportunities for expansion. This team has done a really good job of whether it\u2019s connecting new power plants or doing smaller projects to bring gas from other areas, to Pierce\u2019s comments, we\u2019ve done some of that. We just think there may be more opportunities for that in the future. Craig Shere : Right, thank you. Operator : Our next question will come from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy Partners. Michael Cusimano : Good morning, everyone and congrats on the new roles. I have more of a strategic question. Hypothetically, using Elk Creek 540,000 barrels a day of expandable capacity is kind of a ceiling being filled by even like the 330 touched on earlier this month and the 125,000 barrels a day of available esteem that you mentioned. It still leaves is that 85,000 of capacity available for the GOR and volume growth opportunities that you mentioned. So with that in mind, I\u2019m trying to understand the strategic rationale for overland pass today. Is that just there capacity available for potential growth beyond Elk Creek? If you can mention \u2013 just talk about just how that fits into the portfolio today? Sheridan Swords : Yes, this is Sheridan. I think when you think about the strategic rationale OPPL you need to think about Elk Creek as one system. And the Bakken pipeline delivered into OPPL as a second system. So to reach the total 540,000 barrels a day of capacity that we could achieve by expanding Elk Creek, Elk Creek will run 400,000 of that the other 140 will be on the Bakken pipeline and delivering that into OPPL and delivering all that into business so that\u2019s where OPPL fits into our strategic plan for volumes out of the Bakken. Michael Cusimano : Okay. So okay, so it was more of thinking of Elk Creek from Rockies, before it touches into were open to well connect that\u2019s more of like a 400,000 barrels a day capacity? Sheridan Swords : It is, if we would put the additional pumps on. Right now, we stated that that\u2019s 300,000. Michael Cusimano : Okay, perfect. Yes, that\u2019s really helpful. Thank you. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys want to wish Terry a congrats, and Pierce, congrats to you as well look forward to getting together at some point. Have a volume question, you made the comment \u2013 someone made the comment on the call about 330,000 barrels a day is kind of what you\u2019re seeing right now out of the Bakken. Can you give same data points for what you\u2019re seeing right now in the Mid-Con and in the Permian relative to kind of what the second quarter run rate, I think on Slide 4 was? Pierce Norton : We \u2013 I haven\u2019t looked specifically at what we\u2019re running right now. I will say that we are running higher on both those systems than we did in the second quarter. But I have a specific look at what we have reached on each one of these systems. But we are running \u2013 we are turning higher on both of those systems. Michael Lapides : Got it. And when I look at your guidance, your volumetric guidance across G&P in NGL throughput? Do you think there\u2019s material upside to this little surprise given today\u2019s numbers and then the comment on the 330,000 that you didn\u2019t kind of do a volumetric guidance raise here? Kevin Burdick : Well, Michael, we\u2019re still within \u2013 this is Kevin. We\u2019re still within the range in both segments. I mean, clearly, as we see strengthening activity that you\u2019d see some \u2013 there would definitely be some upside to those numbers. But the other dynamic that\u2019s going on is, when you look at an annual average, you had a pretty tough first quarter with the winter storm as it related to volumes. So, I do think you\u2019re going to see a much stronger volume in the second half of the year than you did in the first half, but still tracking inside the guidance at this point. Michael Lapides : Got it. Super helpful. And then last question just on frac capacity, can you talk about and I know you had the outage this period. So it may be a little hard? What the utilization of your fracs are and when you actually think the earliest you might need new capacity would be? Pierce Norton : Well, right now, the utilization of our fracs is as much as we can get through them, because we\u2019re trying to frac off that backlog of inventory that we had carryover from the second quarter as we go forward. In terms of adding new frac capacity, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate that we\u2019re seeing good strong volume growth in our in our area, we\u2019re trying to understand when the right time is to kick that project off. And we\u2019re hoping that volumes continue to grow. And we can see that come up pretty quick. Sheridan Swords : But Michael, I would just add that add that capacity, all we would be doing is completing MB-5, and you\u2019re just talking a couple $100 million to finish up that project. Michael Lapides : Got it. But is that something you think could be needed next year? Or do you think it\u2019s more longer term down the road? Pierce Norton : Well, it possibly could be needed next year, I think when we get it up, it\u2019ll take a little bit longer than that to get it up and going. So, that\u2019s why we kind of need to look at longer than a year ago probably take a little bit longer than that to get it up to complete what we need to have done there. But there\u2019s a possibility it could be needed next year. But still, I still steal there\u2019s quite a bit of capacity in the industry right now that outside frac deals could be done in the short-term. Michael Lapides : Got it? Thank you guys. Much appreciate it. Operator : We\u2019ll take our final question from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes, hi. Good afternoon, everybody, and welcome back to Pierce and then also congrats to Terry on his retirement. A couple of quick questions for me, seems like there has been a fair bit of debate between the activity levels, public versus private. Could you remind us, how much of your volumes come from private producers versus public producers in Bakken? Pierce Norton : We\u2019ve got \u2013 obviously, we\u2019ve got the big, there\u2019s a lot of publics out there when you think about ConocoPhillips, and Continental and ExxonMobil, and so forth. So the majority of those are coming from the public\u2019s up in the Bakken. But we do have some of our smaller customers are the privates, but we really haven\u2019t seen a distinguishing factor between who\u2019s bringing rigs back, it\u2019s really more an independent company, just depending on what their financial situation is, and how they\u2019re viewing their balance sheet, et cetera. But pretty much across the board, we have seen all those customers talk about increasing activity as we move through the rest of this year into 2022. Sunil Sibal : Got it, thanks for that. And then seems like, when I look at Q2 versus Q1, you had a fairly decent uptick in volumes, but your OpEx were flattish to lower sequentially. I was curious, is there any specific thing which is driving that? And how should we be thinking about your OpEx going forward? Pierce Norton : No, I think, we\u2019ve had a couple quarters of a pretty close run rate here. We grow from sequential quarter-to-quarter. It was really just some timing, coming out of the winter, being able to \u2013 starting to execute on some expense projects that that will typically do and as the weather gets better, and that some of that was occurring in the NGL segment. But as we think going forward, other than maybe a little uptick with Bear Creek when it becomes operational later this year, other than that, kind of the current run rate would probably be a decent number to use. Sunil Sibal : Go got it. Thanks. Pierce Norton : Thank you. Operator : This concludes today\u2019s question-and-answer session. I will now turn it back to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : All right. Well thank you all our quiet period for the second quarter \u2013 for the third quarter, excuse me starts when we close our books in October, and extends until we release earnings in early November. We\u2019ll provide details for the conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and the IR team will be available throughout day. Thank you. Operator : Ladies and gentlemen this concludes today\u2019s call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your phone lines.",

I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Todd, and welcome to ONEOK third quarter 2021 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we'll be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include one of expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933-1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder, before we turn it over to the conference coordinator for Q&A, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in order to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. And good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest and investment in ONEOK. And thank you for taking your time to join us today. With me on today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs, and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids, and Charles Kelly, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas. Yesterday we announced strong third quarter earnings results and increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations. Our Third Quarter results were driven by NGL and Natural Gas volume growth on our system. The result of increasing producer activity and improving market demand. As world economics continue to recover from the pandemic, we're seeing demand continue to recover for natural gas and NGLs. And we're focused on helping to meet that increasing demand for these critical energy products, particularly as we head into the winter months. As we look forward, we continue to coordinate with our customers on future growth expectations and are focused on innovation throughout the Company. In September, we announced a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, marking another major environmental milestone for our Company. Our goal is to achieve an absolute 30% reduction or 2.2 million metric tons of our combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. We will undertake a number of strategic emission reduction measures to meet this target, including the further electrification of certain natural gas compression assets, implementing additional methane mitigation through best management practices, system optimization in collaborating with our utility providers to increase the use of low carbon energy for our operations, just to name a few. As we continue to evaluate low carbon opportunities, we remain focused on those that will complement our operations and capabilities while providing long-term stakeholder value. As we have additional detail on specific projects or future emission reduction activities, we will share that information and our progress toward our 2030 target. I will turn the call over to Walt Hulse to discuss our financial performance. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we once again increased our 2021 financial guidance expectations and narrowed our ranges. We now expect net Income of $1.43 billion to $1.55 billion and adjusted EBITDA of $3.325 billion to $3.425 billion with a midpoint of $3.375 billion. This represents a 10% increase in our net income and EPS guidance midpoints and a 5% increase in our adjusted EBITDA midpoint compared with our previous guidance. Our higher expectations are driven by continued volume strength in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, increased demand for natural gas storage and transportation, and higher commodity prices. Our 2021 capital expenditures are expected to be closer to the higher-end of our guidance range of $525 million to $675 million as a result of increased producer activity and project timing. We continually work with our customers to evaluate their future capacity needs and supply expectations, and we'll align our projects and capital investment with those needs. Our outlook for growth in 2022 continues to strengthen, driven by increasing producer activity and rising gas to oil ratio in the Williston Basin, along with the recent completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion. Additionally, new ethane demand from new and expanding petrochemical facilities is expected to come online before the end of the year. Kevin will provide more detail on each of these shortly. Now for a brief overview of our third quarter performance. One of third quarter 2021 net income totaled $392 million or $0.88 per share. A 26% increase compared with the third quarter 2020, and a 15% increase compared with the prior quarter. Third-quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $865 million dollars, a 16% increase year-over-year and an 8% increase compared with the second quarter of 2021. Our September 30 net debt to EBITDA on an annualized run-rate basis was 4.0 times, and we have line of sight to be in sub 4 times in the near future. We ended the third quarter with no borrowings outstanding on our $2.5 billion credit facility, and nearly $225 million of cash on the Balance Sheet. We continue to proactively manage our Balance Sheet and upcoming debt maturities. Earlier this week, we redeemed the remaining $536 million of senior notes to February 2022. Our next debt maturity is not until October of 2022. In October, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of C/93.5 or $3.74 per share on an annualized basis, unchanged from the previous quarter. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 5% compared with the second quarter of 2021, and 10% year-over-year, averaging nearly 1.3 million barrels per day. Our highest NGL volume to-date. Third quarter raw feed throughput from the Rocky Mountain region increased 5% with the second -- compared with the second quarter, 2021, and nearly 50% compared with the third quarter, 2020. Volume growth was driven by increased producer activity in the region, ethane recovery and increasing volumes from recently connected third-party plants, including a 250 million cubic feet per day third-party plant that came online in July. Roughly throughput volumes from the Mid-Continent and the Permian Basin also increased. Permian volumes increased 12% compared with the second quarter 2021, driven by higher ethane recovery and producer activity levels. We also connected an additional third-party plant in the Basin during the quarter. The segment was also able to utilize our integrated assets to capture the benefit of location and commodity price differentials during the third quarter, providing additional earnings on top of our primarily fee-based results. Petrochemical demand continues to strengthen as facilities have returned to normal operations following Hurricane Ida and as the pandemic recovery continues. Who new petrochemical plants coming online before the end of the year could provide more than 160,000 barrels per day of additional ethane demand once fully operational. This additional capacity combined with strong ethane exports, should support a wider ethane to natural gas differential in 2022. Ethane volumes on our system in the Rocky Mountain region increased compared with the second quarter 2021, as we incented additional ethane recovery during the third quarter. Recovery continued in October, and is also expected throughout November, given current regional natural gas and ethane prices. In other regions, we continue to forecast partial ethane recovery in the Mid-Continent and near full recovery in the Permian for the remainder of the year. All of these assumptions are included in our increased financial guidance for 2021. Any additional ethane recovered would provide upside to our 2021 expectations. Discretionary ethane on our system is now more than 225 thousand barrels per day. Of that total opportunity, more than a 125 thousand barrels per day are available in the Rocky Mountain region and a 100 thousand barrels per day in the Mid-Continent.  As NGL volumes continued to grow across our systems, so does the discretionary ethane. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, third quarter processed volumes averaged nearly 1.3 billion cubic feet per day. A 2% increase compared with the second quarter of 2021, and a nearly 25% increase year-over-year. Scheduled plant maintenance at 4 of our processing facilities, which have since come back online, decreased third quarter volumes by approximately 30 million cubic feet per day for the quarter. We estimate that approximately 14 to 15 rigs, which can drill approximately 300 wells per year, is enough to maintain 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of production behind our system. Any additional rigs combined with the rising gas-to-oil ratios of wells already connected to our system, would provide additional volume growth. Conversations with our producers in the region continue to point to higher activity levels through the end of the year and into 2022. There are currently 32 rigs and 10 completion crews operating in the basin with 17 rigs and 5 completion crews on our dedicated acreage. This is more than enough activity to grow gas production on our acreage. In addition to the rigs currently operating in the Basin, there remains a large inventory of drilled but uncompleted wells with more than 520 basin-wide and approximately 300 on our dedicated acreage, compared with about 400 ducks on our dedicated acreage at this time last year. In the third quarter, we connected 72 wells in the Rocky Mountain region. And in October, we connected more than 30 additional wells. Based on the most recent producer completion schedules, we still expect to connect more than 300 wells this year. With our Bear Creek plant expansion and related compressor stations now complete and in-service, we should see a significant number of well completions in the fourth quarter in Dunn County as producers had time their completions with the startup of our expansion to avoid flaring. The new plant will accommodate increasing volumes as it ramps to full capacity over the next 2 to 3 years. With Bear Creek 2s completion, we now have approximately 1.7 billion cubic feet per day of processing capacity in the Basin. We continue to see increased activity in the Mid-Continent region with 2 rigs now operating on our acreage and ten wells connected during the third quarter. Sustained higher natural gas and NGL prices to drive a continued increase in activity next year. During the third quarter, the gathering and processing segments fee rate averaged a $1.02 per MMBtu compared with $0.94 per MMBtu in the third quarter of 2020. Changes in our average fee rates continued to be driven by our volume and contract mix, each quarter. We still expect the fee rate for 2021 to average between $1 and $1.05 per MMBtu. Under the natural gas pipeline segment. This segment is stable, fee-based earnings continue to drive solid results with adjusted EBITDA, increasing 8% compared with the prior quarter. As we entered the winter heating season, we continue to see increased interest from customers for additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system following the extreme winter weather event earlier this year. The segment's market connected pipelines and more than 52 billion cubic feet of natural gas storage provide critical services to customers year around but especially during the winter. As always, we're working with our customers to understand their needs and to help meet increasing demand in the coming months. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Kevin. The strong results for this quarter underscore the quality of our assets and the hard work and dedication of our more than 2,800 employees. I'm very proud of the fact that our employees remain disciplined and focused on the importance of safety, reliability, and the responsible operations of our assets. The first 9 months of this year has set up well for the end of the next year, the Company-wide earnings growth in 2021, and have laid the foundation for continued growth next year. With that Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We'll take our first question from Shneur Gershuni with UBS. Shneur Gershuni : Hi, good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off, I was wondering if we can talk about tailwinds into 2022. You gave some pretty good color about well completions in the presentation there. It sounds like you've got 100 wells left to complete for this year out of 300 with only 2 months to go. You've got Bear Creek now in service. Is it also fair to assume that you've potentially have some PPI inflators on some of your assets like Bear Creek and so forth? And so just wondering how to think about ONEOK as we head into 2022. In the past, you've talked about a $3.5 billion to $4 billion upside potential. Is that the case? Are these tailwinds stronger now? Just wondering if you can give us some color as to how do you think of the tailwinds right now, as we head into 2022. Kevin Burdick : Sure. This is Kevin. I think there's multiple answers in that question. 1. When we think about tailwinds into '22, I really go more towards the activity levels we're seeing in the Bakken with the rigs, with the DUC Inventory, with the rising GORs. We're seeing really nice activity in volume growth in the Permian. So I kind of point to that core volume growth. In addition to that, you've got, like I said in the remarks, ethane demand coming on the system, which could drive additional ethane recovery as we think about 2022. So that's where I think the tailwinds are. But to your -- you ask a question there about inflators on our contracts. In our NGO segment and our G&P segment, the vast majority of our contracts do have escalators on the fee rates. So we're covered as we think about inflation and other things like that, so those contracts are covered. Shneur Gershuni : Okay. You're still good with the range from before? Okay. And maybe just given their leverage trajectory curious about what kind of return of capital auctions or potentially considering when you hit your leverage targets mid next year. Could we potentially see a dividend increase or buybacks on the table? Just need color on that as well too, please. Walter Hulse : Sure, Shneur. This is Walt. We are very pleased to have achieved that. 4.0 here in the third quarter. We want to continue to see that trend lower and so we're not going to stop looking for that debt rejects section and then improving debt to EBITDA ratio. The other thing with free cash flow is it gives us the opportunity to invest in our capital growth as we go forward, utilizing free cash flow and not having to finance. Obviously as we get further and further along into the reduction, our options open up. But at the moment we're focused on debt reduction and using our free cash flow for high return projects. Shneur Gershuni : Great, perfect. Thank you very much. Appreciate the comment today. Walter Hulse : Great Pierce Norton : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Christine Cho with Barclays. Christine Cho : Morning. If I could start with the incent ethane extraction in the back -?end. The? quarter was, I mean, a little noisy with a number of plants being offline. So it's kind of hard to tell on a sequential basis, but can you just give us an idea of -- I think in your prepared remarks that you said, you continue to incent ethane, what the magnitude of the increase was on a quarter-over-quarter basis. And the Bellevue spread over Ventura Gas didn't seem like it would incentivize ethane extraction. So should we assume it's because of your exposure to ACO? And I know you're not going to tell us what your exposure to ACO is but can you give us an idea of what your limitations and constraints would be so that we can try and figure out, maybe what your max exposure could be? Sheridan Swords : Christine, this is Sheridan. What I would tell you is, when we look at the opportunity to incentivize ethane, we look at what we could sell gas at for at the gas plant, not at been juror. We look at what's going on in the marketplace, what the market is offering us for gas price at the plant, and then we buy it. If we choose to incentivize that, we buy the ethane at that price or slightly better than that price to go in. So you can't really use Ventura or ACO. You have to look and see what is happening at the gas plant at the time. In terms of volume, we -- as we said in remarks, we did incentivize more ethane in the third quarter than we did in the second quarter. At this time, we're not going to give you an idea how much more, but we did incentivize more in the third quarter. Christine Cho : And would it be safe to assume that you could incentivize even more like on a fiscal basis, going forward? Sheridan Swords : Yes. Especially as volumes grow in the basin and grow on our -- in our G and P segment, we do have an opportunity to incentivize more ethane. But as I said in previous, we look at what's going on in the marketplace, whether the prices are an all basis, to see how much we think is the right amount of ethane to bring out. So we don't push other basins that we have operations into rejection. Christine Cho : Okay. And then I guess when we think about the ethane demand that is ready to ramp up, how do you guys think about the risk to the operational crackers not running at full utilization if gas prices and I think prices get too high? Sheridan Swords : What I would say there is still a very strong spread between ethane and ethylene. And so it looks like the crackers have plenty of room to continue to run. Now with the new crackers run at full rate, we think they will, but they need to run it more. Ethane needs to be crack today than has been because of that wide ethane to ethylene spreads. So we see good volume going forward. And then you couple that with the exports that are coming online, we expect stronger export demand in 2022 than we've seen. in 2021, specially as additional crackers come on in China. Christine Cho : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : I think on prior calls, you talked about a low double-digit increase for EBITDA versus what a midpoint of 3.2 billion of EBITDA at that point in time with the guidance. And I'm just wondering if that's a fair way to think about it? Commodity prices look like they're higher than what was quoted in the first call there. But just trying to update, I guess how you guys are thinking about 2022 now versus what you had laid out in the first quarter. Walter Hulse : Jeremy, this is Walt. I think when we laid it out in the first quarter, our guidance at that point was 3.050. Obviously, with the strength that we've seen build throughout the year, we already achieved what was out there at that point in time. What I would comment on is that quarter-to-quarter, we have seen everything strengthened in our business, whether it'd be producer activity, commodity prices. So all of the trends are headed the right direction. We think that we're going into '22 with very good tailwind, and we will give you our '22 guidance in February. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That makes sense there. And maybe just pivoting towards DC for a minute and granted it's a pretty uncertain outlook there, we have a very cloudy crystal ball. But just wondering if you could offer any thoughts on what you might be looking for out there and how that could impact one of the higher 45Q, or a minimum tax, or anything else that is on your mind at this point? Walter Hulse : Well, the rest of the alternative minimum tax and there's still quite a few moving parts right now. If it is enacted, it's unclear at this point how it will interplay with bonus depreciation, which is in place for the next several years and has been in place. It's unclear how it will interplay with the interest limitations that are already in place on the NOL utilization. And also the a billion-dollar threshold maybe increasing making the whole conversation somewhat irrelevant. So we're on top of it. We've got a team that as watching the developments there and we will continue to do that. But at the end of the day, even in its worst case, we wouldn't see it changing our progress on deleveraging or being able to fund our capex going forward. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Thank you for that. That's a very helpful answer. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. Good morning. North Dakota state wide clearing increased in recent months as you show on page 8. Can you talk about the reasons for that? And if it's an indicator that it might be tough to get all of the expected gas production growth going forward. Notably ONEOK 's acreage glaring hasn't increased, so maybe it's different for you all look processing capacity, but just wondering about the trends in wider North Dakota versus your. Kevin Burdick : Jean Ann, this is Kevin, I'll chuck and chime in as well but I think what you saw going on through the summer is you had several outages at facilities. We've talked about some of the facilities we had down and while the majority of the cases producers are then curtailing that volume, sometimes you'll see a little tick up in flaring. And the same with some I know third-party plants that were going through some expansions and other maintenance activities during the summer. I don't think that's a trend. I think it's going to trend back the other way as we get into what I'd consider more normal operational run rates for these facilities. The conversations we're having with all our customers up there and I'm sure third-parties are the same way. The target discussion is 0. It's not the state targets anymore. So we are working with our customers for sure on how we drive that number as close to 0 as we possibly can, as it relates to the timing of our facilities, as it relates to how they're bringing on large pads, etc. I would expect that to turn around as we get these facilities up and going. Jean Ann Salisbury : That's really helpful. Thank you. And then just wondering if there's been any recent movement on either the [Indiscernible] or the Northern Border Expansion to get some more gas take away on the horizon. Chuck Kelly : Yes Jean. And this is Chuck. The projects that were discussed prior to the pandemic when we saw the trajectory of the basin requiring additional residue takeaway, we are revisiting those projects as we see increased activity in the Basin, rising GORs. There's quite a few factors that indicate that in the next, call it two to three years, these projects are going to become necessary. So there's a lot of work being done on that behind the scenes right now and we will definitely be part of that solution. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. Thanks. That's all for me. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Michael Blum of Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning everyone. I wanted to just ask a bit about the Mid-Continent. I just want to hear what you're seeing in terms of producers plans there. Do you think there's a possibility that Mid-Con volumes could be flat in 2022, if there's been enough uptick in drilling activity. Thanks. Kevin Burdick : Michael, it's Kevin I think if you look at the total Basin, yes, it's nice to see the uptick in rigs. I know there's been a couple of producers that have come out pretty strongly and announced increases in production in the Mid-Continent, especially from a gas and NGL perspective. The way we kind of look at it is A, we focus on the total rigs because with our NGL position across that basin where we're connected to about every plant, chances are if a rig shows up in the mid-continent, the NGL s are coming to us. So that's a tailwind. While we may not have a lot of those rigs running on our dedicated acreage in G&P, we do have a couple. We've completed some wells and that's a nice -- again, we continue to talk to our customers and if we see these types of prices sustain, I think you could see some more activity in the mid-continent. Michael Blum : Great. Thank you very much. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Colton Bean with Tudor Pickering, Holt and Company. Colton Bean : Good morning, sir. Maybe, then I point the 2 questions there on ethane incentive and then the Mid-Con, I think we saw a slight recovery in the average bundled Mid-Con rate for Q3. Was that really just a result of this spread between OTT and Bellevue widening out a bit? And if so, I guess, our current levels or Q3 levels at least can sufficient to get that historical $0.09 per gallon rate. Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. What I'd say, there's two things that drove the rise in the average CNF fee in the Mid-Continent. You mentioned one of them, which as we saw a wider spread between OG2 and Bellevue ethane and factors. And one of the months in the quarter, we didn't incentivize -- didn't have to incentivize any ethane. Now that came out naturally. The other thing, we also saw an uptick in our C3 plus volume, which gets a higher rate than the ethane volume through it. A lot of our plants have split tier rate for ethane and C3 plus. so it -- both of those contributed to the higher rate. Colton Bean : Great. And then back on the balance sheet, you've highlighted the desire to drop below 4X, looks like effectively there on a run-rate basis. Is there a new leverage target that you guys think about whether it's a ratio or do you think more in terms of an absolute debt target? I'm really just interested in how you're thinking about the balance sheet over the next couple of years. Walter Hulse : Well, I mean, we've said before that aspirationally we'd like to head towards 3,5 and maybe even a little bit lower, but I think we're going to see opportunities going forward. The EBITDA levels that we're at, a [Indiscernible] there's a whole lot of money to invest. So we think we've got meaningful room there to continue to invest in great projects and still see our deleveraging trend downwards towards that aspirational target of around 3.5 times. Colton Bean : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Tristan Richardson of Truist Securities. Tristan Richardson : Hi, good morning, guys. Just a quick one on capital. Clearly, you guys you've shown the Elk Creek Slide before. Obviously there's plenty of capital efficient optionality there on the downstream side. But can you frame for us maybe generally the capex dynamic in 2022 versus 2021? Certainly a very modest capital year with Bear Creek, but with additional third-party plant online in the second half, GOR trends and that pent-up volumes dynamic you mentioned in anticipation of Bear Creek. Can you just frame for us what capital could look like in G&P or more just broadly in 2022? Kevin Burdick : Tristan, this is Kevin. I'm not going to give you a number because that will flow with or as we provide you guidance on early next year. But the way we think about capital, we're constantly evaluating what our customers needs are and what our capacities are. So rather we're talking about processing, gathering, and/or processing need and the Bakken frac capacity needs in Bellevue. Other pipeline needs maybe on West Texas, we're evaluating all of the information from our customers about what they're plans are as we move into '22 and then factoring that in. So the great position we're in, as you mentioned, Elk Creek, but even should we need additional frac capacity, like an MB-5 to restart that paused project, we've already spent a significant amount of that money.  So both the additional capital we would need to provide that capacity, as well as the time we would need to deliver the capacity, we're in really good shape because we might only need say, 12 months to 18 months to finish out a frac. And pipeline we've already got pipe ordered and bought, so we don't have that exposure. So these projects that could come back or are in really good shape to -- we don't have to spend a lot of money and we can do them relatively quickly. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Good morning. So we're talking about 25 a month in well connects in the Bakken. Obviously, it's increasing. I think you said 30 in October and if I did the math right, we may be at 38 or more for November, December. So I had a couple of questions. 1. If these trends continue is the same inevitable that by year-end, next year, we hit over one-half fee a day. And this is all just off your activity, right? On your acreage. But ignores activity with third-party processing plant connections into your NGL system, right? How much more upside could there be there? Kevin Burdick : Craig, that's -- I mean, you've hit on the tailwinds we've talked about. I mean, if you're north of 30 rigs in the Basin, absolutely, we believe that's enough to grow gas production across the entire Basin. And so that's not only going to benefit us from a G&P perspective, but all the third-party connections that Sheridan has on the NGL side, we're going to benefit from growth there as well. We're in great shape because we've still got, I think like 125,000 barrels a day of capacity on Elk Creek or on our NGL systems coming out of the Basin. So again, we don't have to spend a lot of capital to capture that EBITDA. Craig Shere : Okay. And it sounds like this is great tailwinds, everything is looking wonderful. I understand we'll wait till February to get next year's guidance, but it seems like updated full-year midpoint EBITDA guidance kind of suggests decent but kind of silver fourth quarter, nothing like more recent outperformance versus expectations. Could you maybe talk about the gives and takes going into the fourth quarter? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think the gives and takes or as you're probably going to predict will say, is we always know there's weather we have to deal with in North Dakota. And so if you get a calm early winter then yeah, I think that could provide some upside. We do have a lot of well connects forecasted in the last couple of months of the year. And that's what producers are telling us. But if you get some weather, could those be delayed? Potentially saw, but I think the key is we have this arbitrary cutoffs at December 31. Well, the well connects are going to get done rather it's in on December 15th or January 15th. So as we think if we back up and look at the trends over the next several months, clearly we've got optimism of where we're going to be. But I think, yes, you've hit on there. I think there's some upside as well with both volumes, if these wells come online like we think, and as well as the ethane recovery option that would be a positive upside for us in the fourth quarter. Craig Shere : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. We'll take our next question from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Alex Kania : Hey, good morning. 2 questions, first is just thinking about the ethane recovery opportunity and going into next year and maybe putting into context with your view of a widening spread between ethane and natural gas next year just with increased demand. So it'd be fair to think that there is a double opportunity there between both volumes and maybe an ability to reduce the incentive pricing that you have on ethane? Sheridan Swords : Yes, this is Sheridan. You're exactly right. We think there's an opportunity both. And obviously, if we had the wider the ethane to natural grass spread gets, the more we can capture of that spreads. And so the incentive is less. And also as volume continues to increase in the Bakken and potentially in the mid-continent, we also have the opportunity to bring even more ethane out. So you're exactly -- you're thinking about it right. There's a double benefit going into 2022. Alex Kania : Great, thanks. And then just maybe a follow-up on thinking about I guess, the maintenance gas level at the very least on 300 wells a year, and the 14 or 15 rigs. Does that also imply or assume any continued work-down of the DUC Inventory or is that 14 to 15 rigs enough to keep volumes where they are? And then whatever else agreeing with the GOR but not have to really dive into the inventory of the DUC's anymore. Kevin Burdick : I think you'll see the DUC Inventory continue to work down a little bit. Those will occur, I guess call it simultaneously. You'll look at the completion crews and at 10 completion crews I think you will -- and the number of rigs running, I think you'll work the inventory down. It'll be a little slower. But the more rigs you have, the more working -- you'll get down to a working inventory level at some point where the producer likes to keep a certain level so that they don't ever want a completion crew to be waiting on a well to complete. So I think you'll see it stabilize, but I do think you're going to have a period of time here for the next several months, where you're going to have both the DUC Inventory getting worked down, as well as these new rigs churning out new wells. Alex Kania : Great. Thanks very much. Operator : Thank you. We will take our next our last question from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Mine's a little bit more long-term in nature. When you get close to a point where you're going to think about capital allocation again and given just what the industry has been through over the last couple of years, if not longer, how do you think about from an equity standpoint what you and the board would view as an appropriate -- how to return capital back to equity holders. Meaning, do you think it's embedded primarily in the dividend growth or are you thinking it's embedded more so in buybacks in very limited dividend growth? Do special dividends play a role? I'm trying to just think about how you're thinking and how the board's thinking about capital allocation as you see improving fundamentals ahead. Pierce Norton : [Indiscernible] This is Pierce. I think what our first priority would be to grow our earnings per share and return that value that way in the equity price. Walt said this before, is as we go down through the 4 and get to the 3,5 and maybe lower it does open up our opportunities. But we also are looking at what are those growth opportunities to reinvest in the business, to continue to grow our earnings per share. And then it opens up the board to look at some of those other opportunities. Walt, you got anything to add to that? Walter Hulse : No, I think that's exactly right. We -- as we see these earnings grow, the Board will continue to evaluate all those opportunities and [Indiscernible] getting back to it. We have more attractive returns and high multiple projects then we are going to want to focus our capital. And if that isn't the big case, then obviously looking at other forms of capital return to shareholders is something we'll have to evaluate. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thank you guys. I'll follow-up offline, much appreciated. Pierce Norton : Welcome. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. That concludes our questions for today. I will turn it back to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the fourth quarter and year-end starts when we close our books in January of 2022 and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us and the IR team will be available throughout the day. Thank you. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I\u2019d like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Vice President of Investor Relations and Corporate Affairs. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Jennifer. Welcome, everyone, to ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter and year-end 2021 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation that includes 2022 guidance after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, we\u2019ll be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder, before we turn it over to the conference coordinator for Q&A, we ask you that you limit yourself to one question and one follow-up in order to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone. We appreciate your interest and investment in ONEOK. Thank you for taking the time to join us. We\u2019ve got a lot to cover today. With me on the call today is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Strategy and Corporate Affairs; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Operating Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President of Natural Gas. Yesterday, we announced strong fourth quarter and full year 2021 performance, recording our eighth consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth. That equates to a 13% annual growth rate during that eight-year period, highlighting the stable and resilient earnings power of our assets despite various economic and commodity cycles. In 2021, during a year of continued economic recovery in lingering pandemic-related challenges, we grew adjusted EBITDA 24% compared with 2020, continued to strengthen our balance sheet and achieved record natural gas and NGL volumes on our Rocky Mountain region assets. 2021 provided other milestones as well, including our announcement of a greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, receiving an upgraded AA ESG rating from MSCI, and once again receiving a perfect score in the latest Human Rights Campaign Corporate Equality Index. These are only a few of the many great things we\u2019re doing as a company to ensure ONEOK remains a great workplace, community partner and service provider. With yesterday\u2019s earnings announcement, we also provided 2022 financial and volume guidance expectations. We expect increasing producer activity and improving market demand to drive strong volume and earnings growth across our operations. As we\u2019ve said before, we are well positioned financially and operationally in 2022 and for many years to come. Before I hand the call over to the team for more details on 2022, I\u2019d like to reiterate what makes ONEOK so uniquely well positioned for the long term. First, our extensive and integrated assets, which are located in some of the most productive U.S. shale basins. Our customers are well capitalized with decades of proven reserves and many have announced plans to sustain and grow production levels in 2022. In the Williston Basin, in particular, steady crude oil production still means NGL and natural gas growth for ONEOK due to rising gas to oil ratios. Second, our dedication to safe, reliable and environmentally responsible operations. Our commitment to safety in the environment is a core value for ONEOK. It\u2019s critical for us to be safe and reliable service provider, and we strive to be a good partner in the areas where we operate. Our ESG-related performance is a source of pride for ONEOK, and we\u2019re committed to continuing to make progress. Third, our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings, which provides significant financial flexibility. We\u2019ve reduced our leverage to below 4 times and continue to drive that lower, providing optionality for the future cash flows and investor returns. Fourth, our built-in operating leverage and proven track record of disciplined and intentional growth. After completing more than $5 billion of capital growth projects prior to the pandemic, our systems have significant capacity to grow alongside the needs of our customers. And because of our large infrastructure projects are complete, we now have opportunities for short-cycle bolt-on type projects at attractive returns. Fifth, the resilience and increasing demand for natural gas and NGLs. We deliver energy products and services that are vital to an advancing world. And we believe these resources will play an important role in the energy transformation. And finally, the depth and experience of this management team who have a proven track record and extensive experience. This team has been through commodity cycles, adapted business models and adopted significant changes in technology and innovation over the years. This team continues to grow our core business and advance our company forward. It is because of these factors and the segment-specific drivers the team will discuss in a moment that I have such confidence and excitement for ONEOK\u2019s future. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2021 net income totaled $379 million and $1.5 billion, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA for the same periods totaled $847 million and $3.38 billion, respectively, representing year-over-year increases of 14% for the fourth quarter and 24% for the full year. Our December 31 net debt-to-EBITDA was just below 4 times, passing through an important marker and our continued deleveraging strategy. We continue to prioritize reducing leverage below 4 times and view 3.5 times or lower as our long-term aspirational debt-to-EBITDA goal. In 2021, we reduced our total outstanding debt more than $600 million by proactively paying off nearly $550 million of maturing debt on November 1st with cash on hand and being opportunistic with open market repurchases earlier in 2021. We currently have no debt maturities due before the fourth quarter of 2022. Fourth quarter results reflect volume growth in our Rocky Mountain region that was offset by higher operating costs. These higher costs were driven by discretionary employee-related benefit costs and expenses related to planned O&M maintenance projects completed in the fourth quarter in our natural gas liquids and our natural gas pipeline segment. As Pierce mentioned, with yesterday\u2019s earnings announcement, we provided 2022 financial guidance, including a net income midpoint of $1.69 billion and EPS of $3.76 per diluted share. We also provided an adjusted EBITDA range of $3.5 billion to $3.8 billion, with $3.62 billion as our midpoint, representing a 7% increase compared with 2021. We expect double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint for both the natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments, driven by higher volume expectations across our operations. Kevin will provide more detail on our volume outlook. In our natural gas pipeline segment, we expect earnings to be stable year-over-year when adjusting for Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter of 2021. Our 2022 guidance assumes producer activity associated with WTI crude oil prices in the low $70 range. Sustained higher prices could lead to more activity and the quicker volume ramp, which could drive earnings towards the higher end of our guidance range. We expect total capital expenditures of approximately $975 million, which includes growth and maintenance capital. This midpoint reflects the investments necessary to keep up with the expected increase in producer activity and volume expectations, including investments to complete Demicks Lake III in early 2023 and MB-5 in mid-2023. Our routine growth capital accounts for a higher number of well connects and other high-return routine growth projects such as pump stations, compression expansions and other debottlenecking projects to meet our customer needs. Our guidance also assumes the impact of inflation. As we\u2019ve mentioned previously, we have escalators on many of our natural gas liquids, and gathering and processing contracts. These are typically tied to either CPI or PPI indexes and provide protection from rising costs. We expect these types of escalators to keep pace or exceed inflationary costs as we move forward. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for an operational update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Fourth quarter volumes continued to show strength, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region, where processed volumes increased 5% and NGL volumes increased 6% compared with the third quarter of 2021. Natural gas processed volumes in the Mid-Continent increased in the fourth quarter compared with the third quarter as we\u2019ve seen -- as we continue to see more activity in the region, while NGL volumes in the Mid-Continent decreased due to some reduced third-party volumes and lower ethane recovery levels. Overall, for 2021, natural gas and NGL volumes saw significant increases from 2020 levels. We saw record natural gas and NGL volumes on our Rocky Mountain region assets with significantly higher activity in rising gas to oil ratios. In the fourth quarter alone, our team connected 130 wells, nearly doubling the amount from the third quarter for a total of more than 320 in 2021, a great accomplishment for our team in meeting the needs of our customers and continuing to provide momentum into 2022. Now, taking a closer look at 2022. At the midpoint, our volume guidance would result in an 8% increase in total NGL volumes and an 11% increase in total natural gas processing volumes compared with 2021. These higher expectations are supported by increasing producer activity, volume growth from recently completed ONEOK and third-party projects, rising gas to oil ratios in the Williston Basin and ethane recovery opportunities across our NGL system. With the recent completion of our Bear Creek plant expansion, we are already seeing increasing volumes from Dunn County, and we expect the plant will continue to ramp up over the next two to three years. However, with activity levels in the area consistently outpacing our expectations, we could be looking at an even quicker ramp. In the natural gas liquids segment, we expect continued volume growth from our existing customers and from new third-party plant connections. In the Williston Basin, volumes are expected to increase compared with 2021, supported by higher activity levels and recently completed and expanded processing plants. The Mid-Continent also continues to pick up, particularly from private producers with very recent activity levels providing potential tailwinds not fully factored into our guidance expectations. Our NGL system is connected to more than 90% of the natural gas processing plants in the Mid-Continent. So, any increased producer activity in the region is likely to provide NGL volume to ONEOK, regardless if the activity is on our gathering and processing dedicated acreage. In the Permian Basin, we expect double-digit NGL volume growth on our West Texas NGL pipeline compared with 2021, driven by increased volumes in the Midland and Delaware basins. The volume growth is primarily from long-term contracts entered into a few years ago as well as new contracts we have recently signed. Switching to ethane. Demand continues to increase with more than 300,000 barrels per day of incremental demand expected to come on line in 2022 from new and expanding petrochemical facilities and from growth in exports. Our NGL volume guidance assumes full ethane recovery in the Permian Basin and partial Mid-Continent recovery throughout the year. We\u2019ve assumed no full rate Rocky Mountain region recovery. However, we do anticipate opportunities to incent some recovery. This opportunity will fluctuate throughout the year, but a conservative amount is assumed in our 2022 guidance. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect volume growth this year in both the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions. In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processed volumes to grow 15% at the midpoint compared with 2021 and average nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2022. Just five years earlier, in 2017, volumes totaled 830 million cubic feet per day. That\u2019s an approximately 12% annual growth rate over the last five years, while crude oil production has increased in the low single digits. Accordingly, GORs have increased nearly 70% during that same time period. The Williston Basin remains resilient and highly productive. Producers continue to gain efficiencies as they drill in this proven and highly economic region, and the core of the basin is expanding. The North Dakota Pipeline Authority recently estimated that in the last two years alone, more than 7,000 drilling locations have been added to inventory that are profitable at $60 per barrel. This is consistent with what our customers are telling us as most of them still have decades of inventory remaining. There are currently 33 rigs and 10 completion crews operating in the basin with 15 rigs and 5 completion crews on our dedicated acreage. This is more than enough activity to grow gas production on our acreage, and we expect that as DUCs are completed through the spring, rigs across the basin will increase. As we\u2019ve said previously, approximately 14 to 15 rigs, which can drill around 300 wells per year, is enough to maintain 1.4 billion cubic feet per day of production on our system. Any additional rigs combined with the rising gas to oil ratios of wells already connected to our system would provide additional volume growth. Additionally, more than 475 DUCs remain basin-wide with more than 250 on our dedicated acreage. We expect to connect 375 to 425 wells in the region this year. In the Mid-Continent region, activity continues to increase. We expect processing volumes in the region to increase compared with 2021, and we expect to more than double our well connections in 2022 to 30 to 50 wells compared with 15 last year. In the natural gas pipelines segment, we expect transportation capacity to be approximately 95% contracted and earnings to remain nearly fully fee-based in 2022. Following a successful open season in 2021, we\u2019re in the process of expanding our Texas natural gas storage capacity by 1.1 billion cubic feet, which will increase our total system-wide storage capacity to more than 53 billion cubic feet. We continue to work with customers seeking additional long-term transportation and storage capacity on our system, which remains highly valued as these critical services are used year around. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, Walt. Strong financial and operating results in 2021 have provided momentum for another year of growth. We continue to benefit from our interconnected systems, built in operating leverage and the ability to incrementally grow with our customers. We continue to invest in our core businesses, remaining focused on optimizing our assets and staying dedicated to operating responsibly and reliably. Service is another one of ONEOK\u2019s core values, and it is something that our more than 2,800 employees know very well. Through 2021, they worked tirelessly through severe weather events like Winter Storm Uri to serve our customers and continue delivering the vital energy products necessary for the global economy to run. Our employees\u2019 dedication to meeting customers\u2019 needs while operating safely and responsibly, enabled our strong 2021 performance and has set us up for another year of growth in 2022. With that, operator, we\u2019re ready to answer questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And our first question today comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : I wanted to go back to the comments on incentivized ethane recovery in 2022. Can you just give us a sense of what\u2019s going to drive that? And have you changed the rates directionally that you\u2019re charging on that incentivized ethane? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. What we -- as we said before, what drives that is the difference between natural gas prices in the Bakken compared to ethane prices in Mont Belvieu. And so, what\u2019s going to drive that rate higher is if we see that spread continue to wide, we will incentivize more ethane out of the Bakken to capture that spread. So, it\u2019s not -- we\u2019re not putting out a new tariff or reducing TNF fees. We\u2019re actually literally capturing gas price to ethane prices, which today is widened out wider than what we saw in \u201821. Michael Blum : Okay, great. I appreciate that. And then, just maybe a related question, can you give us your latest thoughts on the -- some of the proposed, including your own natural gas pipeline expansion projects out of the Bakken? Do you think we\u2019re getting closer to a place where we\u2019re going to need some more gas capacity? Thanks. Chuck Kelley : Yes. Michael, this is Chuck. I do, and we do. We believe that the Bakken will need some resolute takeaway, let\u2019s say, in the next, call it, three years either side of that. And as you may have heard on TC Energy\u2019s call, they said don\u2019t be surprised if you see an open season this spring. And frankly, I think all stakeholders, processors, pipelines and producers realize the decision probably needs to be made this year to effectuate that time line. So between Northern Border\u2019s Bison Express pipeline and some underutilized pipelines in the Powder River Basin, I think we\u2019ll be able to go ahead and manage that egress. Operator : And our next question will come from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to pick up on the Bakken a little bit here, I guess, more thoughts about NBPL in heat content and given kind of the trajectory here, just wondering if you could walk us through, I guess, procedurally next steps if it\u2019s viewed that the heat content would get too high and there would need to be adjustments in the rate or less ethane accepted, or just any thoughts you could share there? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Jeremy, it\u2019s Kevin. Yes. That phenomenon still exists. If you -- if we rewind a little bit pre-COVID, we were bumping up against those -- some BTU downstream challenges. And there was a lot of discussion in the basin and Northern Border had proposed a new tariff that ultimately got denied and FERC asked the pipe to go back and work with shippers, work with markets to produce a little more information. COVID hit and it really reduced the volumes back to where it wasn\u2019t an issue. If you look at gas production or gas capture in the Bakken today, we are back up to the pre-COVID levels. So the only thing that\u2019s keeping that problem from being persistent is the ethane that we\u2019re recovering on an incentivized basis, which is reducing the heat content. If that market turns around and we don\u2019t incent ethane, then that\u2019s going to raise the BTU content back on border to the levels we were seeing pre-pandemic. So absolutely Northern Border continues to have those conversations. It\u2019s our understanding, they will go back to FERC with a recommendation sometime this year. But in the meantime, we\u2019ve proven if we do end up with a heat content issue, we can always recover ethane to make that okay -- the BTU spec back okay on the pipe. But if that\u2019s a forced ethane recovery because of a BTU limit, that would be at full rates. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s a helpful context there. And maybe just kind of pivoting towards the guide for a minute here, and thanks for kind of listing some of the puts and takes. But just was curious if we think about kind of the formation of the guidance, I imagine this was informed last night, and it was formed a little while ago. And if you kind of overweigh the world today as we see it within how that applies to the guidance range. Could you provide any color there? Would that put you guys kind of at the high end, or any other thoughts on what\u2019s happening today? And how that covers, I guess, where you could fall in the guidance range? Pierce Norton : Jeremy, this is Pierce. I think, given our asset capacity that we have today and then given kind of the backdrop that you described, which is improved demand and improved commodity prices, is really what\u2019s kind of driving this volume metric growth, and we all know that volume impacts us. I\u2019d probably say that our outlook today is as good or better than our guidance midpoint. Operator : And we\u2019ll hear next from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Brian Reynolds : Maybe just a follow-up on the guidance and talking about the upper end of the guidance range, which we seem to be pointing towards. Just kind of curious if you can help me reconcile the upper end of the G&P growth versus the NGL throughput. It seems like G&P growth is a little bit higher. Just kind of curious if you can give a little bit more commentary around ethane recovery assumptions. Are you assuming a little bit of ethane rejection into \u201822, or is that just kind of a conservative estimate with ethane recovery to the upside? Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Brian, this is Sheridan. I think what you need to look at is on the G&P side, what we noted in our release was that an increase in the Rocky Mountain region. On the NGLs, the increase was across our regions. And one of the big contributors to that is the Mid-Continent is growing less than 8%. So, that\u2019s bringing down the average for our NGL segment. And also in our guidance, we have less incentivized ethane than we did in 2021. So that\u2019s another reason that you brought it down a little bit as well. Brian Reynolds : Great. Really appreciate that color. And as a follow-up just on capital allocation. The high end of the guide kind of implies \u201822 leverage exiting there 3.5 [ph]. Just curious if you could talk about the evolution of the long-term leverage target and how we should think about future opportunities around return of capital as we get into the end of the year and into \u201823? Thanks. Walt Hulse : Well, we\u2019re very pleased with how we\u2019ve progressed on our leverage metrics and that we broke through that 4 times in our head and direction, as you mentioned. I think that as I said on the last call, we\u2019re trying to triangulate between a couple of different metrics and just not entirely focused on the debt-to-EBITDA metric. We\u2019re also focusing on a dividend payout ratio. As you see at the guidance, we\u2019re starting to break under 100%. And that\u2019s trending again and also in the right direction. And we\u2019d like to see that get some room under that 100% as we look and think about capital in the future. But there\u2019s no doubt that our flexibility as we move forward and these metrics get in line continues to broaden and be a little bit more flexible. And we\u2019ll look at that as the year and going into \u201823 progress. Operator : And our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : I was wondering if you wouldn\u2019t mind providing some incremental color on your production outlook, on the projection outlook in your areas of service into 2022 and maybe beyond as well as the GOR outlook. Kevin Burdick : When you say production, Theresa, are you talking about the crude production as we see it? Or... Theresa Chen : By our customers. Kevin Burdick : By our customers? Theresa Chen : Yes. Kevin Burdick : I mean when we think about crude -- yes, we think about crude production in the flat -- excuse me, in the Bakken, it\u2019s going to be -- we believe it will grow slightly. I mean, we don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to grow at 10%, but we do believe there will be some level of growth based on what our customers are telling us. And the completions that we see on schedules, et cetera. With that crude production growth, we obviously then believe our gas production is going to grow at the percentages that we\u2019ve outlined previously. So, I guess, that\u2019s how we\u2019re thinking about that STACK/SCOOP going down the Mid-Continent. This is one that we\u2019ve been saying flat to slightly declining. However, with the recent activity pick up, we\u2019re probably looking at it in a slight increase type environment. I think that\u2019s consistent with what some others have said on their calls as well with some of the recent information. And obviously, the Permian is going to grow and has shown growth, and we believe we\u2019ll continue to get our fair share with both, our West Texas LPG asset and our OWT system out there. So we believe we can participate in that growth in the Permian. Theresa Chen : And would you mind just sharing what kind of commodity price assumptions underlie your 2022 guidance? Kevin Burdick : Well, that\u2019s where Walt mentioned, as we look at activity levels and things like that, we were using a low 70s type number for crude for \u201822. As we think about the rest of the commodities, we\u2019ve driven so much exposure of the commodity exposure out of our business and with how we contract, we really -- that doesn\u2019t have a huge impact to us. I mean, it is a little bit of a tailwind right now at these prices. But it was definitely back if you think of crude in that $70 environment, that would be the associated NGLs and gas prices that we would have been looking at. Operator : And we\u2019ll hear next from Colton Bean with Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Colton Bean : So I think you may have just touched on this. But with the 2022 G&P guidance, it looks like EBITDA per Mcf is effectively flat year-on-year. Fee rate is guided to a similar range. So it sounds like part of that -- well, I guess, just broadly, could you walk us through why unit margins would be flat if the Bakken is comprising a greater share of volumes? And then, it sounds like commodity margin that may be skewed a bit by a price deck, but it seems like for both hedged and unhedged volumes, you\u2019d have a better outcome there. Kevin Burdick : Colton, are you talking about specifically about G&P, or are you talking about overall? I\u2019m not sure we followed exactly what you\u2019re asking there. Colton Bean : Just the G&P segment specifically. Yes, looking at the G&P segment, if I just -- yes, the G&P EBITDA versus volumes, it looks like EBITDA per M, so on a unit basis is kind of flattish. But I would have thought that the fee rate would have seen some escalation with the Bakken growing as quickly as it is. And then, on the commodity side, it sounds like that may be partially attributable to a difference in price deck. Chuck Kelley : One thing -- excuse me, Colton, this is Chuck. One thing I would add is you\u2019ve seen our volume guidance. So, obviously, our volumes are up year-over-year. And as part of that, we do have some percentage of proceeds exposures, roughly, call it, 15%, 18%. And at these volumes and these prices, you have a larger commodity piece contribution to our EBITDA. So the $1 to $1.05 average fee rate is across our segment. Obviously, the Bakken is higher. So I\u2019m not necessarily following your question. Kevin Burdick : Colton, I think another thing that\u2019s factored in there is just we\u2019ve seen that fee rate bounce around periodically quarter-to-quarter. So, we\u2019re giving you -- we\u2019re doing our best to give you the average for the year. That fee rate can move around depending on specific producer characteristics. So, if a producer that has a more of a POP contract with a lower fee, all of a sudden completes a bunch of wells in one given quarter, that can actually move that fee rate down. So, what you\u2019re getting there is a blend, but it\u2019s going to bounce around quarter-to-quarter. Colton Bean : Yes. No, I understood. You can follow up for that. I think looking at it from a high level, it just looks like the EBITDA per M is relatively flat. So with both commodities and Bakken growing was a bit confused there, but can follow up on that. And then just on the OpEx side of things, I know you mentioned compensation factored into that. So, can you give us an idea of how you\u2019d expect that to progress relative to Q4 levels? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think Q4, obviously, as Walt mentioned, had a couple of anomalies with the higher employee costs that were discretionary in the -- and the timing on some of our expense projects. If you think about \u201822 relative to \u201821 and look at a run rate, you\u2019re going to have a full year of Bear Creek II from a -- and you\u2019ll see increased costs just with increased volumes, which we\u2019ll see. And then lastly, you will see some level of -- I\u2019m sorry, I just lost my train of thought here. Those are the two big drivers we\u2019ll see. And then -- but from a timing perspective, historically, our expenses, you\u2019ll see that kind of grow over the year just related to the timing of a lot of the expense projects we\u2019ll do in the summer fall and then trying to get them done by the end of the year. That help you? Colton Bean : It does, yes. Thank you. Operator : And our next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Ann Salisbury : I had a question about Mid-Con guidance. It looks like you\u2019re projecting basically flattish gathering and processing volumes in 2022 versus 2021, in the Mid-Con, but you\u2019re connecting many more wells than you did in 2021. Are you expecting much more oil-directed drilling, or is it a timing thing, or am I totally missing something else? Chuck Kelley : Jean Ann, this is Chuck. No, we see an increase of -- I think our volume guidance came up roughly 2%. We actually, I think that might be a little light, it might be more like 3% to 5%. So, we did guide on volume slightly higher than our actuals from last year. And we do have good line of sight to the 30 to 50 well count that we put out in guidance right now. We\u2019ve got 4 rigs operating on our acreage, well capitalized publics behind that with a couple of private coming in Q2 and early Q3. So, I would say that our Mid-Continent volumes will be up, obviously, relative to 2021. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And then how are you thinking about the timing of Elk Creek expansion? Would you need both Bakken pipes to be approaching full or just Elk Creek to be basically full and Bakken doesn\u2019t have to be full to pursue it? Sheridan Swords : Jean Ann, this is Sheridan. When we think about Elk Creek expansion, really, we do look at them both together. So we both look at Elk Creek and the Bakken pipeline to understand when we need to expand. And really, the next expansion on Elk Creek will come on what we call the east-west portion as we see sustainable volume that has to be delivered to OPPL as we optimize that, and we may decide to increase the pumps on that east-west section so that we can move on back off OPPL to optimize our earnings. So, that\u2019s kind of what we look at when we are going forward. So, right now, we feel with the Bakken OPPL connection and Elk Creek, we have plenty of capacity to meet our customers\u2019 needs. And it\u2019s just going to be an option when we expand. Operator : And our next question comes from Michael Lapides with Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Just curious, cost of everything in the world\u2019s up, meaning commodity... Pierce Norton : Michael, we could barely hear you. Michael Lapides : Hey, guys. Can you hear me now? Pierce Norton : There you go. Perfect. Michael Lapides : Real quick. Cost of everything is up. Inflation\u2019s rough out there, steel, labor, et cetera. Can you talk about that trend that\u2019s impacting kind of all industries? And whether that\u2019s had an impact on your capital budget? So, if we look at your CapEx forecast, are you seeing changes at all in which your original expectations for either MB-5 or Demicks were, or the average cost for every new well connect relative to what it cost in maybe 2021 or 2020? Kevin Burdick : Michael, it\u2019s Kevin. Not significantly, and those numbers are baked into the guidance as we think about it. Related to Bear Creek II and Demicks Lake III, we were so far down the road on those projects that when you think about steel and a lot of the materials, a lot of that stuff was already purchased, bought on site, in many cases, installed at the site. Since that time, we\u2019ve gone out and recontracted everything, rebid everything and we\u2019re not seeing anything that would cause us to deviate from where we\u2019re -- what we articulated from a cost standpoint. We are seeing probably a little tick up, as everybody else is, on just kind of your general materials and services. But so far, nothing that would be outside of what we would consider norms that -- and the philosophy is developed when we put the guidance together. Michael Lapides : Got it. Meaning you\u2019re not seeing a lot of pressure in the cost to do new well connects relative to what you\u2019ve seen over the last couple of years. Kevin Burdick : No. I mean, there may be a minor uptick in some of the prices, again, of the materials. But again, all that\u2019s baked into what we\u2019ve got from our growth and maintenance capital budget. Michael Lapides : Got it. And then, when we think about the capital budget for this year, really the impact of MB-5, is the bulk of the spend on that frac in this year and there\u2019s just a little trickle in the next year, or is it more evenly weighted across the years? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think it will be -- your heavier spend will be this year and early next year. We do believe both, MB-5 and Demicks Lake III will be completed early in the quarters that we provided out there. And we\u2019re doing everything we can to accelerate them even more because we\u2019d like to have that capacity available. And some of that\u2019s factored into the guidance expectation as well. Operator : And we\u2019ll go next to Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : Hi. Congratulations on the ongoing progress here. With regards to the realized NGL pricing, I\u2019m sorry if I missed it, but it seems like the Rockies was just $0.01 lower sequentially. And I was wondering to what degree that\u2019s just random fluctuation or it reflects the level of incentivized ethane, or does it impact maybe some volumes actually starting to increase all the PRB? Kevin Burdick : No. Craig, this is Kevin. That realized NGL pricing, I think you\u2019re referring to on the G&P side. That\u2019s just a function. It does include our hedges in there, which is what is -- what pulled that down slightly from Q3, I think, is what you\u2019re referring to. So, it\u2019s just a function of all our hedges getting lumped in with what\u2019s going on, on the prices. It\u2019s got nothing to do with the NGL... Craig Shere : I was talking about the $0.25 versus the $0.24. Kevin Burdick : On the Elk Creek or the Rockies rate, yes, that is a function of the incentivized ethane. So, that drop in a penny has nothing to do with anything contractually that\u2019s going on. It\u2019s purely the incentivized ethane. Craig Shere : Got you. And you all have been talking about for some time, 25 rig connections -- or well connections among 300 a year in the Williston pretty much holding volumes flat, but you\u2019ve kind of been saying that over a couple of quarters, the volumes have been increasing. And at the same time, GORs, GPMs and overall well productivity keeps improving. If we\u2019re thinking about over 1.5 year-end run rate, do you think -- what are the prospects that an even more subdued rate of well connects, say, 300 versus the 422 guidance, could keep that higher level of production flat versus what we had seen in the third quarter. Kevin Burdick : Yes. Craig, this is Kevin. I do think that\u2019s possible. We continue to be surprised. I think as I said in my remarks, producers continue to get better and better. So, as each well gets more prolific and as the gas to oil ratios continue to increase, that just means you\u2019re going to need fewer wells to hold production flat. Now, we\u2019d like to see obviously the same capital deployed and grow production. But at the pace we\u2019re going on right now, that\u2019s been a trend over the last several years as each year, it seems like the same number of wells will allow us to stay flat, even though the baseline keeps getting larger. So, that trend could absolutely continue. Operator : And next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Truist Securities. Tristan Richardson : Just one from me. Just thinking about 2023 and beyond and your large projects, clearly, there\u2019s a lot of cost advantages in resuming these projects. And if you think about the volume ramp on projects once online, can you talk about maybe the return on capital advantages or incremental return on capital for this year\u2019s budget maybe relative to previous returns on capital or historical returns on capital? Walt Hulse : Tristan, there\u2019s no doubt that we continue to see an upward trend in our return on invested capital, and that really comes back to the operating leverage, that we\u2019re seeing growth and we don\u2019t have to put capital -- meaningful capital into our pipeline assets that we built. Obviously, a pump station here or there as volume grows, but that operating leverage has -- year-over-year continues to fall to the bottom line, and we have enjoyed and expect to continue to enjoy increasing return on invested capital going forward. Operator : And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. Good morning, folks. And thanks for all the clarity. Just a couple of follow-ups. First of all, it seems like the well completion activity in Rocky Mountain, it was very strong in Q4. I was curious if you can talk about what kind of cadence we should see in volume growth in that region, especially considering that typically, Q1 also sees some weather events? So, should we be thinking of a little bit of a subdued growth in Q1, despite this strong well completions and then a ramp up, or should we be expecting some other trends? Chuck Kelley : Sunil, this is Chuck. What I\u2019d say about our well connect cadence for 2022, in some ways, it resembles 2021. We had, as you said, a lot of momentum, 130-plus well connects coming out of Q4. 2022 is more back-weighted to Q2 and Q3, just as it was in 2021. We did have some momentum, obviously, carry into here into Q1 this year. Q2, typically, it\u2019s a little dip every year because of frost laws and the weather spring. But -- so the cadence would be more back weighted to Q3 and Q4. Volumes associated with that would probably resemble the well connect activity. Sunil Sibal : Got it. And then, one follow-up on the cost issue. I realize that Q4 seems like, sequentially, the costs were up about $25 million or so versus Q3. What\u2019s a good way to kind of think about that breakdown in onetime costs versus kind of ongoing costs? Walt Hulse : Well, like I said, if we just -- I guess, the way to think about it, if we look at kind of the full year 2021, I do think our costs will be up a little bit in 2022 just overall. I mentioned before, you\u2019ll see a full year of Bear Creek too. The other item I forgot to mention earlier was taxes. You\u2019ll see we\u2019ll have an increase in our ad valorem taxes in \u201822 versus \u201821, so those type of things. And then just the ongoing volumetric costs that are associated with the volumetric growth, which we\u2019ll see with the growth we\u2019re seeing across our system. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy Partners. Michael Cusimano : Most of my questions have been answered. But, if you can just talk about the progress that you\u2019ve made in adding plant connections in the Permian? And then, maybe what you view as your competitive advantage there? And if that\u2019s a growth area from here? And then, lastly, just if you\u2019ve looked at any acquisitions in order to, I guess, inorganically grow your footprint there? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. When we look at the Permian, we still continue to be very competitive because we continue to sign up more people. A lot of our competitive advantages, we have a pipe in place there today. We\u2019re connected to a lot of the unintegrated players that want an alternative source. We also have cheap expansions on our system that we can continue to grow. So, we can continue to provide a competitive alternative to other people out the basin, and we see that because our volumes continue to grow. We\u2019re seeing -- as we mentioned, we\u2019re seeing double-digit growth. We\u2019re also seeing growth from people we\u2019ve already contracted. As the volume out there grows on their system, it comes to our system. And we have long-term contracts in place, as we do in every other place. The M&A question... Pierce Norton : So, Michael, I\u2019ll weigh on that. This is Pierce. I mean, yes, we do look at M&A opportunities in all of these basins. We kind of drop them into kind of two categories, a defensive kind of play versus a proactive look at it. As it relates to looking at these, when you look at -- especially in our NGL business, when you look at the length of our contracts in a lot of these places and you look at maybe the prices that you have to pay to get the G&P opportunities that feed the NGL business, then we just don\u2019t see that as being maybe a place where we would deploy our capital when you look at it as the benefit to our shareholders. So, yes, we look at them, but so far, we haven\u2019t found anything that we think is attractive there. Operator : And our next question comes from Alex Kania with Wolfe Research. Alex Kania : Maybe two questions. First is, just I was thinking about the headroom on the kind of your pipeline infrastructure out of the Rockies. And could you remind us, maybe you said it, I might have missed it on the call, but you were at 335,000 in Q4. Sort of what\u2019s the expectation of that going as you\u2019re assuming for 2022? And the second question would be, if you could maybe talk a little bit just about the kind of commodity components of the POPs, kind of what price deck were you assuming when you were talking about kind of the outlook for the G&P business for this year? Sheridan Swords : Alex, this is Sheridan. As we think about capacity on Elk Creek in the Bakken, as I said, if we think about them together, we currently have a 440,000 barrels a day of capacity. As you said, we\u2019re running in the in the 330,000 to 350,000 range today. We see that -- we\u2019re having plenty of capacity for the period of time now. A lot of that we had incentivized ethane on there. We also we\u2019re pulling that into that. So, we think we have completing capacity on that system going forward for a period of time, and we can take it up another 100,000 barrels a day pretty easily, just adding some additional pumps in a very short period of time. So, we feel very comfortable with our capacity coming out of the Rockies. Kevin Burdick : And Alex, on the question about the POPs, we provided that earlier. We\u2019re -- again, we\u2019re thinking about it in a low $70 type crude environment. If you go back and look at what NGL prices were doing when crude was kind of in that range, that gets you in the ballpark. And then, gas, kind of that same one. It\u2019d be in the upper 3s, upper $3 type number. The other thing to remember when you\u2019re thinking about the POP is we are about 75% hedged when you look at it in the -- for those POP contracts in 2022. So, there\u2019s really just not a lot of commodity exposure left when you factor in the impact of the hedges as well. Operator : And our last question today will come from Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Thanks for squeezing me back in here. Just a real quick question. Our conversations with regulators in North Dakota leads us to see a lot of emphasis on the potential for carbon capture and state policy as well as really kind of support this development. And North Dakota being only one of two states that has Class 6 primacy that allows CO2 wells to be developed at the pace the state sets there, kind of sets them apart from others. And also, you have the Summit pipeline pointing towards North Dakota in progress there. Just wondering, any updated thoughts that you have -- that ONEOK has case on carbon capture. And could this be something that realistically enters the fold at some point? Do you have any visibility here? Kevin Burdick : Yes. Jeremy, it\u2019s Kevin. Yes, this is something we are actively involved in conversations with state officials with other private entities, et cetera, for opportunities. We\u2019ve had a few conversations with them so far, and we\u2019ve got conversations scheduled with them in the very near future to have discussions around that. I do think there are some opportunities when you look at -- that\u2019s what we do, right? We\u2019ve got a lot of -- we know how to process things. We know how to build pipelines, and we know how to store things. And so, I think there\u2019s opportunities. It\u2019s just finding the right partners up there and getting the right opportunities before we pull the trigger on something, but it\u2019s definitely something we\u2019re actively working on. Operator : And this concludes our question-and-answer session. Mr. Ziola, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you, Jennifer. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in April and extends until we release earnings in early May. We\u2019ll provide you details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us. And the IR team will be available throughout the day. Thank you all. Operator : And this concludes today\u2019s conference. Thank you all for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Paula, and welcome to ONEOK's first quarter 2022 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks management will be available to take your question. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. On today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Pipelines.  Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2022 results, which highlighted year-over-year natural gas and NGL volume growth. Earnings significantly increased year-over-year when adjusting for the favorable Winter Storm Uri impact in the first quarter of 2021. Customer and producer conversations continue to point to additional activity through the remainder of the year, supported by strong demand for U.S. energy and commodity prices far exceeding basin breakeven economics. Our built-in operating leverage and proven track record of disciplined and intentional growth have positioned us well to support increasing producer activity levels. Our systems have significant capacity to grow alongside the needs of our customers. And because of our large infrastructure projects are complete, we now have opportunities for bolt-on expansion projects with quicker in-service dates, attractive returns and minimal capital requirements. Not only are we expecting strong activity going forward, but our position in the key U.S. shale basins provides us a long runway to continue our efforts to help address increasing domestic and international energy demand. Current events continue to demonstrate the importance of natural gas and natural gas liquids and a long-term energy transformation and highlights the critical role that ONEOK plays in providing essential energy products and services. Before I hand the call over, I'd like to discuss the recent weather events that have impacted our Rocky Mountain region operations in April and into early May. First of all, I want to thank our employees in the area, and those who supported from other locations to ensure that we were as prepared as possible for these two unprecedented winter events within a two-week period. The severe April storms caused blizzard conditions, record-setting snowfall, high winds and extensive power outages across North Dakota, Montana and South Dakota. A number of our employees, staff facilities during these conditions to maintain the safe and reliable operations of our assets. Many of these employees were also dealing with lost power and damage at their own homes. Widespread outages left many of our facilities without power for several days and a significant number of wells across the Williston Basin were shut in. Our primary focus has been on the safety of our employees, assets and the communities where we operate as we continue to work through the full impact of the storms. Due to the basin-wide power outages, our April Rocky Mountain region volumes were reduced in both our natural gas gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments by approximately 20%. May volumes will continue to be impacted as down power lines are replaced. Currently, our process volumes are more than 1.1 billion cubic feet per day, and our NGL volumes are more than 320,000 barrels per day and trending up as shut-in wells are brought back online. The coordination during and since these weather events with our customers, local agencies, communities and other operators in the area has been impressive, once again highlighting the resiliency of our employees, assets and our customers. Even with this late winter storm, we are affirming our financial guidance ranges and midpoints for both adjusted EBITDA and earnings per share. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK's first quarter 2022 net income totaled $391 million, or $0.87 per share, a 24% increase compared with the first quarter 2021 when excluding the benefit of Winter Storm Yuri. First quarter EBITDA -- adjusted EBITDA increased 11% year-over-year when excluding Winter Storm Yuri. We ended the first quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs primarily due to timing and expect to recognize those earnings in the second quarter as our current inventory is fractionated and sold. Our net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis remains below 4 times, and we continue to view 3.5 times or lower as our long-term aspirational leverage goal. In April, Moody's updated ONEOK's rating outlook to positive, and affirmed our investment-grade rating. ONEOK maintains investment-grade ratings with Moody's, S&P and Fitch. As Pierce mentioned, the recent extreme April storms have impacted our operations in the Rocky Mountain region. But even with these weather impacts, we are affirming our 2022 financial guidance. Strong volumes prior to the weather impacts, strengthened drilling activity, DUC completions through the remainder of the year and a positive outlook for NGL and natural gas demand this year points to a strong volume exit rate in 2022. I now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. During the first quarter, we saw a double-digit NGL volume growth across all our operating regions compared with the first quarter 2021, and Rocky Mountain region natural gas processing volumes increased 11% year-over-year. After reporting record Rocky Mountain region natural gas and NGL volumes in the fourth quarter 2021, we saw volumes decrease sequentially in the first quarter 2022, primarily due to normal seasonality across our operating areas. Through the first four months of the year, we've continued to see encouraging activity from producers, and we expect these activity levels to trend higher through the remainder of the year. Let's take a closer look at our natural gas liquids segment. Total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 17% year-over-year supported by increasing producer activity and increased ethane recovery. Rocky Mountain region NGL volumes increased 24% compared with the first quarter of 2021. In April, we reached peak volumes of more than 385,000 barrels per day from the region prior to the severe late-season storms Pierce discussed earlier. Mid-Continent NGL volumes increased 10% year-over-year. As producers continue to increase activity in the Mid-Continent, a large majority of those related NGLs are transported on our system. So far this year, NGL volumes from the region are trending slightly higher than we had originally planned. In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 23% year-over-year due to strong producer activity levels, which feed our West Texas NGL pipeline. In the Gulf Coast, construction continues on our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we now expect to be complete in the second quarter of 2023. MB-5 will increase our total system-wide fractionation capacity to more than 1 million barrels per day. International LPG demand remains strong, and we continue to expect both domestic and international ethane demand to continue to increase throughout 2022. As natural gas prices have increased this year, ethane prices have kept pace, providing attractive ethane recovery economics in certain areas of our system. While first quarter ethane recovery is typically lighter due to natural gas heating demand and typical winter weather impacts, we see strong ethane recovery opportunities for the remainder of the year. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, first quarter processed volumes averaged 1.3 billion cubic feet per day, an 11% increase year-over-year. In April, volumes reached a peak of more than 1.4 billion cubic feet per day prior to the storms. We connected more than 90 wells in the region in the first quarter compared with 38 connections in the first quarter 2021, and are on pace to meet our guidance midpoint of 400 well connections in the region. There are currently 38 rigs and 12 completion crews operating in the basin, with 17 rigs and approximately half of the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. This continues to be more than enough activity to grow gas production in the basin and on our acreage. Additionally, the basin-wide DUC inventory remains at approximately 500, with half of those on our dedicated acreage. Recent reports from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority highlight the long runway of core drilling inventory remaining in the Williston Basin. Enhanced drilling and completion technologies are significantly increasing the basin's core acreage and further extending the decades of profitable drilling locations remaining in the region. The core acreage in the basin has expanded by an additional 3,000 square miles, with more than 7,000 drilling locations added to inventory that are profitable at crude oil prices of $60 per barrel. In the Mid-Continent region, we continue to see increased activity with 3 rigs now operating on our acreage and 45 rigs basin-wide. We continue to expect increased natural gas processing volumes from the region compared with 2021 and expect the majority of rigs basin wide to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipeline segment, strong first quarter results benefited from increased natural gas sales and higher seasonal volumes compared with the fourth quarter 2021. We continue to see strong demand for natural gas storage services and are working to expand our facilities to meet this increasing demand. We recently completed a 1.1 billion cubic feet expansion of our Texas storage facilities and announced an open season to increase our storage capabilities in Oklahoma, enabling an additional 4 billion cubic feet of storage capacity to be contracted. This project is expected to be complete in early 2023. We also recently announced two open seasons for additional pipeline capacity to address increased demand, one, on our WesTex pipeline system in the Permian Basin, and one on our Viking pipeline in the Upper Midwest. We continue to work with customers across our natural gas pipeline network to address their evolving transportation and storage needs as these key assets continue to provide value year-round. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Kevin, and Walt. The overall dynamics in the midstream space and for ONEOK specifically remain positive. We increased activity, strengthened demand and available system operating leverage. The U.S. energy industry is well positioned to be a significant source for domestic and global natural gas and NGL supply for the long term, with midstream playing a vital role in the safe and responsible transportation of these vital energy resources. As we continue to help supply our country in the world with low-cost energy, we are also looking to play an important role in the transformation to a lower-carbon future through best management practices and collaboration with customers and service providers. We are addressing the growing need for energy products and services today, while also preparing for a long-term energy future. It's this innovation, resiliency and dedication of our employees that makes ONEOK a leader in our industry with the positive momentum we're seeing in our business, and the increasingly positive outlook for the remainder of the year, we're well positioned for yet another year of volume and earnings growth. With that, operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] And first, we'll go to Jeremy Tonet with JP Morgan. Unidentified Analyst : This is Steve on for Jeremy. I guess I just wanted to start obviously with the most topical one about weather. And in the release, we talked about reaching 1.4 million cubic feet per day in the Bakken. So I just wanted to see if that's -- is that an average? Or was that what you got to and just kind of how that's trending now with how things are there? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. That reached volume that we said, that's not an average for April. That was just -- we wanted to provide a number out there that showed where we -- the gas that was available. So we were at 1.4 Bcf a day on a few days there before the storms hit, which shows kind of where we were trending. In my remarks, I mentioned that we were at -- or I think Pierce, we were at 1.1 Bcf a day currently, and that's trending up as the wells are brought back online. Unidentified Analyst : And then next one, I guess, we'll go to the GORs. I guess I just kind of want to get some feedback there on how you're seeing those trending as new wells get drilled. Are they maintaining kind of that GOR level? Or are they becoming I think, more oil-based at early stages and just how you're kind of seeing that go? Kevin Burdick : Yes. The GORs, when you look at trends over time, obviously, they've been going up, I think the number is like 80% since 2016. And -- but yes, you'll see some fluctuations, some minor fluctuations as new wells are brought on. The GORs do increase over time for individual wells. The GORs also are a little different across different parts of the basin from a regional perspective. But yes, you'll see some dynamics of that will bounce around month-to-month as new wells are brought online and as drilling occurs in different parts of the play. But the general trend is it's going to continue to go up. Operator : Moving on, we'll go to Brian Reynolds with UBS. Brian Reynolds : Maybe just to start off on operations. I was wondering if you could talk a little bit more about the completion guidance for this year. We saw roughly 90 wells completed, which kind of indicates that roughly 25% of the well completions were done in 1Q per the guide. So typically knowing that most of the well completions were no back half weighted just due to natural seasonality, I was curious if you could see some upside to that well completion number particularly as producers, specifically the private took to take advantage of the current pricing and rigs start to materially come back into the basin over the balance of '22? Sheridan Swords : Brian, this is Sheridan. And what I would say -- we said in our remarks that we're staying at our previous guidance on well connects. But as you said, coming out of the first quarter with 90 well connects is a really good start to this year. Brian Reynolds : Maybe to pivot to just future -- the natural gas segment really outperformed this quarter. I was curious if you could just talk about those future recontracting opportunities, specifically around the Permian and around the West Texas system just given Permian nat gas tightness and whether there are opportunities to expand WesTex similar to what we saw 12 in 2018? Pierce Norton : Chuck, do you want to take that one? Charles Kelley : Yes, surely. Brian, this is Chuck. So as you said in 2018, we had an expansion, we also recontracted. We're seeing right now similar opportunities for this year. We're currently working on an additional expansion opportunity beyond the open season that's listed on our website, that'll be moving Permian gas north as well like we did in 2018. So that's an incremental expansion. And then on recontracting, we see some really good recontracting opportunities this year, somewhere in the neighborhood of up to 200 million a day on recontracting. Operator : And next, we'll go to Praneeth Satish with Wells Fargo. Praneeth Satish : I think you mentioned that NGL volumes in the Bakken reached 385,000 barrels per day prior to the winter weather. So I mean that's an 88% utilization rate on your NGL pipe. So I guess my question is, why aren't you moving forward with an Elk Creek expansion at this point? Are you waiting for utilization to get closer to 100% or waiting to see what happens with the gas pipe expansion? Just trying to get a better understanding of your thought process behind an expansion. Sheridan Swords : Praneeth, we -- this is Sheridan. When we look at the expansion, we got -- we look out forward and see when we'll need it, when we need to start commissioning that expansion. And you've got to think about that we have about 440,000 barrels a day today and at 385 that has quite a bit of incentivized ethane in it. So we can kind of swing on that as well. So we continue to look through our gathering and processing what's going on in the basin when we need to expand that and when we need to expand the capital. And right now, we're sitting today, we think, in the short term, we have enough capacity on the system to handle what we need going forward, but we continue to evaluate the opportunity to expand and make sure that we put ourselves in a position that when it is time to expand, we can expand it quickly. Praneeth Satish : And then I wanted to ask about the rate case on the Guardian pipeline. If you could just ballpark the magnitude of the rate case, and how you intend to proceed? Would you expect to settle with shippers? I mean I know you're probably limited in what you can say, but just any clarity would be helpful. Pierce Norton : Chuck, do you want to take that one? Charles Kelley : Got a connection problem. But as we look at the rate case, yes, it's not going to be a big deal at all. When I say a big deal, it's not going to be material in the terms of where we're at from a rate and where we might go. Yes, those typically will evolve. We'll do our best to work with the shippers on the pipe, and come up with a rate that we feel is appropriate and move forward. But it's not going to be meaningful to our overall EBITDA. Operator : And next, we'll go to Colton Bean with Tutor, Pickering, Holt & Company. Colton Bean : Just a follow-up on Pierce and Kevin's comments. It sounded like 1.1 the as of processing currently versus the 320. So I think on the processing side, still down about 15% versus Q1, but actually up for NGL. So one, I just wanted to clarify that that's what you mentioned in terms of incentivized ethane. And then, two, interested in your thoughts on whether we're seeing a more structural shift or primarily due to pricing volatility over the last month or two? Pierce Norton : Colton, when you say structural shift, I'm not sure I'm following that question on the pricing. Colton Bean : Yes. Kevin, I think you mentioned that you see ethane opportunities over the balance of the year. So I guess I mean it seems like that would imply that you are seeing a pull on ethane. But I just wanted to get your thoughts on the market broadly. Pierce Norton : Okay. Go ahead, Sheridan. Sheridan Swords : Colton, this is Sheridan. I think when we look at the ethane market, no doubt it's going to be, I think, recovery rejection is going to be volatile through this year in certain areas. But with the increase in domestic demand that's coming online and with the increase in international demand or export demand, we still see some growth in ethane demand or a pull coming in. And right now, ethane is the only advantage crack and the petrochemicals right now. We are in the short term, seeing a little bit of softness due that we have some maintenance going on in the petrochemical industry. and they are working through some of the logistic issues they have on the supply side getting out, but that seems to be as we talk to our customers, is getting better. So as we see that, we -- that's what gives us confident that we'll see good opportunities to bring more incentivized ethane out of the Bakken for the rest of the year. Colton Bean : Yes. Maybe a related question there. Sorry, go ahead. Pierce Norton : No, we didn't say anything. Go ahead. Colton Bean : Yes. Just on the optimization of marketing, it looks like that ticked higher here in Q1. I think historically, you all have highlighted the Conway to Belvieu ethane spread as key indicator of optimization opportunities? I guess, one, is that still a good marker? And then, two, can you frame the opportunity that you're seeing if so? Sheridan Swords : Well, a lot of things that happened in the optimization of marketing between 4Q and 1Q, you remember in 4Q, we were down due to timing of inventory sales, and we said we'd get that back in 2022 when we got it back in the first quarter of '21. And the reason we use ethane as the marker for the Conway to Belvieu spread for optimization is the fact that ethane is the product we have the most of. So that's volume in it. But volatility in that spread views us a lot of opportunity, whether or not it's going to Belvieu or in favor of Conway with all products. So we were able to use that volatility to make our positions on contracts to make minor either way if the favor of Conway in favor of Belvieu, what we need is just some volatility between the two markets, not necessarily just wide markets to Belvieu. Colton Bean : And I guess in terms of the spread that we've seen just over the course of Q2, I mean, is that maybe offer a little bit of upside relative to that 5% guidance contribution? Sheridan Swords : Yes. We're seeing a little bit wider spread right now on the ethane side in Q2, and that's mainly right now due to the fact that we have some Mid-Continent crackers that are in turnaround. We think they'll be short lived through May, but it has given us some upside in the second quarter. Operator : And next, we'll go to John Mackay with Goldman Sachs. John Mackay : I just wanted to kind of collect some of the comments you guys have had so far. Just thinking about the flat or unchanged guidance versus some of the weather impacts. I guess you've talked about first quarter well connects being a little bit better talked about Mid-Con maybe being a little bit better. But just can you kind of line up the moving pieces that get you to kind of maintained guidance versus after the weather impact, specifically? Is your kind of ethane recovery assumption actually better now than it was a few months ago? Kevin Burdick : Well, this is Kevin, John. I think you hit on a bunch of the key attributes we're looking through. One, yes, we've seen weather impact our Bakken volumes, but it hasn't changed the rest of the year outlook for our growth opportunities in the Bakken, both on the G&P side and the NGL side. So we see that as very positive. And we continue to see activity at or above levels than we were anticipating when we put out guidance. So we think there's going to be some offset there. Clearly, we've had ethane recovery opportunities both so far to date and as well as, as we look through the remainder of the year that we believe are going to be strong. You mentioned we're seeing growth. There's been some very positive and favorable calls where other processors and producers in the Mid-Continent about volumes growing there. So we think there's some upside there. And the Permian, again, where we can -- we haven't talked about it a lot on this call, but we've continued to get our fair share of the volume growth coming out of the Permian, and like our position with both our West Texas LPG system as well as our WesTex pipe system we've talked about. So there's a lot of tailwinds for us in a lot of those other areas, including the optimization and marketing side we have on the NGL business. And we think those are absolutely going to offset any hurt we may have had with the severe weather impact in April. John Mackay : Maybe just as a follow-up, you guys talked about kind of strong international demand for NGLs. Can you just remind us where you sit on the export idea and kind of what the latest might be? Kevin Burdick : Well, we continue to work it. As we've said for a while, it's a piece of the business. We would love to extend the value chain and we see that as a natural extension. It's a nice fee-based business. But at the same time, we're working with a lot of different markets, and we're trying to get a deal done. It would happen, but we're not going to step out and do something that's going to earn a return that we're not used to. So we're going to be disciplined. We're going to be intentional about a dock project, but we continue to work it. Operator : Next, we'll go to Chase Mulvehill with Bank of America. Chase Mulvehill : I guess a couple of questions and one kind of follow-up question, I guess, maybe on ethane. On one of your competitors' conference calls earlier this week, there was mention that the Permian is still rejecting about 200 to 200,000 barrels a day of ethane. And obviously, if we hit some bottleneck constraints with natural gas egress in the Permian, then you would look to recover that. So I guess maybe my question is, if this actually does happen and you start going to full ethane recovery mode in the Permian, what do you think that means for ethane recovery and other basins? Do you think that you have to have an offset there? And if so, kind of what basins do you think you'll see some of the offsets? Pierce Norton : Yes. I think all that 200, as I read that call to, all that 200 may not be recoverable out there in the Permian. I can only speak to our system. Our system, we're fairly full on recovering ethane on our system. But if you would see natural gas prices get depressed and if there's more ethane to be recovered out of the Permian, that will have a downward pressure on ethane as it relates to other basins and probably the first basin we would see come out of is probably our Mid-Continent Basin. But we still have the opportunity to move that mid-continent basin in front of the Permian Basin by flexing our rates as we've done out of the Bakken because we've always said the Bakken well at full rates will be out of -- we'll be in rejection for this year and for the future. But I think it may have some impact on it, but I don't think it's going to have a major impact on what our forward -- what we're forward-looking for ethane out of the Mid-Continent. Chase Mulvehill : The other question is really just when we think about Bakken egress and kind of look at the situation over the next two or three years, -- do you see any egress bottlenecks, whether it's for oil, NGLs or natural gas? And if so, which one do you think you hit first? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think the basin is in really good shape. Oil is fine with energy transfer and apples expansion. They're in great shape. NGL we've talked about that. We've got capacity currently, and we have a quick low-cost expansion. We could add another 100,000 barrels a day of NGL capacity. So we go to residue. We -- there's still volume on Northern border that can be priced out or pushed out. Bakken gas can displace gas coming from Canada. There's an open season out right now for 400 million, 500 million a day that Northern Border has out there on a Bison reversal and there's some other smaller expansions from a residue perspective that are out there being discussed, that could -- that will help out the basin from a residue takeaway. So all in all, we feel like the capacities that are out there and some of the expansions that are available, put the basin in really good shape from a takeaway perspective. Operator : And moving on, we'll go to Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Yes. I just wanted to start off with a couple of clarifications. If I heard correctly, I think you said April volumes reduced by 20% because of the weather events. So just wanted to clarify, is that 20% based on the peak rates that you mentioned hitting in April? Or is it more related to Q1 averages? Pierce Norton : Yes, that would be roughly off the 1.4 Bcf a day. Sunil Sibal : And then I think you mentioned also that you have runway to exceed the 400 well connects in that you guided to for Bakken. I was curious, is that the exit rate we are talking about? Or do you think that for the full year average -- or for the full year total, you would probably exceed 400 well connects? Pierce Norton : Well, I think what Sheridan said was we're still maintaining our guidance range, which the midpoint would be 400 but connecting more than 90 wells in the first quarter is an outstanding start to the year. So there's definitely -- we think there could be some upside there. Sunil Sibal : And then one on CapEx trend. So it seems like you expedited the start-up date on the MB-5 a little bit, and then you're also adding gas capacity. What does that mean for the total CapEx for full year? I saw that Q1 was a little bit higher or was it pickup from Q4? Pierce Norton : Yes. We still feel good about our capital guidance range as well. As we think about -- as we looked at the first quarter, we always have some seasonal kind of timing things of just routine growth type stuff. Again, we did not increase the cost at all for MB-5 in accelerating that schedule. That was just our ability. We had some things go our way from a schedule perspective early in the project that allowed us to pull it forward. So the guidance range for capital is still in place. Operator : And our final question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : First, I just had a question of clarification around the different moving components of the average bundled rate for the Rocky Mountain NGL raw feed throughput. So if you did -- on an average basis $0.26 for the $3.14 average of first quarter, and hit $3.85 in April, what would be the analogous average bundle rate if there was a lot of incentive ethane attributed to about $3.85? Sheridan Swords : Theresa, this is Sheridan. To be honest with you, I have no idea what it will be. It will be around the 26. The reason I say that is the accountants will work through it and we have a lot of moving parts on that. But it's going to be 26% to 27% in that range is where I would say that it's going to come out to be. Theresa Chen : And to the earlier comment about your customers seeing some alleviation downstream on the pet chem front, I'm just curious to hear how do you see the pace and path of supply chain models relieving out of the Gulf Coast? To the extent that it can reduce some of the economic run cuts on ethane cracking and increased demand. Sheridan Swords : Well, I could say is as we've talked to our customers and seeing what they're seeing in there, and they said they have had some issues getting rid of the polyethylene pellets to get them exported out of there or actually get them from the petrochemical facilities to the dock. And they keep saying they're working through that and continue to improve that to be better. And they're optimistic that it's going to improve over time is kind of what we're hearing. Obviously, if there's a bottleneck there, you could see them slow down their production to make sure they get rid of the products. But they seem to be more upbeat now than they have in the past. Theresa Chen : And lastly, if I can just squeeze one more in. On the cost side, you've seen some good cost control in first quarter. Just wondering your outlook for costs for the year as far as potential inflationary pressures go? Pierce Norton : We've seen a little bit of the inflationary pressures. I would just remind everybody that we also have the escalators on our contracts that we think are more than offset the cost increases we have seen. The first quarter-- if we look at op cost, the first quarter is usually just a little bit light as you think about the rest of the year. But we still feel good. Again, all that's factored in as we talk about reaffirming our guidance. Inflationary pressures are included in that analysis. Operator : And now I'd like to turn it back to Mr. Ziola for any additional or closing comments. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in July, and extends until we release earnings in early August. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : Thank you and that does conclude today's conference. We'd like to thank everyone for their participation. You may now disconnect.",

At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Nash. And welcome to ONEOK second quarter 2022 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder for Q&A, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one follow up in order to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks Andrew. Good morning, everyone. And thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your interest in investment in our company. On today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Chuck Kelley, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Pipelines. Yesterday, we announced strong second quarter 2022 earnings, provided an update on the Medford incident and affirmed our 2022 financial guidance expectations. As we sit today, we still expect to achieve the midpoints of our 2022 net income and adjusted EBITDA guidance, which Walt will provide additional details shortly. Our second quarter financials were achieved despite unseasonable weather in the Rocky Mountain region during the quarter. Two separate April weather events cause widespread outages and power, disrupting midstream and producer operations across the region. Our employees were well prepared and quickly responded to the challenge. They remained focused on the safe operation of our assets and the safety of the communities where we operate. And they worked with local agencies, customers, utility providers to resume normal operations as quickly as possible. Across our operations, we continue to see strength in producer activity, with commodity prices and demand supporting a strong second half of the year. While it is still too early to provide our outlook for 2023, we are well positioned across our integrated footprint to help transport and process essential natural gas and natural gas liquids. Before I turn the call over, I'd like to make and provide an update on the Medford, Oklahoma fractionation facility. On Saturday, July 9, mid-afternoon, there was a fire at the facility. First and foremost, all of our personnel were safe and accounted for, the safety of our employees and communities is always the main concern and initial focus during a situation like this. I would like to thank the many employees, first responders and local agencies who worked together to quickly respond to the incident. We cannot see enough about the corporation and the coordination efforts of those teams who work to put a safety of our personnel and the surrounding community first. We are incorporating with government agencies as we work to determine the cause of the incident, but expect the facility to remain out of service for an extended period of time. In yesterday's earnings release, we provided details of our property and business interruption insurance coverage. Because of this coverage, we do not currently anticipate that the incident will have a material effect on our financial condition. Results of operations or cash flows, however, the timing of insurance proceeds may impact financial results in a given quarter or year. From an operational perspective, we continue utilizing our system of integrated NGL pipeline, fractionation and storage assets. We're also working with industry peers on additional fractionation and storage arrangements. I want to thank those companies for working with us to keep these essential products flowing since the incident. Our industry has a long history of stepping up to help each other when disruptions happen. And this incident has once again proven that relationships in corporation are critical to this industry's long-term success. And we want to thank them once again. With that, I will turn over the call to Walt for discussion on our second quarter financial performance. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK second quarter 2022 net income totaled $414 million or $0.92 per share, a 21% increase compared with the second quarter of 2021 and a 6% increase compared with the prior quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA was $886 million and an 11% increase year-over-year. Compared with the first quarter of 2022, higher second quarter results were driven by increased NGL volumes across our operations and higher realized commodity prices primarily benefiting our Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. Operating costs increased in each of our business segments, which is typical for the second quarter as improved weather allows for more routine maintenance projects to take place. As of June 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.8 times. And we continue to view 3.5 times or lower as our long-term aspirational leverage goal. In June, we redeemed nearly $900 million of senior notes due in October 22 with cash and short-term borrowings. We currently have no long-term debt maturities due until September of 2023. Yesterday, we reaffirmed our 2022 financial guidance expectations. And to expand on Pierce's comments earlier as we sit today, we still expect to achieve the midpoints of our guidance range ranges, which remain at $1.69 billion for net income and $3.62 billion for adjusted EBITDA. We expect total 2022 capital expenditures to trend towards the upper end of the range of our guidance range of $900 million to $1.05 billion, driven by higher producer activity levels and expansion opportunities in our natural gas pipeline business. Positive drilling activity across our operations and expectations for higher natural gas and NGL volumes in the second half of 2022, support our financial guidance and continue to point to a strong volume exit rate this year. I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. During the second quarter, we saw NGL volume growth across all our operating regions compared with the first quarter 2022. NGL volume expectations remain strong through the remainder of the year, providing confidence in achieving the midpoint of our raw feed throughput guidance for 2022. Natural gas processed volumes and well completions during the quarter were significantly impacted by the April weather events. And we now expect process volumes to be toward the lower end of our 2022 volume guidance range. Let's take a closer look at our Natural Gas Liquids segment. Total NGL raw feed throughput volumes increased 5% year-over-year and 4% compared with the first quarter 2022. Rocky Mountain region NGL volumes increased 10% year-over-year and 5% compared with the first quarter 2022. Activity in the region has rebounded following the April storms, as July volumes averaged more than 360,000 barrels per day, 9% higher than the second quarter average. Mid-Continent NGL volumes increased 4% compared with the first quarter 2022, driven by increased C3+ volumes as producers continued to add rigs in the basin, with a large majority of the region's NGLs dedicated to ONEOK system. In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes increased 10% year-over-year and 4% compared with the first quarter 2022. We recently completed a 25,000 barrel per day expansion on a portion of our West Texas NGL pipeline in the basin to support continued expected volume growth. We saw increased ethane volumes on our system in the second quarter 2022, and expect continued opportunities for ethane to be recovered through the remainder of the year. We anticipate high levels of recovery in the Permian Basin, periodic recovery in the Mid-Continent and continued opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region as in basin natural gas prices fluctuate. Our fractionation capacity is fully utilized following the incident at our Medford Facility. And as Pierce mentioned earlier, we have worked with industry peers to secure additional fractionation and storage capacity. Medford\u2019s capacity was approximately 210,000 barrels per day of our total system-wide name plate capacity of more than 980,000 barrels per day. Construction continues on our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we now expect to be complete early in the second quarter of 2023. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. In the Rocky Mountain region, second quarter processed volumes averaged more than 1.2 billion cubic feet per day, a slight decrease compared with the first quarter 2022 due to the April weather. We\u2019ve seen recent volumes return to pre-storm levels. And in July, volumes reached approximately 1.4 billion cubic feet per day. Through the first six months of the year, we\u2019ve connected 157 wells in the region and we continue to expect approximately 375 to 425 well connections in the region this year. There are currently approximately 45 rigs and 18 completion crews operating in the basin with 21 rigs and approximately half the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. Basin-wide rigs have more than doubled in the last 12 months from only 20 rigs total in July 2021. As we\u2019ve said before, approximately 15 rigs on our acreage can maintain natural gas production at current levels, but with more than 20 currently on our acreage, we expect to see higher well connections in 2023, compared with 2022 if these activity levels remain. The basin-wide DUC inventory remains at approximately 500 with half of those on our dedicated acreage. This compares with approximately 650 DUCs in a basin a year ago. Recent producer M&A in the Williston Basin continues to show the value and long-term viability of the play. We see these recent announcements as positive for ONEOK, as we expect increased activity from the acquirers to drive NGL and natural gas volumes to our system. In the Mid-Continent region, we continue to see increased activity with four rigs now operating on our acreage and 46 rigs basin-wide. We expect steady to increasing activity through the remainder of the year with the majority of rigs basin-wide driving additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipeline segment, strong second quarter results benefited from the continued increasing demand for natural gas storage and transportation services. Last quarter, we discussed a recently completed 1.1 billion cubic feet expansion of our Texas storage facilities, which is now fully subscribed through 2032. Additionally, we are expanding our storage capabilities in Oklahoma, enabling an additional 4 billion cubic feet of storage capacity to be contracted. This project is expected to be complete in early 2023, and is nearly 90% subscribed through 2029. We also recently completed two open seasons for additional pipeline capacity to address increase demand. One on our WesTex pipeline system in the Permian Basin, and one on our Viking pipeline in the Upper Midwest. Both open seasons were successful and we planned to move forward with low capital expansions on both systems. The value of our natural gas pipelines and storage assets continue to be highlighted in the outperformance we\u2019ve seen from this segment so far this year. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Walt and Kevin. As we enter the second half of 2022, we see producer activity and attractive commodity prices providing tailwinds to our business. We\u2019ve affirmed our financial guidance for the year underscoring the resiliency of our operations, earnings and employees, who are always ready and willing to respond to changing market and operational dynamics. Challenges happen in our business and weather is unpredictable, but how we respond to the \u2013 is the real difference maker. Operating safely, sustainably and environmentally responsibly remains an important focus and is key to our success as a midstream operator. How we operate is important, but also how we engage with our employees, communities and other stakeholders is also important. To learn more about our commitments in these areas, I encourage you to review our most recent corporate sustainability report, which was just published to our website last week. The report details are most recent environmental, social and governments related performance and programs and highlights key initiatives underway across the company. Our ESG efforts are a source of pride for ONEOK, and we are committed to continuing to make progress in these important areas. With that, operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you, sir. [Operator Instructions] We will take the first question from Jeremy Tonet from JP Morgan. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Pierce Norton : Hey, good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to dig into Medford a little bit more if possible, and as we think about everything there talked about not being material, but maybe it could help us to understand better what the threshold is for financial materiality there. And then just as far as kind of the parameters of what\u2019s happened with regards to volume offloads, where are those volumes going now? Can you tell us? And you said about the timeline being extended, if this slips deeper into 2023 with this impact \u2013 might it impact your ability to offload volumes if volumes continue to grow? Pierce Norton : So Jeremy, I think I\u2019ll let Walt take the materiality question for us and then we\u2019ll flip it over to Kevin and Sheridan on the offloads. Walt Hulse : Well, Jeremy, I think that we\u2019re very comfortable with that, that comment. I\u2019m not going to give you our level of materiality, but I will say that remember that our insurance coverage provides for a 45-day period, which we have as a standalone and then we have business interruption insurance from that point forward. So we\u2019re very, very comfortable with the view of where we\u2019ve come out from a materiality standpoint. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Jeremy, it\u2019s Kevin. On the volumes and where they\u2019re going right now, I mean, clearly a lot of them are going down to Belvieu. We talked in our remarks about our industry peers that have been very helpful in securing spots for those barrels. We feel good about being able to move the volume. Especially as we get to MB-5 and keep in mind, that\u2019s going to be another 125,000 barrels a day of new capacity that will come online early in the second quarter. So that\u2019s the things we\u2019ve got lined up there. And again, we feel good about being able to move the volumes. Sheridan Swords : One thing I\u2019d add is, we\u2019ve been able to talking with our peers, we have very much comfortable with our growth plans through 2023, depending on how long this lasts, it will be able to handle all of the volume income in our system. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you for that. And just want to pivot over towards IROF if we could and realize it\u2019s hot off the press, and it seems like the shape keeps changing a bit here and what the bill looks like. But just wondering thoughts you could provide as far as how as it currently stands this might impact your tax profile in 2023 or going forward. And as the bill is written right now, separately, would this increase or change your appetite to pursue CCS, renewables or other items like that? Pierce Norton : Well, I\u2019ll handle the tax portion of that. Jeremy, that the \u2013 you\u2019re right, it\u2019s still off the presses and we\u2019re getting a lot of the details, but I do think the late in the game addition of using tax depreciation versus book depreciation was a positive development for us. And we don\u2019t see a real meaningful increase in our tax over the long-term. We may have a little bit higher tax in the earlier years, but if we get into that alternative minimum tax at that 15% that would be for an extended period of time where we would\u2019ve otherwise gone to a statutory rate. So while we expect some are higher level of taxes that addition to the tax depreciation was a big positive. Walt Hulse : And so I\u2019ll take the question about CCUS. I\u2019d like to remind everybody on the call that 36% of the natural gas demand in this country is devoted to electricity. You add to that 33% in the industrial sector. So that\u2019s a total of almost 70% of the natural gas demand goes to those two forms of consumption. Anything that is done that would enhance the ability to capture carbon from natural gas being consumed is a good thing for our industry. And so these incentives, it\u2019s left to be seen exactly how effective they\u2019re going to be, because we need to know the details, but it does encourage us as an industry and as a producer of natural gas and actually, the liquids that are coming off the oil production and the natural gas production in these rich basins that this will help to curb the CO2 emissions in the future. And we do think that will open up some opportunities that we will look both at CCUS and hydrogen. So I think it\u2019s a positive for the industry what\u2019s happening. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I\u2019ll leave it there. Thanks. Operator : We will take the next question from Brian Reynolds from UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Brian Reynolds : Hi, good morning. Maybe to touch a little bit on the 2022 reaffirming guide as it relates to the base business ONEOK appears to expect a complete roughly 60% of its wells for the year in the back half of 2022. And Mid-Con volumes looked to be on track to surpassed 4Q 2019 levels by year end. So I was just kind of curious if you could just talk about given the year-to-date impacts from weather in the Medford frac fire. Was curious if you could talk about how the base business is performing relative to initial year expectations in terms of activity. Thanks. Kevin Burdick : I mean, I\u2019ll start Brian. This is Kevin. I think the base business is performing very well. If you think about where we were going into the storms, we were right on track with everything that we had kind of outlined and laid out. The storms up in the Bakken did kind of set the basins back a couple months, not just with the volumes flowing, but also it was kind of a couple months pause on lower completions that we saw. So it kind of delayed things, and that\u2019s the reason that we\u2019re going to be at the lower end of the guidance from a volumetric perspective there. But on the flip side, when you look at the NGL business and what they\u2019ve done both from a earnings perspective, as well as a volumes perspective, and then the outperformance of the gas pipeline business, I think those two segments are performing at or better than we anticipated coming into the years. So I think it sets us up nice going into to 2023. Brian Reynolds : Great. Appreciate that color. And follow-up on the Medford frac. I know while it\u2019s probably a little bit too early, has there been any initial thoughts on potential replacement of the Medford frac and whether we could see it be built in Mont Belvieu or Conway at the time. Kevin Burdick : Brian, you hit it on the head. We\u2019re still really early in that process. And, and again, not ready to talk about timing or anything like that. We\u2019ve got capacity secured, we believe to move our volumes and we\u2019ll keep working that until we get more information. Brian Reynolds : Fair enough. Enjoy the rest of your day, everyone. Thank you. Kevin Burdick : Thank you. Operator : Next question from Michael Blum, Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So apologies for maybe a technical question. But just so I understand, are you going to be accruing insurance proceeds in your EBITDA results in Q3 and Q4? So that\u2019s how guidance is basically unchanged or is that not the case and you\u2019re just able to make it up in other areas. Pierce Norton : Michael, we expect to get timely recovery of our business interruption insurance. We will actually book that as we receive those proceeds. But that\u2019s why we said that we may have from time to time a \u2013 little bit of a timing difference if we hit right at quarter end. But we expect timely ongoing payments that would flow through our income statement in a normal way. Michael Blum : Okay, great. Thanks for that clarification. Also just wanted to ask about AECO gas prices, which are big trading at a pretty big discount to Henry Hub. Can you just remind us how your ethane recovery economics in the Bakken work? Will you benefit any way from the decline in AECO gas prices? Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. The way we buy gas at the alternative at the gas plant. So we go and look at what we could sell gas at the gas plant versus what we could sell ethane in Mont Belvieu. And so whatever the gas plant is receiving, that\u2019s what we can get. So an AECO price is a factor in what the gas price we\u2019re receiving at the gas plant. Michael Blum : Got it. Thank you. Operator : Next question from Colton Bean, Tudor, Pickering, Holt & Co. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Colton Bean : Good morning. So the NGL segment had a fairly significant step up in costs. Of the three drivers you mentioned, I think fuel power and then third party services. Do you expect an improvement in the back half of the year for any of those or is Q2 level of pretty good run rate moving forward? Pierce Norton : Well, I think there are a couple dynamics going on Colton, the 30 million you referenced really got power costs were just higher, but we also had a more volume. So you had more power just moving it there. And then we also had a turnaround in the second quarter, which caused us to go get some outside frac capacity during the quarter, and that\u2019s in there as well. So some of those costs will just be \u2013 will float as power costs moves around. But some of the other costs were more one time. So that\u2019s as we think going forward, we typically do more work like turnarounds and integrity work and other expense project type work. We\u2019ll do more of that in the summer when the weather is better. So historically, you might see a little stronger in the summer from a cost perspective on those types of activities. Colton Bean : Understood. And then just following up on the Bakken ethane discussion, I mean, it sounds like, with the wider gap between AECO and Mont Belvieu pricing this quarter. Would you expect any upside to that bundled rate? Just if you \u2013 if the incentive rate that you have to offer is now less of a discount than it would\u2019ve been previously. Pierce Norton : Colton, there\u2019s a lot of factors that go into that. Sometimes it impacted, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. I think we\u2019re \u2013 we think we have a good opportunity to incentivize more ethane in the second half of the year. So we\u2019re very bullish on that, but due to the regional gas prices, but how it affects the overall average rate kind of depends on where it\u2019s come volume and the escalators that we have on our base business. Colton Bean : Got it. Appreciate the time. Operator : Next question from Theresa Chen from Barclays. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Hi. I just wanted to ask first on the $16.4 million increase in the NGL segment related to higher average fee rates. Can you tell us what that was related to precisely and is that expected to carry forward? Pierce Norton : Yes. That was mainly related to inflationary escalators for both fuel and power and inflation, and we do have those inflationary escalators coming on throughout the year. So we do anticipate it will increase. Theresa Chen : Okay. Thank you. And in your GMP segment, the $5.3 million increase due to the contract settlement during the quarter. Should we expect some sort of offset and base earnings going forward as a result? Pierce Norton : No, I don\u2019t believe you\u2019ll see any offset. It\u2019s just normal course of business on our large portfolio mix. So I don\u2019t \u2013 you won\u2019t see any offset. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Next question from Michael Lapides, your line is open. Please go ahead \u2013 from Goldman Sachs. Michael Lapides : Hey guys. Thank you for taking my question and congrats on a really good quarter. Just curious as you think about infrastructure needs going forward, given kind of some of the volume commentary about July volumes, how are you thinking over the next year or so about the need for either new processing or even a sixth frac at Belvieu? Kevin Burdick : Michael, this is Kevin. I mean, I think we\u2019re in really good shape as we\u2019ve talked for the last several months. And when you think about Demicks Lake III coming up, that gets us a nice headroom of capacity in the Bakken. We\u2019ve talked about the available capacity that\u2019s currently exists on Elk Creek and then we\u2019ve got low cost expansion opportunities if we need to expand that pipe. We just demonstrated, we\u2019ve got some expansion opportunities on West Texas as our volumes continue to grow out there that we can expand that pipe in tranches. Plenty of capacity in the Mid-Continent, obviously with what\u2019s going on at Medford frac capacity is tight and is going to remain that way until we get clarity on what\u2019s going on with Medford. But other than that, we\u2019re in excellent shape as we think about our capacities and where we\u2019re at. Michael Lapides : So then, if there\u2019s not really a need potentially, I mean, volumes could always surprise to the upside. But if there\u2019s not really any need for any material new asset development in 2023, that implies that the capital budget kind of declines a ton, which not a surprise. How are you and how are the Board \u2013 how\u2019s the Board kind of thinking about capital allocation and uses of some of that significant free cash flow that you might be generating next year? Pierce Norton : So this is Pierce. The way we look at that is that we look at all the levers that\u2019s available to us. So we\u2019re going to be looking at as we get closer and closer to what Walt had mentioned about the 3.5x on the debt to EBITDA ratio as we continue to go below 100% on our payout ratio, then that\u2019s going to actually open up some of those other elements to us that we\u2019ve had in the past. Of course, our first focus is going to be on these organic opportunities because they give us the best chance to deploy capital that gives us really, really good rates of return. We are proud of our ROFC that we\u2019ve been able to achieve, and we are predicting that is going to continue to go up. So I think what it\u2019s going to do is just give us more flexibility to use whatever levers that we feel like, bring the most value to our shareholders. Michael Lapides : Got it. Thanks guys. Much appreciate it. Operator : Next question from Chase Mulvehill from Bank of America. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Chase Mulvehill : Good morning. I wanted to come back to the GMP side of the business, and I guess a few questions. I guess just correct me if I\u2019m wrong and I think your commodity or POP exposure is 15% to 20% this year. And then maybe just remind us again, the gas versus NGL exposure on those POPs and how much you have hedge versus open today? And then just maybe tie into there, kind of what you\u2019re thinking about realized GMP rates in the back half of the year? Kevin Burdick : Chase, this is Kevin. You\u2019re right. We provide the hedging information that\u2019ll come out in our Q and we\u2019ve provided that in the past. So we are pretty well hedged, but prices have run up significantly and we\u2019ve been able to benefit for that \u2013 for the part of those that those contracts that aren\u2019t hedged. So that\u2019s what you\u2019re seeing. And also the other thing that\u2019s driving the price improvement is just what volumes are on what contracts. So we\u2019ve been fortunate to have some volumes come in on higher in this case, higher POP type contracts and been able to benefit from that. Chase Mulvehill : Is it fair to assume in 3Q that a lot of your open volumes were natural gas as opposed to NGLs? Kevin Burdick : Typically from an open perspective, we\u2019ve got \u2013 we hedge most of our commodities in a similar way. So you\u2019re not going to have a higher percentage hedge necessarily of natural gas versus crude versus NGLs. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. All right. If we go up to the NGL section and look at volumes and kind of where they are today, I think you said, 360,000 barrels a day. If we go back and look back in April, you were doing 385,000 a day. So we\u2019re not back to kind of April peak-ish levels, but yet GMP volumes in the Rockies are actually back to peak levels. So kind of help me connect the dots there. Is that Medford related or is there something else, and should we kind pretty quickly back to that 385,000? Sheridan Swords : I think the first quarter announced \u2013 this is Sheridan. We came out and said, we had reached 385,000, but we had an average 385,000. Actually July at 360,000 will be our highest monthly average that we\u2019ve had off the Bakken pipeline. And we continue to trend higher in \u2013 as we get into August, we are trending even higher than that. So from an NGL perspective on the Elk Creek pipeline, we are back further than we were in the first quarter, or even in the fourth quarter of 2021. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. All right. Last one, just going to squeeze one more and I apologize. Just want to confirm this. It sounds like, obviously you\u2019re seeing \u2013 looking at Medford and trying to figure out when you can bring it back online. But I just want to confirm that it is not a total loss. You do not see it as a total loss at this point. Correct? Pierce Norton : Well, I mean, the way I would say that right now is we are looking at all the pieces and parts to that facility right now. So we\u2019ll be assessing that over the coming weeks as to exactly what pieces of equipment are still usable or are not. So we can\u2019t say emphatically right now that it\u2019s either a total loss or not a total loss. We\u2019re doing the assessments of that. Chase Mulvehill : Okay. Got it. Makes sense. I\u2019ll turn it back. Operator : Next question from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : Good morning. Congrats on the quarter. One clarification on Medford. So as far as new expense for third-party fractionation or things that were contracted, you ultimately get insurance recoveries, but doesn\u2019t this kind of at least limit optimization margin opportunities until something\u2019s resolved? Walt Hulse : Yes. Craig, I think that we are \u2013 we believe that we\u2019ve got business interruption insurance for our entire business under that coverage. And really don\u2019t see a meaningful difference from how our earnings would be sorted out in our normal guidance. Craig Shere : Okay. And maybe this is expressing my own ignorance and I apologize. Given the increased gas storage and storage pricing, I\u2019m kind of assuming storage is more of a steady year round product versus gas pipes that have more seasonality since the storage has to fill. So if that\u2019s the case, does the improving storage position in terms of capacity and pricing, reduce your gas height seasonality? Chuck Kelley : Craig, this is Chuck. No, see the way we contract with our customers, frankly these are firm fee-based contracts. What the customer tends to do is play seasonal spreads and utilize their transport and combined storage for optionality. So from a pipe standpoint, we\u2019ve got levelized fee earnings throughout the year. So the optionality actually comes from the customer, but not the pipeline, so variability from the customer, not the pipeline. Craig Shere : Got you. So the increasing contribution of storage really doesn\u2019t impact seasonality. Chuck Kelley : Could you repeat that? Craig Shere : So the fact that you\u2019re increasing the amount of storage and the pricing is looking more attractive that doesn\u2019t have any impact on the seasonality question? Chuck Kelley : Correct. We\u2019re seeing a step up in our storage revenues based on higher rates and the expansion that came online in April. And we\u2019ll have an additional expansion come online in April of 2023 where you\u2019ll see another step up in our storage revenues. Pierce Norton : So, Craig, the only thing I\u2019d add to that, this is Pierce, is post Winter Storm Uri, the value of storage has increased. And so we do have customers that lay that seasonal spread and that benefit goes to them. But we also have utilities that are putting gas into storage every single month during the summers getting ready for that winter pull that they have during their peak demand from basically December through March. Craig Shere : Got you. Thank you. Operator : Next question from Jean Ann from Salisbury, sorry, Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. good morning. It looks like there has been some movement on the open season for gas takeaway options out of the back end, but it seems like they\u2019re targeting 2026, which is kind of a long time from now. Do you think that will be soon enough to not constrain gas growth out of the Bakken? Kevin Burdick : Jean Ann, this is Kevin. Yes, I think we feel good about the timing of that. There\u2019s some other smaller scale things that have gone on up there that have created a little more capacity. So we think that timing lines up pretty well with the kind of our outlook of where gas volumes go. I would remind you, there\u2019s still, we believe 300 million, 400 million a day of Canadian gas that can be displaced coming out of the Bakken. And so that\u2019s there\u2019s capacity there that just may not on the surface look like it\u2019s there. In addition, we can always, if you get tight and we\u2019re I say, we\u2019re wrong or we\u2019re a little bit late, you can always recover ethane to reduce the MMBtus that go into the pipe. So we \u2013 all in all, we feel good about where we\u2019re at. Jean Ann Salisbury : That makes sense. Thank you. And there has been a trend of NGL integrated midstream companies, buying GMP companies, which ONEOK has not really participated in. If this trend continues, do you see it potentially impacting your rates or your close on the Gulf Coast negatively? Pierce Norton : Well, I think I\u2019ll let Kevin get into the details of this, but we believe that the positions that we have in the other basins are the right thing for us to pursue based on our positions with our assets and the things that we see in the future. I mean, it\u2019s \u2013 could it have a downward pressure on some of the volumes? Yes. But I\u2019d remind everybody that the rates that we get as far as margins in the Permian, in the mid-continent are some of our lowest ones. So as far as having a really material impact, we don\u2019t see that in the future. Kevin, you got anything to add to that? Kevin Burdick : No, I\u2019d just say that with some of those transactions, obviously, we take a look a lot of things, but they just haven\u2019t been a fit for us. One of the things I would put out there is that me that we could have continued to grow volumes on our West Texas LPG system. Many of those contracts have quite a bit of term left, and many of them are with producers who have taken kind rights. So regardless who the processor is we believe those volumes will stay with us. So that\u2019s some of the other dynamics at play. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. That\u2019s very helpful. That\u2019s all for me. Thank you. Operator : The next question from Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi, good morning, folks. And thanks for all the clarity on the volume trend. So one question for me on the CapEx side of things, could you talk a little bit about what kind of inflation trends you\u2019re seeing in terms of building costs versus what you had budgeted at the start of the year? Pierce Norton : Yes. From a cost perspective, we\u2019ve probably seen more pressure on outside services more than anything as we think about our projects. In many cases for the projects, we were working on, especially MB-5 and Demicks III that equipment had been purchased years ago before the projects were paused. So we had a lot of that taken care of. On the new equipment that we\u2019re ordering and the new materials we\u2019re ordering probably as much impact from a supply chain perspective just on a timeliness or schedule perspective than cost. So those are some of the things we\u2019re obviously watching closely and staying on top of hadn\u2019t impacted any of our scheduled dates or our dollar amounts that we\u2019ve got these projects approved for. So we still feel very good that we\u2019re right on top of on budget and on schedule. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Thanks for that. And then one housekeeping question for me, it seems like, your reconciliation, you had called out a 10 million sequential decrease in the NGL segments from commodity price differentials. I thought the commodity price differentials kind of widened out a little bit in Q2 versus Q1. Am I just looking at that correctly? And I was curious about that line item? Kevin Burdick : Sunil, this is Kevin. Yes, that\u2019s just with our assets and with \u2013 we\u2019ve got assets in Conway and Belvieu and storage, that\u2019s just the delta between sometimes we have an opportunity to make money than as different prices per by commodity. So how different prices compare of the different commodities in how we move barrels around and how we sell barrels. And so that 10 million was just lower than the \u2013 sequentially lower in the first \u2013 than the first quarter in that part of our business. But it\u2019s all in is part of that kind of how we\u2019re optimizing our system. Sunil Sibal : Okay. And anything to read into that from for the second half of this year? Kevin Burdick : No, that bounces \u2013 that\u2019ll bounce around quarter-to-quarter just in the sequential comparison. Sunil Sibal : Got it. Thanks. Thanks for all the color. Operator : Next question from James Carreker from U.S. Capital Advisors. Your is open. Please go ahead. James Carreker : Hey, thanks for the question. Just thinking about the Medford outage some more, were those NGLs fractionated there largely sold into Conway, or they sold down in Mount Belvieu and just making sure that there\u2019s with that outage there\u2019s sufficient pipe capacity to move incremental barrels down to Mont Belvieu to get fracked? Sheridan Swords : James, this is Sheridan. We don\u2019t designate by frac where we sell barrels. We can \u2013 with our integrated system, we can deliver barrels from any of our frac into the Mont Belvieu complex. And with that frac being down, we can get these barrels into the Mont Belvieu complex, mainly because of our Arbuckle II asset that we had just brought online that we know had significant extra capacity on it for upside. So we\u2019re able to deliver through the raw feed system down to Mont Belvieu. And if we need to, we can use the purity system to do that as well. Since we don\u2019t have as much purities coming off the \u2013 we don\u2019t have any purities coming off the Medford frac. We have a little bit extra capacity on that. So from a pipeline perspective, we feel very good about getting the product into Mont Belvieu. James Carreker : Thanks for that. And I guess maybe one follow-up, maybe it\u2019s minor, but just noticed on this earnings presentation, you\u2019re now saying greater than $0.06 bundled rate on your Gulf Coast, Permian volumes versus prior approximately $0.06, is that maybe a trend that continues or any other color on what\u2019s going on there? Sheridan Swords : Yes, a lot of it, I think we\u2019ll see our rates tick up a little bit, and you\u2019re seeing that because of the inflationary escalators that we have on our system. James Carreker : Okay. Thank you. Pierce Norton : Thank you. Operator : It appears that there is no further question at this time. Mr. Andrew, I\u2019d like to turn the conference back to you for any additional or closing remark. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in October and we\u2019ll extend until we release earnings in early November. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : This concludes today's call. Thank you for your participation.

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Betsy, and welcome to ONEOK's Third Quarter 2022 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions.  Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. [Operator Instructions].  With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us on our call this morning. We appreciate your interest and investment in our company. On the call today is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Chuck Kelley, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Pipelines.  Yesterday, we announced strong third quarter 2022 earnings, affirmed our 2022 financial guidance midpoints and provided our 2023 growth outlook to exceed $4 billion of adjusted EBITDA. Our third quarter results demonstrate the resiliency of our strategic and integrated assets in some of the most highly productive U.S. shale basins, and our employees who are dedicated -- have dedicated themselves to the safety and reliability and sustainability of our operations. Looking forward, we expect continued strength in producer activity and increased volumes and higher earnings from our fee-based services in all of our business segments in a favorable commodity price and increasing demand backdrop.  So with that, I will turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance and the expectations and our insurance update. So Walt? Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK's third quarter 2022 net income totaled $432 million or $0.96 per share, a 10% increase compared with the third quarter of 2021 and a 4% increase when compared with the second quarter. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA was $902 million, a 4% year-over-year increase and an increase from the second quarter. Higher results benefited from increased Rocky Mountain region NGL and natural gas volumes, higher realized commodity prices, net of hedging and higher average fee rates. Additionally, we had lower interest expense due to our lower debt balances and increased capitalized interest.  Third quarter 2022 results reflected our $5 million property insurance deductible related to the Medford incident and approximately $30 million of losses related to the 45-day business interruption waiting period under the terms of our insurance policy.  We received notice in September that our Medford property insurers agreed to pay $100 million unallocated first installment of insurance proceeds. And as of today, we received $45 million of that amount and expect to receive the remaining amount before year-end. We've applied this cash receipts to our outstanding insurance receivables.  After the waiting period ended, we incurred costs subsequent to the 45-day business interruption waiting period of $21.7 million, primarily related to third quarter -- I'm sorry, to third-party fractionation agreements and recorded a partial impairment charge of $6.7 million, representing the value of associated with certain Medford facility property based on the limited assessments completed to date. There is no income statement impacts of these incurred business interruption costs or impairment charges as they are fully offset by insurance receivables.  We continue sharing information with our insurance carriers to refine ongoing business interruption insurance coverage and to determine the ultimate path to replacement of this temporary loss of fractionation capacity. We will provide additional updates as we move forward in this process when material information is available. And lastly, for the third quarter, we ended with higher NGL inventory levels that have since been sold forward, and we will realize $17 million earnings benefit from those sales in the fourth quarter and first quarter of 2023. As of September 30, our net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.8x, and we continue to view 3.5x or lower as our long-term aspirational goal. We currently have no long-term debt maturities until September of 2023 and we have no material exposure to floating interest rates through our current outstanding long-term debt.  Yesterday, we affirmed our 2022 guidance midpoints of $1.69 billion for net income and $3.62 billion for adjusted EBITDA. We now expect total capital expenditures of $1.2 billion, driven by our acceleration of spending on the MB-5 fractionator and smaller scale expansion projects that were not previously planned for '22 across our 3 business segments that will contribute to growth in 2023. Key drivers for our 2023 outlook of a more than 10% increase compared with our 2022 midpoints to exceed $4 billion in adjusted EBITDA include continued strength in fee-based earnings and rates, stable to growing producer activity providing higher natural gas and natural gas liquids volumes in our system and expected higher realized commodity prices due to higher hedges. These tailwinds into 2023 from our base business, additional insurance recoveries related to Medford, and our strong financial position provide us confidence in our double-digit earnings growth outlook for next year.  I'll now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Let's start with our Natural Gas Liquids segment. Rocky Mountain region NGL volumes increased 17% year-over-year and 12% compared with the second quarter 2022, driven by volume recovery following the April severe weather and overall volume growth, including higher incentivized ethane on our system. Volumes have remained strong in the region with September averaging more than 380,000 barrels per day. Third quarter Mid-Continent NGL volumes decreased year-over-year and compared with the second quarter, due primarily to lower ethane recovery on our system. In the Permian Basin, NGL volumes were unchanged year-over-year and compared with the prior quarter. With the recent third-party plant connection in October, we expect volumes from this region to increase through the remainder of this year and into 2023. We also continue to see interest from customers seeking additional NGL takeaway out of the Permian, so we will continue to evaluate future low-cost expansions on our system.  From a 2022 NGL volume guidance perspective, we expect to be near the midpoint of our guidance range, due mostly to the ethane rejection we have been seeing in the Mid-Continent and the impact of the April storms.  Regarding ethane. Beginning in September, we started to see lower demand for ethane from the pet chems leading to more ethane rejection across most regions. The decrease in utilization has been driven by lower NGL demand globally, especially in China and Europe, along with some pet chem outages. We expect ethane demand to remain muted somewhat in the fourth quarter and into early 2023. And this has been factored into our 2022 and 2023 expectations.  As we sit today, we are seeing ethane and ethylene inventories starting to get worked off, which we believe will lead to increasing demand in 2023. As for ONEOK, it is typical that we don't incentivize as much ethane out of the Bakken during the winter season due to higher natural gas prices and natural gas demand, but we will continue to be opportunistic.  As it relates to our 2023 outlook, we expect the Permian to be in full ethane recovery, the Mid-Continent to be in partial recovery and the Rockies continuing to provide opportunities to incentivize recovery. Construction continues on our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu, which we still expect to be completed early in the second quarter of 2023 and is reflected in our updated 2022 capital guidance.  Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. Producer activity remained strong in the Rocky Mountain region with third quarter processed volumes averaging 1.4 billion cubic feet per day, a record quarter for us. Our average fee rate also increased, reflecting the impact of contract escalators, higher volumes on higher fee component contracts and a larger percentage of our total volumes from the Rockies. On a go-forward basis, we expect this average rate to range between $1.10 and $1.20. Year-to-date, we've connected 244 wells in the region. We now expect to complete approximately 375 well connections near or at the low end of our guidance due to the impact of the April storms, timing of some wells coming on and availability of completion crews and materials. Activity still remains high, just some timing elements that we now expect will push a few large pad completions into next year. These same factors also led us adjusting our volume expectations for 2022 to be near or slightly below the guidance range.  There are currently more than 40 rigs and 18 completion crews operating in the basin, with more than 20 rigs and approximately half the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. As we've said before, approximately 15 rigs on our acreage to maintain natural gas production at current levels. But with more than 20 currently on our acreage, we expect to see higher well connections and volumes in 2023 compared with 2022.  The 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake III processing plant under construction remains on schedule to be completed in the first quarter and will bring needed capacity to the region. The basin-wide DUC inventory remained stable at around 500, considering the increasing rig count and activity with half of those on our dedicated acreage.  In the Mid-Continent region, we continue to see increased activity with 4 rigs now operating on our acreage and more than 50 rigs basin-wide. We expect steady to increasing activity and volumes through the remainder of the year and into next year with the majority of rigs basin-wide driving additional NGLs to our system.  In the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, with strong year-to-date results benefiting from the continued increasing demand for natural gas storage and transportation services, we now expect this segment to exceed the high end of its guidance range of $400 million to $430 million. We are highly subscribed for our storage service in Oklahoma and Texas at higher rates and for longer terms, including our recent expansion of our Texas storage facilities, which is now fully subscribed through 2032.  Additionally, we are expanding our storage capabilities in Oklahoma, enabling an additional 4 billion cubic feet of storage capacity to be contracted. This project is expected to be complete in April 2023 and is nearly 90% subscribed through 2029, and we are also evaluating an additional expansion of our Texas storage assets. And lastly, before I turn the call back to Pierce, we began a compression electrification project on our interstate Viking Gas Transmission pipeline to improve operational reliability and provide future greenhouse gas emissions reductions on the system. The project is expected to cost $95 million and be completed in the third quarter of 2023 and is included in our outlook.  Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Walt and Kevin. As we enter the last couple of months of 2022 and look forward to the next year, I'm proud of our employees and want to thank them for their hard work and contributions who continue to focus on operating safely, sustainably and environmentally responsible and are key to our success as a midstream operator. How we operate is important, but also how we engage with our employees, communities and other stakeholders is equally as important. Also important for ONEOK is to remain focused on meeting the growing energy demand for today even as it looks forward to helping drive the energy transformation needs for the future.  We also recently announced that ONEOK joined with 2 other large publicly traded companies based in Oklahoma and a venture capital firm to fund an effort to transform Oklahoma into a hub of energy technology start-ups and redefine a sector that has shaped the region's economy for more than a century.  We believe this partnership aligns to our long-term business strategy, which includes potential low-carbon investments that contribute to low -- long-term growth and business diversification. ONEOK has been building the right teams and resources to better participate in the innovative practices and technologies that it sees now and those that may play a role in the future. Before I turn the call over for Q&A, I wanted to highlight an important ESG item we mentioned in our earnings release. ONEOK's MSCI ESG rating was recently reviewed and updated by MSCI to AAA from AA, and we maintained our industry leader status. As I previously said, our ESG efforts are a source of pride for ONEOK, and we are committed to continuing to make progress in these important areas.  With that, operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. The first question today comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Brian Reynolds : Maybe to revisit some of the assumptions in your prepared remarks around '23 earnings growth, it seems like we should see some tailwinds on volumes and hedges rolling higher. I was curious if you could just dive a little bit further into the ethane recovery assumptions for '23. Historically, you guys have been pretty conservative on this assumption, but curious as how we should think about how Btu concerns plateauing ethane demand for the next few years and Permian nat gas tightness impacted some of your assumptions as it relates to Rockies recovery into 2023 and that 10% earnings growth? Kevin Burdick : Brian, this is Kevin. I'll start and then Sheridan can add in. Think about the overall 2023 growth outlook, we expect our volumes are going to be up, both NGL and Gathering and Processing in all of our basins with the tailwinds, with the existing rigs we're seeing today as those carry over into '23. So volume growth is going to be the primary driver. You've also got -- you're going to have a full year of the contract fee escalations. So we'll see a full year of that.  You've got a step-up in our hedging. If you look at the hedge prices we have in '23 compared to '22, that's going to be a significant step up there. The ethane recovery assumptions are pretty similar to what we had going into '22. As we mentioned, full recovery we expect out of Permian, partial in the Mid-Continent, and we'll continue to incentivize ethane out of the Bakken, where appropriate. Sheridan Swords : The one thing I would add on that is when we look at '23 as we looked in '22, we have limited incentivized ethane coming out of the Bakken factored in. We really see that as an opportunistic -- opportunity going forward. Brian Reynolds : Great. I appreciate that color. Maybe just to pivot towards capital allocation for a minute. ONEOK is trending towards its leverage target and payout ratio targets. Obviously, there are some concerns that were partially alleviated with earnings around the insurance proceeds. But I was curious of how we should think about the return of capital framework looking into '23 given that you've had the same dividend since 2019, but that said, never cut at the same time. So any color there, I appreciate it. Pierce Norton : So Brian, this is Pierce. With our positive earnings growth indications for 2023, our payout ratio and our debt-to-EBITDA metrics are indicating that we are going to have more flexibility to execute on one or more of the capital allocation levers that are going to be available to us to create that value for our shareholders as we progress through 2023. So that's the way I'd answer your question there. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : I wanted to ask the latest on Northern Border. Where does it stand in terms of gas coming from Canada versus the Bakken? Is there any more room there? And then related to that, any updates on a potential expansion project on North Border? Kevin Burdick : Yes, Michael, it's Kevin. For your first question, we estimate there's still probably 300 million to 400 million a day of gas coming from Canada. That will continue to get displaced from Bakken as Bakken grows. So you've got some opportunities there. And also, we're in active discussions with multiple parties on various residue takeaway and demand projects, actually some demand projects in Basin. We have secured about 100 million a day of takeaway solution on that's going out south that doesn't go to Northern Border. So that's going to help. So we don't think there's one single solution that provides -- that's going to provide that, but we do believe we'll be able to find and there will be the necessary capacity out of Basin as we move forward. Michael Blum : Okay. I guess second question, just wanted to ask -- I know you haven't really made a decision yet about whether you're going to rebuild Medford or maybe build something else at Mont Belvieu or otherwise. So just curious if you could talk to the dynamics, if you do choose to not rebuild Medford, does that change anything in terms of the market dynamics between Conway and Mont Belvieu for you as it relates to Sterling? Sheridan Swords : No. I mean, there will be a little bit of an impact on that if we build down in Mont Belvieu if you put down in there. But today, or when Medford was up, most of our liquids was transported down Sterling anyway to the Mont Belvieu market. So we think overall, the market dynamics are not going to be impacted that much, whether we build it at Medford or at Mont Belvieu. Operator : The next question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Salisbury : In the third quarter, there was more ethane recovered from the Rockies and less from the Mid-Con than I would have expected. Is it fair to say that most of the time you would recover marginal ethane from the Mid-Con before the Rockies and that maybe it was specifically due to AECO price blowouts in the quarter that it was a little flipped from usual? Sheridan Swords : Yes. We look at the gas basis as really what kind of drives us on which basin we're going to incentivize. So yes, AECO pricing versus what's going on in the Mid-Continent will drive what's going -- where we incentivize ethane coming out of there. We did see a lot of benefit in the third quarter coming out of the Rockies due to the basis and what we could secure gas prices for and so on for ethane. So that we see that as a great opportunistic 2 basins that we can incentivize at times and kind of play that gas base between the 2. So we think that's a big advantage to our system. Jean Salisbury : Okay. That's helpful. And assuming that Bakken does go back to higher rejection in the next couple of quarters, I think the Northern Border Btu spec at that receipt point is probably going to exceed the 1,100, which I think Northern Border has said, is kind of the max that they really want. Does anything happen then? Or is that just all kind of a whole FERC process to potential cap in? Kevin Burdick : Jean Ann, this is Kevin. Yes, as you reject more ethane, that will raise the Btu content on Northern Border. If you were back to about where we were pre-COVID and that number was north of 1,100, right now, there is not a spec on the pipe. So the Northern Border, it's our understand they'll watch it. They've got some levers to pull if it gets too high and downstream markets start to have concerns.  They continue to work with shippers and all the relevant stakeholders to potentially go back to FERC for a spec, but we don't have an exact timing on that. So we'll watch it. If it gets to the point where it gets -- the Btu level gets too high and downstream markets start raising issues, then we always have the option to recover ethane to lower it back. And if we do that, if it's required at that point, then that would require -- I mean, that would be at full rates, not at an incentivized rate. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Stephen McGee : This is Steve McGee on for Jeremy. Just starting along the insurance line, as far as business interruption insurance goes. Just trying to get an idea of what's covered under that. Does that include optimization, marketing in there as well? And then for 2023, does that include the business insurance as well? Walter Hulse : Well, as we said on the last call, the coverage that we have is that we are entitled to receive coverage so that we get return to what we would have made, but for this event. So it's system-wide. So if that does impact other parts of the business like optimization and marketing, that gets factored into our BI calculation.  The money that we received in September, [indiscernible] that we booked in September, I wouldn't necessarily look at as a run rate because there's still are some moving parts that we're working with the insurance companies to refine how we look at BI going forward. Those costs were predominantly the third-party frac costs. And as we work with them and refine how much optimization in the market, we do expect to receive some benefit from that going forward. In 2023, we expect BI coverage to continue. And at that point, be on a pretty regular month-to-month catch up so that we're hoping that you really don't see any real variation from the BI insurance going forward. Stephen McGee : Understood. And then, I guess, flipping over to CapEx, you pulled some forward, well connects kind of towards the lower end of the guide, but still up a little bit this year. So I'm guessing most of the uptick this year is MB-5. Should we expect, I guess, a little bit less CapEx into 2023 now because of that? And just if you could walk us through, I guess, that raise this year and then what that looks like in the next year as well. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Steve, it's Kevin. Yes, MB-5 was a significant mover in moving some of that capital forward into '22. We also had a compressor station up north in the Bakken that we moved forward with that will add to our growth in '23. We referenced the Viking compression project in the -- in our opening remarks. And then we just had a handful of smaller routine growth-type projects that typically have extremely strong multiple -- strong earnings power from them, and that will contribute in '23 as well. So just a combination of those factors are what led into the increase in '22.  You're thinking about '23 correctly. If -- once we complete MB-5 and Demicks Lake III, that would lead you probably to a little step down in capital barring other projects that we continue to work on that could prove. So that's the unknown at this point is we're constantly working on new projects that -- and as they reach FID, we'll announce them. But absent those, then yes, you would expect CapEx to maybe come down a little bit in '23. Operator : The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : First, I would love to touch on the 2023 guidance and delve into some of the assumptions here. Mainly, if you could provide some color on your price deck assumption and then in terms of Bakken activity, in particular, any color you can share on assumptions for rig counts, well completions, exit-to-exit growth in oil or gas?  And then granted that the ethane recovery dynamic remains in development and can be volatile, but any sort of color you can give on the recovery assumption in 2023 versus the level that you just reported for the third quarter 2022? Kevin Burdick : Theresa, this is Kevin. And we're not -- again, we're not going to get into the detailed guidance specifics that we'll release probably sometime next -- early next year. But I would tell you, as we think about price decks and activity levels, there's probably more rig. If you just look at today, there's more activity in the basins that we're looking at, that we're talking about than we have in that outlook. So the activity levels we're seeing today are plenty strong to help us achieve that exceedings of $4 billion. Theresa Chen : Got it. And in the Gathering and Processing segment, that $1.16 average fee rate, quite a step-up from the previous run rate and I understand the color you shared on the fee escalators and the composition of it. Just trying to think about the trajectory of growth here. Was there anything in particular driving this? And as we think about the escalators in 2023 and beyond, should we assume similar magnitudes of step-ups? Or generally speaking, how should we think about this line? Sheridan Swords : Theresa, this is Sheridan. When you think about that margin which is driving that increased step up, a lot of it was on escalation is where it came from. Some on the contract mix being on. We got volume on higher contracts or more margin contracts and on others as we go forward. The big thing that's going to drive as we get into '23, [indiscernible] that trajectory is what the inflationary escalators are going to be, and we'll have to see how inflation comes out and how the -- we go against CPI and most of the time on that, how CPI reacts in '23 versus '22 is going to be a big driver on where we land on that and going forward. So it's really going to be based on inflation, would be the biggest piece. Operator : Next question comes from Michael Cusimano with Pickering Energy Partners. Michael Cusimano : I wanted to first focus on the Natural Gas Liquids optimization and marketing number, I think you all noted a 44 million decrease sequentially. Was any of that a result of Medford at all? Or was it just other -- I think you all mentioned some price differentials and timing on the NGLs? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. Yes, Medford did have an impact on those numbers, and that's factored in there. And that 45-day waiting period, we did take some hits in optimization and marketing there. And as you mentioned, the other things we have is spreads were a little bit narrowed during that time. We had forward sales due to Medford, that we push forward sales forward, that we will receive some of that money or $17 million of that money in the first quarter and second quarter -- I'm sorry, fourth quarter and first quarter as we go forward here, we will get that $17 million back. So that -- those are the 3 main factors as you see in that drop in optimization and marketing. Michael Cusimano : Okay. And just to clarify, you would expect to be -- in the future, you would expect to be -- or you expect to recoup insurance proceeds in the event of any optimization of marketing reductions, what would happen? Pierce Norton : We do. We do expect to get insurance proceeds, but a lot of that $45 million as we -- part of that is in the 45-day waiting period, which we wouldn't get that because that's on us. But going forward, we expect to get any losses in marketing and optimization that we would have received if Medford had been up, we expect insurance to cover that. Michael Cusimano : Okay. That is helpful. And then previously, you all have given like a current month run rate out of the Bakken for NGL takeaway. I think you gave a September number. Any indication you can have for what October looks like going forward? Kevin Burdick : Michael, we're not going to provide kind of numbers in Q4. We gave you the number for September. That was a -- that's a really good run rate if you think about it as we move through. We get into the fourth quarter and you start bringing weather into play. So that's why we backed off that. Michael Cusimano : Okay. Understood. And then last one, if I can. If I break up the insurance proceeds from one allocation for business interruption, the other for property loss, are you all viewing the property loss as replacement cost? Or is it getting back the frac capacity to where like MB-5 recover some of that? Just trying to think of like how that shapes out from the way you and the insurance company are thinking about it? Walter Hulse : We have specific coverage that would cover the replacement or the repair of the facility to get it back to the point where we would achieve the 210,000 barrels of capacity that we currently have. So we have property coverage to put us back in the same position that we were before. And then -- but we do have the flexibility with those dollars that it would cost to do that to build it wherever we want to do that, and that's what we're still considering at this point. Going forward, we would expect to likely not get as much -- not get unallocated money. This was -- it should be allocated out for the BI on a monthly basis once we get into kind of a monthly rhythm. And the property will be what it is as we spend the money for the repair or replacement of the facility. Michael Cusimano : Okay. That's helpful. Would MB-5, since it was already undergoing construction, be something that you could allocate any sort of property loss to? Or would it be in MB-6 and beyond if you wanted to? Walter Hulse : No. MB-5 is its own stand-alone project that we built because we needed it. And -- we -- obviously, it will help us a little bit as it comes on and we are going to be in our natural ramp-up phase. But that is part of our capital and the proceeds that we received for the repair or replacement of the Medford facility will be discrete, and it will cover those costs. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you, all. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Have a good day, and thank you for joining us. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, MJ, and welcome, everyone, to ONEOK's Fourth Quarter and Year-end 2022 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pearce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew, and good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us this morning. On today's call is Walter Hulse, our Chief Financial Officer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development, and Kevin Burdick, Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines. Yesterday, we announced strong fourth quarter and full year '22 performance. We met our 2022 financial guidance expectations despite weather-related events and a significant operational incident. We also achieved our ninth consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth in 2022. Through the efforts of our workforce and the resiliency of our assets, we have provided exceptional value for our stakeholders and have positioned ONEOK to continue delivering growth in 2023. I believe the term resiliency is a great description descriptor of 2022 and will continue to be a focus of our operations going forward. Our people, assets and earnings continue to prove their resiliency flexibility and stability. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we also provided 2023 financial and volume guidance expectations. Higher natural gas processing and NGL volumes and strong fee-based earnings are expected to contribute to higher earnings in 2023 as we continue to focus on both growing our core business and innovating for future opportunities. There are key differentiators of ONEOK's business that have proven critical to our past success and offer us confidence in the future. These differentiators provide stability, resiliency and unique opportunities for growth. First, our solid and growing base business, which features strategically positioned assets in some of the most productive U.S. shale basins connected with some of the largest and most well-capitalized producers in the U.S. who provide stable and growing supply to our systems. Our margins in our core businesses are approximately 90% fee-based with minimum direct commodity price exposure because of our proactive hedging strategy; second, our strong balance sheet and investment-grade credit ratings, which provides significant financial flexibility. We've reduced our leverage to below 3.5x and significant -- a significant milestone for us. We provided investors with more than 25 years of dividend stability and growth not cutting our dividend during the COVID challenge years and recently announced a dividend increase. Third, our proven track record of intentional and disciplined growth. We continue to benefit from significant operating leverage across our systems, enabling us to continue focusing on lower capital, high-return projects and investments to support producer growth across our operations. Our strong return on invested capital is a source of pride for ONEOK and is a key metric for evaluating our management's team performance annually. Our nearly 15% ROIC in 2022 highlights the scrutiny that we place on investments, the efficiency of our capital and the high quality of our projects earnings, and this disciplined growth also approaches and will continue. Finally, the continued demand of the energy products and services that we provide, which are vital to our national security and the quality of life, in which we believe will play an important role in a transforming energy future. U.S. natural gas and natural gas liquids remain abundant and reliable. The products that we move will continue to provide much needed energy domestically and globally. We enter 2023 from a position of strength driven by a year of solid financial and operational performance. And as you can see, there are many reasons why we are confident and optimistic about ONEOK's future. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. As we detailed in yesterday's press release, we expect continued growth in our businesses in 2023 after achieving our 2022 financial guidance even with some challenging events. ONEOK's fourth quarter and full year 2022 net income totaled $485 million and $1.72 billion, respectively, representing increases of 28% for the fourth quarter and 15% for the full year compared with the same period in 2021. Adjusted EBITDA also increased year-over-year, totaling $967 million in the fourth quarter 2022 and $3.62 billion for the full year. Our strong financial performance was driven by increased producer activity, higher realized commodity prices, higher average fee rates and higher natural gas storage and transportation services. In January, we increased our quarterly dividend to $0.95 per share or $3.82 per share on an annualized basis, marking a return to dividend growth following 3 years of dividend stability. In November 2022, we completed a $750 million senior notes offering due in 2032, generating net proceeds of $742 million, which was primarily used to repay short-term debt. And just yesterday, we redeemed $425 million of 5% senior notes due September 23 with cash on hand. Our year-end net debt-to-EBITDA on an annualized run rate basis was 3.46x, in line with our previously discussed aspirational target of 3.5x or less. As it relates to Medford, we reached an agreement with our insurers in early January to settle all claims related to the incident for total insurance payments of $930 million, which included $100 million that was paid in 2022. We received the remaining $830 million in the first quarter of 2023, and applied approximately $50 million to an outstanding 2022 insurance receivable. We provided a table in our earnings release showing the line-by-line details. The remaining $780 million will be recorded as a gain in our operating income in the first quarter of 2023. As Pierce mentioned, with yesterday's earnings announcement, we provided 2023 financial guidance, including a net income midpoint of $2.41 billion and an EPS midpoint of $5.36 per share diluted share. We also provided and adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $4.575 billion. Our guidance includes the net effect of the onetime insurance settlement gain of $780 million and future method related costs, primarily third-party fractionation, which we estimate will total $240 million in 2023. We expect Medford related costs to be significantly lower in 2024 due to our ability to fully utilize the MB-5 fractionator to substantially reduce third-party fractionation costs compared with 2023. By taking the full settlement of $780 million, less the $240 million of expected third-party costs in 2023, you get a total approximately $540 million related to the settlement that has been assumed in our $4.575 billion adjusted EBITDA guidance midpoint for 2023. Excluding the effect of the settlement and the third-party costs of $540 million, this still amounts to more than $4 billion, double-digit earnings growth which we referenced on our last earnings call. We also expect double-digit earnings growth at the midpoint for both natural gas liquids and natural gas gathering and processing segments driven by higher volume expectations across our operations. Kevin will provide more detail on each of the operating segments in a moment. Our 2023 guidance assumes producer activity associated with WTI crude oil prices in the range of what we are currently seeing in the market. We expect total capital expenditures of $1.38 billion, which includes growth in maintenance capital. This midpoint reflects the investments necessary to keep up with expected increase in producer activity, the completion of MD5 early in the second quarter of 2023 and also more than $300 million related to MD6 this year. Excluding the MD6 expenditures, our total CapEx would have been lower than 2022. Our 2023 CapEx guidance does not include the Saro Connector pipeline or any other projects that have not reached a final investment decision. Our routine growth capital accounts for higher number of well connects and our higher return projects such as natural gas storage expansions, pump stations and compression expansions to meet customer needs. Finally, as it relates to the 15% alternative minimum tax associated with the inflation Reduction Act, we expect the AMT to have an impact on our cash taxes beginning with the 2024 tax year. You can find details in our 10 -K when it is filed later today. I will now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. We saw strong full year natural gas gathering and NGL volumes on our system in 2022 despite several weather events during the year, providing continued growth in our primarily fee-based earnings. NGL volumes were particularly strong in the Rocky Mountain region, increasing 12% year-over-year due to higher activity levels and increased opportunities to recover ethane from the region. Well connects across our operations increased 24% compared with 2021, and we saw a solid return of activity in the Mid-Continent driving a significant increase in well connections in the region and higher natural gas processing volumes on our system. We'll continue to see the benefits of this activity throughout 2023 as volumes ramp. Our Natural Gas Pipelines segment exceeded its 2022 financial guidance range on higher earnings from long-term storage services and higher rates from renegotiated contracts customers continue to see the value in our storage assets, and we continue to evaluate opportunities to expand these services. Turning to 2023. A Key drivers for our higher 2023 guidance includes stable producer activity, providing higher natural gas and NGL volumes across our systems, continued strength in fee-based earnings and rates and higher expected realized commodity prices due to hedges placed at higher price levels compared with 2022. At the midpoints, our 2023 volume guidance would result in a 7% increase in total NGL volumes and an 11% increase in total natural gas processing volumes compared with 2022. In the natural gas liquids segment, we expect volume growth to be driven by strong producer levels, a producer activity across our operations, a continuing the momentum we saw from producers in 2022. Higher average fee rates will also contribute to the segment's earnings as contract escalators continue to be realized throughout the year. NGL market dynamics point toward a continued improvement in global demand with China reopening and with lower natural gas prices, resulting in an attractive environment for U.S. pet chems. We expect this current market to drive increased activity from the U.S. petrochemical industry relative to global pet chems while the U.S. position being with the U.S. position being one of the lowest on the global cost curve. On our system, we expect the Permian Basin to stay in high ethane recovery in 2023 and for the Mid-Continent to be in partial recovery as natural gas prices fluctuate seasonally. We also expect to continue to see opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region this year. We are on track to complete our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu early in the second quarter of 2023. And we recently announced MB-6 which we expect to be complete in the first quarter of 2025. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. We expect volume growth again this year in both the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions, driven by producer activity levels, resulting in more well connections than in 2022. In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processed volumes to grow 11% at the midpoint compared with 2022 and averaged nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day in 2023. Already this year, despite winter weather, we've reached a process volumes as high as 1.46 billion cubic feet per day in February, a new record for the segment. We completed construction on the 200 million cubic feet per day Demicks Lake III processing plant this month, providing our customers with needed capacity as well as operational redundancy. Activity levels in the Williston Basin remains strong, particularly considering we are just entering March. There are currently more than 40 rigs and 22 completion crews operating in the basin compared with just over 30 rigs and 13 completion crews at this time last year. Producers remain committed to the region, and we anticipate a few more rigs will return as we move into spring. At our guidance midpoint, we expect to connect 500 wells in the region this year a nearly 40% increase compared with 2022. We've already connected nearly 90 wells through February and have remained steady at more than 20 rigs operating on our dedicated acreage. Additionally, there remains a large inventory of around 500 DUCs basin-wide with approximately half on our acreage. Keep in mind that in the Bakken, producer economics are driven by crude oil and customers -- our customers are some of the largest and most well capitalized in the country. This means recent fluctuations in commodity prices and specifically lower natural gas prices have not had an impact on producer activity levels on our acreage. We also expect gas-to-oil ratios to remain strong and continue to trend higher in the future, which can drive volume on our systems even without increased producer activity. In the Mid-Continent region, we continue to see positive activity with approximately 10 rigs currently operating on our acreage and more than 50 across the region. We expect process volumes to grow 12% at our guidance midpoint compared with 2022 and average more than 700 million cubic feet per day in 2023. Rig activity across the basin will also continue to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the natural gas pipeline segment, we continue to expect strong demand for natural gas storage and transportation services in 2023. At the end of 2022, nearly 80% of our natural gas storage capacity was contracted under long-term agreements, and our pipeline transportation capacity was nearly 95% contracted. We expect similar levels in 2023. Work continues on a project that will expand our storage capabilities in Oklahoma by 4 billion cubic feet and we are currently evaluating reactivating previously idled storage facilities in Oklahoma and Texas. Construction also continues on our Viking pipeline compression electrification project. The Oklahoma storage expansion and Viking project are both slated for completion this year. Additionally, in late December 2022, a ONEOK subsidiary filed a presidential permit application with the FERC to construct and operate new international border crossing facilities at the U.S. and Mexico border. The proposed border facilities would connect upstream with a potential ONEOK intrastate natural gas pipeline called the Swaro Connector pipeline and with a new pipeline under development in Mexico for ultimate delivery to an export facility on the West Coast of Mexico. Since the announcement, there have been several positive developments related to the potential LNG export project. And a final investment decision on the ONEOK pipeline is expected in mid-2023. Pearce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, Walt. We covered a lot today, and we have many reasons to feel confident in our 2023 guidance and our expectations for more growth this year. Everything that we've talked about today, from our 2022 performance to our future expectations and key differentiators for growth are all underscored by our commitment and focus on safety and environmental performance. Our company and our industry aren't immune to incidents, but I'm proud of how we have responded when challenges do occur and how we continue working to improve our performance going forward, focusing on safety and the health of our employees and the communities near where we operate. From our environmental perspective, we've made significant progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, achieving reductions that equate to approximately 20% of our total 2030 reduction target. Our employees' dedication to meeting customers' needs while operating our assets in a safe, reliable and environmentally responsible manner continues to drive our strong operational growth and financial performance year after year, and we're set up well for continued growth in 2023. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question is from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Brian Reynolds : Maybe to start off on the guidance. Last year, we had a couple of weather events and a material amount of frac capacity come offline, but guidance was still achieved. While some activity seems to have gotten pushed to 23% from '22, the '25 guide yearly seems similar to 2022 original base guidance. So perhaps could you just talk about the puts and takes this year from last year and whether this is a base guide out performance or if we saw some volumes for G&P and NGLs get moved into '23. Kevin Burdick : Brian, yes, this is Kevin. I think probably the big thing is just like you mentioned the volume that was off-line and really the delays we saw when the volume came offline primarily in April, when we had the severe just kind of historic weather events in North Dakota, that just delayed not only getting volume back online, which hurt our '22. But it delayed some of the well connects as we into push back into '23. So that's why we feel really good about our '23 guide. Yes, we've got a significant step-up in well connects. But when you look at the wells. We've already connected to date, which historically is some of our lower months from a well connect perspective. and you look at the momentum we kind of built as we exited '22, we feel really good about where we're at volumetrically in both G&P and NGL out of the Bakken. Brian Reynolds : Great. And as a follow-up just on capital allocation. It seems like we should have pretty stable CapEx in the next few years with the MB-6 build-out. And just given the already announced dividend raise and leverage targets and payout ratios met at this point, how should we think about use of excess cash going forward? Pierce Norton : Brian, this is a good question to kind of clear up and really focus on what our key strategies are for capital allocation. The first one is that we want to invest in high-return organic projects that are adjacent to our existing footprint. The second thing is that we want to maintain and grow a -- what we refer to as a sustainable dividend. And what we mean by that is we want to keep that dividend growth somewhere below our EPS growth percentage and then also focus on our payout ratio, which I would say that approximately 85% are lower. So we were above 100%. We've got it down below 100% in our 2023 guidance. And number three, we want to keep our strong investment-grade credit ratings with a target of that 3.5x debt-to-EBITDA. And assuming that we've achieved all of those kind of capital allocation key strategies, if we do have excess cash or whatever, we could consider share buybacks. But that's kind of laying it out as to what our priorities are from a capital allocation standpoint. Operator : The next question is from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Spiro Dounis : First question, I wanted to touch on the third-party frac fees. You guys highlighted Mont Belvieu 5, frac 5 coming online and really sort of benefiting 2024 from the third-party frac 3 perspective. But I guess just given the fact it does come on or it sounds like it could come on early and second quarter, is there any ability to leverage that frac as well in 2023? And to the extent you've considered any of that in the '23 guidance? Sheridan Swords : Spiro, this is Sheridan. So when we had the Medford incident, we went out right away and secured frac capacity that we thought we needed going into '23. And we already took into account that MB-5 was going to come up in April. So our -- what we contracted for frac capacity is obviously heavier in the first part of the year until MB-5 comes on and then drops off. And that was all accounted for in the settlement that we had with the insurance company. So we have that already baked in, and that's why there's not that much movement on the third-party frac that we have. Obviously, MB-5 will help us if volume exceeds our expectation, we will be able to use MB-5 for that in '23. Spiro Dounis : Got it. Second question, multipart one on the Sao pipeline. So to the extent that does reach FID in mid-'23. I guess, one, would you expect any impact on the '23 CapEx budget? Or is that kind of more of a 2024 plus item? And then if you could just maybe give us any sense of cost of the pipeline, if you willing to take on JV partners? And then finally, just on the 2.8 Bcf a day of ultimate design capacity. Obviously, it's a pretty big pipe. Should we imagine that, that maybe comes on in phases or just how to think about the cadence there? Kevin Burdick : Spiro, this is Kevin. Still a lot of your questions were -- that's what we're working through right now. We're not going to provide a capital guide. There would be a little money that would be spent if we FID this year. But obviously, the bulk with it coming on, the anticipation had come on. And 2025 time frame, most of the capital is going to get pushed -- is going to be pushed out. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : So I wanted to ask about ethane recovery. You gave some broad expectations for ethane recovery across your footprint. But gas prices are pretty weak. It seems like they're going to stay there for a while. Can you just talk about opportunities for ethane recovery, specifically in the Bakken and what is actually reflected in guidance? Sheridan Swords : Yes, Michael, this is Sheridan. We have a very modest amount of ethane incentivized ethane in our guidance, a little bit that we have already contracted and already locked down the spread. We have not done any more than that. As you said, we do see a lot of opportunity in '23 with this low gas price which Kevin mentioned in his remarks, is making the United States pet chem very advantaged on using ethane as a feedstock going forward. And we think that we will continue to see more ethane recovery as we go through the year, especially as more demand comes on internationally, which we will pull the Mid-Continent up to be more in ethane recovery later in this year and will allow us to incentivize more ethane out of the Bakken at wider spreads than what we have done today. Michael Blum : Okay. Great. And then I also just wanted to ask another question about the frac market. It seems like everyone is adding frac capacity. And so I'm wondering if you think that's going to be pressuring rates over time at Mont Belvieu and within that context, how should we think about frac 6, how much of that is going to be contracted with third parties versus held-on account? Sheridan Swords : The -- Michael, what I'd say about frac capacity coming online. In the NGL world, the people that are building those fracs as us, we contract that volume and build our fracs to be able to grow into. So as these fracs come on, you'd probably see the spot market be a little bit weaker than it was when our frac went down. But long term, those fracs are contracted and as volume comes on, they will fill that. In terms of MB-6, remember, MB-6 is really just replacing Medford. And so MB-6 is completely contracted as Medford was completely contracted. So we're really only looking at our really add to our frac fleet is the MB-5 that we had substantially contracted before the Medford incident. So I think you'll see a little bit of softening in rates in the spot market. But long term, I do not think you will see softening of rates. Operator : The next question comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays. Harry Mateer : On the 3.5x leverage target, Walt, you've spoken about it as being aspirational for some time. But at this point, with out '22 and given your '23 guidance, it seems more reality than aspirational. So how are you thinking about it now? Is the plan to hold this level going forward? Or are you not ready to commit to that with Sahara ahead of you? And what is still a pretty good oil price environment? Walter Hulse : Well, Harry, I think that we've definitely achieved the goal as we sit here today, given the fact that we had an $830 million infusion from the insurance settlement, over the course of the next couple of years, we obviously will utilize some of that cash to build out MB-6. And we would expect to come back into that 35% or below in the not-too-distant future. We like that as a spot to give us flexibility going forward. But I think the peers walk through our capital allocation thoughts earlier. We're not concerned if it trails down a little bit lower as we look for projects. But I would just go back to Pierce's discussion about our capital allocation. Harry Mateer : Okay. And then my follow-up is just -- I know you guys recently redeemed one of your maturities later this year. You have another one. Any guidance you can give us on potential financing plans for the year and how are you planning to manage potential debt capital markets needs. Walter Hulse : Sure. Well, yes, you're right, that we actually did the make call because we could do it at par on the 4.25% for May. The other coupon that we have later in the year is 7.5%. So the make hall doesn't work. So we'll wait until the actual contractual call date, which I think the first time we can do that is early May. I think you can assume that given the fact that we have -- had this cash infusion that we will take that out for cash at that point in time. And we'll just assess our needs as we go through the year if there is a need for any further issuance. But as we sit today, we will cover off our maturities with cash on hand. Operator : Next question is from Jackie Caleres [ph] with Goldman Sachs. Unidentified Analyst : First, I'd like just to focus a little bit on the macro front. What are your thoughts on comfort level on backing egress out of the basin? And further, are you seeing the need for Bison River, any other ways to add gas capacity there? Kevin Burdick : Jackie, this is Kevin. Just kind of macro Bakken related from a gas takeaway perspective. We've talked before that we do believe there's still 300 million, 400 million cubic feet a day of capacity on Northern Border that the basin will continue to price out. So in other words, displaced gas currently flowing down from Canada, there has been a 100 million a day roughly project that's kind of moved south and southwest over to -- on WBI and gets down into a Cheyenne market that we've signed up for. There's the Northern Border open season on Bison Express that we are actively involved in that TC Energy has said they're working that project and have been pleased with the results so far. So there's an opportunity. So from an egress perspective, we feel good, obviously, for the next -- that will get you several years out even with some solid growth. And then obviously, we've got on our NGL system, we've got the ability to expand if we need to expand it by just adding pump stations, which is not a lot of capital and does not take a lot of time relative to some of the other projects we're talking about. So Basin overall, feel very good about the macro environment. We do not need to see more rigs show up in the basin to achieve our guidance. The rigs that are there today, when you also look at the -- finishing up some DUCs they've got we're in really good shape to meet the volume guidance in both the G&P and the liquids segments as we think about the basin. Unidentified Analyst : Okay. Great. And just one quick follow-up. A little bit more into CapEx. What goes into that upside, downside for the CapEx range? What's is are there? And could you potentially provide some color on the components or segment-level spend? What's the majority of that spend specifically allocated to? Kevin Burdick : We're not going to get into segment by segment. But like Walt mentioned in his remarks, we're finishing up MB-5. We've got MB a pretty significant amount of the MB-6 spend that will occur in '23. And then the uptick in activity when you think about the step-up in well connects in both the Mid-Continent and the Bakken, that's going to drive some additional capital needs from a well connect little horsepower, may need to add some pumps here or there in the NGL segment, those types of things, but those are highly, highly efficient capital and typically generate very strong returns. So those are the types of things that we've seen. And then also, we're seeing -- we've got some of those type projects in the gas pipeline segment as well that we're finishing up when we talked about our storage and some other expansion opportunities. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truth Securities. Neal Dingmann : At a higher level, we've seen some of the public E&Ps gobble up some of the private companies and then kind of slow their pace of activity down. So I was just wondering if you could maybe talk about any exposure you have public versus private or any observations you've seen if maybe one of these deals that happened with your assets? Kevin Burdick : Neil, this is Kevin. We really haven't seen the impact. And in some cases, we've seen it go the other way a little bit where maybe some of the larger publics have shed some of the acreage that they may be considering more Tier 2, Tier 3, and we've seen companies that acquired it, go ahead and start drilling. So that's been a little bit of a phenomenon. But we have been -- we've seen very consistent investment from the large publics that we have, and we've kind of got the who's who, especially in the Bakken, but also in the Mid-Continent, they've been incredibly consistent with the capital that's been allocated to those basins. Neal Dingmann : All right. That's a great point on the flip side of that. And then for my follow-up, in the PRB, one of the large operators has kind of said they were shifting to the Mowry, which comes -- brings a much higher gas cut. I just wanted to check and see if you are you seeing -- is that what you're seeing? Or is that what you're planning for? Or is the kind of guidance for the Rockies more so about the Bakken growth and maybe the PRB just assumes moderate growth? Kevin Burdick : Yes. The last is what is the way we think about it. We've got a nice position in the G&P segment. We do have a very nice large position in our NGL business. There's been several operators out there that have talked about the Powder and spending more capital. So we do have some modest growth built in. But the driver of the Rockies volumes is going to come from the Bakken. Operator : The next question comes from [indiscernible] with Bank of America. Unidentified Analyst : I wanted to touch on the implications of building MB-6 to essentially replace Medford. I'm assuming that you're going to flow less purity volumes on sterling and transition more to Y-grade down to Bellevue on Arbuckle. And I wanted to know the runway for Arbuckle on latent capacity before you'd have to consider an expansion for the increased volumes? Sheridan Swords : Neil, this is Sheridan. Yes, you're right. As we put MB-6 or as we're moving raw feed today, we're not moving as much purity products on the Sterling system. But as it comes to expanding Arbuckle II, we, as we did with other pipes, put it in a large diameter pipeline that if we need more capacity, it's very easy to put in a couple of more pump stations, and we get hundreds of thousands of barrels more of capacity on that pipeline. And obviously, we are watching that, and we can react very quickly. So it's fair to say we will not run out of raw feed capacity to Mont Belvieu from the Mid-Continent. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Great. And then the second question related to that when you look at optimization opportunities, obviously, it will be -- have less capacity in Conway and sometimes you're short propane in that market. And you have the ability to send natural gasoline up to Canada. How does the higher capacity in value versus Conway impact the optimization revenues going forward after you get the insurance proceeds? Sheridan Swords : Neil, as we look at that, it's going to change a little bit, but I don't know from a financial impact, it's going to have that big of an impact. We -- as we went back and looked at it as we determined whether or not we were going to build Medford back or do MB-6, we noticed that most of the volume from Medford already flows to Mont Belvieu on average. And so I think I also look at it as this is going to put us back in a position by moving MB-6 down there the way we were before we did put in the Busan fractionator in ONEOK. The Busan fractionator today has enough volume to satisfy the mid-continent market what the deployment has there. We've transitioned our business to be a little bit more Bellevue anyway. So I think as we'll be able to take advantage of probably spikes in the Convoy market, a little bit more than we have in the past, and we'll be able to move -- optimize the overall feed system down to the fractionators in Mont Belvieu. So all in all, I don't think it's going to be that big of an impact on our optimization business. Operator : The next question is from Robin Reddy [ph] with JPMorgan. Unidentified Analyst : To start off kind of a 2-parter on the volume outlook. I was wondering if you could provide a breakdown of that 10% G&P inlet growth assumption in '23 between the Mid-Con and Bakken. And the second part of that question was kind of what's the right way to think about volumes and EBITDA growth in '24 if you guys have 20-plus rigs on your acreage for 2 to 3 years. Kevin Burdick : I think we did provide the breakdown by Mid-Continent versus Rockies and the materials for the guidance range for '23. So that's in the materials. As we think about the growth, we've mentioned that it takes roughly 15 rigs on our acreage to hold volumes flat. So clearly, if we're sitting north of 20 rigs on our acreage and those rigs stay there, we're going to experience growth. And that would include growing '24 over '23 if the activity levels remain kind of where they're at today in the Bakken. And that would also hold true for the Mid-Continent as well You've also got the rising gas to oil ratios. So as we move through time, the gas-to-oil ratios have continued to trend up, which is also going to be a tailwind for volume growth as we -- especially if we're keeping these activity levels. Unidentified Analyst : Got it. Appreciate that. And then I appreciate that you guys spoke on frac fees a bit earlier, but just wondering if maybe you guys could provide a rough sense of what third-party frac fees look like per quarter in '23 and then maybe for 2024 as well given like the incremental volume growth maybe could we think about third-party frac fees in the $100 million range for '24? Sheridan Swords : Yes. I don't -- we're not going to break down our factories just for competitive reasons on how we go through '23. But it's very to say that what we've got from the insurance company is going to cover what we're going to pay to third-party fracs in '23 and '24. Operator : Today's last question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : I just wanted to confirm one thing with regard to your comments on the Medford fractionator. I think you mentioned that you considered that to be fully contracted -- so is it fair to assume that all your third-party frac leads for 2023 and 2024 are kind of contracted at this point of time? Walter Hulse : Yes. Yes, that's a good assumption. Sunil Sibal : Okay. And then on the Saguado gas pipeline, in addition to the FERC approval, I was curious what are other kind of getting items for that project? And could you look at a kind of a JV or a partnership for that pipeline? And then lastly, would you look to finance all of that, if that were to move ahead on your balance sheet or you could look at some other ways to finance. Kevin Burdick : Sunil, this is Kevin. I mean we're still, again, early in the process from the pipeline perspective. It would be an intrastate pipeline. So -- we wouldn't need other FERC approvals as it relates to actually building the pipeline if it did reach FID. As far as partnerships go, we are looking at it as we would own the pipeline at this point, but as with anything, if there's a strategic and economic reason for us to have a partner, we would consider that. But again, at this point, we're approaching it like we're going to our pipeline would just be part of that entire pipeline service that would get gas to the Gulf Coast -- or excuse me, get gas to the West Coast of Mexico. Sunil Sibal : Got it. And then on the financing side, all on the balance sheet or... Walter Hulse : Yes. I mean. So this pipeline is going to be built over a course of several years in the context of our normal CapEx, we would just do it on our balance sheet unless we found an attractive source of capital that was more efficient than the normal way. We always are keeping our eyes open for that sort of thing. But I don't think it would have a significant change in our CapEx program going forward. So not one that we would have to change our ordinary course. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : All right. Thank you all. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in April and extends until we release earnings in early May. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you again, and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2023 earnings and affirmed our full year 2023 financial guidance. Strong first quarter results were supported by continued earnings growth in each of our businesses, with higher Natural Gas Processed and Natural Gas Liquids volumes, providing a solid start to the year. Producer activity continues to drive new volume to our assets and recent conversations with customers point to additional activity through the remainder of the year. Crude prices well above breakeven economics in the Basins where we operate and continued strong demand for U.S. energy support, a constructive outlook for 2023. We provide midstream services to some of the largest, most well-capitalized producers in the U.S., helping contribute to our history of earnings stability and growth despite commodity prices. We continue to evaluate infrastructure and the needs of these customers so that we can provide added capacity or services aligned with their growth. The successful completion of our Demicks Lake III natural gas processing plant and MB-5 fractionator projects provide additional system capacity and resiliency, and are examples of our continued focus on organic growth aligned with our customers\u2019 needs. We remain financially well positioned with significant balance sheet strength and flexibility to support continued growth. Our capital allocation priorities remain consistent, with ONEOK\u2019s unique ability to identify and execute on high return organic growth opportunities setting us apart. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Walt for a discussion of our financial performance. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK\u2019s first quarter 2023 net income totaled $1.05 billion or $2.34 per share and adjusted EBITDA for the period totaled $1.72 billion. As we discussed on our last call, we booked the gain related to the Medford insurance settlement in the first quarter, resulting in a net increase in operating income and adjusted EBITDA of $733 million. This reflects the insurance settlement gain of $779 million, offset partially by $46 million of third-party fractionation costs incurred during the first quarter. We expect third-party fractionation costs to remain around this level with the potential to decrease through the remainder of the year as our MB-5 fractionator ramps up. Excluding the Medford impact, net income increased 24% year-over-year and adjusted EBITDA increased 14% over the same period, benefiting from increased NGL and natural gas processed volumes, higher average fee rates and higher natural gas storage rates. We ended the first quarter with a higher inventory of unfractionated NGLs primarily due to the timing of the MB-5 fractionator being placed in service and expect to recognize approximately $12 million over the second quarters and third quarters as that inventory is fractionated and sold. In April, Moody\u2019s upgraded ONEOK\u2019s credit rating to Baa2 from Baa3, recognizing our significant deleveraging, conservative financial policy and consistent strong operating and financial governance. Our net debt-to-EBITDA remains below our long-term target of 3.5 times and we had $680 million of cash and equivalents as of March 31st. Our cash balance is primarily made up of highly liquid government and treasury money market funds and deposit fully insured by the FDIC. We\u2019ve reduced our total debt -- net debt by more than $1 billion compared with the first quarter of 2022. In February 2023, we redeemed $425 million of 5% notes due September 2023 and we recently announced a June redemption of $500 million of 7.5% notes due September 2023, both with cash on hand. As Pierce mentioned, we affirmed our financial guidance expectations in yesterday\u2019s earnings release. With our strong first quarter performance and positive outlook for the remainder of the year, our confidence remains high in achieving our financial guidance. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update. Kevin Burdick : Thank you, Walt. Let\u2019s start with our Natural Gas Liquids segment. First quarter 2023 NGL volumes increased both year-over-year and compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, with higher producer activity levels driving increased C3+ or propane plus volumes on our system. Permian Basin volumes saw the largest increase up 17% compared with the first quarter of 2022 and 14% compared with the fourth quarter of 2022. We continue to have success contracting additional volumes in the Basin and connected one new third-party natural gas processing plant during the first quarter. Permian producer activity remains strong and we continue to consider incremental expansions on our West Texas NGL system to accommodate increasing volumes. Volumes in the Rocky Mountain region increased during the first quarter compared with the same period last year and decreased slightly compared with the fourth quarter 2022. The decrease was driven entirely by reduced ethane recovery as our propane plus volumes increased sequentially. We expect volumes to continue to grow in the spring and summer months. In the Mid-Continent region, consistent producer activity in the STACK and SCOOP continues to drive NGL volumes on our system. Raw feed throughput volumes increased compared with the fourth quarter 2022, driven primarily by higher ethane recovery. Regarding the macro ethane environment, we expect domestic petrochemical utilization rates to continue to improve as we move through 2023. With lower sustained natural gas pricing and lower ethane inventory levels driving improved ethane economics and volumes across our system. Through the remainder of the year, we continue to expect that the Permian Basin will stay at high levels of ethane recovery, the Mid-Continent will be in partial recovery and that we will have opportunities for incentivized recovery in the Rocky Mountain region. In April, we completed our 125,000 barrel per day MB-5 fractionator in Mont Belvieu. With MB-5 now fully operational, our system-wide fractionation capacity is nearly 900,000 barrels per day. The added capacity will be used to accommodate volume growth and reduce third-party fractionation needs. We remain on track to complete our MB-6 fractionator in the first quarter of 2025. In the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment, first quarter processed volumes averaged more than 2.1 billion cubic feet per day, an 11% increase compared with the first quarter of 2022. In the Rocky Mountain region, processed volumes averaged nearly 1.4 billion cubic feet per day during the first quarter and have recently reached more than 1.5 Bcf per day. We connected nearly 150 wells in the region during the quarter, compared with approximately 90 connections in the first quarter of 2022, a more than 60% increase. Well connections in the region are currently on pace to exceed our guidance midpoint of $500 million for the year. There are currently approximately 40 rigs and 23 completion crews operating in the Basin with 20 rigs and approximately half of the completion crews on our dedicated acreage. We continue to expect additional rigs entering the region as we exit winter. In the Mid-Continent region, first quarter processed volumes averaged more than 750 million cubic feet per day, a 27% increase year-over-year. We connected 11 wells in the region during the first quarter, compared with six in the first quarter 2022 and are on track to be within our guidance of 45 to 55 connections. There are currently more than 50 rigs and 11 completion crews operating in the region, with 10 rigs on our dedicated acreage. Despite weakness in natural gas prices, we continue to see strong activity in the higher crude and NGL rich producing areas of the region, where producers are focusing their drilling. In the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, strong first quarter results continue to benefit from firm transportation services and the demand for natural gas storage. We are on track to complete an expansion of our natural gas storage capabilities in Oklahoma in the second quarter, allowing us to utilize and subscribe an additional 4 billion cubic feet of our existing storage capacity. We have subscribed 100% of this incremental capacity through 2027 and 90% through 2029. We continue to evaluate the Saguaro Connector Pipeline, a potential intrastate pipeline project that would provide natural gas transportation to the U.S. and Mexico border for ultimate delivery to an export facility on the West Coast of Mexico. There continue to be positive developments related to the potential LNG export project and we still expect to make a final investment decision on the ONEOK pipeline in mid-2023. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Walt and Kevin. As you both have highlighted, ONEOK is well positioned for another year of strong financial and operational performance. We continue to execute on high return organic growth projects and remain intentional, and disciplined in looking for additional opportunities to add value for our business and our stakeholders. Demand for our products and services remains robust and we\u2019re continually looking for opportunities to enhance the vital services we provide for our customers. Our employees take pride in our position as a leading midstream operator, maintaining our focus on operational reliability, safety and environmental responsibility. As part of our core values, a focus on safety and environmental performance is at the core of our business and we\u2019re proud of the cultures we\u2019ve built around these key areas. 2023 is not only a year of continued financial progress, but also a year to continue our commitment to responsible operations, emissions reduction projects and our continued pursuit of a zero incident culture. With that, Operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will be from Brian Reynolds from UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Reynolds : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off on the third-party frac fees. The original guidance stipulates roughly $0.25 billion in costs for all of 2023, but 1Q trended better than expected, and now with MB-5 up and running, kind of curious if you can give us an updated view on how we should see third-party frac fees trending going forward and into next year? Thanks. Walt Hulse : So, Brian, as we said in the remarks, we expect that $46 million level to be viewed as kind of a run rate going forward with the potential for us to do better as we bring up MB-5 throughout the balance of the year. Brian Reynolds : Great. Thanks. And as a follow-up, maybe just touch on the Bakken activity levels are off to a strong start this year with weather helping out in 1Q, given ONEOK has completed roughly a third of its Rockies well connects in 1Q. I was wondering if we should expect a slowdown in activity from producers or if we continue to see similar activities going -- similar activity going forward? Thanks. Kevin Burdick : Yeah, Brian, it\u2019s Kevin. I think we see similar activity levels, if not a little bit stronger. Now we did as -- if you remember in the fourth quarter, we were a little light on our connections and said that just timing had slipped some of those into the first quarter, so that was part. But there -- the activity levels with 20 to 20-plus rigs on our acreage and that looking to be consistent, if not growing moving forward. I don\u2019t see the activity level slowing down. That\u2019s why we think, right now we\u2019re -- with those tailwinds looking that we\u2019d be ahead of our midpoint of the guidance for the well connects. Brian Reynolds : Great. Appreciate it. I will leave it there. Thanks. Operator : And the next question will be from Jeremy Tonet from JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi. Good morning. Pierce Norton : Good morning, Jeremy. Walt Hulse : Good morning, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : I just want to dial into the Bakken a little bit more, if I could. That was helpful with the 1.5 Bcf per day volume number that you provided there, but just wondering on the NGL side itself. I think we saw the Bakken NGLs tick down a little bit quarter-over-quarter, but the rates went up a little bit quarter-over-quarter. Just wondering, I guess, where you see that now? How you think about NGL volumes trending in kind of like the ethane extraction economics at this point? Sheridan Swords : So, Jeremy, this is Sheridan. What I would tell you is that, as we said in the remarks, the decrease in volume quarter-over-quarter was due to less ethane that we incentivized in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter, and actually, our C3+ volume on the NGL system was up quarter-over-quarter. So we still see good growth -- good trajectory of growth going through 2023, and with low gas prices right now and we think that ethane is really the preferred feedstock in the petrochemicals, we will have plenty of opportunity to incentivize ethane other Bakken going forward as well. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks. And just wanted to kind of pivot with the insurance proceeds, obviously, a lot of capacity on the balance sheet and thinking about where that could be deployed going forward between growth or buybacks or what have you. And just any updated thoughts, I guess, as far as incremental West Texas LPG looping or other extensions of the value chain such as LPG export facility in the Houston Ship Channel. Pierce Norton : Well, I\u2019ll start out with the first part of it and kick it over to the other guys for the West Texas part of. Jeremy, you\u2019re absolutely right. Our balance sheet is in a stellar shape at this point and it does give us quite a bit of flexibility. Our priorities haven\u2019t changed at all. Our first priority is to find very high return projects that we can grow our business. Our debt reduction has kind of achieved the goals that we were looking for and that does create our flexibility for further dividend increases and potentially even stock buybacks over time. But that is our list of priorities, and as I said, high return growth projects that they\u2019re at the top of the list and that\u2019s a good segue into West Texas LPG. Kevin Burdick : Yeah. Jeremy, it\u2019s Kevin. The -- as we think about, like we said in the remarks, with -- the Permian volumes have been strong for us. We\u2019ve seen nice growth there. So, clearly, we\u2019re continuing to evaluate and we\u2019ll stay ahead of any capacity needs we had by through our looping of West Texas LPG. So we\u2019ll stay on top of that and won\u2019t get caught short capacity. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Michael Blum from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on the Saguaro Pipeline project around contracting. What percent of the pipeline do you need to be contracted to move forward and what\u2019s sort of an average length of contract that you\u2019re looking for? Kevin Burdick : Well, Michael, it\u2019s Kevin. As we think about Saguaro, we\u2019ll look at that project from an integrated perspective. I mean you\u2019ve got the contracts with the LNG facility, the potential pipeline in Mexico and our potential pipeline. So all those are related. At the end of the day, the offtakers are the ones that will be looking for the transportation out of Waha. So that\u2019s the way we\u2019re thinking about that. Not ready to talk about any contract terms or rates or anything like that yet. Still early in the process. But we are taking the steps forward and continue to move it forward. So, hopefully, we\u2019ll be in a position to announce something midyear. Michael Blum : Okay. Great. So just maybe a follow-up on that, since midyear is fast approaching here. If you do go forward with the project, would that result in some increase in 2023 CapEx and then just, generally, when would be CapEx for the project be spent? Kevin Burdick : Well, that will all depend on when it -- we would announce something. But again, not ready to talk about any specific capital that might hit, because we\u2019re still unsure when it might be FID. Michael Blum : All right. Thank you. Operator : And our next question is from Tristan Richardson from Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Tristan Richardson : Hey. Good morning, guys. Kevin, I appreciate your comments on the Permian. Obviously, you\u2019ve got production growth there, as well as adding a new plant -- a third-party plant. But you also talked about contracting additional volumes. Can you kind of talk about that environment, whether these are medium-, long-term deals? Just kind of what that environment looks like and how that may have contributed to the first quarter? Kevin Burdick : Well, I think, a lot of the volumes that we\u2019ve seen on our system are growing volumes on contracts that may have been put in place several years ago, back when even pre-COVID. But we also have seen opportunities to go contract new volumes. And Sheridan, do you want to talk about some of the things we\u2019ve seen there? Sheridan Swords : Yeah. I mean, obviously, volume is growing well in the Permian Basin. And as we have a lot of relationship with producers out there and processors that we\u2019ve been able to get our fair share, if not a little bit more of the volume that\u2019s come up. So we\u2019ve had good luck contracting new volume, a lot of that is coming through existing plants on our system or the potential for new plants as we look into the Board. But we think we\u2019re -- have a compelling story out there to be highly competitive in a very competitive area and we are seeing some success. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it, Sheridan. And then maybe just the obligatory high level question. Obviously, strong results in the first quarter. Just thinking about the full year outlook, some of the conditions necessary to hit the high end versus what might need to happen to see the low end occur? Pierce Norton : Hey, Tristan. This is Pierce. I think you all have picked up on the fact that, we\u2019re coming out of the first quarter with some really, really strong tailwinds and that actually is a very positive move for us, a lot of times during the first quarter we\u2019re trying to explain kind of the different trajectories that we have, but we really, really like the trajectory that we\u2019re on now and we\u2019ve affirmed our guidance range and stay tuned for the quarters to come. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it. Thank you, guys. Operator : And the next question is from Theresa Chen from Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Hi. Thank you for taking my questions. Within the G&P segment, can you talk about the fee escalation that I think kind of just wholly steps up in the second quarter now that we\u2019re a month and change through it, how that\u2019s trending now and how that gets to your guidance within the fee range? Kevin Burdick : Theresa, it\u2019s Kevin. On the fee rate, again, that\u2019s going to move around on a couple of factors. One is just various contract mix as new volume comes on the system every quarter and then the others is the contract escalators that kick in. So we\u2019ve said, historically, and previously that in G&P segment, that typically occurs in the spring. So you\u2019re just seeing just the minor moves like that or just contract mix moving around from quarter-to-quarter. Theresa Chen : Okay. And then in terms of the third-party frac fee, so I understand that you have downsized from the $46 million per quarter as you utilize some of the space on MB-5. But as some of your competitors are also bringing on additional frac capacity second half of this year and into next year, would you expect that the spot fee will also weaken to some extent. So is there further downside even in addition to you being able to use MB-5? Walt Hulse : I think that is the potential as we look out into 2024. A lot of what we did in 2023, we have contracted it at a certain rate. But as we get into 2024 or for some reason we would need a little bit more in 2023, we\u2019re definitely seeing spot frac rates are a lot lower than they were six months ago and that will -- we predict that will continue into 2024. So we could see some additional downside or upside as it would be for us on lower third-party frac fees. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : The next question is from Spiro Dounis from Citi. Please go ahead. Spiro Dounis : Thanks, Operator. Hi, guys. First question actually one for about Elk Creek. Curious, you talked about keeping pace with customer needs and I acknowledge this question is probably a bit on the early side. But just given the well connect outlook, potential breathing recovery, GOR is increasing over the next year or so. When is it sort of time to start thinking about not expansion? How are you guys thinking about some of the capital needs and timing that will go into that? Pierce Norton : I think I\u2019ll kind of give a high level thing, throw it to Kevin here. But I can tell you that we\u2019ve said before that we\u2019re not going to get short -- cost short on capacity. So as your question of when does it start time to thinking about it, we\u2019re thinking about it. So I\u2019ll let Kevin kind of fill in the blanks there. Kevin Burdick : Yeah. We are with the strength we\u2019ve seen recently and even going back to last year with the activity levels and the producer, the rigs that were there. But particularly now as we move into Q1 and seeing what we have seen from the producers, we\u2019re definitely taking steps that -- are already taking steps necessary to ensure that we\u2019ve got the capacity when we need it. Spiro Dounis : Great. That\u2019s helpful color. Second question kind of outside the quarter as well, but over the last two years or so, even before that we\u2019ve sort of seen you lean more in some more utility-like businesses, new storage expansions, now the potential Saguaro Pipeline, more take-or-pay style. Is that part of kind of a larger plan to introduce even more earnings stability into the platform and how should we think about maybe other avenues where you can continue to grow there? Pierce Norton : Well, the short answer to that is yes. This is Pierce. But those things are really driven by customer demands as well, but we definitely are looking for those opportunities. That\u2019s part of the intentionality of the diversification into those more stable earnings type areas in our footprint. So the short answer is yes. Spiro Dounis : Understood. Appreciate the color, guys. Thank you. Operator : And the next question will be from Jean Ann Salisbury from Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. Good morning. I just have one -- another one on this Saguaro Connector. I guess my understanding is that inside Mexico pipelines have -- I don\u2019t think so a disaster, but have generally been very, very far delayed and not successful. How does ONEOK and how do investors get confidence that if you build another pipeline to the border that the rest of it will be on time? Kevin Burdick : Okay. Jean, this is Kevin. I think the way I would answer that is, I mean, obviously, we -- as we come to a decision to FID or not, that will be -- we\u2019re factoring in what\u2019s going on with the full aspect of the pipeline. And I think it\u2019s safe to say you know us we\u2019ll be do the things we need to do from our contractual position to mitigate that risk as much as we possibly can. Jean Ann Salisbury : Okay. That makes sense. Thank you for taking my questions. Operator : And thank you. The next question is from Neal Dingmann from Truist. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, all. Thanks for the time. My first question is just on the contract structure. I\u2019m just wondering maybe in the type of valid commodity tapered now, could you remind me, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s changed much, but I just want to make sure I\u2019ve got this. What percent of this year\u2019s earnings you expect to be fee based and I\u2019m just wondering, do you all have availability. I don\u2019t know any of these contracts to potentially walk them up the remainder of the year? Walt Hulse : Just, overall, we said we\u2019re 90% fee-based and 10% commodity exposed. And then you think about the G&P business with our POP contracts where some of the direct commodity exposure occurs. We\u2019re well hedged in 2023. So that even reduces that commodity exposure further. So really, it\u2019s a -- when you just look at it on an earnings perspective, it\u2019s a small percentage that we have direct commodity exposure. Neal Dingmann : Perfect. Okay. And then my second just on the Rocky Mountain Nat Gas G&P. You did have a nice step up last quarter on the total there. I\u2019m just wondering if you remind me, how should we think about the expected cadence for the remainder of the year? I see that -- I forget what slide I\u2019m looking at here, but obviously, the guide you\u2019ve got for the year still, we\u2019re now already at the low side, but you\u2019ve got a pretty good range. I\u2019m just wondering how is pretty good step-ups we should think about? Walt Hulse : You\u2019re talking about the Gathering and Processing the volumes... Neal Dingmann : Correct. Correct. Walt Hulse : \u2026from Rocky Mountain region. Neal Dingmann : Yeah. Walt Hulse : Okay. I mean, yeah, we -- the first quarter, you were at the low end, and if you go to the -- we referenced, we had reached here recently 1.5 Bcf. So we definitely think there\u2019s some -- there\u2019s a ramp and that\u2019s one of the tailwinds Pierce mentioned is where we sit today from a Bakken or Rockies volume perspective, we\u2019re in really good shape. Neal Dingmann : Great to hear. Thank you all. Operator : And the next question is from Neel Mitra from Bank of America. Please go ahead. Neel Mitra : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my question. A lot has been answered. So I wanted to go a little bit beyond the quarter and with the Medford proceeds and what seems to be a strong 2023, it seems like your leverage levels are trending well below kind of the 3.5 times target. So when you think about that a little bit longer term, do you plan to stay lower like some of your peers or are you thinking more about dividend increases, repurchases or possible acquisitions and just in terms of how you plan to think about the mix? Walt Hulse : Sure. Neel, this is Walt. Well, if you back out the gain from the Medford settlement, we\u2019re at 3 -- we are around 3.4 times. So, yes, we\u2019re through 3.5 times, but we\u2019re not meaningfully below it at this point. We are not concerned if that trend is lower. We would -- if we don\u2019t have investment opportunities, we like it probably would trend lower in the short-term. But we continue to look at attractive opportunities. We\u2019ve spoken a little bit about the increases we\u2019re seeing in the various basins and some of the expansion plans that we might need to do on some of the pipes and the like. So those are very, very high return types of projects and that\u2019s where we like to be first. And then we have flexibility for other capital return now that we\u2019re down and achieve these goals. Neel Mitra : Got it. And then second question, I know you\u2019ve seen a lot of stickiness in terms of the rigs on your activity, but now the -- just we\u2019ve seen crude fall below $70 twice this year. How do you see the producer activity given that a lot of publics have budgeted around $70 if we stay in this environment over intermediate to longer term? Kevin Burdick : Well, Neel, this is Kevin, and I haven\u2019t had a lot of time to talk to our customers over the last couple of days. But, what I would say, you\u2019re right, the rigs have been very sticky. I like that word. As we -- as prices -- if you rewind, rigs really start coming back to the Bakken in earnest as prices move through $50, $55. That\u2019s when we started seeing the stickiness. Now when it ran up to $110, rigs didn\u2019t necessarily follow. But then as the prices came back down, they didn\u2019t go away either. So we still feel very good. It\u2019s not a matter of -- that\u2019s still well above breakeven. Producers are still make -- generating a tremendous amount of cash flow even at the prices we\u2019re seeing on the tape right now. So that would give me a lot of confidence that we\u2019re going to continue to see that stickiness even in this type of environment. Pierce Norton : And the only thing I\u2019d add to that -- this is Pierce is, I get the opportunity to go around and meet with these heads of many of these exploration and production companies, and they take a really long-term view. So it\u2019s not just what is the price today, yes, the price has fallen off, improved the last couple of days. But they\u2019re taking a long-term view of what do they think crude is going to do over time, because until they get the rigs drilled out there, drill wells producing, you don\u2019t have the opportunity to capture whatever price it is out there. So they really take a long-term view and it seems to be a very wide path that they look at now as far as a range of prices that they don\u2019t really get emotional and go either up or down. They stay very steady. Neel Mitra : Okay. Great. I appreciate the color. Operator : And the next question will come from Sunil Sibal from Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody, and thanks for the clarity on the call. So I wanted to start off on Bakken. I think there has been some chatter in the E&P community about well productivity. So I was curious if you could talk about -- in the past you\u2019ve talked about close to 400 wells per year to maintain your gas volumes. I was curious if that number has changed in your view based on some of the recent results and also it seems like gas-to-oil ratio have trended down recently? Kevin Burdick : This is Kevin. There was a couple of questions in there. One is on well productivity and we really have not seen a degradation at all in the well productivity. We\u2019ve -- there has been a little bit of movement with the strong prices to different areas of the play. So we\u2019ve seen some changes a little bit in potentially the gas-to-oil ratio, but nothing that would cause us concern to think that wells are getting less productive. If anything, producers, if they\u2019re drilling in the same areas, the technology continues to improve and we\u2019ve seen strong results. So we don\u2019t have any concerns at this point on what\u2019s going on with well productivity or the GORs. Sunil Sibal : Okay. And then my follow-up was on your Natural Gas Pipeline segment. It seems like a pretty strong Q1 and even if the remainder of the year turns out to be similar to last year. I think you would exceed that guidance. So I was just curious if there are any one-time items in Q1, which helped the gas pipelines? Chuck Kelley : Sunil, this is Chuck. No. Q1 was a solid quarter for us in all regards. Our storage revenues were higher. Obviously, we had some gas sales that we were able to pick up in the quarter like we typically do first quarter. So there wasn\u2019t a single outlier that generated debt performance. So balance of the year, we expect to be at or above our midpoint and looking forward to see what opportunities come about this summer. Sunil Sibal : Got it. Thanks for that. Operator : Thank you. And the next question will be from Colton Bean from Tudor, Pickering & Holt. Please go ahead. Colton Bean : Hi. Just a quick follow-up on Saguaro. It looks like the proposed 48-inch diameter would offer plenty of capacity over and above the proposed LNG exports in that. So can you speak to how you scope that project and what opportunities you might be tracking downstream apart from LNG? Kevin Burdick : Colton, this is Kevin. Well, we\u2019re just lining up again with what\u2019s going on with the possible export facility. So as we just back up from there and what they\u2019re talking about building in Mexico and what we would need to build for the border crossing. That\u2019s what we\u2019re looking at right now. But not ready to talk about any other opportunities or so forth. But there\u2019s potential plans for the LNG facility for additional trains and so we scoped the pipe kind of what -- and what they were looking for. Colton Bean : Understood. Thank you. Operator : And the next question is from Craig Shere from Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : Good morning. Just a couple of quick ones. So the Permian NGL unit rates were shown at about $0.06 versus over $0.06 in the fourth quarter. Wondering if there\u2019s any detail or trending there? And could you remind us roughly on the increments that you can increase Elk Creek with additional pumping and what kind of CapEx that would incrementally run? Walt Hulse : Craig, I\u2019ll take the first -- I\u2019ll take the last one and then let Sheridan talk about the fee rates. On the Elk Creek expansion, as Pierce alluded to, Yes, we\u2019re -- it\u2019s adding pumps up and down the pipe. So that\u2019s -- that would be the scope of the project. We haven\u2019t talked to any specifics on what that would cost and -- but, again, we\u2019re not going to get caught short of capacity and we\u2019re already taking the steps necessary to hopefully bring that forward. Sheridan Swords : Craig. This is Sheridan here. Craig Shere : Thank you. Sorry. I am sorry. Could you quickly just elaborate how quickly or soon that can be done. It\u2019s pretty efficient stuff, right? So can you do it well under a year once the decision is made or how quickly can you roll that out? Walt Hulse : That -- again, we\u2019re still working through. That\u2019s the steps we\u2019re taking is to understand exactly what that would be working with power companies, working with pump providers and things like that. So we -- those are the steps. The types of steps we\u2019re taking to ultimately come up with how long it might take. But, yeah, it\u2019s not like building a brand-new pipeline start to finish. Pierce Norton : Hi. This is Pierce. Craig Shere : All right. Thank you. Pierce Norton : The only thing I\u2019d add to that is, the thing to remember on that as it relates to capital is, these are very high return projects. So whatever the number is, when we announced today that we\u2019re going to do this, just be assured that it\u2019s a very high return project. Craig Shere : Understood. And those Permian NGL unit rates? Sheridan Swords : Yeah. Craig, this is Sheridan. I mean we always see a little bit of escalation or changing up and down in our fee rates. It all depends on where the volume is coming from. And one of the biggest thing that drives that is if we\u2019re getting a little bit more volume from a transport-only contract versus the TNF contract or is that mix is a little bit, it\u2019s going to play with that rate just slightly and you\u2019re just seeing just a little bit of a slight change. I mean it\u2019s just noise. It\u2019s really immaterial. It\u2019s just kind of contract mix. Craig Shere : Got it. So no trend going on there, just bouncing around. Sheridan Swords : No trends. There\u2019s no trends going on. Craig Shere : Thanks. Operator : And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Well, thank you all for joining us today. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in July and extends until we release earnings in early August. We\u2019ll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, MJ, and welcome to ONEOK's Second Quarter 2023 Earnings Call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions.  Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ please refer to our SEC filings. [Operator Instructions]. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer; and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Kevin Burdick, the Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer. Also available to answer your questions are Sheridan Swords, our Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing; and Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines.  Yesterday, we announced second quarter 2023 earnings and increased our full year 2023 financial guidance. Strength in volumes across our operations, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin, resulted in higher second quarter results and positive momentum entering the second half of 2023. We continue working toward a successful closing of our pending merger transaction with Magellan while remaining focused on the growth of our legacy assets. Initial activities have begun on 2 NGL pipeline expansion projects. The growth we are seeing across our existing operations is driving the need for these economically attractive projects.  Walt and Kevin will talk more about the early work that we are doing on the Elk Creek and West Texas natural gas liquids toplines.  Regarding our pending acquisition of Magellan Midstream. We've recently accomplished 2 critical milestones toward completing the transaction, including the expiration of the HSR waiting period in June and the filing of the definitive proxy materials with the SEC in July. Proxy mailings are already hitting investors' mailboxes. As we look ahead to the shareholder and unitholder votes on September 21, we're confident that the investors of both companies will see the compelling long-term value proposition this transaction brings with immediate financial benefits and incremental growth through the combination of these 2 companies.  Today, we will walk you through both the macro and micro takeaways of our synergy assumptions. I will cover the macro and Kevin will go into more detail with the macro explanations. On Slide 6 in our earnings presentation, which was provided yesterday with our news release, you will see a summary of how we've organized the synergy opportunities we've identified to date and have targeted to realize as a combined company. You can see we have slided these commercial opportunities into 4 categories and have provided a breakdown for both the assumed scenario in our proxy and for the incremental potential near-term commercial opportunities. So now I'd like to cover the macro takeaways from Page 6 previously referenced.  First, combined, these companies will have opportunities that were not possible as stand-alone companies. Second, batching and blending are done by both companies today. Therefore, these operational techniques are well understood by both companies. They are not new. But the difference is with these assets under one company's direction, batching and blending value can be realized on a larger scale.  Third, with the exception of bundling, the 3 remaining commercial categories are within 100% of our control. This means that we make the decision to pursue opportunities if they make commercial and economical sense instead of relying on factors outside of our control.  Fourth, as we integrate the 2 employee bases post close, we can focus on widespread collaboration and believe that we will find even more opportunities not identified to date.  And finally, there is significant potential value in the near term, the next 1 to 4 years, above our assumed case in the proxy. ONEOK has proven our commercial creativity over the course of our company's transformative history, and together with Magellan's team, we believe our companies have many opportunities to continue improving the services that we offer to our customers and returning value to our investors.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt Hulse, for the discussion of our recent financial performance and guidance increase. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. With yesterday's earnings announcement, we increased our 2023 financial guidance expectations. We now expect a 2023 net income midpoint of $2.49 billion and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $4.675 billion, a $100 million increase from our original adjusted EBITDA midpoint provided in February. These midpoints are ONEOK specific and exclude the impact of the pending merger with Magellan and any future merger-related costs in order to be an apples-to-apples comparison with our original guidance provided in February.  Higher guidance expectations were driven by volume growth, volume strength across our operations, higher average fee rates and lower-than-expected third-party NGL fractionation costs. In the second quarter, we recorded $31 million of third-party fractionation costs compared with $46 million in the first quarter. We expect approximately $30 million of third-party fractionation costs per quarter to be a good run rate for the remainder of the year as MB-5 is fully operational.  Strong producer activity and a constructive volume outlook also drove the increase in our capital expenditure guidance. We now expect total capital expenditures, including growth and maintenance capital, of approximately $1.575 billion in 2023. Initial activities, including the purchase of long lead time components related to the expansion of Elk Creek pipeline and the decision to complete the full looping of the West Texas NGL pipeline are included in our updated guidance. Kevin will provide more detail on these projects shortly.  Now a brief overview of our second quarter financial performance. ONEOK's second quarter 2023 net income totaled $468 million or $1.04 per share. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $971 million, a 10% increase year-over-year. If you exclude merger-related and third-party fractionation costs, second quarter adjusted EBITDA increased nearly 15% and would exceed $1 billion. In June 2023, we redeemed $500 million of our 7.5% senior notes due September 2023 with cash on hand. Our net debt to EBITDA remains well below our long-term target of 3.5x, and we had more than $100 million of cash and equivalents as of June 30.  Early in the second quarter, Moody's upgraded ONEOK's credit rating to Baa2 from Baa3. As it relates to our pending acquisition of Magellan, I'd note all 3 rating agencies, Moody's, S&P and Fitch, reaffirmed our investment-grade credit ratings pro forma for the acquisition showing a recognition of increased scale, earnings diversity and growth opportunities that this acquisition provides. As it relates to merger transaction financing, we expect to complete a notes offering prior to the close of the transaction. We are monitoring the markets and will be opportunistic in our timing of that offering.  I now turn the call over to Kevin for a commercial update. Kevin Burdick : Thanks, Walt. Let's start with our Natural Gas Liquids segment. Second quarter 2023 NGL volumes increased 11% year-over-year and compared with the first quarter 2023. Higher volumes were driven by increased producer activity, particularly in the Rocky Mountain region and Permian Basin. Both regions saw double-digit volume increases year-over-year and compared with the first quarter 2023. Permian Basin volumes saw the largest increase, up 26% year-over-year, driven by continued growth from existing plants and volume from a new plant connection in the first quarter of 2023. Volumes in the Rocky Mountain region increased 17% compared with the first quarter of 2023 and 14% compared with the same period last year driven by increased propane plus volume and slightly higher incentivized ethane. Mid-Continent region volumes increased 8% compared with the first quarter of 2023, partially driven by increased ethane recovery.  While we've seen ethane prices decrease recently from July highs, they remain at a level driving recovery in most basins. We think the recent volatility in ethane pricing is the market responding to some short-term dynamics along with the general tightening in the overall supply and demand balance. Given these market conditions, we remain confident in our ethane recovery assumptions included in our updated guidance. The Permian in near full recovery, the Mid-Continent in partial recovery and opportunities to incent recovery in the Williston.  As Walt mentioned, we've begun initial work, including purchasing long lead time components for 2 NGL pipeline expansion projects. Activities are underway to complete the looping of West Texas NGL pipeline, which will more than double ONEOK's NGL capacity out of the Permian Basin. The full loop is expected to be in service in the first quarter of 2025, which aligns with our customers' needs. We also are taking steps towards expanding the Elk Creek pipeline to 400,000 barrels per day to provide capacity for growing volumes in the Williston. In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, second quarter processed volumes averaged nearly 2.2 billion cubic feet per day, a 16% increase year-over-year. In the Rocky Mountain region, processed volumes averaged nearly 1.5 billion cubic feet per day during the second quarter and have averaged more than 1.5 bcf per day in the month of July. We've connected more than 280 wells in the region through the first half of the year compared with approximately 160 connections in the first half of 2022, a 75% increase. As we sit today, we're on pace to reach the high end of our 475 to 525 well-connect guidance range for the year. Currently, there are approximately 35 rigs and 20 completion crews operating in the basin with 19 rigs and approximately half of the completion crews on our dedicated acreage which remains more than enough activity to grow production on our acreage. In the Mid-Continent region, second quarter processed volumes increased 12% year-over-year and decreased slightly compared with the first quarter of 2023, primarily due to the timing of new pads coming online. We've seen some recent decreases in STACK and SCOOP activity in the past few months but continue to see increased activity in Western Oklahoma as producers are focusing on higher crude producing areas. We currently have 9 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the Mid-Continent and have connected 23 wells in the region through the first half of the year.  In the natural gas pipeline segment, strong year-to-date results continue to benefit from demand for natural gas storage and transportation services, and we now expect the segment to exceed the high end of its original earnings guidance range. We recently completed an expansion of our natural gas storage capabilities in Oklahoma, allowing us to utilize and subscribe an additional 4 billion cubic feet of our existing capacity. We have subscribed 100% of this incremental capacity through 2027 and 90% through 2029.  We continue to evaluate the Saguaro connector pipeline, a potential intrastate pipeline project that would provide natural gas transportation to the U.S. and Mexico border for ultimate delivery to an export facility on the West Coast of Mexico. There continues to be positive developments related to the potential LNG export project with support from multiple large, well-known customers anchoring the project. We expect to make a final investment decision on the ONEOK pipeline later this year. Now I want to end where Pierce left off with a micro look at the Magellan transaction synergies. I will discuss how we define each category, an example of the opportunity, the sensitivities and comments on the overall risk weighting. The dollar ranges between our assumed case and the near-term potential are shown on Page 6 of our investor presentation for all 4 categories.  Liquids pipelines provide opportunities to move natural gas liquids and refined products through the same product pipelines. Both companies refer to this as batching. This operational technique utilizes available capacity and combined connectivity to ship a refined product or natural gas liquid to a demand center to capture a higher value. An annualized average of 100,000 barrels per day in any combination of refined products or NGLs at $0.07 per gallon would result in more than $100 million annually.  The ability to mix products to obtain a higher value is called blending. The combined assets will increase unleaded butane blending as well as other incremental blending opportunities, increasing an additional 25,000 barrels per day annually at a $0.20 per gallon uplift on any given slate of products or NGLs would result in approximately $75 million annually. As volumes grow or contracts expire, a wider variety of services can be combined or bundled to offer greater value to customers. This focuses on optimizing system utilization and connectivity to and from key customers and market centers. This is the one category where time and decisions, primarily by customers, will jointly be needed to realize this synergy. Picking up an incremental 25,000 barrels per day at $0.10 per gallon would provide approximately $40 million a year.  Additional opportunities that can be realized within the 1- to 4-year time frame include incremental refined product, NGL, and crude oil storage and optimization activities. We also see value and opportunities to leverage Magellan's proven marine export expertise. We have consistently said that acquisitions of this size often result in a 25% reduction in G&A cost, which, in this case, would be $200 million. However, we have assumed only $100 million in both the assumed case and the near-term potential case.  It's also important to point out when the transaction was announced, we significantly risk-weighted our financial assumptions to come up with our total assumed $200 million of synergies. This should highlight the level of conservatism we've applied to our expectations and also the potential upside to our assumptions, which we think could drive synergies to more than $400 million. As we've said previously, we have a high level of confidence in achieving the assumed $200 million of near-term synergies. For obvious commercial reasons, we're not going to provide specific project level details at this time. However, we have provided realistic potential outcomes by categories. We believe our ability to batch and blend products on our combined pipeline systems as well as bundled services to increase value for customers will provide significant synergy opportunities over the next 1 to 4 years.  Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Kevin, and thank you, Walt. We've had a strong first half of the year with a promising second half still ahead of us. We continue to focus on the fundamentals of our business that have gotten us where we are today. These fundamentals include customer service, reliability, innovation and, most importantly, a focus on operating safely and responsibly. We have a long and successful track record of growing and transforming our business while innovating for future opportunities but even through change and advancements over our more than 100-year history, ONEOK employees have been consistent in their dedication to doing things the right way.  In the coming weeks, we'll be publishing our 15th Annual Sustainability Report. I'd encourage you to review the report and see our many updates related to our environmental, safety and health performance, related targets, employee initiatives and examples of how we're economically participating in the future of energy transformation. We're proud to share our efforts and accomplishments, but we also know we can't stop there. As our company continues on our journey of growth, change and progress, we remain committed to operating responsibly and sustainably.  As we look forward to increasing our operations, workforce and expertise through the merger of Magellan. We're also excited to join 2 companies with proud histories with a more promising future combined. I want to thank all the employees from both companies that are working on integration plans while continuing to run daily operations. We look forward to building on all that both companies have accomplished, creating a larger, more diversified company with a shared commitment to safety and stakeholder value.  With that, operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions]. Today's first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Brian Reynolds : I appreciate the prepared remarks and slide details around the commercial synergy opportunities. I was curious if we could just view -- if we could talk about if we should view the upside opportunity of synergies to be around $800 million versus the original $200 million that you talked about when the deal was announced? And then second, are there any assumptions around growth synergies on Slide 6, just given the larger integrated framework that you'll have? And if not, how should we think about the size and scope of those opportunities? Pierce Norton : So this is Pierce. Brian. I'll start out with some comments, and I'll let Kevin fill in or share in either one. So the $800 million is a list of opportunities that we have that's fairly lengthy as far as what the potential could be based on certain volume assumptions, pricing assumptions, and time. And so you come up with your list first, and then you have to go back and risk weight those as to what you think can realistically be done.  I think in any of these transactions, you want to come up with the most comprehensive list possible realizing that you may not get them all. So we're very comfortable in that range of $200 million to $400 million. And so -- but we wanted to add the color to kind of show how we risk weighted both into that assumption. Brian Reynolds : Great. Appreciate that. And I guess just a follow up, is there -- can you talk about the size and scope of those potential growth synergy opportunities, whether it's downstream, I guess? Kevin Burdick : Brian, it's Kevin. No, I mean we've kind of provided as much as we're going to provide at this time. Again, just for competitive reasons, we're not going to -- we don't -- we prefer not to get into the details at this time of some of that. A lot of these will happen with not a lot of capital. Some may require a little bit, but we'll work those details as once we get closed and get into it. Pierce Norton : The only thing I'd add to that, Brian -- this is Pierce -- is there's not one large opportunity in any one of those buckets that's driving it. It's multiple opportunities. Brian Reynolds : Fair enough. And if I may just -- I know it's a little bit too early to discuss what the final company will look like post-merger but kind of just curious if you could just talk about leverage for a larger integrated company. We've seen NGL peers take leverage to 3x. And we've seen some recent spin co announcements talk about 5x as being the right number. So just kind of curious as a combined entity, what do you think the right leverage target is for ONEOK and Magellan? Walter Hulse : Well, we definitely haven't changed our view on where we want to be from a long-term standpoint. We've heard out there that 3.5x, we thought was a good benchmark for us. We are going to trend that direction pretty quickly with this transaction. And as we said in the past, we have no issue if we trend a little bit lower than that 3.5x. But we think that puts us in a good position to take advantage of opportunities as they come down the road over time. Operator : The next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just wanted to start with the underlying -- the fundamental business -- fundamentals of the underlying business here. With the results that you've had raising the guidance as far as we are into '23 just wondering if you could talk a bit more on operational momentum in the business right now. How you see that trending into '24 to the extent you're able to comment and specifically with regards to the numbers put forth in the prospectus and knowing that that is not guidance, but just wondering if there's any frame of reference you can provide there is how you see results potentially shaping up versus that number? Kevin Burdick : Jeremy, it's Kevin. I think it's shaping up very well. The activity levels we're seeing across our footprint really in all 3 of the major areas. And even a little activity in the Powder, but primarily the Bakken and the Permian announcing or talking about these expansion projects that we're pushing forward to me signals that volume's coming and the activity levels we're seeing right now in the Williston and the Permian would absolutely dictate that we would be continuing to grow as we move through '24. Walter Hulse : Jeremy, the one thing I might do is give you a little bit of context on those numbers that were in the proxy. Those were numbers that were developed in September of '22 for our board meeting in November where we got the 2023 plan approved. The numbers for 2023 were the primary focus of those numbers. But as we've made -- as we stated in these conversations, and you'll remember, if you looked at the proxy that it goes back to September of 2022, we were using the same numbers for our board that we were using in our planning process. They were not a forward projection of our full view of what we would do in outer years. It was a pretty good view of 2023. So as we see these business opportunities grow, we will give guidance for '24 and beyond when we get to February and in future periods. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Maybe just one more cut at this. Is there any way, I guess, to provide color on what inputs were for -- driven into the 2024 numbers, such as Bakken rig count or other? And how they trend now versus what you saw at that point in time? Walter Hulse : Like I said, I think that you should think about those numbers with the primary focus on 2023 to try to look forward 15 months and give a rig count is something that we don't typically try to do. We usually freshen that up and the team is actively thinking about that as we head into the fall for 2024. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. Just real quick last one, if I could. If you could provide updated thoughts on the West Texas LPG loop and Elk Creek, what type of project economics you see for those investments? Sheridan Swords : Jeremy, this is Sheridan. I'll start with the West Texas completing that loop. So we're just finishing completing the loop that we started in 2018. It's a very low cost per barrel of capacity loop, and we'll be adding the pipeline capacity when it's done coming out of the Permian will be well over 700,000 barrels. We have contracts in place that give us a very nice return on that project with still a lot of capacity left to be contracted as we go forward. So we're very excited about that project. I think that's going to be a very, very low multiple projects when we're done, high return.  On the -- coming out of the Elk Creek as we continue to see volume grow in the Elk Creek on obviously, out of our G&P presence up there, where we have a large majority, 60% of the market share up there and then off of what volumes we see from third parties that we've already contracted. We now see the opportunity that we need to grow this pipeline to make sure we don't get caught short. So with the margins we see on there and just putting in pumps on our pipeline and just the last bit of capacity, it's going to be another very high-return, low-multiple project on that.  So obviously very excited as we continue to grow forward. Just another example, as we said, we will not get caught short of volume coming out of the Bakken. Operator : The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : First, I'd like to get a little bit more detail on the batching opportunities. Do you have examples of which types do you see the most upside for batching? And are you already seeing commercial interest in this? And just what underlies that $0.07 per gallon estimate. Sheridan Swords : I think we, this is Sheridan again. I'll give you 1 example of what we can do it as a batching opportunity is obviously with our Sterling pipeline that runs in between the Gulf Coast and the Mid-Continent region. We can put refined products on that to move refined products in between those 2 locations on the safe pipeline as we are moving NGLs on that pipeline as well. So that's an example of an area where we could be moving back and forth between two areas on refined products on the NGL pipeline. That's an example of batching. Theresa Chen : And what underlies the $0.07 estimate for the illustrative estimate? Sheridan Swords : The reason we use $0.07 illustrated estimates, that's kind of what we see the overall tariff in between those 2 areas tend to be from more on the refined products pipeline as we see that, then obviously, there could be upside to that as we go forward, depending on where the markets are.  But that's -- we wanted to use a number that was out there in the market, and that's what we see today. Theresa Chen : Got it. And on the blending piece, are you -- within this illustrative example, are you looking to blend 25,000 barrels per day of incremental butane into the gasoline pool? Or are you looking to expand margins by $0.20 for 25,000 barrels per day? Sheridan Swords : I think we see a lot of opportunities in both areas. We're trying to give you an idea of what the impact could be and give you more of a notionally where we're thinking about going on that. It could be both. We could be -- we think that there's opportunity for increased margin. We also think there's an opportunity for increased volume. But we're trying to give you an idea of what the impact could be and a little bit of sensitivities around that. That's how we came up with the numbers that we gave you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : I want to go back to the proxy again for a minute specifically on the CapEx in the proxy for 2023, it's higher than your revised CapEx guidance here this morning. So I'm wondering if you could just explain the variance there? And then does that imply that '23 CapEx could go higher if you FID more projects for the balance of the year? Walter Hulse : Michael, if you -- again, think of the timing when we did it. This is back September of last year. At that point in time, we thought the Saguaro pipeline would be further along in its process. We've now said that we expect FID between now and the end of the year. So that just from a timing standpoint, that analysis assumed that the Saguaro pipeline was fully included. And with the timing moving on that and some other projects, we see some of that kind of shifting out, some of it won't be realized that we will actually do it, and there may be other projects. The capital, as we look at commercial opportunities is continually revisited and the number that we gave you today is our expectation for 2023. Michael Blum : Okay. Perfect. And then I just wanted to ask on the Elk Creek expansion, I'm assuming that this will be brought on in phases. So is that correct? And anything you can provide in terms of a timeline for when you'll be adding capacity? And then what is the cost of the project? Kevin Burdick : Michael, it's Kevin. On the timing, we're not -- we're just going to -- we're not going to get caught short. As we look at our customers, we're going to make sure we've got that capacity there. We're still working through. And on the cost, we're given consistent with the NGL expansion as well, we decided to give here's what the impact is going to be in '23 as we move forward and we get to '24, then we'll provide -- it will be included in those numbers there as well. Operator : The next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Spiro Dounis : Maybe just to follow up on some of these questions and starting with CapEx. It sounds like these pipeline expansions are going to be pretty capital efficient. But maybe you could just give us a general sense of the trajectory on CapEx going into '24 on a stand-alone basis. Obviously, Mont Belvieu 5 dropping off you still have Mont Belvieu 6, you've added these pipeline expansions. And so directionally, without Saguaro, let's say, it doesn't seem like it's trending in any particular direction versus '23. Kevin Burdick : I mean, this is Kevin. Again, we're not going to start guiding to '24 yet, but just notionally, you think about the projects, we've got our -- at the activity levels we're seeing, it'd be relatively consistent from just kind of that routine stuff. So to the extent we don't announce any other larger projects than it would be in the ballpark. But again, like Walt said, we're constantly looking at projects. We're evaluating projects and some pop and get to the point where we execute and others don't. So it's kind of hard to say. But we don't -- there's nothing we're seeing other than Saguaro. It's more pipeline expansion type stuff. Spiro Dounis : Got it. And second question actually is on Saguaro. I know you're still working towards an FID there. But I guess I'm just curious if you've seen any incremental interest beyond the LNG project downstream of that pipeline? And if you're also sort of feeling any interest from potential JV partners yet? Kevin Burdick : Our focus right now on Saguaro is -- I mean, like we said in the remarks, there have been some positive developments, that's great. But our focus is on continuing to drive out and ensure we get the presidential permit and the timelines we need and continuing to refine our estimates, and we're focused on that -- the U.S. side of that pipeline. Operator : The next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Tristan Richardson : Kevin, you talked a little bit about the volatility we saw in June and July around ethane. But can you talk about maybe the dynamic you're seeing in the north obviously, with a tighter market at Belvieu with relief on the way and then obviously, weather's impact there. Were we able to see some incentivized ethane come in, into June? And then just curious maybe what you're seeing in the third quarter? Kevin Burdick : Just -- I'll start. And just in general, at a high level, the environment does bounce around. That's why we talk about we'll have opportunities to incentivize ethane. Once again, you've got to look at what's going on with gas prices up north in Canada and what's going on with Belvieu ethane. So we've had those opportunities. It's moved around. We're not going to provide the specific volumes. But again, it continues to be an opportunity for us. I mean Sheridan, anything to add? Sheridan Swords : One thing I'd add with that is that with this -- we had a big run-up in ethane prices, and it came off and overall is still higher than it was in the first part of June, which has allowed the Mid-Continent for later part of June, July and into August to be in full ethane recovery. Tristan Richardson : That's helpful. And then maybe, Walt, I understand we're not talking about '24 CapEx just yet or even identifying the cost of specific projects at this point. But maybe can you talk a little bit about long lead time procurement in '23 and maybe just generally what proportion of a project that might be? Walter Hulse : Well, I think that I would -- as you look forward, kind of think about it this way, that as Kevin mentioned, most of what we're looking at is build-outs from our existing system whether it's expansions or add-ons to that. So at the moment, we don't have any significant sized project that we have looming out there other than we've obviously talked about the potential of the Saguaro pipeline. And the long lead times. In this environment, you always have to be on that game. And so we are looking at that as it relates to all of our projects and how we can be there to meet the needs of our customers going forward. So that's just a reality in this day and age. Operator : The next question comes from Jean Salisbury with Bernstein. Jean Salisbury : Kevin, can you give a little bit more detail on why the gas pipeline segment is doing so much better than guidance? It seems like a lot of it is from renegotiating storage up to higher rates. So if you can give any kind of direction on how much of your storage capacity has been renegotiated up to the current rates already? And how much might be yet to come, that would be helpful as well. Kevin Burdick : Jean, really, it's just segment hitting on all cylinders. There's a variety of things. I mean, absolutely, after Uri, the increase in storage, both from an amount of storage contracted up and the rates we were getting that was a benefit. The segment has seen an opportunity, again, through its retained fuel and some gas sales to be opportunistic there. That's been strong. And with some market dynamics and how they've handled here recently parking loans and so forth has been a little bit of a benefit to us.  So really, the segments just performed outstanding, and we continue to find other projects as well. We're not done as it relates to looking at other storage opportunities, expansion opportunities, whether it be in Texas or Oklahoma. So again, segment is just doing a great job capturing the market opportunities that are provided. Jean Salisbury : Great. And one more for you, if I can. It seems like Bakken volumes are outpacing your expectations a bit. If you can just kind of say whether that's primarily been a function of more oil growth overall, higher GOR than you forecast or more ethane recovery than you forecast or just all 3, that would be helpful. Kevin Burdick : Well, when we think about gas, the gas production, that wouldn't have as much ethane recovery, but it's definitely the activity levels we're seeing, the productivity, it's a combination of both of those. Producers just continue to get better and better when it -- as it relates to their drilling techniques, their completion techniques, some of the length of the laterals has expanded in certain areas. All those things really go into giving us, again, a lot of strength as we exit Q2, where we're at and where we think it's going to go. So you're right. We do see strength, and we think we're in a great position. Operator : Next question comes from Neil Mehta with Bank of America. Neil Mehta : I noticed on the G&P side, you hit kind of the top end of your rate at $1.20 Mcf. I was wondering kind of the factors behind that, whether it was inflation, more wells driven towards the Bakken? And then how any commodity sensitivity would play into that and if that rate is sustainable going forward? Sheridan Swords : Neil, this is Sheridan. A lot of that, obviously, the increase in rates is going to be -- we had inflationary factors in there. Depends on the contract mix where -- what contracts coming in there. We've renegotiated contracts. So it's overall, as we move through, we continue to improve those contracts, to go forward. But I think one of the biggest ones is probably more of the inflationary escalators having the biggest impact. Neil Mehta : Okay. And then just a general question on the commercial synergies with batching, blending, bundling. How much of these synergies are kind of spread based and opportunistic versus finding new demand centers where kind of serving demand on a baseload basis. Kevin Burdick : Neil, this is Kevin. I'll take it, and again, we're not going to get into project-specific details. But I think Sheridan mentioned earlier, it's going to be -- those opportunities are going to be a mix of both. It's going to be volumetric, and it's going to be rate. And to the extent we can find opportunities for the higher rates, great. If it's more volume, that's great, too. So that's kind of how we're thinking about it. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley : First, just a quick follow-up on the blending synergies, the $70 million to $195 million. Is that predominantly butane blending? Or are there other types of product blending activities you see with the merger? I asked just because Magellan's business today is about $150 million a year on butane blending. So the synergy number is just pretty large. Sheridan Swords : Keith, this is Sheridan. We see some opportunities in butane blending, but we see opportunities in other blending as well, not just on butane, but other NGLs into different products. We see -- be able to expand that and be able to actually do the butane blending that is being done today also cheaper. Keith Stanley : Got it. And second question, just want to better understand the components of Saguaro. So it seems like Mexico Pacific's made really good progress with the trains being fully commercialized the first 2 anyway. Can you give an update on where you see things for the connecting pipeline in Mexico? I just have not heard as much about that. Is your understanding there's a lot that needs to be done on that to move forward? Or that's progressing well as well and consistent with your timeline? Kevin Burdick : Well, again, this is Kevin. Keith, the remarks I made earlier, we're going to stick to those. We're working -- there have been some positive developments, like you said. But at the end of the day, we're focused on the U.S. side and making sure we are in line with the overall timing and needs of the projects. So that's our focus right now is really on the U.S. side. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Jacob Nivasch : This is Jake Nivasch on for Neal. Just one for me. Going back to the synergies, but just touching on the different segment, the bundling part knowing like you guys said this is not entirely in your control, but I just wanted to get a sense, should we assume the synergies or the potential synergy opportunity that you're seeing here, is that -- would that be like evenly spread throughout the, I guess, 1- to 4-year time -- just near term in general? Or is that going to be lumpy potentially? Just trying to get a sense of the dynamics there. Sheridan Swords : Yes, Neal, this is Sheridan. Yes, there's some -- I think there's some opportunities near term, but it is going to be a little bit lumpy. As we said in the remarks, it's a lot is going to be dependent on when contracts come up and as we continue to see how these 2 assets work together and multiple touch points with the same customer is going to create opportunities. So we're going to see some in the beginning and then as contract roll off, will be lumpy throughout the 4-year time period. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Craig Shere : You add existing asset and commodity optimization synergies, I just want to dig in a little different manner, more into Brian's question on combined growth project opportunities. I understand you don't want to get into commercially sensitive areas maybe relating to crude transport, exports and all kinds of other things. But would it surprise you to see the combined business perhaps produce $2 billion to $3 billion more aggregate incremental growth project opportunities at your normal historical 4x to 6x build multiple by late decade. Walter Hulse : Craig, I think I would leave you with the thought that a lot of these opportunities are incremental off of our existing assets or Magellan's assets. So in most cases, we're expecting very low return -- very high return, low multiple opportunities. So not an enormous amount of capital that is necessary to make those hit. We will continue to evaluate that and see if there are other growth opportunities that come up. But I think that we would expect to be at the lower end of that 4x to 6x, if not significantly better than that. Craig Shere : Got you. And one other follow-up, maybe a little over the skis on this because you've got to finish the merger, but -- once we get past that, do you intend to break out commercial synergies on an ongoing basis? Pierce Norton : This is Pierce. We are in the process of deciding exactly how we're going to report all these segments. And then when we make that decision, we're going to move forward. But we're reporting by segment the way that we report on our business. As far as -- we'll give you as much detail as we possibly can without compromising anything we have from a competitive advantage standpoint. Operator : The next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : Thanks for all the details on the MMD transactions synergies. I was just curious, so it seems like where things stand now with regard to this transaction, there are some aspects of the transaction, which are beyond OK use control. So I was kind of curious if this weren't to go per the plan, what are some of the other levers that OK could pull to accelerate growth in the forward years? Pierce Norton : Well, I think the way I'd answer that question is that both companies right now, we're focused on the vote. Magellan is focused on their vote and ONEOK, we're focused on our vote. We believe that the Magellan unitholders and the ONEOK shareholders are going to see the value in this deal, the combined companies. And I think we're scratching the surface there because when we get these 2 companies combined, I think and get our employees collaborating together, I'm very confident in the innovation of both companies is going to turn out to be something that people are going to really be proud that they voted yes for this deal. Sunil Sibal : And then one clarification question. It seems like ONEOK filed a shelf last week for additional equity. So I was just curious if you could provide some context around that? Walter Hulse : Sure. I'm actually glad you asked that question. That is just renewing the ATM plan that we have had in place for better part of 7 or 8 years. We've had -- we have not utilized that within the last 5 years and don't really have any expectation to utilize it going forward. But we do think it's a nice liquidity tool to have in our -- to have available to us, but there is no expectation that we would be using the ATM on a going-forward basis. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in October and extends until we release earnings in late October. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Rocco and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s third quarter 2023 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. [Operator Instructions] With that, I will turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. On today\u2019s call is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; Sheridan Swords, Executive Vice President, Commercial liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing, which includes our commercial responsibility for our NGL business, refined products and crude businesses. Also available to answer your questions are Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President, Commercial of Natural Gas Pipelines; and Kevin Burdick, who has assumed the newly created position of Executive Vice President, Chief Enterprise Services Officer, with responsibilities for cybersecurity, information technology, enterprise optimization, innovation, and integration activities. This position will be vital as we continue to integrate systems, technologies and workforces following the acquisition of Magellan. Kevin is uniquely qualified for his experience in integration processes, information technology, commercial and corporate operations to lead the company as we continue to identify, prioritize and realize the value of the synergies as one company. We completed the acquisition just over a month ago. And since then, we have been fully focused on integration activities, maintaining the reliable and responsible operations, our customers and stakeholders expect from us. And at the same time, exploring optimization and integrated opportunities by engaging the combined commercial, operational and engineering teams. What has become evident at this point, based on the number of commercial synergies and opportunities is the importance of prioritization, the value of combining our companies, the potential commercial synergies and the opportunities going forward are significant, more to come on this in the coming months. But after September 25 and getting full access to both companies, I can say that the collaboration of our employees is already presenting additional possibilities. ONEOK\u2019s increased scale, scope and diversified operations are already enabling us to create exceptional value for our stakeholders. We have added primarily fee-based earnings and expect a significant free cash flow through the new refined products and crude businesses and expected tax synergies, which combined with ONEOK\u2019s legacy operations, is setting up a strong finish to 2023 and a solid foundation for 2024 performance. Yesterday, we announced third quarter 2023 earnings and increased our full year 2023 financial guidance on a pre-acquisition basis for the second time this year. We also provided new consolidated guidance that includes the impact of the Magellan acquisition. Walt will provide more detail in our guidance a little bit later, which is underscored by our strong volumes across our systems and favorable market conditions continuing to drive confidence in our expectations. We saw double-digit growth in NGL and natural gas processing volumes in the third quarter and continue to see robust producer activity across our operations with North Dakota natural gas production reaching a new all-time high in August. The industry landscape is healthy, and now with a more diversified portfolio of assets, we are even better positioned to make the most of opportunities across our operations. So with that, I will turn the call over to Walt for the financial performance and a guidance update. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. I\u2019ll start with a brief overview of our third quarter financial performance. ONEOK\u2019s third quarter 2023 net income totaled $454 million or $0.99 per share. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $1 billion, an 11% increase year-over-year. Adjusted EBITDA would have exceeded $1.1 billion for the third quarter 2023, excluding $123 million of transaction costs, $35 million of third-party fractionation costs and partial earnings from the Refined Products and Crude segment. Refined Products and Crude segment earnings totaled $40 million of adjusted EBITDA from the 6 days following the close of the Magellan acquisition, which includes a $9 million mark-to-market gain on commodity derivative positions settling in the fourth quarter 2023. It is worth noting those 6 days of earnings aren\u2019t necessarily an indicator of full third quarter segment earnings in part due to the uptick in our seasonal butane blending business. As of September 30, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit agreement and had more than $280 million of cash on hand. As we look ahead, we expect fourth quarter 2023 net debt to adjusted EBITDA, excluding transaction costs, to be approximately 3.7x on an annualized run-rate basis. Moving on to our increased guidance. On a pre-acquisition basis, we now expect 2023 net income midpoint of $2.61 billion and adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $4.8 billion, which is $125 million higher than our last guidance increase in August. These midpoints are specific to legacy ONEOK operations and exclude impacts from the Magellan acquisition in order to provide a more accurate comparison with our original 2023 guidance. Since that original guidance announcement in February, we have increased our adjusted EBITDA midpoint by $225 million. Our higher guidance expectations are driven by volume strength across our operations, higher average fee rates, lower than expected third-party NGL fractionation costs and sustained strength in our natural gas pipeline segment. Moving on to our newly announced 2023 consolidated financial guidance, which includes impacts from the Magellan acquisition. We expect a consolidated net income midpoint of $2.6 billion and adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $5.1 billion. Consolidated guidance includes earnings from the Refined Products and Crude segment following the close of the acquisition on September 25 and also includes $175 million of transaction costs. Earnings assumptions for the refined products and crude segment also include an approximately $40 million unfavorable earnings impact in 2023 related to commodity inventory balances being valued higher at the time of the acquisition than pre-acquisition value. As these inventories are sold, we will recognize a smaller margin than would have been recognized at the pre-acquisition value of the inventory. An additional $10 million unfavorable impact is expected in 2024 related to the same inventory valuation adjustment. The Refined Products and Crude segment is expected to perform in line with its previously increased expectations, which reflects solid segment fundamentals despite the impact of the inventory valuation. We continue to expect total capital expenditures, including growth and maintenance capital and excluding legacy Magellan CapEx of approximately $1.575 billion in 2023. This includes assumptions for continued strong producer activity and initial activities related to the expansion of Elk Creek pipeline and fully looping the West Texas NGL pipeline. As we look ahead, our financial outlook remains strong. When we announced the acquisition in May, we expected total combined adjusted EBITDA to approach $6 billion in 2024, supported by stable and growing volumes across our operations. As we stand today, our confidence in that outlook has only increased further, and we believe there is a potential to exceed those expectations. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update. Sheridan Swords : Thank you, Walt. Let\u2019s start with our natural gas liquids segment. Third quarter 2023 NGL volumes increased 11% year-over-year with all regions where ONEOK operates seeing increases compared with the third quarter 2022. Compared with the second quarter of 2023 both Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent NGL raw feed throughput increased 5%, driven by continued strong production activity in these basins, resulting in higher propane plus volumes and slightly higher ethane recovery levels. Rocky Mountain region volumes averaged more than 400,000 barrels per day in September. The continued growth in volume from the Rocky Mountain region provides momentum into 2024 and further supports why we have started initial long lead time activities for an Elk Creek pipeline expansion. We continue to maintain our ethane recovery assumptions for the remainder of the year, with the Permian in near full recovery, the Mid-Continent in partial recovery and opportunity to incent recovery in the Williston. In the natural gas gathering and processing segment, third quarter processed volumes averaged more than 2.3 billion cubic feet per day, a 12% increase year-over-year. As Pierce mentioned, North Dakota gas volumes have reached record production levels of more than 3.3 billion cubic feet per day in August. Our Rocky Mountain region process volumes averaged more than 1.5 billion cubic feet per day during the third quarter and reached more than 1.6 Bcf per day in September. We\u2019ve connected 450 wells in the region for the \u2013 through the first 9 months of the year compared with approximately 245 connections during the same period last year, a more than 80% increase. We have also increased our well connect guidance for 2023 due to the strong pace of completions and now expect to connect 525 to 575 wells compared with our previous guidance of 475 to 525 wells. Currently, there are approximately 37 rigs and approximately 15 completion crews operating in the basin with 20 rigs and approximately half of the completion crews on our dedicated acreage, which remains more than enough activity to grow production. In the Mid-Continent region, third quarter process volumes increased 10% year-over-year and increased 3% compared with the second quarter of 2023. We continue to see producers focus on higher crude producing areas and currently have 3 rigs on our dedicated acreage in the region. We have connected 46 wells in the region through the first 9 months of the year compared with 40 in the same period last year. We expect to be at the high end of our Mid-Continent well connect guidance of 45 to 55 wells in 2023. Moving on to the Refined Products and Crude segment, we only have 6 days of operation from this new segment in the third quarter due to the timing of the acquisition closing, but the segment continues to perform in line with expectations that were already increased earlier this year. Healthy business fundamentals continue to drive consistent performance, and we\u2019re currently seeing strong seasonal butane blending margins. Looking ahead, we see a growing list of opportunities, which will continue to drive growth in this segment through synergies. The more time we spend with the assets and with the legacy Magellan employees, we\u2019re seeing even more opportunities. In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, strong year-to-date results continue to benefit from demand from natural gas storage and transportation services. And we saw increased demand for interruptible services during the third quarter as extreme heat in Texas drove increased electric generation demand and pricing. We\u2019re seeing opportunities for additional expansion in Oklahoma and Texas, with additional storage expansion in Oklahoma and Texas and demand for long-term storage capacity remaining strong. We continue to work toward FID in the Saguaro Connector pipeline and expect to receive the presidential permit before the end of the fourth quarter. There has been significant interest from producers in the Permian Basin relative to shipping gas west to the potential LNG export facility and reported support from multi-large, well-known customers anchoring the export project. Pierce, this concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Sheridan and Walt, for adding color to what was a very strong quarter. With only 2 months much left in 2023, there\u2019s still time for progress to be made and a lot to be excited about. Since closing, I\u2019ve had the privilege of visiting many of our field and office locations, and we\u2019ll continue to visit additional sites. I\u2019m energized by the enthusiasm and the collaboration that I\u2019ve already seen between both the legacy ONEOK employees and the Magellan employees. I can say with certainty that we have incredible teams in place. Thank you to all of our employees for what you are doing to continue our high level of service through safe and reliable operations. And thank you to our investors for your support and trust in our vision for the future of ONEOK. Our future is bright and the long-term value of bringing our companies together will play out in the years ahead. With that, operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Today\u2019s first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Reynolds : Hi, good morning everyone. Maybe to start off on synergies, I know that you\u2019ve only had 4 weeks into the pro forma ONEOK and thus larger growth CapEx projects will likely take some time to commercialize and talk about. So curious if you can just talk about some of the smaller low-hanging fruit synergies that you have seen over the last few weeks, particularly around just commercial discussions around batching, blending and bundling. Have you seen some initial commercial success and when can we see some realizations there? Thanks. Pierce Norton : So I\u2019ll start off and then I\u2019m going to kick it over to Kevin on this. I am going to kind of start with part of your question is kind of what have you seen immediately with some of the kind of the smaller things. As you know, after closing, we do have immediate synergies that have been realized basically from day 1, which are board costs, credit facility renewals, cyber insurance, audit fees and then the executive organizational design that was put in place. So all of those kind of things added up to some immediate savings that will be annualized primarily in next year. I\u2019m going to turn it over to Kevin to kind of talk a little bit more about the process, both on the small things and the large things. Kevin Burdick : Yes, Brian, as we think about kind of how we went through the process and how we\u2019re tracking, if you go back to really the announcement back in May, we immediately started kind of documenting all the synergy opportunities through the integration planning work we were doing. Once we got closed, then we had access to a lot more information, a lot more data. We continue to refine those estimates of existing opportunities, and we found new ones as well as the company has got to talk more closely. At this point, we\u2019ve got around 250 different opportunities that we\u2019ve identified. And now we\u2019re going through and prioritizing those based on value, time to achieve, is there capital required, things like that, in many cases, like Pierce mentioned, some of it have been captured. Several others are being worked right now as we speak. And then others still, we\u2019ve got teams in place that are identifying, developing plans to go capture. I think the key is for each of these opportunities, we have owners identified that are held accountable for the results. And we\u2019ve got tracking mechanisms in place that we\u2019re tracking status, what\u2019s been captured, how that relates to the forecast and our estimates as we go forward. So that\u2019s kind of a general kind of overview of the process as it relates to some of the commercial synergies you asked about, yes, some of those may be a little longer lead time. But Sheridan and his team, have teams in place that are working these high-priority items that are \u2013 that have the opportunity to drive the most value. And then I\u2019ll just kind of close the question with all this will be factored in as we think about our guidance and go out with \u201824 guidance probably in February of next year. This will all be factored in and will be included in that guidance as we move forward. Brian Reynolds : Great. Thanks. Appreciate all that. Maybe to pivot just towards the forward growth CapEx outlook relative to the initial S-4, it seems like ONEOK has pulled forward some CapEx related to West Texas LPG and Elk Creek expansion. And it seems like Saguaro is trending towards more of a JV type relationship, which could defer capital further. So perhaps could you just update us on kind of a forward CapEx outlook maybe for \u201824 and beyond? Just given some of these recent trends? And does it imply that ONEOK could be trading closer to a 10% free cash flow yield if CapEx trends lower? Thanks. Walt Hulse : Well, Brian, we aren\u2019t going to give you 2024 CapEx guidance today. I think that all of the material projects have been disclosed at this point. And as we look towards 2024 and the opportunities that we have, we see quite a bit of opportunity without any significant material capital projects that we\u2019re ready to announce. So we think we\u2019re set up very well for 2024, but we will give you the guidance in February to firm that number up. Brian Reynolds : Great. Fair enough. I will leave it there. Have a great rest of your morning. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Jeremy Tonet : Hi, good morning. Pierce Norton : Hi, Jeremy. Jeremy Tonet : Just maybe one to pick up on the last question a little bit and fully appreciate not giving \u201824 guidance today, but just trying to get a state of affairs as it stands right now. And I think I wanted to be kind of clear, I guess, on the guidance. And if I\u2019m looking at this the right way, if what\u2019s implied for remainder of the year for fourth quarter, just over $1.4 billion, but then on a normalized basis, you back out most of that $50 million inventory adjustment and then there is a $40 million or so of transaction costs. So it seems like the run rate for the business might be close to $1.5 billion looking at 4Q. Now granted there is seasonality that can impact that at different points throughout the year, but then you also have $200 million of synergies from Magellan that should be realized and you have an increasing GOR and there is other projects set to come on over time in \u201824. I\u2019m just wondering, moving pieces wise, is that encapsulate what we should be thinking about? Is that a good base to work off of or any other color on these pieces would be helpful? Walt Hulse : Well, Jeremy, I think you\u2019ve done a good job of summarizing some of the moving parts there. And those \u2013 at this point, I would say, are all moving in a favorable direction. In my prepared remarks, I mentioned that on a run rate basis after you take out the merger expenses and the like, that we expect to be approximately at 3.7x debt to EBITDA in the fourth quarter, which is ahead of the expectations that we had when we announced the transaction. So that\u2019s obviously showing that we\u2019ve got favorable free cash flow materializing, and that\u2019s going to give us even more flexibility as it relates to capital allocation as we go into 2024. And we will update you all on that as we get into the 2024 season. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s very helpful. And I guess I wouldn\u2019t be a Wall Street analyst, if I wasn\u2019t asking now that the ink is dry on the Magellan agreement, anything you can share on what you\u2019re working on now going forward? Pierce Norton : Well, Jeremy, this is Pierce. We do the same thing we\u2019ve always done, which is we continue to look at different things out there. And like Walt said, with the capital allocation strategy that we have, it\u2019s just a lot more flexible going forward post Magellan and especially with our debt-to-EBITDA metrics coming down quicker than what we expected. So it\u2019s probably about as much color as I can get right now. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That\u2019s helpful. I will leave it there, thanks. Operator : Thank you. Our next question today comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. I wanted to ask on the West Texas NGL pipeline expansion. In the slide, you mentioned optionality to use the legacy system for NGLs refined products or crude. I\u2019m wondering if you could just expand on that? Is there any way to get a sense of how you think that will kind of split over time? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. I think what we\u2019re talking about there is that, as we explained before, the legacy system that we bought from Chevron, we\u2019ve been looping that system from West Texas all the way into the Fort Worth area where we tie into the Arbuckle II pipeline. When that loop is completed, which is in our West Texas project, we can segregate out the legacy system, the system we bought from Chevron and use it for a different product. And that is one of the things we\u2019re looking at in synergies, and we will continue to evaluate as we go forward. But that gives us an opportunity to be able to move more product back into the Permian, whether that be refined products, where it gives us opportunity to move crude out of the Permian into the Gulf Coast or leave it in NGL service. That\u2019s probably more of a longer-term type synergy that we have right now as we continue to look at that. But we do think that is an opportunity going forward to be able to leverage our three liquid pipeline streams in that pipeline, what we use it for. Michael Blum : Okay. Got it. Thanks for that. And then just one question on the Bakken. So it seems like the Bison Express pipeline project is moving ahead. So I wanted to just get your thoughts on that project. Does this reduce ethane recoveries volumes for you? Or ultimately should we think of this as sort of a tailwind because ultimately, it opens up the potential for more natural gas production in the basin, which obviously would lead to more associated NGL production? Sheridan Swords : Michael, I think what this project does is make sure that we have enough natural gas takeaway out of the basin, we wouldn\u2019t want that to be a constraint on the producers up there well, I do not think it has a big impact on our incentivized ethane program that we\u2019ve had going on there because today, there is enough natural gas production coming out of the basin. So I think it\u2019s going to allow the producers to continue to grow and have a surety of natural gas takeaway without hurting our ethane recovery benefits that we have today. Michael Blum : Great. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Please go ahead. Spiro Dounis : Thanks, operator. First question just maybe on the export opportunity. I don\u2019t think that was a synergy necessarily when you announced the deal, but something you may\u2019ve been better positioned to do post Magellan. Just curious where that stands now and then expanding into exports is kind of high on the priority list of things to do post close? Pierce Norton : Spiro, this is Pierce. And I\u2019ll let Sheridan kind of fill in some of the details here. But we\u2019ve said all along that what Magellan brings to us is the expertise to operate docs and to build docks and to just really understand the dynamics of marketing across docs. We don\u2019t expect to necessarily turn any of those docs into anything other than what they are currently doing. But we do believe that global demand will continue to grow both in crude and both in probably refined products and liquefied petroleum gas and propane. So we\u2019re going to continue to look at that. And as the market dictates and as we learn more, and if we get some customers that either on the producing side or the takeaway side that wants to take space across stock, then we\u2019re going to continue to look at that. So Sheridan, you got anything to add? Sheridan Swords : The only thing I would add to that, Pierce, is that with the addition of the Magellan employees, we have much more confidence in both our engineering and operation capability since that is what they bring to the table since they are already operating marine docs and built marine docks. Spiro Dounis : Got it. That\u2019s great color. Thanks for that, guys. Second question just going for the Bakken. I guess we\u2019re hearing increased talk of peers, maybe looking to develop LNG infrastructure in the region, too. You\u2019ve obviously got a pretty good stronghold there. But just curious how you\u2019re assessing the risk of kind of new competition in the basin going forward? Sheridan Swords : What I \u2013 this is Sheridan again. What I would say on competition coming in the basin is what we\u2019ve said for many times is that on the G&P side, we have 60% of the market share, and that feeds our NGL pipeline. So we very \u2013 feel very secure about that volume. And then on the third-party NGL customers, we have long-term contracts with them, and that also gives us a surety that we will be able to maintain our volume coming out of the Bakken and be able to capture the growth going forward. Spiro Dounis : Great. That\u2019s all I have today, guys. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Tristan Richardson : Hey, good morning, guys. Appreciate the comments on what you\u2019re seeing so far early in the merger. Just curious, like we\u2019ve replaced the concentric circle with a telescope, but in that telescope, you talked about mid to high-single-digit dividend growth. Curious about capital allocation now that the merger is closed and thinking about balancing project opportunities with allocating free cash for repurchases and dividend growth to be competitive with peers. Walt Hulse : Yes, well, Tristan, as I just mentioned, our debt metrics are coming in line even quicker than we had expected. We continue \u2013 we think that direction will continue. And that\u2019s going to give us significantly greater flexibility as we move forward to think about capital allocation. It\u2019s going to give us plenty of capital to take advantage of high-return projects as they become available and think about ways of returning value to shareholders. And we\u2019re going to lay that out as we get into \u201824 as we see forward where our debt metrics are headed and we will give you more clarity as we get into February. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it, Walt. And then maybe, Sheridan, where do you see sort of this GOR theme, particularly in the Bakken going long-term, particularly as producers consolidate \u2013 operator consolidation drives producer efficiency, but just where \u2013 what\u2019s the end game or in terms of where do we top out from a GOR perspective long-term? Sheridan Swords : Tristan, that\u2019s a good question. And we\u2019ve had that talk to our producers about that as well. And they don\u2019t know where the top end of it is. What we do know is as wells continue to age, the GOR continues to grow up \u2013 grow. Now we do see some up and down in the GOR overall for the basin because as new rigs come on, depending on where they come on, they may have a starting point of a lower or higher GOR. So overall, it makes it move around. But every well up there as it continues to decline, the GORs continue to rise. And so that gives us a lot of confidence that even in a flat crude environment, which crude is growing right now, but in a flat crude environment, we are still going to see some pretty good growth in the gas volume in the basin. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it. Thank you, gentlemen. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi, good morning. You referenced contracting in the Permian on nine plants to kind of underpin West Texas LPG and the looping. Can you give any more detail on the duration of those contracts even qualitatively? As I\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware, we seem to be heading towards severe Permian NGL pipe overbuild in 2025. So having long-term contracts seems important. Sheridan Swords : I would say that we have long-term contracts. That\u2019s the people that we have contracted with both now and for the LPG expansion or the NGL expansion are long-term contracts. So we feel comfortable that we have the volume behind to be \u2013 to have a very favorable return on that project and with a lot of upside as we continue to grow. We think it\u2019s a very cost-effective way to do it, that we can be able to compete going forward even as new pipelines come online. Jean Ann Salisbury : Thanks, that\u2019s helpful. And you may have said this before, but can you remind us roughly what portion of the liquids pipelines for the combined company do you think you can generally take the full PPI indexation on? Sheridan Swords : On the liquids pipelines, on the NGL pipeline, a lot of it is more driven by individual contracts as we do as not as much on the tariff itself. And then there is a larger portion of that on our new refined product system that contain that \u2013 but about 70% of our tariffs on the refined product system are at market rate that we can move as we want to. And so 30% would be more on a FERC tariff rate. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. Thanks so much. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Harry Mateer with Barclays. Please go ahead. Harry Mateer : Hi, good morning. Walt, you mentioned the 3.7x annualized run rate leverage number for 4Q ex transaction costs, I guess following up on Jeremy\u2019s question a bit. Just curious how much seasonality is in that number? And can you just confirm your goal still to bring leverage to the 3.5x level that you previously laid out? And it sounds like more quickly than you previously thought? Walt Hulse : Well, Harry, we\u2019re pretty positive on \u201824 and where things are headed. So I think that we expect to continue to make progress on our leverage metrics as we go throughout 2024. We have said aspirationally all along, that 3.5% is a good spot to be. We don\u2019t care if we go below it a little bit. That\u2019s fine. If we have got significant earnings and it drives our debt-to-EBITDA below 3.5%, that\u2019s a good problem to have. So, we are very pleased with the trajectory of that credit metric and have no reason to think it\u2019s going to change any direction. Harry Mateer : Okay. Thanks. And then my follow-up is when you think about that target, how do you go about the balance between EBITDA growth and debt reduction? And maybe put differently, should we think about ONEOK being in the bond market refinancing? You have some small maturities next year, do you think it\u2019s more likely that free cash flow will take care of that and maybe that puts ONEOK out of the bond market for a while as things currently stand? Walt Hulse : Well, I am not going to say we will or we won\u2019t be in the bond market, but I would just say that the last several maturities that we have had, we have called for cash. We are generating a lot of cash. So, I think we have got the flexibility to manage our debt portfolio in a very comfortable manner. But we are going to keep our flexibility. If it makes sense for us to go to the credit markets for a reason, we may or may not do that. But you can see what we have done in the last several. And given the size, we are probably going to maintain that flexibility. Harry Mateer : Okay. Understood. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Thanks for the time. My first question is just around the synergy ops that you talked about on Slide 8. Specifically, I don\u2019t know if you all could comment yet, maybe it\u2019s too early, but I am just wondering if you could comment on how quickly you all are thinking about the potential for start realizing some of that batching upside, which looks quite interesting. Kevin Burdick : I mean just in general, as we look at the synergies, obviously, they are going to \u2013 there is going to be a variety of scenarios that play out. Some will get very quickly, potentially by the end of the year. There may be others that are going to take some capital and some effort to put things in the pipeline in the ground or other activities like that, that may span out of ways. So, it will be a blend. But I think again, the focus here is that our confidence level in achieving these things continues to grow as we get more information. Neal Dingmann : That makes sense. And then \u2013 go ahead, I am sorry. Pierce Norton : Well, I said \u2013 this is Pierce. What I am going to tell you is that to kind of tag it on to what Kevin is saying is that we are confident that these opportunities are there. It\u2019s just a matter of the timing of when they come in, and we will let you know that as we give our guidance from year-to-year. Neal Dingmann : Okay. Thanks for that add. And then just \u2013 you touched on this a little bit earlier, but my second question is just on Rockies and Mid-Con activity. It seemed like last quarter was solid. You talked about a number of connects there, especially in the Rocky. So, I am just wondering are you currently seeing sort of similar type activities, just any color you could add there. Thank you. Sheridan Swords : Neal, this is Sheridan. Yes, we still are seeing good activity in the Bakken. We have increased our well count activity, and that\u2019s to show you what we are seeing. And we think that\u2019s going to continue or know that\u2019s going to continue into 2024 in the Bakken. So, we are very excited about that. And that\u2019s why we continue moving on long lead time items with the Elk Creek expansion. And then the Mid-Continent, as we said multiple times, has really been surprising us to the upside that more producer activity out there, especially with oil-driven rigs that is producing high GPM or high liquid content gas, that\u2019s really \u2013 not only producing more gas in the region, but also more liquids for the NGL pipeline. So, we continue to see growth being very \u2013 we are very optimistic about growth going through the fourth quarter and into 2024. Neal Dingmann : Thank you. Thanks guys. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Hi. I wanted to ask related to the line of commentary around the synergies. Can you just help us think about how much commercial synergies are in that $450 million to $470 million 2023 refined products and crude EBITDA guidance for the year. And specifically, are there incremental butane blending opportunities during this winter and 4Q outside of what MMP had locked in during this past summer? Just in light of still elevated octane spreads versus historical levels and your natural length in butane, coupled with your marketing and optimization capabilities? Sheridan Swords : Theresa, yes, we do think there is a little bit this quarter. As you said it, a lot of it has been locked down or been hedged, but we do have some above that, and we are seeing wider spreads at this time, so availability is there, and also with our position, legacy normal butane position. There is opportunity there. We will have the butane available, and we can work a little bit on logistics cost. We think most of that\u2019s really going to come as we come into next year where we will see a much bigger opportunity for synergies in the butane blending in the 2024 timeframe. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Keith Stanley at Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Keith Stanley : Hi. Good morning. First, just a follow-up on West Texas LPG, it\u2019s a big step-up in capacity from 300 a day to 740 a day. Do you see any strategic rationale to building or buying Permian plants to bolster your long-term NGL supply position? It would seem like you would have a lot of synergies doing that and a lot of operating leverage as you fill the pipeline. Sheridan Swords : Keith, we continue to look at that, and we have looked at a lot of different opportunities out there. What I can tell you is just by us expanding, we started off at about 140,000 barrels a day, now we are going up to 700,000 barrels a day. It has not been an impediment for us to be able to contract NGLs on that pipeline. But we will continue to look at as opportunities come if we need to get into the G&P space. And if it makes sense, we will get into it and do that. But so far, we have been able to contract and expand that pipeline without having a G&P presence. And a lot of that is, as you think about it, we have a very integrated value chain in touch. A lot of the producers out there in many different areas, so if we look holistically across our system, we can create and offer a very attractive program to them to incentivize barrels coming on to our West Texas system. Pierce Norton : Keith, this is Pierce. I think this is the point in the call where I would tell you that we are going to be intentional and disciplined about any future M&A opportunities. Keith Stanley : Got it. Thanks for that. Second question on SWRO [ph], and sorry if I missed this, but \u2013 can you say, are you in discussions or looking at working with potential partners on the project, or do you think it\u2019s more likely you would move forward on that by yourself? Walt Hulse : We are in a position right now where we are working towards FID and expecting the presidential permit here by the end of the year. And we will lay out the full program if and when we get to that FID point in time. Keith Stanley : Okay. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. Good morning everybody and thanks for taking my questions. So, my first question was related to the West Texas LPG and I apologize if I missed this, could you indicate what is that system running at right now? It seems like, you had a little bit of a step down in volumes. Sheridan Swords : West Texas LPG throughput, yes, we can \u2013 I am sorry, as soon as your question about how \u2013 what are our volumes looking at like on the West Texas throughput today? Sunil Sibal : Yes, ballpark. Sheridan Swords : Yes, our volumes continue to \u2013 we continue to grow that volume, especially as we bring some of these plants online. But right now, we are running about 430,000 barrels a day is coming through our whole Gulf Coast \u2013 Permian and Gulf Coast system on the LPG. And we have capacities when we get this completed, we will be able to have capacity for over 740,000 barrels a day. Sunil Sibal : Okay. And thanks for that. And then my second question was a little bit more broader. We have seen a number of E&P deals announced over the course of last few months. And I was curious if you had any dialogues with your E&P customers with regard to that, and how is that impacting your dialogue with the producer customers? Pierce Norton : So, I will kind of take \u2013 I think that\u2019s a big picture question. First of all, I think with \u2013 go all the way back to OXY with what they did with Anadarko and then fast forward to what Exxon has done and the most recently, Chevron. We actually view that as very positive because most of those companies are kind of reinvesting in domestic production, very large companies. So, we see that as a positive for domestic production here in the United States, so that\u2019s the first thing I would say. The second thing was as we do business with all of those people, and now that we are not only in gathering and processing, but in natural gas pipelines, in the NGL business, refined products and crude that goes into this bundling concept where when you have that as a producer, one of your areas, you have added different businesses going forward. We just feel like there is even going to be more opportunities to bundle different deals together to get more and more businesses with these larger companies. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Thanks. Thanks Pierce. Operator : Thank you. And our next question today comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Neel Mitra : Hi. Good morning. Thanks for taking my questions. It seems like everything is going well, you are going to be below 4x leverage easily for 2024 and the $6 billion in guidance seems pretty conservative. How are you looking at shareholder returns right now? Is a repurchase program in 2024 on the table, just as we look for how to return cash to shareholders after this merger and when we can think about how we are going to do that? Walt Hulse : Well, I would say, clearly, our financial flexibility is increasing. And all of the capital allocation tools that are available are available to us and will be considered going forward, so plenty of flexibility and stay tuned. Neel Mitra : Okay. Great. And then second question on building an LPG terminal on the Gulf Coast. Some of your peers have talked about how they initially priced at greenfield and now they will price everything at brownfield to try to combat new entrants. Does this make LPG exports or a new terminal kind of lower on the priority list than the batching, bundling, etcetera, when you consider the barriers to entry just with pricing for existing players that are in the space right now? Sheridan Swords : Neel, this is Sheridan. We still have aspirational to have LPG export terminal. We are not going to do a project that\u2019s uneconomical. But we do have one of \u2013 or the only person that has the amount of volume at our disposal to be able to support a new dock, and we do have customers that are interested in seeing a new dock being built. So, we think there is an opportunity there as well. As it relates to how we prioritize that with our other opportunities, we are going to \u2013 as Kevin said, we are going to look at things on capital. How quick that we can get it to market and how much money we are going to make on that to determine which projects we have our resources work on. But I don\u2019t think that the LPG export dock has moved down in the list from where it is before. We still are continuing to look at and still have conversations. But it is a much longer term project than some of the other ones that we have in the synergy category. Neel Mitra : Got it. I appreciate the commentary. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And our final question today comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : Congratulations on the closing and quarter, and thanks for taking the question. Just one for me, and you kind of talked around this a little bit or kind of responded to some Q&A on it. But Pierce, you mentioned prioritizing incremental commercial opportunities identified post close at the start of this call. And I am a little unclear, given all the commentary, if this is mostly about chopping wood and management bandwidth or despite better than expected deleveraging, are you starting to see more accretive capital deployment opportunities than you are prepared to pursue all at once? Pierce Norton : Well what we are seeing is as we have put these two \u2013 just as a reminder, prior to September 25th, you are limited in how much discussion and how far you can go with some of these discussions both on \u2013 with people, contracts, commercial opportunities. So, what we are seeing is as we have gotten access to all the information, all the contracts and the people and our people are working together, we are just seeing more and more opportunities. And so we are going to prioritize that. It\u2019s hard to tell right now if we have overrun some of those kind of things, but that\u2019s something that we are \u2013 we definitely have enough that we can prioritize the things that are going to make the highest impact in the shortest amount of time. So, those are the ones that we are focusing on, and we are managing through the rest of it. But we are not going to lose an opportunity because we feel like we are \u2013 we don\u2019t have resources, we will get resources to deal with those. Craig Shere : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Alright. Thank you everybody. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter starts when we close our books in January and extends until we release earnings in late February. We will provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you for joining us and have a good day. Operator : Thank you, sir. This concludes today\u2019s conference call. We thank you all for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect your lines and have a wonderful day.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Drew and welcome to ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter and year end 2023 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK\u2019s expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the Safe Harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder for Q&A, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up in order to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I will turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew and good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us this morning. On today\u2019s call is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Sheridan Swords, who is our Executive Vice President, Commercial Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. Also available to answer your questions are Chuck Kelley, our Senior Vice President, Natural Gas Pipelines and Kevin Burdick, who is the Executive Vice President of Chief Enterprise Services. Record volumes, strong financial performance and the closing of the Magellan acquisition solidified 2023 as a year of significant growth and transformation for ONEOK. Momentum from our operations in 2023 is setting the stage for additional growth in 2024. With our earnings release yesterday, we reported double-digit NGL and natural gas processing volume growth year-over-year and continued fee-based earnings growth in all three of our legacy business segments. We also provided 2024 guidance along with some insight into 2025 and beyond, including an expectation for double-digit adjusted EBITDA growth in 2024. Walt will provide more detail on our guidance, which is underscored by solid business fundamentals, demand for the products that we deliver, and a full year of earnings contribution from our refined products and crude oil segments and the initial realization of acquisition-related synergies. Before I turn the call over to Walt, I want to share a few data points that help sum up the exceptional growth ONEOK has experienced in recent years. While our business continues to transform and to look to the future, it\u2019s still important to reflect on what has already been accomplished. I\u2019ll share just a handful of highlights, but there are many more. First, 2023 marked ONEOK\u2019s 10th consecutive year of adjusted EBITDA growth throughout various commodity cycles. Over the same time period, we have increased dividends paid to $3.82 per share from $1.48 per share, a more than 150% increase. And in January, the Board approved another increase. Our volumes out of the Rocky Mountain region have set numerous records. Over the last 5 years alone, NGL volumes from the region have grown at a more than 20% annual growth rate and natural gas processing volumes have grown at a 10% annual growth rate. We have continued to expand our asset portfolio, increasing our extensive pipeline network to more than 50,000 miles from approximately 30,000 miles in 2013 and adding nearly 2 Bcf per day of natural gas processing capacity and 3 fractionators. And finally, through all of this growth, both internally and by acquisition, we\u2019ve continued to prioritize safety and our sustainability and ESG-related performance, consistently ranking towards the top of our industry peer group, including a AAA rating from MSCI. We have achieved a great deal in recent years. And over the course of our company\u2019s history and now with a more diversified portfolio of assets, we are even better positioned to make the most of future opportunities. With that, I\u2019ll turn the call over to Walt. Walt Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. Before I get to guidance, I\u2019ll start with a brief overview of our fourth quarter and full year financial performance. ONEOK\u2019s fourth quarter and full year 2023 net income totaled $688 million and $2.7 billion respectively. Adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter 2023 and more than $5.2 billion for the full year. While there were a number of unique items contributing to the significant year-over-year increase in results such as the Medford settlement and the Magellan acquisition, the strong performance from our legacy business segments continued. Even excluding these unique one-time items, ONEOK\u2019s adjusted EBITDA would have increased more than 15% year-over-year. As of December 31, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit facility and had more than $335 million of cash on hand. In 2023, ONEOK extinguished $1.3 billion of long-term debt, contributing to a fourth quarter 2023 run rate net debt-to-EBITDA ratio in line with our previously discussed target of 3.5x. In January, we increased our quarterly dividend 3.7% to $0.99 per share or $3.96 per share on an annualized basis. Going forward, ONEOK expects to target an annual dividend growth rate ranging between 3% to 4%. We also announced a $2 billion share repurchase authorization, which we target to largely use over the next 4 years. This program is complementary to the dividend growth rate when thinking about shareholder return in the future. Over the next 4 years, ONEOK\u2019s combination of dividends and share repurchases is expected to trend towards a target of approximately 75% to 85% of forecasted cash flow from operations after identified capital expenditures. Our commitment to maintaining our financial flexibility and taking advantage of attractive return, capital growth opportunities that complement our now larger and more diverse operating footprint continues to be the highest priority in our capital allocation strategy. This commitment will continue to create value for our investors and support ONEOK\u2019s position as one of the midstream leaders of return on invested capital. Now moving on to 2024 guidance. We provided a net income midpoint of more than $2.8 billion, an EPS midpoint of $4.88 per diluted share and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.1 billion. We also include in guidance related to the synergies we expect to realize over the next couple of years. This guidance reflects higher earnings from all business segments, excluding the Medford insurance settlement and a full year contribution of the refined products and crude segment. Sheridan will provide more detail on each of the operating segments in a moment. As for synergies, we\u2019ve assumed a midpoint of $175 million of total realized annual cost and initial commercial synergies in 2024, followed by an additional $125 million in 2025. We expect additional synergies in 2026 and beyond as capital expenditure projects to connect our NGL to the refined products and crude businesses are completed. As it relates to capital expenditures, we\u2019ve assumed a total of $1.85 billion, which includes growth and maintenance capital. This guidance reflects the investment necessary to keep up with the expected levels of producer activity and attractive return growth projects, including the MB-6 Fractionator and expansions of our West Texas NGL and Elk Creek NGL pipelines, all expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2025. Once these projects are completed in early 2025, we expect to be on a trend of decreasing capital expenditures over the near to medium-term. Our expected 2024 capital guidance does not include the Saguaro Connector project or any other projects that have not yet reached financial investment decision. I\u2019ll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update. Sheridan Swords : Thank you, Walt. We saw strong year-over-year volume growth in 2023 with natural gas processing volumes up 14% and NGL volumes up 10% compared with 2022. Rocky Mountain region volumes were particularly strong with double-digit growth in both NGL and natural gas processing volumes year-over-year. Higher producer activity levels, increased well connects, and continued strong gas-to-oil ratios drove record fourth quarter volumes totaling nearly 400,000 barrels per day of NGLs and nearly 1.6 Bcf per day of processed volume. Mid-Continent process volume increased 15% year-over-year and Permian Basin NGL increased 19% year-over-year, both benefiting from solid producer activity throughout the year in those regions. Well connects across our operations increased more than 50% compared with 2022. We continue to see the benefit of those connections throughout 2024 as volumes ramp. Our Natural Gas Pipeline segment significantly exceeded its 2023 financial guidance range on higher earnings from long-term storage services and higher rates from negotiated fee-based contracts. Our Refined Products and Crude segment adjusted EBITDA totaled more than $420 million in the segment\u2019s first full quarter of operations since the acquisition of Magellan. This segment\u2019s performance was driven by midyear tariff increases, longer haul refined product shipments and steady crude oil transportation volumes. Our optimization and marketing activities, which includes liquids blending also benefited from strong margins and volumes. Turning to 2024. Key drivers for our higher 2024 guidance includes stable producer activity and continued production efficiency improvements, providing strong natural gas and NGL volumes across our systems. Solid refined products demand, continued strength in fee-based earnings and rates and our first full year of annualized synergies. In our Natural Gas Liquids segment, we expect higher year-over-year adjusted EBITDA and raw feed throughput volumes should be driven primarily by growth out of the Rocky Mountain region. Despite lower assumptions for incentivized ethane recovery in 2024 and a low margin contract expiration from Overland Pass pipeline in November of 2023, we still expect higher year-over-year NGL volumes. The expired contracts volume is being replaced with higher rate barrels ramping through 2024. Healthy demand for ethane from the petrochemical industry and wide gas-to-oil ratios are setting up a positive backdrop for NGL markets in 2024. On our system, we\u2019ve assumed high levels of ethane recovery continue in the Permian Basin in 2024 and partial recovery in the Mid-Continent. We also expect to see continued opportunities to incentivize ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region. As Walt mentioned, we\u2019ve officially moving forward with the expanding the Elk Creek pipeline to 435,000 barrels per day, increasing our total NGL capacity out of the Rocky Mountain region to 575,000 barrels per day. This additional capacity will support future growth and increased ethane recovery. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. We expect volume growth in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions driven by higher-than-anticipated well connections in 2023 and consistent producer activity levels expected in 2024. In the Rocky Mountain region, we expect processing volumes to grow 9% at the midpoint compared with 2023 and an average more than 1.6 Bcf per day in 2024. This outlook includes the impact from the weather we experienced so far this year, including well freeze-offs in mid-January when the wind chills dropped below negative 60 degrees. By the end of January, volumes had recovered to levels achieved prior to the extreme cold. Strong producer activity levels in 2023 and the continued trend of high gas-to-oil ratios drove several months of record North Dakota natural gas production with the latest record of 3.52 Bcf per day set in December. Producer activity has carried over into 2024. Even through the winter months, as we enter March, there are 36 rigs in the Williston Basin with 20 on our dedicated acreage. Through detailed planning sessions with our customers, we expect additional rigs to return as we move into spring. Additionally, we continue to see a trend at producers drilling longer laterals in the basin, 3 miles in length or more as opposed to the historical 2-mile laterals. These longer laterals continue to drive improved production efficiencies and result in fewer well connections needed to grow gathered volumes. As detailed in our earnings presentation, we expect 3-mile laterals to account for approximately 30% of the wells drilled on our acreage in 2024 compared with only 7% 2 years ago. In the Mid-Continent region, we are currently seeing approximately 45 rigs in Oklahoma with 6 operating on our acreage. We expect processing volumes to grow approximately 3% at our guidance midpoint compared with 2023 and average approximately 770 million cubic feet per day in 2024. Rig activity across the basin will continue to drive additional NGLs to our system. In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we continue to expect strong demand for natural gas storage and transportation services in 2024. At the end of 2023, more than 75% of our natural gas storage capacity was contracted under long-term agreements, and our pipeline transportation capacity was nearly 96% contracted. We expect similar levels in 2024. From a natural gas storage perspective, we continue to focus on expansion projects. We are currently working on a project to reactivate 3 Bcf of previously idled storage in Texas and are further expanding our injection capabilities in Oklahoma. In February 2024, the FERC approved the Saguaro Connector Pipelines presidential permit, and we expect the final investment decision on the pipeline by midyear 2024. Moving on to the Refined Products and Crude segment. We continue to expect healthy business fundamentals and the segment\u2019s more than 85% fee-based earnings to drive consistent performance. We\u2019ll see the full year effect of higher refined products tariff rates, driven by the midyear 2023 increase of 11.5%. And we expect additional mid-single-digit increases in July 2024. We also expect an increase in refined products volumes, including a benefit from the completion of our expansion to El Paso. Additional benefits are expected from higher volumes and margins related to liquids blending in 2024, driven by favorable market conditions and synergy-related opportunities. Walt discussed commercial synergies earlier, which we expect primarily to show up in our Refined Products and Crude segment\u2019s earnings. Pierce that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Sheridan and Walt. I started this call by saying that 2023 was a year of significant growth and transformation. None of this would have been possible without our dedicated employees, with many of those employees actually listening to this call today. So I want to make sure that I thank them publicly for all that they did in 2023. With us now 5 months post closing of the acquisition, our employees have continued to focus on our integration efforts and prioritize the reliable operations of our assets in the high quality of service expected at ONEOK. Everything we have accomplished this past year means nothing if we don\u2019t do it safely and responsibly. From an environmental perspective, we\u2019ve made significant progress toward our greenhouse gas emissions reduction target, achieving reductions that equate to approximately 50% of our total 2030 reduction target. And from a safety perspective, we brought together two companies with leading safety cultures and performance. And combined, we will continue to focus on the safety and health of our employees in the communities that we operate. We\u2019ve created an operational platform that provides increased scale, scope and diversification. It\u2019s a platform which is already providing opportunities and enabling us to generate exceptional value for our stakeholders. Looking ahead, ONEOK is well positioned in 2024 for another year of significant growth and opportunity. With that, operator, we\u2019re now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Brian Reynolds with UBS. Please go ahead. Brian Reynolds : Hi. Good morning, everyone. Maybe to start off on synergies on Slide 10. We\u2019ve seen the risk-weighted synergies increase to roughly $400 million from the original expectation of $100 million. So perhaps just a two-part question. First part is, can you provide some concrete commercial examples of what\u2019s driving that upward revision? Just anything specific? And then second, based that these risk-adjusted synergies are up roughly $300 million, could you perhaps update us on the initial like $200 million to $800 million synergy range that you provided last quarter? It seems like there\u2019s a little bit of upside to that range at this point. Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Well, you\u2019re right, we do see some upside to our synergies be going forward, as we say in the $700 million. And really, a lot of it is going to be driven by being able to bring our refined product and crude oil and NGL systems together, which we have multiple opportunities in many different areas of our systems. And really, as we continue through \u201824 and \u201825, the thought is going to be, as we said before, in prioritization of which ones we\u2019re going to work and we can bring forward. We started 24 wells to be driven by, we\u2019ve reached a substantial amount of our cost saving synergies already through \u201823, and we\u2019ll see a full year of that in \u201824. Kevin Burdick : Brian, this is Kevin Burdick. The other thing, just on the \u2013 if you think about the cost savings, we have realized the vast majority of those already. So we\u2019ll see the full impact in \u201824. A couple of examples to that would be our organizational design and restructuring activities are complete. So that will be factored in. Another example, public company costs have been eliminated for the Magellan Company. So that\u2019s another example as well as many others. So the cost savings side will play a big role in 2024 as well. Brian Reynolds : Great, thanks. Appreciate that. Maybe to switch to just the updated return on capital framework. You outlined a 3% to 4% dividend growth, but kind of updated it with the updated payout ratio of 75% to 80% with buybacks and dividends. So looking at the model, it seems like it\u2019s pretty clear on 2024 that you can kind of come to that conclusion. But when I look at \u201825 and \u201826, leverage trends below 3.5x, you should have some excess cash based on existing projects that are FID at this point with potentially Saguaro going into that bucket. So as we look in \u201825 or \u201826, can you maybe update us on how we should think about the return of capital framework. Could we see maybe an increase of buybacks? Or how should we think about maybe interest in M&A or maybe other projects that may come to fruition in \u201825 and \u201826, maybe keep kind of that return on capital framework unchanged. Walt Hulse : Sure. Well, I want to start out by, again, continuing to point out that during 2023, we were able to extinguish over $1.3 billion of debt, including paying off maturities as they came due and making some open market repurchases in the debt market. So we obviously are continuing to produce significant amounts of free cash flow. As we go into 2024, I think you\u2019re correct that we expect to begin our share repurchase program. We do expect that to ramp over the 4-year period as we\u2019re still getting through our debt-to-EBITDA metrics that we\u2019ve gone out with the goal of that 3.5x. So we will expect that to ramp over time. But we do have an intention to begin that program here in 2024. So I think we\u2019re set up to make those forward capital returns to our shareholders while still retaining in that additional 25% \u2013 15% to 25% of unallocated cash flow, meaningful free cash flow for high-return capital projects that we have not yet identified. Brian Reynolds : Great. Makes sense. Super helpful. Enjoy the rest of the morning. Pierce Norton : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Neel Mitra with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Neel Mitra : Hi, good morning. I was wondering what you\u2019re assuming for any third-party frac costs in 2024 and the timing of MB-6 and how that would impact those costs? Sheridan Swords : Well, in MB-6, as we said in our prepared remarks and in our earnings release, come up in the first quarter of 2025, and it\u2019s 125,000 barrel a day frac. So it will have a significant impact to our third-party frac costs. Our third-party frac costs in 2024 will be about $30 million a quarter, so I think, of what we\u2019ve estimated on that piece. So we\u2019ll be needing third-party frac costs through the remainder of that, which most of we\u2019ve already contracted. Neel Mitra : Got it. And then the second question, specifically on the butane blending synergies. I think legacy Magellan landed about 2% of butane into the gasoline stream but because you\u2019re able to type a lot of the butane and the gasoline together, it seems like you can expand that opportunity. Can you give us a sense of the total opportunity there in terms of how much of butane you can blend into the gasoline as a percentage basis or how much you can expand that operations from the legacy Magellan operations? Sheridan Swords : For commercial reasons, we won\u2019t get into too much of it, but butane blending is driven by regulations of RVP into the gasoline. So there is a limit. But other than that, we don\u2019t want to get too much into it due to commercial sensitivities on what we\u2019re doing. Neel Mitra : Okay, thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Sunil Sibal : Hi, good morning, everybody. And thanks for the clarity. So I wanted to start off on the consolidation theme. It seems like that\u2019s kind of picking up even more, both on the upstream side and some on the midstream side. So I was kind of curious, as you think about that as a growth revenue, should we be thinking about any major guardrails in terms of the assets or corporations that you look at? Pierce Norton : Sunil, this is Pierce. The really question kind of falls in the bucket of mergers and acquisitions, I think \u2013 I just want to reemphasize that our primary focus is to continue to be integrating the Magellan acquisition and executing on the synergies and opportunities that we see to create the maximum value for our shareholders. So we\u2019re going to be \u2013 we\u2019re going to continue to be intentional and disciplined in our approach to M&A. But I\u2019d also say that we have \u2013 and we will continue to look at other mergers and acquisitions in the context of how do they strengthen our competitive position. Sunil Sibal : Okay, thanks for that. And then I think in your prepared comments, you mentioned that the growth CapEx is likely to come down in 2025 and forward years. I was kind of curious if you could help us think through the growth CapEx needs at combined ONEOK now. And is there a good way to think about growth CapEx or total CapEx needed to maintain volumes and then to further on grow volumes? Pierce Norton : So I\u2019ll kind of take a high-level cut at that, and then I\u2019ll ask either Walt or Sheridan to chime in on this. But one thing that I don\u2019t know if you picked up on, but Walt just mentioned that we actually have some excess cash of about 20% to 25%. So there is money out there for these high-return projects that we either or potentially working on or even not identified at this point. So as far as the specifics go, I\u2019ll kind of turn it over to Walt and Sheridan. Walt Hulse : Well, I think as we mentioned here in 2024, we\u2019ve identified a midpoint of $1.85 billion. We have some pretty large projects in there with the MB-6 being the largest and then the completion of the West Texas LPG expansion and then the completion of the Bakken expansion, which we want to make sure is done here in early 2025. Once those projects are done, we don\u2019t have any other large identified projects that we\u2019ve FID for the market. So you can kind of peel those away as they\u2019ve come into 2025. Our routine growth type of expenditures will continue and we will find more opportunities that probably just going to be more bite-sized and ones that we can do out of free cash flow and will be ones that are really facilitating and accelerating the synergies that we\u2019re looking to achieve in \u201825 and \u201826. Sunil Sibal : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning, everyone. So question on Saguaro, if you FID Saguaro in mid-\u201924, first of all, would that change the \u201824 CapEx number much or would most of that fall into the \u201825 and \u201826? And would that change your expectation that \u201825 CapEx would come down? Pierce Norton : I\u2019m going to let Walt kind of take the CapEx question, but there\u2019s a couple of things that I want to make sure that I note on this call that it pertains to Saguaro, Michael. And one is I want to really thank all those employees who worked on getting the permit approved in this process. And as we look at Saguaro, it is the most economic route for LNG to reach the markets or at least multiple markets. And that\u2019s actually been indicated by the strong commercial interest and the backing by the major players there. And here\u2019s where I want to really kind of make this clear that we said all along that our commitment to this project will involve procuring the presidential permit, which as we noted in our script, that is complete, the building of the U.S. portion of the pipe, getting across the border with the pipe and then the operation of the U.S. pipe. And as far as our financial involvement, that\u2019s going to be commensurate with the value that it brings to our shareholders versus the risk we see in the project. I\u2019ll kind of let Walt fill in some of the details there. Walt Hulse : Yes, Michael, given the timing, there\u2019s not \u2013 if it gets FID midyear, the capital associated with that would not be a material change to 2024. And in 2025 and beyond, I don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see anything that would change my comment before about seeing a reduction over the 2024 level of CapEx as we go forward. Projects takes a couple of years to construct and we\u2019ll fit right in within our capital program. Michael Blum : Great. Thanks for that. And then just wanted to ask on the Elk Creek expansion you announced. Maybe you could just help us understand a little bit what the ramp in volumes could look like? Should we expect this to be highly utilized at startup, like maybe [indiscernible] or will this be kind of more of a gradual ramp? Thanks. Sheridan Swords : Well, Michael, as we think about the Elk Creek expansion, we\u2019ve always said that we\u2019re not going to run out of capacity coming out of the Bakken. And that\u2019s why we want to make sure this pipeline comes up in the first quarter of 2025. So we are expecting volume increases and we\u2019ll need that as we move into 2025. And then there is a lot of things affected on the ramp up. One is how much incentivized ethane we have coming out of there. And if we \u2013 and the other one is the continuing growth in the basin as we\u2019ve seen gas to oil ratios continue to grow and drilling activity that we\u2019re seeing right now is conducive to increase overall volumes in the basin. So I think we will see quite a bit of growth as we move into 2025 on this pipeline with those two backdrops. Michael Blum : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Vrathan Reddy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Vrathan Reddy : Good morning. I appreciate the color you guys provided on producer efficiency in the slides and even in the prepared remarks, it seems like a pretty significant step up there in the share of 3-mile laterals in \u201824. So just kind of thinking if we should be thinking about the increase in 3-mile laterals, reducing the required CapEx to maintain current volumes at this point? Or any other thoughts you could frame up there would be greatly appreciated. Sheridan Swords : Yes. This is Sheridan. Absolutely with more efficiency and then growing 3-mile laterals, so, each well is going to have more production on that. So we are going to see a drop off from our previous cadence on capital that we need to spend in the area to maintain volume. And also remember that in the Bakken, we are guiding a little bit over 1.6 Bcf of throughput, and we have 1.9 Bcf of processing capacity up there. So we have a lot of working leverage to grow in that area. So we will see our capital come down. Vrathan Reddy : Great. And then for the second one, I wanted to hit on Northern Border. And just any thoughts you guys could share on how you see dynamics playing out there throughout the year. Mainly, if we could see any relief on the pipeline once volume starts flowing on Coastal GasLink to service LNG Canada? Chuck Kelley : Well, Vrathan, this is Chuck. As far as Northern Border goes, the volumes that we see coming down there today, I don\u2019t think will be appreciably impacted but the Canadian volumes diverted to LNG Canada. There\u2019s a stronghold of about 400 million a day that\u2019s held by long-term producers that will continue to flow down Northern Border. So the pipe will remain full headed toward Ventura in Chicago. And there\u2019s been some relief in our G&P business, working a deal with WBI to move some guests down to Cheyenne Hub and that\u2019s been a nice relief and you\u2019ve probably seen some information about Bison Express which should be coming on in Q2 of 2026 that will offer upwards of another, call it, 400 million a day of relief. So I think the pipe is positioned well for the next couple of years. Vrathan Reddy : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Please go ahead. Spiro Dounis : Thanks, operator. Good morning, everybody. Maybe just go back to a follow-up to Michael\u2019s question, but really kind of focused on the three major projects you\u2019ve got coming online in the first quarter of \u201825. As up to about $1.4 billion of capital kind of starting up that quarter, just curious if you can give us a sense for what the initial return multiple was on those projects and how to think about the EBITDA ramp for all three over \u201825. Sheridan Swords : Well, I\u2019ll take the first part of that. As we look at each one of those projects, and we think about the ramp-up, MB-6 is going to come up full. We will \u2013 because we\u2019re having third-party frac capacity today. So it\u2019s going to be at a very high operating rate. So it\u2019s going to be a very nice multiple we have on that. As we\u2019ve said with the West Texas expansion that we are contracting and continue to contract more volume on that to have an acceptable return with a significant amount of upside going forward. So we\u2019re continuing to drive that projects multiple down as we grow on that. The Elk Creek expansion is probably going to be the lowest one on that as we don\u2019t need a whole lot of volume to be able to have a very low multiple. And if we would get to the point that we are at a high utilization rate, that multiple will be well below 1. Spiro Dounis : Okay. That\u2019s helpful. Thanks very much, Sheridan. And maybe going back to the synergies, it sounds like for 2026 plus, you\u2019re going to have to develop some new infrastructure to achieve those synergies. Just curious, can you give us a sense for or what that looks like? Are these storage tanks? Are these connections within the systems, just a sense of what you\u2019re building out there. Sheridan Swords : Yes. I think it\u2019s going to be all that kind of stuff. It\u2019s going to be small \u2013 relatively small capital. There\u2019s going to be some connections here, some tanks here, depending all up and down our system. So it \u2013 some of that will come before \u201826. But as we continue to look forward to that, we\u2019ll be achieving most of it as we head into the \u201826 timeframe. Spiro Dounis : Great. I will leave it there. Thanks for the time. Operator : The next question comes from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bernstein. Please go ahead. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. Just a follow-up on the discussion about Northern Border earlier, my understanding from looking at the scrapes is that Canada is actually already at the sort of 300 MMcfd to 400 MMcfd that they have directly contracted. Do you think we have had a limit here on Bakken gas takeaway until the rest of Bison comes on in 2026? And how do you think it plays out? Chuck Kelley : Jean, this is Chuck. I stand by what I have said. I really think the 400 million a day will continue to come down northern border from the legacy Canadian producers. So, the growth coming out of the Bakken will be absorbed through Bison Express and the WBI expansion. Pierce Norton : So, Jean Ann, this is Pierce. Based on what I have seen, I mean I actually look at this as well. There is capacity today. So, there is no restrictions today. And if you look at the fact that there is going to be some natural gas-fired generation facilities that are going to be built in the North Dakota area and you also look at the Bison Express and then you also look at WBI, we are not seeing anything in \u2013 anywhere in the near future if there is going to be any kind of restrictions on gas takeaway. Walt Hulse : Yes. And while we think that there is plenty of takeaway, do remember that we always have the lever if we need to, that we can extract more ethane and put it on the NGL pipe to create capacity for natural gas. Jean Ann Salisbury : Thank you. That\u2019s exactly what I was looking for. And then kind of a follow-up on some of the ethane outlooks that Sheridan was talking about earlier. I think there is not a ton of new ethane demand domestically or exports for a few years from now, but associated gas will likely still grow. And your outlook, does that have the risk of increasing rejection in the Bakken or Mid-Con over the next couple of years? And could that be a drag on EBITDA? Sheridan Swords : Potentially, I think when we get out in 2025, we will see a little bit more of ethane export capability coming online. A lot really depends on how hard the pet chems are running on utilization is a big impact on. And then as we think about ethane rejection and recovery across our footprint, a lot depends on what the natural gas price in that area is. We feel that we have a very good opportunity to continue to bring incentivized ethane out of the Bakken just from our fully integrated NGL system and G&P system as well. Mid-Continent maybe where we see a little bit of swing, could be a little bit more swing in ethane recovery, but those were at much lower rates than we see coming out of the Bakken. But I think the big thing is going to be is how hard the pet chems are, the utilization rate. And we are seeing as we move into 2024, they are operating at pretty high levels. Jean Ann Salisbury : That\u2019s helpful. Thanks for taking my questions. Operator : The next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Keith Stanley : Hi. Good morning. I wanted to start and follow-up on Saguaro and so if Mexico-Pacific declares FID, how are you thinking about DOE risks for that project? I think they need an extension of their in-service deadline for non-FTA exports. How do you mitigate that risk around that issue as it relates to your project and your contracts? Chuck Kelley : Keith, this is Chuck. Yes, as you state, MPL received back in 2019 for the first two trains, the OE export approval. And they have adequate time to go ahead and start this project post-FID where that approval is for both FTA and non-FTA countries. So, I feel pretty good, obviously, about trains one and two, this pause that we are seeing right now impacts their second requested approval, which would be for train three. And as you know, we don\u2019t know exactly how this is going to play out the balance of the year. So, trains one and two post-FID, we feel good about those volumes as we sit here today. Keith Stanley : Okay. Thank you. And the second question, just any updated thoughts on potential to enter the LPG export business and how you are weighing the potential to use Magellan sites or other facilities versus I think there is a greenfield option that you are in the early stages of looking at to at Sabine Pass. Just any updated thoughts there? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. On the LPG exports, I think we are the same spotter what we can share publicly, where we have been for a period of time as you are right, we continue to look at all alternatives that we have. We have a greenfield site. Trying to understand if there is some synergies there from a physical standpoint from the Magellan assets, if we could put something on their sites. So, we continue to do that. But right now, as I have said, we see the LPG export as we think something that could enhance our integration, but it\u2019s not something we absolutely need as we continue to be able to move our barrels through the market today that has the export capabilities at other facilities. Keith Stanley : Thank you. Operator : Was there a follow-up to that Mr. Stanley? Keith Stanley : No, that\u2019s all. Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning. On the refined products side, with the significant swings in Mid-Con versus Gulf Coast product prices, thus far into the year, Mid-con being heavily discounted earlier in the year, then product price is certainly rising after the widening outage. Has this created opportunities for you to use the Sterling system to ship product software when the ARPA was there towards the beginning of the first quarter and also opportunities for more long-haul movements of refined products from the Gulf Coast to Mid-Con on the legacy Magellan assets and incremental earnings as a result? Sheridan Swords : What I would say is, right now, we are not going to comment specifically on refined products, movements on any specific pipeline. What I can tell is NGL pipelines have moved refined products here in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. We do see with that movement in the two pricing mechanisms between the Gulf and the group. We have seen opportunity for longer haul tariffs on our refined products system. Theresa Chen : Okay. And Sheridan, going back to the butane blending synergies and your comment about the RVP requirements, so butane blending getting to come out of the gasoline pool in that mid-April timeframe. And just given the comments from some of the downstream customers that have the lack of octane in the gasoline pool after that switch happens, does this lend to some opportunities for your isobutane volumes as a feedstock for alkylate, or said differently, does the acquired Magellan refined products assets and your exposure to gasoline flows now more than before, can that create some uplift for the even heavier components of your NGL barrels. Sheridan Swords : Yes. There could be some potential as we look at for the natural gasoline component of the barrel, some blending into the unleaded pool that we have looked at. As in terms of isobutane specifically going into alkylate, we have been servicing those alkylate units for quite a long time in the legacy NGL business. And typically, as you know, alkylate is a very high priced and usually, they run those pretty strong. The big difference in those alkylate unit is whether or not they are going to run some refinery grade propylene through that unit or are they going to stay or how their RGBs, refiner grade butane runs through that as well. So, if we see more propylene run through an alkylate unit, we will see a little bit more isobutane being used. But typically, they run pretty steady. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : The next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Please go ahead. Tristan Richardson : Hi. Good morning guys. Just maybe a question on the WesTex expansion, you have talked a while now about the optionality that you have once the final team is complete. And just maybe just a little bit about timing and progress on the decision of what service to put the legacy pipe into your crude refined product or NGLs? And then how readily and quickly you can make that transition? Sheridan Swords : Well, right now, we \u2013 it is an option. We haven\u2019t decided to exercise that option. We continue to see good on the NGL side. So, there is a good possibility we want to keep it in NGL service to continue to be able to service our downstream assets in the Mont Belvieu area. If we would decide to shift it to some other product, the big thing is going to have to be determined on which way we run it. Obviously, if we want to run it from Mont Belvieu out to West Texas, it will take us a little bit more time because we will have to do a little bit of work on header systems on that side. If we want another product moving from West Texas in to Mont Belvieu, into the Houston area, it would be quicker because the pumps are already set up going that direction. But as of this moment right now, we are probably leaning more towards the natural gas liquids side of it or the raw feed side of it as we continue to see good growth coming out of the Permian. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it, Sheridan. And then maybe for Walt, just curious, you talked about this in a couple of questions here. But as thinking about the three major projects coming off in \u201825 and what that implies for future CapEx and certainly what that implies for future free cash flow. Can you talk about \u2013 as we think about \u201825 and \u201826, what gets you to maybe the higher end or the lower end of that capital return as a percent, that 75% to 85%? Walt Hulse : Well, clearly, with what we have identified today from a CapEx standpoint, as I have said before, that we would expect that capital return to ramp throughout that period. I think that we will be producing a meaningful amount of free cash flow. Obviously, it will increase when our CapEx number goes down. So, we will still stay in that 75% to 85% availability after CapEx, it\u2019s just going to be a bigger number. So, it will give us more opportunity for shareholder return. Pierce Norton : Tristan, this is Pierce. Kind of embedded in your question there is the implication of kind of what drives our EBITDA to the higher end versus the lower end, I think that\u2019s probably worth mentioning there. But filling more of our existing capacity across these assets is going to clearly make that movement up. And we have already mentioned that we want to make sure that we get this pipe in by first quarter 2025 out of the Bakken. And then also to continue to prioritize and execute on those additional \u2013 those connectivities between our NGL refined products and crude oil systems across our footprint. And then third, it\u2019s those quicker than forecasted recognition of synergies. And of course, the downside would be things that might impact the volume, which is the weather and the user activity. All of those kind of go into how far above or below the midpoint that we might be that impacts what you and Walt just talked about. Tristan Richardson : Peirce, appreciate it. Thank you all very much. Operator : The next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist Securities. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Thanks for the time. My first question is on NGL specifically, just wondering where are you all seeing notable demand pure NGL from the Permian NGL service. Is it mostly in key Midland or Delaware areas? I am just wondering if there are specific areas that we should be looking at there? And then are you all taking market share from Permian contracts rolling off, other pipes or this is more basic expansion? Sheridan Swords : Yes. When we look at the Midland and Delaware, it\u2019s more \u2013 as we look about growth to our system, it\u2019s more based on the customers out there and who we are seeing and the ones we have aligned, and we have some that are more Midland-specific, some that are more Delaware-specific. So, that really depends on who is kind of drilling more or bringing volume to us at that time. We \u2013 in terms of contracts roll off, we have seen a little bit of that. What we have seen a little bit is some taking kind rides coming to us from different customers as we go forward. But overall, we see an opportunity in both of those basins to be able to source NGLs into our system going forward. A lot depends \u2013 really, a lot depends on the customer. Neal Dingmann : Yes, that makes sense. Okay. And then just a quick follow-up on, like that Slide 10 that shows the synergy opportunities. I am just wondering on the batching upside that you laid out here on this slide, just wondered timing-wise, how quickly, I am just wondering are you thinking, and are there key areas that you would anticipate seeing the majority of that batching upside? Sheridan Swords : Well, on that batching, I think we are really going to see a lot of it throughout our system. Some of it is already happening today. Some of it will happen throughout 2024. Those are opportunities that we see where we already have some connectivity between the system and then that will continue to grow through \u201825 and \u201826 as we continue to bring these assets together. But we see that opportunity in the central system, we see that opportunity on the Gulf Coast. We see that opportunity even as much as on the lines out of West Texas. Neal Dingmann : Thank you for the upside. Operator : The next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : Good morning Thanks for taking the question. On CapEx opportunities, could you opine on the possibility of meeting another frac by 2026? And does the MMP acquisition increase prospects for accretively rebuilding and/or repurposing legacy Medford frac site? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan. Yes, I don\u2019t think the MMP effects, really affects Medford at all what we have there. As we think about increased frac capacity and our needs there, really what we are looking at right now is bottlenecks throughout our system where we can get very low-cost expansions through our existing fracs. And we continue to look at Medford and what type of capacity we could get out of Medford at a very low cost by only bringing portions of that back up. The whole facility wasn\u2019t as damaged by the fire in certain parts. So, we think there is an opportunity to have a little bit less capacity there at a very low dollar per barrel of capacity. So, that\u2019s where we see our next really growth in fractionation capacity coming from, and we really don\u2019t see the MMP acquisition have a big impact to that. Craig Shere : Great. And last question, on synergies, it sounds like you expect almost the full $100 million or so in G&A benefits in 2024 which would suggest that you might be being conservative on the commercial side. Is that a fair assessment? Kevin Burdick : Craig, it\u2019s Kevin. Like we said, I mean we feel \u2013 obviously, we feel really good about our progress we have made on the cost savings side. I think just kind of naturally, many of those synergies come quicker than the commercial. We continue to prioritize those. We did add kind of 100 plus to the upside for the cost savings side. So, we will continue to work those. But we are just trying to send the message that, particularly in \u201824, there is a good chunk of the synergies that are going to be cost savings. Craig Shere : Okay. Thank you. Operator : And the last question comes from Zack Van Everen with TPH. Please go ahead. Zack Van Everen : Hey guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Just going back up to the Rockies growth, you noted 9% year-over-year in 2024, but it looks like NGL growth is a bit lower than that for the year. Is the majority of that the contract rolls on Overland, or are you expecting just less overall ethane recovery, just trying to kind of put those two numbers together. Sheridan Swords : Yes. The \u2013 on the NGL growth, we are expecting less or we have put in our guidance less incentivized ethane coming out of the Bakken. We definitely think there could be some upside there, so that has an impact. And then the contract that we will no longer be getting volume off of Overland Pass is a very low margin, very kind of high-volume contract that has an impact. We haven\u2019t been expecting that contract or we knew we were not going to be moving forward to renewing that contract when it came up. So, this is something that\u2019s been in our plan for a period of time. So, that\u2019s what\u2019s kind of driving a little bit of the difference when you look at growth on G&P versus the growth on NGLs. Zack Van Everen : Got it. That makes sense. And then shifting over to the rate adjustments in July, you noted mid-single digits. Just looking at the FERC regulated calculation trending towards 1.5% kind of hints that higher-market based adjustments. Curious if you had any pushback from the customers on that or just how that conversations going overall? Sheridan Swords : We haven\u2019t decided what we are going to do on market-based rate adjustments, but we do look at it very extensive at each one of our locations and do extensive look at the market and what\u2019s appropriate in those locations. And that\u2019s why we have kind of just given a mid-single digit rate is what we think it will be. But we have not yet determined exactly what we are going to do. But we do have varied conversation with customers, understand the marketplace, and extend the dynamics that are there before we make those adjustments. Zack Van Everen : Okay. Perfect. Thanks guys. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Alright. Well, perfect timing, everybody. Our quiet period for the first quarter starts when we close our books in April and extends until we release earnings in late April. We will provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all very much and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today\u2019s presentation. You may now disconnect.",

I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Megan, and welcome to ONEOK's first quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions.  Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. [Operator Instructions] With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us.  On today's call, is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Sheridan Swords, Executive Vice President, Commercial Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. Also available to answer your questions are Chuck Kelley, Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Pipelines; and Kevin Burdick, our Executive Vice President and Chief Enterprise Services Officer. Yesterday, we announced first quarter 2024 earnings and increased our full year 2024 financial guidance. Solid results during the first quarter were supported by higher year-over-year volumes in the Rocky Mountain region and contributions from the Refined Products and Crude segment. The efforts of our employees were highlighted once again as we were able to effectively manage through the winter weather during the quarter. Heating degree days were actually higher than normal in January, but it was the temporary acute cold and excessive wind that caused a deviation from normal operations. Volumes have rebounded across our systems, and we are continuing to see volume trends higher, providing additional confidence in our expectations for the remainder of the year. Our increase to 2024 financial guidance was driven by 2 primary key factors : first, favorable industrial fundamentals across our systems, which is supply and demand, that are contributing to volume growth and providing significant momentum for the remainder of 2024 and into 2025. And second, the continued confidence in our ability to realize meaningful commercial and cost synergies. We remain focused on the integration efforts following the acquisition of Magellan last year, and our management team has spent the past several months meeting with employees and visiting assets across all of our operations. Our employees see the value of our combined businesses and are excited about the opportunities ahead. Through collaboration between business segments and the innovation of our employees, we are on pace to exceed our 2024 synergy goals, while most importantly, putting safety first. We also see growth across our systems from producer productivity, favorable commodity prices and continued demand for our products and services or as we previously mentioned, favorable industrial fundamentals. One potential significant source of future natural gas demand is expected to increase in power generation required to serve AI-driven data centers. ONEOK like other natural gas pipeline operators will play a role. We have already had conversations with several of our large electric power generation customers and power developers, who anticipate the need for additional natural gas transportation to address this future AI data center-related power demand. As the need for future power generation increases, domestic natural gas demand is projected to increase. This is going to affect the entire midstream value chain, and ONEOK is positioned to play a meaningful role. Today, we serve numerous natural gas-fired power plants across our system, and many of those customers are looking to expand, some related to AI and others to address general power demand. We also continue to see supportive demand and fundamentals for the NGLs and refined products across our system. Ethane remains a highly preferred feedstock for the petrochemical facilities, NGL export strengths continue, and a seasonal refined product demand for travel and agriculture is picking up. We remain focused on expanding and extending our systems in ways that align with our customers and the market's needs. ONEOK now larger in scale, will continue to support our efforts to help address domestic and international energy demand, contribute to the energy security of our nation and maintain our critical role in the long-term energy transformation.  With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. As Pierce mentioned, we increased our 2024 financial guidance expectations. We increased our 2024 net income midpoint to $2.88 billion and increased our adjusted EBITDA midpoint by $75 million to $6.175 billion. This new guidance also brings up the low end of our original range, reflecting the strong fundamentals across our businesses. We remain confident in our synergy expectations. Our updated guidance still assumes we will meet or exceed our midpoint of $175 million in cost and commercial synergies in 2024. We continue to expect that additional annual synergies will meet or exceed $125 million in 2025. Additionally, our total 2024 capital expenditure guidance remains unchanged at $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion. Now for a brief overview of our first quarter financial performance. ONEOK's first quarter 2024 net income totaled $639 million or $1.09 per share, and adjusted EBITDA for the period totaled $1.44 billion. Results were driven primarily by higher NGL and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, increased transportation services in the natural gas pipeline segment and contributions from the refined products and crude segment. We saw higher consolidated operating costs in the quarter, primarily related to the timing of planned maintenance turnarounds, higher property insurance premiums and operational growth. Of note, this was the first quarter the refined products and crude segment was allocated its full share of corporate costs. Therefore, compared with the fourth quarter 2023, we saw an increase in operating costs for that segment and a decrease in operating costs for the other business segments as they received a lower allocation of corporate costs. As of March 31, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit agreement and our run rate net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.8x. As it relates to capital allocation, we remain focused on delivering long-term value for our stakeholders through a balanced combination of high-return capital projects, dividend growth, debt reduction and share repurchases. As previously discussed, we continue to see share repurchases as an important part of our capital allocation strategy and remain committed to utilizing our $2 billion share repurchase program over the next 4 years. We have significantly delevered our business in recent years, while still completing high-return capital growth projects and successfully closing a transformational acquisition. We are well positioned to continue returning value to investors through a strategic and balanced capital allocation approach.  I'll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update. Sheridan Swords : Thank you, Walt. Beginning with the natural gas liquids segment. First quarter NGL volumes increased 12% in the Rocky Mountain region year-over-year, including the effect of the mid-January winter weather. Volumes fully recovered in February and have been continuing to accelerate. April volumes averaged more than 400,000 barrels a day from the region, driven by record propane plus volumes on our system and modest ethane recovery levels. The Elk Creek pipeline expansion remains on track for an early first quarter 2025 completion, increasing ONEOK's total NGL capacity from the basin to 575,000 barrels per day, enabling continued volume growth and providing needed NGL takeaway capacity. Mid-Continent region NGL volumes reflect the effects of first quarter winter weather in a full quarter without the low-margin volumes from the contract expiring in November of 2023. We expect to continue replacing the expired contracts volume with barrels at market-based rates ramping through 2024. Y-grade gas to crude ratios remain, making ethane the most preferred feedstock of the petrochemical industry, and ethane exports remain highly utilized. These dynamics could provide tailwinds for ethane recovery throughout the remainder of the year. Our current guidance includes modest incentivized ethane recovery in the Rocky Mountain region.  Moving on to the Refined Products and Crude segment. We continue to see healthy business fundamentals and consistent performance. First quarter refined product volumes increased compared to the first quarter of 2023. From a liquids blending perspective, volume and margins were in line with our expectations for the quarter. With gasoline and diesel demand typically lower in the first quarter, we expect volumes to ramp in the coming months as we see a pull from agriculture activity and summer driving demand. Refined product volumes will also benefit from our pipeline expansion to El Paso, which is now fully complete. The majority of the 30,000 barrels per day expansion is contracted under firm long-term agreements. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. Rocky Mountain region processing volumes increased 9% year-over-year, including the effect of winter weather during the quarter. By the end of January, volumes had recovered to levels achieved prior to the extreme cold. Since then, our process volumes have continued to increase, averaging nearly 1.6 Bcf per day in April. There are currently 38 rigs in the Williston Basin with 20 on our dedicated acreage. We expect additional rigs to return as we are now into spring and for the trend of drilling longer laterals to continue. Stable rig activity and longer laterals coupled with continued strength in our gas to oil ratios and additional producer efficiencies provide a compelling backdrop for significant Rocky Mountain region volume growth in 2024. In the Mid-Continent region, we were currently seeing more than 40 rigs in Oklahoma with 6 operating on our acreage. With current gas prices, we expect producers to continue concentrating activity in the oilier and NGL-rich areas in the region.  In the Natural Gas Pipelines segment, we benefited from higher equity natural gas sales and increased firm and interruptible transportation in the first quarter. Natural gas storage continues to be in high demand. Our current expansion projects, including reactivating 3 Bcf of previously idled storage in Texas and further expanding our injection capabilities in Oklahoma, enabling us to market an additional 4 Bcf of working capacity. The Texas project will be fully in service in the third quarter of 2024, and the Oklahoma expansion will be completed in the second quarter of 2025. Both projects have firm contracts extending beyond 2030.  Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Walt and Sheridan. As you have heard, strength across our businesses is indicating a solid 2024 and already providing momentum into 2025. Before we take questions, I want to once again acknowledge our employees for your continued dedication and exceptional performance in the first quarter. Specifically, I'd like to recognize those of you who responded to the winter weather across our operations in January and our employees in Texas and Oklahoma, who were personally affected or [indiscernible] to the Texas panhandle Smokehouse Creek fire in late February and early March. Our focus on reliable and responsible operations and on supporting our communities is particularly highlighted during the events like these. I'm proud to work with individuals and teams who demonstrate a service mentality by being ready and willing to rise to the challenge. We're looking forward to the rest of 2024 and beyond.  And with that, operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] The first question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : Just want to start off with the guidance increase, if I could, I want to dig into the component pieces there. When you're talking about volumes, it seemed like they rebounded in stronger. Just wondering if you could break down where across the system that is, if that's really the Bakken or other parts of the portfolio, you're seeing better-than-expected strength. And at the same time, you talked about the synergy realization maybe being better than expected or more confidence. And just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more detail on what the component drivers to that are as well? Sheridan Swords : Jeremy, this is Sheridan Swords. The first thing we think about volume across our system is a lot of it is coming out of Bakken. We're seeing a strong volume as we come out of winter and with the rigs that we have running, we see that increasing strongly throughout the year. So that gives us a lot of confidence on our volume expectation drains and we'll be more on the higher end of that. We also, in our refined product segment, we're also seeing good volume into the El Paso market as our expansion was completed and came online. And for May, that expansion is already on allocation. So we feel that, that complete expansion and continue to see that go through the remainder of the year. So those are 2 areas where we're really seeing volume increase. As we think about synergies, synergies we've got in this company together and people working together, we are finding more and more synergies out there that we can execute on, and we will continue to see that growth through the remainder of the year, which give us even more momentum as we move into the 2025 time line. The other thing that we have going on is in the first quarter, we also had 2 large planned turnarounds, one in the refined products crude segment at our Corpus Christi terminal and the other one in our NGL segment at the MB-1 fractionator. This was a onetime event that really pushed up our operating cost in the first quarter that we won't see for the remainder of the year. So those are a lot of the things that give us confidence on raising our guidance. Jeremy Tonet : Got it. That's helpful there. And then pivoting in your remarks, I think you touched on the potential for data centers to be a tailwind for the business over time, and just want to unpack that a little bit more. Do you see that as kind of a general thing that helps natural gas demand overall, or do you see the potential, I guess, for data centers materializing proximate to your footprint where in Oklahoma, West Texas, what have you, where there could be more, I guess, direct opportunities? Pierce Norton : So Jeremy, this is Pierce. So I think it's kind of all of the above. There's -- we -- if you go back the last 20 years, electrical generation load between things that were added as far as devices that you have to charge versus the efficiencies that we got from LED pipes and those kind of things, pretty much offset one another. So it's been really flat for the last 20 years. Kind of for the first time in a couple of decades, we're seeing a lot of momentum for needing more energy for these data centers. And a natural quick solution to that is natural gas. So we do see that, that's going to increase natural demand here specifically over the next half decade here and probably even more. When you look at it, it's yet to be seen which area is actually developed more, which means that you put a data center next to where electricity is already there, and they've got enough capacity to generate the load, or you switch over to putting a data center close to, say, a pipeline where you can literally generate the electricity from a natural gas-fired generation facility, this located right beside the AI data center. So yet to be seen exactly how that comes. We've seen some interest in different areas of our system. And it's something that we're going to continue to focus on and to see just what the pace of that is going to be. But I think it's kind of all of the above. Jeremy Tonet : That's helpful. So on that last point, you're in current conversations with potential customers that could be proximate to your assets, I just want to make sure I have that right. Pierce Norton : Yes, we are. And whether or not it's proximate to our assets, we serve quite a few utilities. So we've had a lot of calls from utilities as well. It's yet to be seen exactly what kind of infrastructure is going to be needed in both cases. Operator : Our next question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Spiro Dounis : I wanted to go back to the synergies quickly, if we could. Sheridan, it sounds like in some of your comments there, you're saying you're sort of finding even more as time goes by. And I was wondering if you could tie that back to your prior targets when you talked about $400 million of synergies with upside to $800 million. I think a lot of that was sort of probability-weighted. So I'm curious, are you sort of getting closer to that $800 million number? If you could maybe just provide some examples of where you've been most surprised? Sheridan Swords : Yes. Spiro, we are getting more confident in moving up the ladder as we see more opportunities come out there. And we're kind of seeing it all across parts of our business. We're seeing it from as how we optimize our storage, we're seeing it how we are combining the 2 assets to make logistics savings better, we're seeing it as we tie the systems together, how we can demand pull NGLs in the refined products. So we're seeing it across all aspects of our business that we've talked about. Spiro Dounis : Great. That's helpful color. Oh, sorry. Kevin Burdick : Spiro, this is Kevin. The other thing I'd just add in there is we pull in all these opportunities that Sheridan talked about, not only there, but also we continue to identify opportunities on the G&A side as well from a cost reduction standpoint. When we pull all that in, we prioritize them. We understand what the value is, the timing, any cost, and then we get people assigned to them. And I think it's that transparency and accountability internally that help us get the confidence of what we're looking at and those numbers continue to improve. Spiro, this is -- the only thing is it's a comment of you get what you measure, and we are measuring our synergies. Spiro Dounis : Got it. Got it. Helpful. Second question, maybe just turning to CapEx, maybe for you, Walt. Some of your peers have started to provide this sort of normalized CapEx figure that allows them to keep growing with the basin. I guess I'm just curious maybe how we should think about that for ONEOK, especially as we head into 2025 in the first quarter, you've got 3 major projects coming online. It would seem like that CapEx [indiscernible] coming down. So just curious how you guys think about what normal looks like on the CapEx side? Walter Hulse : Spiro, I'm not going to go down the 2025 guidance route yet. But I think it's fair to say you've identified directly that we've got 3 decent-sized projects that will all roll off early in 2025. So as we look at CapEx going forward, we have much more manageable, lower capital, very high return opportunities that are presenting themselves. So I think it's fair to say that we would see that trend down. And if you were to look longer term for a kind of sustainable CapEx level, it probably is lower than where we are for 2024. Operator : Next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Tristan Richardson : Maybe just a minor one on the guidance increase. Should we think of the small Saddlehorn acquisition as part of that increase in expectations for the year? And if so, maybe kind of what proportion of the guidance increase could we attribute to the acquisition? Sheridan Swords : Yes, we did put a little bit of the Saddlehorn increase into our guidance, that was part of it. But it's a small portion. You could see we probably increased and that we'll get from Saddlehorn by about 1/3. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it. Walter Hulse : We've known that was coming for a little bit of time. So it's not like that, that was the primary driver of the expansion. It's across -- it's really seeing strength across our entire business. And of course, a little more Saddlehorn doesn't hurt. Tristan Richardson : Helpful context. We appreciate it. And then maybe just more of a housekeeping one. How should we think about maybe the corporate cost allocation? You guys noted a $33 million change within refined products crude. Should we think of all of that is attributable to moving the corporate costs around? Or maybe is there a way to think about for the full year '24, maybe what percent of total corporate costs get allocated to the segment just as we think about refined products and crude modeling? Walter Hulse : I would look over a couple of quarters to see a trend there as we do that. We're -- this was the first quarter that we allocated corporate costs to that. So surely, we took a look at it, but there could be some other corporate costs in the first quarter that might skew a little bit. So I would look over the next couple of quarters to get a trend, but it will proportionately carry its fair share kind of based on EBITDA contribution. Operator : Our next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : I wanted to go back to the AI data center discussion a little bit. When you look at your gas pipeline network, how much room is there to expand capacity via compression versus having to actually build new pipe? And then if you were to increase gas pipeline capacity to serve higher power load growth, are there any upstream benefits that you'd also see? Charles Kelley : Michael, this is Chuck. As far as capacity adds that we could look at along our footprint. As Pierce mentioned a couple of times here today, we are in conversations with existing customers on our pipes connected to little more than -- I think the number is 40 gas-fired generation facilities today. We're working -- there's about 15 potential projects on our systems today. Not all of those will come to fruition, but the conversations are ongoing and of the 15, we're seeing probably 3 or 4 of those folks saying the demand is derived from the data center. So we are looking at several projects that would add [indiscernible] looping as well as some compression depending where we are on which of our systems, whether it's the interstate up in the upper Midwest in Oklahoma, not necessarily looping but rather some compression projects. So it's kind of an all of the above capacity additions. And I don't recall the second part of your question. Michael Blum : Second part was about any upstream benefits. Charles Kelley : Upstream. Pierce Norton : So Michael, what I would say there is it's going to be a little bit of a longer answer here. But you came at it from the question of what's the capacity of an existing line, and you put more demand on it, and what does that look like. I'll just paint a scenario, which don't take anything from my comments that we're far along in this. But if you were to put a data center in North Dakota, it's a cold weather area. It's very advantageous for data centers, and you connected it, say, to the tailgate of one of the plant. Then you're taking load 24 hours a day, and that's loaded, it frees up on transportation of gas that goes elsewhere out of that basin. We do have space to do that, but that's one way to kind of tamper down maybe a future expansion out of the North Dakota area on the transmission lines, whether or not that WBI, whether or not that be Northern Border, or actually some other generated facility for natural gas electric power generation. So that's just one example of the way I could see that it's kind of a long way of answering your question, but that's what I would see a benefit to the gathering and processing business. Michael Blum : Okay. Perfect. And then just wanted to go back on Saddlehorn for a second. I realize it's a small acquisition in the grand scheme of things, but I wonder if you can just talk in terms of strategic rationale for that asset to why you want to own more of it? And just also from a capital allocation perspective, and why that makes sense? Sheridan Swords : Michael, this is Sheridan. I think the first thing on why we won't own it. We operate that pipeline. It's coming out of an area that we see growth in crude. In fact, the last couple of months, Saddlehorn has been fully allocated. And the third is, as this was kind of instigated by [indiscernible] that has a lot of connectivity up in the area, and they're seeing a benefit as well, which gives us more confidence that this is a good asset to own more of. Operator : Our next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : In terms of the synergy outlook, just near term, looking at the upcoming maintenance in Wink to Webster, is there a room from a crude oil marketing activity perspective across your assets for additional synergies to capture what would likely be a temporary and volatile [indiscernible] backdrop and using the excess capacity you have on a BridgeTex or maybe Longhorn to small extent. I realize that this does not neatly fit within your 4 categories of synergy buckets, but given that you are a significant market of commodities in general, could this be a source of additional upside? Sheridan Swords : Theresa, this is Sheridan. Yes, we do see -- we've always, from the beginning, saw opportunity in marketing crude oil to bring volume to our system. Specifically, right now, as we think about what's going on in the next 2 months, with the [indiscernible] differential kind of blowing out, we're naturally seeing more volume come to BridgeTex. That volume is up quite a bit. And it's part of the reason we're even more confident that's going to continue and confidence in increasing our guidance as we go forward. And with some of the maintenance that is coming up on certain pipelines, we haven't factored that in yet, but that gives us even more confidence that we'll see some strong volumes, crude coming out of the Permian on our system. Marketing will add to that, but that will probably be a little bit more longer term as we get later on the year. Theresa Chen : Got it. And going back to the AI theme, this has come up so much in recent weeks and months, but related to natural gas transmission and storage assets. And I'm just wondering if you have any early indications or thoughts on just quantitatively, what this could mean as far as the size of the EBITDA opportunity for ONEOK? Walter Hulse : Well, first of all, I think you've got to look at the size that we currently are making $6.175 billion in EBITDA. And I think you've got to look to see what kind of pace it's at. I think it's really just too early to tell. Operator : Our next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Sunil Sibal : So I just wanted to understand a little bit on the growth prospects. When you think about beyond the projects, which are kind of get completed in the first half of 2025, so I was curious how would you put your growth opportunity beyond that in the 4 business buckets that you have, and then on the same line, how have your hurdle rates changed, if any, in the current environment versus the environment we had a couple of years back in terms of interest rates, et cetera? Sheridan Swords : This is Sheridan, again. On growth projects, we are continuing to, on the synergy side, continuing to see low capital/high multiple type growth projects that we are baking in as we continue to go forward. They're coming all the time. We get more and more of them, but they're kind of factored into our overall capital plan already. [indiscernible] that we would capture this. But we continue to get more excited about that growth that we see different growth projects as it relates to synergies and bringing them together. Michael Blum : Okay. Charles Kelley : I think as you were asking, I think what you're asking about the interest rates. We aren't a company that relies heavily on short-term debt. All of our debt has termed out. And we have cash called the last 3 bonds that we had matured. And we've said that we expect that, that will probably be the case later this year that we would go down that path. So occasionally, we're in and out of the CP market to cover month-to-month type of things. But our business is generating cash flow to be self-contained, and so we don't see any real impact from higher rates going forward. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Understood. And then one kind of operational one for me. It seems like in Permian, NGL volumes were a little bit weak sequentially. And I was curious [indiscernible] toward the end of weather issues there. And then in terms [indiscernible] expansion, if you could update us on the contracting there? Sheridan Swords : Yes, on the Permian [indiscernible] sequential in the Permian is really weather. We had the impact of weather out there. And one thing we noticed in the Permian, they're not used to weather. And any time they get any kind of weather, it takes them a little bit more to get back up and going. So we saw some weather impact the first quarter and it was a big reason for the volume decrease. As we think about contracting going forward on our West Texas pipeline expansion, it is going as we had planned. We continue to contract more volume on that. We are right where we think we need to be as we continue to go forward. We are going to continue to leverage that into the future for more plant connects and to feed or transportation and fractionation business. As we have said earlier, we already have contracted 2 plants that will be coming on this year. We have another one that's expanding. And recently, we've actually signed up some more people as well to bring more volume onto the system. So like I said, we are very comfortable where we are with the contracting on that system today on that expansion. And the expansion is on time, on budget, coming up in the first quarter of 2025. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Mehta with Bank of America. Neil Mehta : I had a couple of questions on the guidance increase. So first, it seemed like the [indiscernible] rate was $1.21 an Mcf, which was a little bit higher than the high end of the range of $1.15 to $1.20, which is the guidance. Is that something that we should roll forward? Or is that something that occurred with maybe [indiscernible] in the first quarter. And then second on that part, should we expect kind of a linear increase in volumes in the Bakken? Or should we expect another weather downturn in 4Q in terms of your budgeting? Sheridan Swords : Neil, this is Sheridan. The first thing on your increase on the earnings on the fee rate. A lot of that is driven by our inflationary escalators that are coming in. And to a lesser extent, volume coming from certain customers that may have a different fee structure in there. And yes, we do think that will continue going forward, that fee rate. On the volume cadence coming out of the Bakken, it can be a little bit lumpy as we bring on compressor units and everything else. We'll sometimes will have some big volume coming in. We do always budget for winter weather in the fourth quarter and the first quarter. But as you saw in '23, the fourth quarter did not have any weather and all the weather showed up in the first quarter. But we spread it out over the 2 quarters in a budgeting standpoint, but we know it doesn't all show up evenly across those quarters. It usually concentrates in 1 quarter or the other. Neil Mehta : Got it. And then I wanted to clarify on the AI theme. I know this is still very early innings. But curious, I wanted to follow back up on kind of the opportunity you see there in North Dakota with the advantageous weather temperatures, et cetera. Are you seeing opportunities from the wellhead to move lines to CCGTs or more so from CCGTs to data centers? And is this kind of geographically concentrated with your opportunities within your NGL footprint in the Bakken? Or are you seeing things outside of the Bakken and perhaps the Permian and Mid-Con as well? Walter Hulse : Well, first of all, you're not going to take it out of the well hit because the GPM or the gallons per thousand of liquids that's associated with that gas is just too high to tie it in back there. So you're going to need to get downstream of a plant. And I would also tell you that that's a theoretical scenario at this point, and that's something that we'll be exploring in the future with multiple different players. It could happen in any one of our basins. It's just that it's a little more advantageous where you can locate one of these things where you get some really good kind of lower natural gas prices. And you got a lot of natural gas supply and the weather actually is colder, you have more kind of heating degree days. So therefore, it lessens the cooling load that you're meeting on these AI facilities. So the thing I would probably say again about AI, more to come. We'll have more updates on these in the coming quarters. But again, I don't think it's necessarily going to be material in the short term. Operator : Our next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley : First, just a follow-up to Neil's question, but on the Rocky's NGL bundled rate, that was up nicely to $0.30 in Q1. What drove that higher? And is that a good run rate for the balance of the year? Sheridan Swords : What drove that -- Keith, this is Sheridan. What drove that rate is less incentivized ethane that came out, so that rate is going to depend a lot on how much incentivized ethane we come out because obviously, we're bringing that out at a lower rate. But that $0.28 to $0.30 is going to be -- maybe even a little higher than that, depending if we get volume continue to ramp up and we have to manage capacity on Elk Creek through backing out of ethane for C3+, you could see it go a little bit higher there, but it's going to be in that range. Keith Stanley : Okay. Great. Second question just on going back to Saddlehorn, but are you optimistic that you could find other bolt-on type opportunities like that over the course of the next year, or was that more of a one-off with Western's process? I noticed you didn't list acquisitions as part of the capital allocation priorities in your remarks? Pierce Norton : So this is Pierce. What I would tell you is we're always looking for opportunities to expand our footprint out there. That's one of the things that we look at. As far as M&A goes, we continue to be focused and actually very pleased with the integration as it's related to Magellan. So at this time, our -- that is our organization's primary focus is on the integration of what we just acquired last year. I'd say that future M&A will be the same as it always has been here at ONEOK. We're going to be intentional and disciplined about what we look at. Operator : Our next question comes from Neil Dingmann with Truist Securities. Neal Dingmann : Good morning. Thanks for the time. My first question, just looking at your NGL [indiscernible] throughput on the raw volumes there. I'm just wondering, it looks like the range is a little wider in this run. Could you discuss some drivers behind that and how this is shaping up sort of year-to-date so far? Sheridan Swords : Neil, could you repeat that question one more time? Neal Dingmann : Just looking at the -- I'm looking specifically at Slide 8 around that NGL [indiscernible] throughput volumes and just sort of looking on expectations behind '24. And it's not terribly Y, but just wondering what would cause that to trend towards the higher side and how that's looking sort of year-to-date? Unknown Executive : On our raw NGL volumes. One of the big things on the raw feed NGL volumes that's going to make it go up is ethane recovery. And we've come out and said that we're going to have -- naturally the rockies is going to be in rejection, but we're going to have opportunities to incentivize that. And I also said we're going to manage our capacity in our pipeline at Elk Creek until we get the expansion on, is up more to the high end of its capacity. Then you have the Mid-Continent, where we have said that's going to be kind of in and out of ethane recovery. So is that more -- we have the opportunity to -- as prices spreads stay wide like they kind of are today, we'll see more ethane throughout the year come out, which will drive that up, your raw fleet throughput up. And then out of the Permian, we've always said that's going to be in full ethane recovery from here on now. So the biggest one is going to be ethane recovery. Obviously, we are seeing we've talked about volume in the Bakken that looks really, really good. We're also seeing plentiful of rigs in the Mid-Continent drilling in different areas in some of the oil-rich areas, some very high GPM areas, that as we go through this year, we're cautiously optimistic that we're going to see really good growth there as well. So those are some of the areas we see could push it to the high end, but definitely ethane recoveries, the biggest swing here in 2024. Neal Dingmann : Very helpful. And then just a second question on your natural gas pipeline earnings, I'm just wondering, part I saw of the sequential increase was driven by that earnings was driven by the higher natural gas sales volumes previously held in inventory. I'm just wondering, is that something you anticipate to continue to see potential upside from these incremental volumes in inventory? I mean is there -- is that more to come, or what should we think about with other volumes around associated around that? Charles Kelley : Yes, Neil, this is Chuck. Seasonality, obviously, the prices are higher in Q1. So when we set up our Bridge Town  each calendar year, we look at our portfolio of equity gas and choose where we're going to -- what months we're going to sell that in and try and optimize our value there. So that was part of our plan going into Q1. Obviously, you've seen gas prices fall here in Q2, so you've got seasonality at work. So we'll just be -- throughout the summer, we see electric generation pick up, and we'll see prices spike, we may sell into some of that. And then again, we may still into be seasonal back to the winter months next year. Operator : Our next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers.  Sheridan, back to that $0.20 to $0.30 Williston NGL bundled rates question and this issue of incented ethane recovery. Are you seeing the spread of ethane discounts required to incent recovery less than historical to the degree that we ramp up ethane. Do you see that having relative to history, less of an impact? Sheridan Swords : Craig, what I'd say right now is we -- in the incentivized ethane that we've done so far this year, it has been at or maybe a little bit above what we've done, what you'd say more as a run rate in the past. A lot depends on not just the price of ethane, which we have good demand for ethane on the Gulf Coast, but also what the price of natural gas is in the Bakken. And so you got to look at the spread between those 2. But so far, we have been very pleased with what we've been able to incentivized ethane in it. Craig Shere : Got you. And just to finish off, do you see prospects for ethane being tailwinds year-over-year even into 2025? And separately around the Conway to Mont Belvieu basis spreads, that seems to have contracted last couple of quarters. Do you see that stuck in the doldrums for a while? Sheridan Swords : Well, I take the last one. On the Conway to Belvieu spread. That has -- actually, we have had opportunities. If you look at the average through the month, it may be [indiscernible] we've had some opportunities to lock in some fairly good spreads. And our system is set up that we can lock in by component Conway to Belvieu or Belvieu to Conway. We can lock both of those in as we go forward. We've been happy where the spreads have been at this time. Obviously, we'd always like them to be a little bit wider, but we've been able to take advantage of them. They're not going to get as wide as we saw in a long time ago where they were double digits, not going to get there because there's still plenty of capacity to move product in between the 2 basins. But I think they're going to be at an acceptable range that we are going to be able to meet what our expectations are in our guidance or even exceed it. Craig Shere : And I'm sorry, what did you say about thoughts about ethane into next year? Sheridan Swords : I think as we go into next year, what you're doing is you -- we're continuing to have the ability to recover more ethane as production continues to grow in all basins. You will -- we're kind of waiting for the incremental ethane exports coming online that we'll see some coming on next year and '25 in the year after that. And so [indiscernible] are running. And right now, with this Y crude-to-gas ratio that you're seeing on a global scale that puts the United States ethane, petrochemical ethane crackers at a huge advantage that we're going to see them continue to try to run as hard as they can. So I think you'll see the strength [indiscernible] will be running harder, but you will see a little bit more ethane coming out due to more production. We still, as we get going to how we set up our system, we still see that the Bakken is going to be an area that we will be able to incentivize ethane out at a nice rate to be able to bring it into the stack wherever that stack even if we have more volume coming out of the Mid-Continent or the Permian, we still think we can fit the Bakken in there at a nice rate. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : All right. Well, thank you, everyone. Our quiet period for the second quarter starts when we close our books in July and extends until we release earnings in early August. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you again, and have a great day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today\u2019s presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instrctions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Andrew Ziola, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, Dave, and good morning, and welcome to ONEOK's second quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder for Q&A, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call is Walt Hulse, the Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Sheridan Swords, Executive Vice President, Commercial Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. Also available to answer your questions today are Chuck Kelley, our Senior Vice President of Natural Gas Pipelines; and Kevin Burdick, who is the Executive Vice President and Chief Enterprise Services Officer. Yesterday, we announced the second quarter 2024 earnings and affirmed our full-year 2024 financial guidance, with record Rocky Mountain region volumes, continued progress on acquisition-related synergies and solid demand on our products and services drove our strong second quarter performance and provide momentum into the second half of 2024. Increasing volumes across our gathering and processing and natural gas liquids segments and the demand for our natural gas pipeline services, combined with the strategic opportunities in our refined products and crude oil segments continue to provide confidence in our long-term growth and highly attractive returns across our business. We continue to identify opportunities to expand and to extend our systems with recent announcements tied specifically to the commercial opportunities and synergy-driven growth in our natural gas liquids and refined products and crude segments. In June, we completed our acquisition of a system of NGL pipelines from Easton Energy. This acquisition was unique and that it made sense for ONEOK even before the acquisition of Magellan because of the ability to capture value downstream of our Mont Belvieu fractionation assets. Now adding the legacy Magellan assets, and the value creation and return potential is even greater. In addition to acquisitions, we continue to see substantial organic growth opportunities. In July, we announced the expansion of our refined products pipeline to the Greater Denver area. This project will provide additional needed capacity for various transportation fuels, including aviation and sustainable aviation fuel to support increasing demand from the significant future expansion of the Denver International Airport. Also in July, we received our first shipment of sustainable aviation fuel at our Galena Park Marina terminal in Houston, facilitating growth with sustainable fuels in this market. These opportunities are all in addition to our previously announced NGL-related growth projects, including our MB-6 fractionation and expansions of our Elk Creek and West Texas NGL pipelines. Sheridan will provide a more detailed explanation of those projects and timing and more to that shortly. Long-term volume commitments, strong operating performance and a proven track record of supporting our customers with reliable capacity gives us the confidence in our future growth. And we remain committed to investing alongside our customers. Less than a year after the Magellan acquisition, we're already seeing significant synergies and discovering new growth opportunities that wouldn't have been possible for either company on its own. Our integrated assets are proving their value and our potential for additional growth remains. With that, I'll turn the call over to Walt. Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. ONEOK's second quarter 2024 net income totaled $780 million or $1.33 per share, representing an earnings per share increase of 28% compared with the second quarter of 2023 and a 22% compared with the prior quarter. Second quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.6 billion. Results were driven primarily by higher NGL and natural gas processing volumes in the Rocky Mountain region, increased transportation services in the natural gas pipeline segment, the contributions from the refined products and crude segment. The sale of nonstrategic gathering and processing assets in Kansas contributed to a pretax net benefit of approximately $50 million during the quarter. We expect the full-year net benefit from the sale to be approximately $40 million when considering the earnings of the assets would have provided through the remainder of the year. As Pierce mentioned, we affirmed our 2024 financial guidance after increasing it with our first quarter earnings announcement. That increased guidance range included an expected adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.175 billion, with the high end at $6.325 billion. We continue to expect to meet or exceed our midpoint of $175 million in cost and commercial synergies in 2024 and expect additional annual synergies to meet or exceed $125 million in 2025. As of June 30, we had no borrowings outstanding under our $2.5 billion credit agreement. During the quarter, we extended the maturity of our revolving credit facility to June of 2028. In addition, our run rate net debt-to-EBITDA ratio was 3.36x at the end of the second quarter, in line with our long-term leverage target of 3.5x. We have an approximately $480 million maturity due in September, which we expect to pay with cash, strengthening our balance sheet even further. This will position us well to continue returning value to our investors through a strategic and balanced capital allocation approach. Our approach remains and all of the above strategy, utilizing a combination of high-return capital projects, dividend growth, debt reduction and share repurchases. I'll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update. Sheridan Swords : Thank you, Walt. Beginning with the natural gas liquids segment. Volume growth from the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Continent regions of 17% and 16%, respectively, compared with the first quarter 2024 drove higher earnings in the second quarter. Rocky Mountain region growth was primarily from increased propane plus volume, with higher incentivized ethane also contributing. The Mid-Continent saw more ethane recovery compared with the first quarter, as well as contributions from overall NGL growth sequentially. In the Permian Basin, we had higher volumes committed short term in the second quarter of 2023 and the first quarter of 2024 than in the second quarter 2024. We since recontracted much of that capacity with the volumes committed for longer terms. We continue to see opportunities to recover ethane across our system. Favorable ethane economics will continue to depend on natural gas values and ethane demand at petrochemical facilities. Dynamics through the remainder of the year could provide a tailwind to our modest ethane recovery assumptions and guidance. We've made significant construction progress on our capital growth projects, and now expect the West Texas NGL pipeline expansion and our MB-6 fractionator to be in service by the end of 2024. Our previous in-service estimates were the first quarter 2025 for both projects. On the West Texas NGL expansion, the full pipeline looping providing a capacity of 500,000 barrels per day is expected by year-end, with a few remaining pump stations to be completed to get to the full capacity of 740,000 barrels per day. The Elk Creek pipeline expansion remains on track for the first quarter 2025 completion. Additionally, today, with our expanding need for fractionation capacity, we are announcing a project to rebuild our 210,000 barrels per day NGL fractionator in Medford, Oklahoma. The project is expected to cost approximately $385 million and be completed in two phases, with the first expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026 and the second phase in the first quarter of 2027. Rebuilding at Medford provides a number of strategic benefits. It is the lowest cost per barrel expansion option for ONEOK to help address the expected increase in NGL production. Its location in the Mid-Continent will further increase the reliability and resiliency of ONEOK's fractionation capabilities and will allow our integrated system to accommodate volume growth from the Permian, Bakken and Mid-Continent. The Medford fractionator will also produce additional butane and natural gasoline for incremental refined products and delivering blending opportunities in the Mid-Continent. As Pierce mentioned, we recently completed a strategic acquisition of NGL assets from Easton Energy in the Houston area. These assets will provide connectivity between our NGL and refined product systems and with key customers in the area. The acquisition came with associated earnings from existing volumes, and we expect to fill the additional capacity of this system, providing a very attractive return on the project through committed volumes we control. In addition to tariff earnings on the system, we also expect the acquisition to accelerate our commercial synergy opportunities primarily related to blending. The close proximity of our NGL and refined products terminals to major refiners in the Houston area and now improved connectivity presents considerable opportunities to capture value downstream of our fractionation assets. We expect to complete connections from the legacy Houston asset to our Houston-based assets beginning in mid-2025 through the year-end 2025. Moving on to the refined products and crude segment. Gasoline and jet demand was strong in the second quarter, supported by the beginning of a robust summer travel season. As it relates to marketing and optimization, we were able to optimize our assets through forward sales to capture higher margins on our liquids blending activity. As Pierce mentioned, we recently announced the expansion of our refined products pipeline system from Kansas to the greater Denver area, including an additional direct connection with the Denver International Airport. Total system capacity will increase by 35,000 barrels per day, with low-cost expansion opportunities available as demand continues to grow in these markets. Following a successful open season, the additional capacity is fully subscribed. The project is expected to cost approximately $480 million and be completed in mid-2026. Moving on to the natural gas gathering and processing segment. Rocky Mountain region processing volumes increased 10% year-over-year, averaging a record of more than 1.6 Bcf per day during the quarter. There are currently 40 rigs in the Williston Basin with more than 20 on our dedicated acreage. As we look to the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our volume guidance due to the benefits we're seeing from the drilling of longer laterals and higher well performance on traditional laterals without the need for as many well connects. In the Mid-Continent region, we are currently seeing 35 rigs in Oklahoma, with six operating on our acreage. With current commodity prices, we expect producers to continue concentrating activity in the oilier and NGL-rich region -- areas in the region. And as natural gas prices strengthen towards the remainder of the year, we could see rig activity increase in the gassier regions. In the natural gas pipelines segment, we benefited from higher firm and interruptible transportation rates in the second quarter. The demand for natural gas storage remains high. Progress continues to be made on our current expansion projects in Texas and Oklahoma, which we both have -- which both have firm contracts extending beyond 2030. In the second quarter, we completed 2 Bcf of the Texas project and expect the remaining 1 Bcf to be in service next month. Our Oklahoma project is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2025. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Sheridan and Walt, for those updates. Before we conclude, I'd like to express my deep appreciation to our Houston-based employees for their incredible dedication through Hurricane Beryl and its aftermath. Despite challenging weather conditions and persistent power outages, they remain committed to ensuring the safe and reliable operations of our assets in the area. Many also faced impacts to their own homes, yet they continue to demonstrate resilience and professionalism. So I want to thank you personally for your dedication and the efforts that you showed during this aftermath of this event. ONEOK employees have consistently demonstrated dedication to responsible operations and doing things in the right way. As our business has grown, we have continued our commitment to our company-wide sustainability program and practices. This dedication has been recognized with the MSCI AAA rating and being named as one of America's Greatest Workplaces in 2024 by Newsweek. As we close our prepared remarks, we published our 16th Corporate Sustainability Group Report last week, highlighting our safety, environmental and governance programs. This report details our efforts and progress in these crucial areas as we continue to deliver the energy the world needs while innovating for the future. Operator, we're now ready for questions. Operator : [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Spiro Dounis with Citi. Spiro Dounis : First one, maybe just to start with the guidance. Walt, if you just go back over some of your comments and guide for the year, you maintain the range, but I think in some of your comments there, you seem to mainly make reference to the midpoint and high end that if I combine that with Sheridan's comments around ethane being a tailwind in the back half of the year, seems to suggest like coming below the midpoint is getting a little bit more remote here. So one, am I kind of reading through some of those comments correctly? And if you think about that second half of the year, what needs to go right here to kind of beat the midpoint? Pierce Norton : So Spiro, this is Pierce. Walt mentioned in his comments that we did raise guidance in the first quarter during that analyst call. Personally, I like, the team likes where we are and where we're trending to. And it does give us a lot of confidence in the back half of the year. So we're going to take a look at this guidance again as we come to you guys with some additional information in the third quarter. So that's the way I'd answer your question. Spiro Dounis : No problem, we'll be patient on that one. Second one, maybe just going to double-ish. Of course, one of your peers has announced the conversion to an NGL pipeline up in the Bakken, where you've sort of enjoyed a lot of the market share there. So curious how you're assessing the risk to your Bakken position at this point? And is there a scenario where you actually see some of these volumes flow on OPPL and maybe into a ONEOK frac? Sheridan Swords : Well, Spiro, this is Sheridan. What I would say is we were aware of this pipeline is to be considered as an alternative for NGL takeaway out of the region. And don't expect a material impact on our business. We have long-term contracts in the basin with a very small amount of NGLs in the Williston are up for contract renewal in the next 5 years. The average life on our contracts in the Williston Basin today is over 9 years. We think we provide a superior service, both with dual pipeline offerings, redundancy and reliability to our customers. And a seamless service from the Bakken to market centers in Conway and Mont Belvieu on one system with the overall best value through our integrated system. As we talk about volumes moving on -- could volumes move on OPPL, currently today, OPPL is on is full and on allocation. We control over 70% of that allocation. And I think if you think about volume coming on to OPPL, people must be assuming that when we complete the Elk Creek pipeline, we will move volume off of OPPL and that is not a foregone conclusion. Operator : And the next question comes from Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Jeremy Tonet : This is Jeremy Tonet with JPMorgan. Just wanted to pick up with synergies, if I could. Following the Easton acquisition, wondering if you could provide a bit more color on what you see this unlocking specifically for your platform, especially post Magellan acquisition? Just wondering if you could provide a bit more color on what could be accomplished. Sheridan Swords : Sure, Jeremy. This is Sheridan. When you go back -- the Easton acquisition, we had our eyes on the Easton acquisition for a period of time because we saw that as a way to continue to move our product downstream of our frac directly through pipelines to end users. In fact, a lot of the product today that's on Easton comes from our fractionation complex in Mont Belvieu. But with the Magellan acquisition came up, what we saw was an opportunity to buy Easton to create a more capital efficient and faster way to connect our NGL and refined products systems, thus accelerating our commercial synergies through this acquisition instead of doing new builds which would take longer. So really, we're going to capture the synergies that we thought before. We're just going to capture it at a lower capital cost and faster. Jeremy Tonet : And then just moving along, I guess, with producer activity, as you see it right now, wonder if you could provide a bit more color on how things are shaking out, particularly given Bakken well connects year-to-date versus your guide. Just wondering any thoughts you could share there. Sheridan Swords : Well, I would just say that on the volume side, we still are -- reaffirmed our guidance on volume. What we are seeing is, as we have talked earlier about, longer laterals. And so the wells are producing more and more efficient. And so we see that we don't need as many well connects to reach our volume guidance that we have in there, and that's been a pleasant surprise this year. We knew we'd see some of it, but it's even more a pleasant surprise. So even you see that our well connects seem to be a little bit down. We're still very confident in our volumes in the remainder of this year and going into 2025. Operator : The next question comes from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Theresa Chen : I'd love to get your thoughts on the strength in the refined products and crude segment. Just puts and takes on what's driving that? Is it largely seasonal? Are you realizing the synergies ahead of schedule? And as we look to the second half of the year and kind of touching on the broader discussion of where you're going to land within your guidance, within this segment, as we see downtime in the Chicago area and the product margins as well as regional product spreads spike as a result, would it reasonable to think that would increase your earnings in the segment above what you typically budget year in and year out? Sheridan Swords : Theresa, this is Sheridan. I think if you start off, it's kind of all of the above. We are seeing our synergy capture coming in very nicely and very strong, and that will accelerate through the remainder of the year. So we are very confident, as we said, that we will be it the cost and commercial synergies at or above the $175 million that we have outlined. We are seeing a little bit of seasonality, a little bit more volume in the summer months. But remember, as we get into the back half, the third quarter will -- our blending activity will ramp up. So we will see a growth in that time as well. And the issues we have in Chicago are creating a little bit of tailwinds for us right now. But we always anticipate we will see some refinery turnarounds throughout the year. So we're -- we feel very comfortable where we're sitting at today on both our synergies and where the refined products and crude segment is going to end the year at. Theresa Chen : And then on your expansion project into Denver, can you help us think through the economics related to that expansion? And if there are additional opportunities as you assess the landscape within the segment to expand your infrastructure based on committed volumes to additional inland premium markets? Sheridan Swords : Well, let's say, Theresa, on the expansion, this is a 5x multiple project on -- on 35,000 barrels a day. Obviously, we laid a 16-inch -- we're laying a 16-inch line into Denver, and that's why we say we have very cheap expansion capability on that pipeline as we anticipate volume to continue to grow. And if volume continued -- I mean if demand continues to grow and we need more volume on that pipeline system, we will go out for a subsequent open season. Operator : The next question comes from Tristan Richardson with Scotiabank. Tristan Richardson : Could you talk a little bit about ethane across the basin, seemingly strong recovery in the Mid-Con and in the Rockies? But this is ethane trending better than maybe you were thinking at the beginning of the year? And then just how you see the second half looking? Sheridan Swords : Tristan, this is Sheridan. Ethane is going to be volatile. It's going to be up and down, as we said, it's going to be dependent on natural gas prices. That's why we've always put just a very modest amount of ethane recovery into our guidance as we look forward. Right now, we are seeing the Permian is in full recovery. The Mid-Continent at this time is in rejection. We do have -- have already locked in some incentivized ethane through the third quarter and into the fourth quarter. So we see that going, and we'll just have to watch and see how the ethane market evolves as it changes. We do see that the petrochemicals are having a very wide spread -- ethane and ethylene, it's very wide right now. So they're wanting to run at high utilization rates. And so we anticipate that we will see some recovery in the ethane markets as we finish the remainder of the year. Tristan Richardson : Appreciate it, Sheridan. And then maybe, Walt, curious you haven't offered anything on '25 CapEx yet. But just given that you've pulled some projects forward, and you've said in the past, you really expect a downtrend in '25 versus '24 CapEx. Curious if we should see that maybe amplified with some of the projects pulled forward into '24? Walter Hulse : Well, Tristan, we were going to be finishing up those projects in '25. So clearly, the capital that was associated with the tag-in of those projects is going to move forward into '24, and that will be a positive for our CapEx in '25. We've added the Denver project spread over a couple of years that isn't really a material increase to our capital. So I think the trends we've talked about in the past continue to be true. And we're getting to that point, we're going to enjoy the operating leverage we have built into our system. And as we fill that demand, we're going to see that drop to the bottom line. Operator : Next question comes from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Keith Stanley : Several of your producer customers in the Bakken have announced mergers, Conoco and Marathon, Devon and Grayson Mill. Any thoughts on what you think that could mean for Bakken production and your business over time? Sheridan Swords : Keith, this is Sheridan. One thing I'd tell you is, all those producers, all those on both sides of the acquisition up in the Bakken, we have very good relationships with them, not only in the Bakken, but also in other areas as well. And we think that they will -- as we've talked to them a little bit, we think that it's not going to have an impact on what's going on up there. They're going to continue their cadence of they do as drilling. There may be even some upsizing to the right as they go to the more better areas or more in the core areas and drill those a little bit faster. So we are feeling very good about the consolidation that's happened up there going into the hands of strength, and they will want to be producing up there for the long period of time. Keith Stanley : And I wanted to follow up just on the Denver project. So I mean, the whole Magellan business has historically been viewed as a lower growth, kind of high return on capital business. But the Denver project is pretty material when you think about it. Are there other material opportunities across refined products besides Denver that you could pursue other areas of the system that are getting tight on capacity, you're seeing more of a demand inflection? Sheridan Swords : We continue to look for those areas as well. We think there are some other opportunities. We continue to -- one is we can continue to think El Paso showed some strength as well as we have completed our expansion into El Paso, and it is running -- running full. We've actually had an open season on a little smaller expansion on there that was fully subscribed. So we're already seeing a little bit more growth in that area. And we're encouraged about that continuing to grow. And then our teams are continuing to look for different areas, synergies or growth that we can expand our system as well. So we are excited about the growth in the refined products and system that we think we will see it at a higher rate than has been typically seen in that business. Operator : The next question comes from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Michael Blum : Wondering if you have any updates on potential AI data center-related projects on the -- in the gas pipeline segment? Charles Kelley : Michael, this is Chuck. Yes, since we last spoke last quarter, as I mentioned then, we had 15 projects, potential projects across our footprint. Of those, there were 3 that specifically stated AI. Since then, we've -- our number is up about to 17 on the potential power plants, and of which 5 are AI demand specifically. Approximately across our footprint, these 5 are right in the neighborhood of a Bcf per day. So again, early stages, but more to come. Michael Blum : And then just -- I was looking for an update on Saguaro. Any recent conversations and what's kind of the latest thinking there on timing of FID if that's going to happen? Charles Kelley : Yes. I would just remind everyone, this really is a commercially strong project with world-class customers, and it makes great commercial sense. I mean you've got Permian supplies. LNG demand pull is competitively advantaged to the Asian markets. So MPL is working on the project financing to make their final investment decision. And at this time, we do not anticipate any material capital spend on our behalf here in 2024. Operator : And the next question comes from Manav Gupta with UBS. Manav Gupta : My first question is, can you talk a little bit about ethane? Can you also talk about any butane blending opportunities in your system at this point of time? Sheridan Swords : Yes, Manav, this is Sheridan. And we -- I mean, obviously, we have opportunities as we continue to integrate the refined products and NGL systems together that we are -- have the opportunity to take our butane and put it into our refined products instead of having to buy from a third party. So just from a sourcing and logistics savings, we're seeing that opportunity. And also, we continue to find ways to blend more butane into our refined products across our system by more automation and understanding, directing volumes through our system. So we are very pleased with where we're sitting on our blending strategy at this time. And obviously, we have found some projects too that takes some capital that will be more into next year. We'll see Easton being one of them, but we'll see greater blending opportunities next year as we put some of these capital projects, small capital projects in service. Manav Gupta : Perfect. My quick follow-up is you kind of mentioned earlier or hinted to it that '25 CapEx obviously now would be lower than '24. So your growth projects are kicking in and the CapEx is lower. So the free cash flow next year would be higher. I'm just trying to understand if there is a preliminary plan and how should we think about those uses of the extra cash that is going to come out in 2025? Walter Hulse : Well, as we stated before, back in January, the Board did give us an authorization to buy up to $2 billion worth of stock. We remain committed to our level of capital allocation. Our first goal is always to find high-growth projects that are extremely accretive to our shareholders. Then we want to maintain that balance sheet. We've clearly demonstrated that we have a very strong dividend that we've maintained through some very difficult times over time and continue to grow. And then if we have excess cash, that does provide the opportunity for stock repurchases. We fully expect to complete that $2 billion program over the time frame -- time program that we had announced. And we haven't bought any today, as we mentioned on the first quarter call, because we do have this maturity coming up in September that we were going to focus our free cash flow on through that, and we will just allocate as appropriate as we get out in the coming quarters. Operator : And the next question comes from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Neal Dingmann : I just want to approach the data center question from a different angle, not really on new projects. And this might be early, but has the downward market activity in the last month change the conversation side of this at all? I would assume they're not changing their demand forecast in real time, but have there been any maybe pauses in conversations or do some parties want to take a step back? Or is everything kind of steady as she goes? Charles Kelley : I'm sorry, Neal, could you repeat the first part of that question? You said something about the past... Neal Dingmann : Yes. Just the downward activity in the market over the past month, has that impacted the conversations at all? Or is everyone still looking so long term that maybe downward activity over the last month is just kind of a blip? Charles Kelley : No. As a matter of fact, it hasn't impacted the discussions at all. As a matter of fact, we see even more activity here this month and then in the next several months. So the markets are looking long term. And when you're looking at having to add facilities to serve these markets, that takes time. That's understood both by the power generators and the commissions that they answer to. So no impacts at this time. Neal Dingmann : And then the second one, on Slide 10, you do a really good job of showing Williston Basin GORs and kind of how flaring has tailed off and maybe that relationship is related. But do you see that continuing? Is this more of an inventory just drifting with a higher GOR? Or -- or is there any other kind of plateaued on that trend? Charles Kelley : I would say on the GOR question, we know that as wells age, the GOR goes up. So a little bit the movement in the GOR we see is more based on drilling activity as -- if you drill in an area that starts at a lower GOR, it may pull the overall GOR down for a little bit. But those wells, even wells have started lower will continue to grow. So we -- overall, we see the GORs increasing in -- as a general trend, increasing in the bottom. Operator : And the next question comes from Neil Mehta with Bank of America. Neil Mehta : I wanted to touch on the share repurchase. I think the leverage level over the last 12 months has been 3.36x, which you pointed out. Are you looking to buy back shares after the September debt maturity? Or are there other factors or criteria which you're waiting for to start executing on that $2 million program? Walter Hulse : I think the plan is to allocate the capital as appropriate from the third quarter through the remainder of the program. So it's over several years. And we expect that to be executed in each of those years going forward. But it will obviously ebb and flow as we have opportunities to spend capital on high-growth projects in a particular quarter, then it will be allocated there. And other quarters, that will go in other directions. So -- but we are committed to completing the program over the time period that we have said, and I think on track with our plans with this maturity coming up in September. Neil Mehta : My second question relates to the Medford rebuild. Could you talk about the decision to move forward with that? My understanding was that with the Magellan merger, you're able to batch NGLs up the refined pipes, so there was an ability to maybe replicate Medford with Mont Belvieu sending volumes up to Conway and then also with the Easton acquisition. So maybe you can kind of educate me on that, on the -- where I'm wrong or what's not connecting and how Medford benefits ONEOK? Sheridan Swords : Well, I think the first thing on Medford benefits ONEOK is if you just do the math on 210,000 barrels a day of fractionation capacity for $385 million, that is a very low cost per barrel capacity for fractionation. The second thing is what you're alluding to is could we take all our raw feed all the way down to Mont Belvieu and fractionate it and then turn around and take certain products and ship them all the way back up to the mid-continent and deliver them into the Mid-Continent. That is -- could be a possibility. This is a much more efficient way to do that, to have all those volumes not have to make that travel. And consume that variable cost will fractionate them in the Mid-Continent, be able to put them back into the Mid-Continent as we need it, but still have the ability to move them down into the Gulf Coast. The third thing it also does is by not having to move all that raw feed down all the way down to Mont Belvieu to fractionally bring it up, we are actually creating capacity on our Arbuckle system to be able to source even more raw feed into our -- into the Mont Belvieu system. So we're moving that volume off of the Arbuckle system, fractionating it in net burden and putting on the Sterling system. So it's a much better way to balance our system as we go forward. So our system was really designed to have Medford where it is, and it runs more efficiently that way. So we're pretty excited about bringing this facility back up. Operator : And the next question comes from Craig Shere with Tuohy Bros. Craig Shere : Congratulations on the strong performance. I just have one question. It's obvious that you're finding ways to more than nickel and dime at very high return, stable contracting growth that is beyond what was originally guided with the MMP acquisition. But -- and this kind of relates to some of the questions that have already been asked. But it seems that apart from contracted stable, very high return growth that your asymmetric optimization opportunities between Y-grade or purely NGL transport with increased lending opportunities with the Easton acquisition and more that in any given year, I mean, it's not going to go down, but you have increasing asymmetric upside in a given year. Am I thinking about that wrong? Sheridan Swords : No, Craig, I think you are thinking about that correct. Especially as we continue to put into place some of these low capital projects that I had mentioned about earlier, we are going to increase our blending opportunities, both with our blending our refined products, blending butane into gasoline that we do. But also with the Easton acquisition, we have customers at our terminals now that are also blending NGLs into their facilities. And this is going to really allow us to supply that -- those volumes into those locations and create a bundled service in there. We're looking at the whole value chain that we'll be able to attract even more volume into our terminals on the Gulf Coast down there. So yes, I think you are seeing that we will continue to grow this, and this is an area that we saw when we bought the Magellan acquisition and has been -- we've been very pleased with how it's playing out. Pierce Norton : This is Pierce. I want to add one thing to what Sheridan says as a big picture comment is, as this company has gotten more diversified, it is harder to point to one thing that maybe that will drive our numbers down, which is I think what you're kind of alluding to is that there's not maybe as much downside as maybe we've had in the past. So I think that's one comment I would make to your question. Craig Shere : And in Sheridan's point, it's not just the optimization I mentioned but increasing bundled opportunities, which would seem to be even more stable long-term returns that get the icing on the cake potential with the optimization that all of it's happening at once as you take these expansion and attractive bolt-on opportunities. Operator : The next question comes from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global. Sunil Sibal : I'm not sure if I missed this, but could you talk a little bit about the economics on the Medford project? How should we think about returns on that project? Sheridan Swords : Well, on the -- incrementally on the Medford project, we are already -- even with MB-6 coming up online here at the end of this year, we still have need -- contracted need for more fractionation capacity. So what we took a look at is where was the cheapest fractionation capacity we could get and where is the best fit into our system. And also with the idea of bringing that much on with what we have contracted already today, we have a very nice project, and we do this a lot. We have a very nice project with a lot of upside on this capacity. And that's why we're going back at Medford that we will be able to grow into this as we continue to see volume grow across our systems, be able to have that fractionation capacity online to be able to timely meet our customers' demands as they continue to grow their system as well. So basically, we're saying we're putting in -- we're once again, putting in a very low-cost option that allows us to compete in all basins across our footprint. Sunil Sibal : And then on the Bakken processing, it seems like a lot of commentary we hear is gas to oil ratios getting higher. And it seems like your processing system is running close to 85%, 90% capacity, but at least it was in Q2. How should we think about opportunities in terms of processing there in that region? Sheridan Swords : Yes, we continue our -- I think I understand your question. I mean, our facilities up in the Bakken are running at a pretty good utilization, but we still have -- we're running at about 1.6 Bcf today. We have 1.9 Bcf capacity. So we still basically have a plan to be able to grow into or be able to handle turnarounds on our system as well. We will continue to monitor production growth at that time. And at the right time, we'd need to, we'll put more capacity in that region as well to make sure we can be able to service our customers out there that they have a very reliable alternative to move the -- both the gas and the NGLs to make sure they can produce their crude oil. Because that's really what they're after. They're after the production of their crude oil, and they just need to make sure they have a very reliable and resilient outlet for their gas and NGLs. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Andrew Ziola : Our quiet period for the third quarter starts when we close our books in October and extends until we release earnings in late October. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",

[Operator Instructions] After today's presentation there will be an opportunity to ask questions. [Operator Instructions] Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Mr. Andrew Ziola, Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir. Andrew Ziola : Thank you, and welcome to ONEOK's third quarter 2024 earnings call. We issued our earnings release and presentation after the markets closed yesterday, and those materials are on our website. After our prepared remarks, management will be available to take your questions. Statements made during this call that might include ONEOK's expectations or predictions should be considered forward-looking statements and are covered by the safe harbor provision of the Securities Acts of 1933 and 1934. Actual results could differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. For a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ, please refer to our SEC filings. Just a reminder for Q&A, we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow-up in order to fit in as many of you as we can. With that, I'll turn the call over to Pierce Norton, President and Chief Executive Officer. Pierce? Pierce Norton : Thanks, Andrew. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us. On today's call is Walt Hulse, Chief Financial Officer, Treasurer and Executive Vice President, Investor Relations and Corporate Development; and Sheridan Swords, Executive Vice President, Commercial Liquids and Natural Gas Gathering and Processing. Yesterday, we announced the third quarter 2024 earnings and provided new consolidated guidance that includes contributions from EnLink and the pending Medallion acquisition. We also increased our full-year 2024 financial guidance on the stand-alone basis, for the second time this year. Our higher guidance expectations highlight ONEOK's ability to continue to deliver on synergy opportunities while also maintaining a strong fee-based earnings across our systems. Our stand-alone 2024 adjusted EBITDA guidance, which excludes contributions from EnLink and Medallion, is well over double ONEOK's adjusted EBITDA just five years ago. This extraordinary growth has been possible because of our employees' focus on excellence, service and innovation, our strategic assets and our intentional and disciplined approach to organic growth and acquisitions. It has been more than a year since we completed the acquisition of Magellan, and we continue to identify synergy opportunities related to the transaction exceeding our original expectations. In mid-October, we completed our acquisition of the controlling [indiscernible] EnLink Midstream. And today, I'm able to announce the expiration of the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act waiting period related to the Medallion acquisition. We look forward to finalizing that acquisition in the coming days. The EnLink and Medallion acquisitions continued to build off the complementary assets of ONEOK, providing significant growth potential by establishing a fully integrated Permian Basin platform at scale that will drive new service offerings for our customers. Expanding and extending ONEOK's footprint in the Mid-Continent and North Texas, providing a new asset position in Louisiana connected with the key demand centers providing significant synergies through connections of complementary asset positions and finally, delivering immediate accretion in supporting our capital allocation strategy. These acquisitions mark another exciting milestone in our company's history, building on our proven track record of shareholder value creation. There is much to look forward to with these latest announcements, but there's a lot of momentum in ONEOK's current businesses. I'll turn it over to Walt and Sheridan to discuss our latest guidance, increases and give a commercial update. Walt? Walter Hulse : Thank you, Pierce. I'll start with a brief overview of our third quarter financial performance. ONEOK's third quarter 2024 net income totaled $693 million or $1.18 per share which included $0.04 per share of transaction expenses. Third quarter adjusted EBITDA totaled $1.55 billion. The year-over-year increase was driven by continued strength in the Rocky Mountain region, increased transportation services in the Natural Gas Pipeline segment and a full quarter contribution from the refined products and crude segment. Moving on to our updated guidance. In addition to increasing stand-alone guidance, we announced 2024 consolidated financial guidance, which does include contributions from EnLink and the pending Medallion acquisition, but excludes transaction costs. We expect a consolidated net income midpoint of approximately $3 billion and an adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.625 billion. EnLink will be a consolidated subsidiary of ONEOK for GAAP financial reporting purposes, and we expect to report EnLink adjusted EBITDA within each of ONEOK's corresponding business segments beginning in the fourth quarter of 2024. On a stand-alone basis, we now expect a 2024 net income midpoint of $2.945 billion and adjusted EBITDA midpoint of $6.275 billion, which is $100 million higher than our guidance increase in April. These midpoints exclude contributions from EnLink and the pending Medallion acquisition as well as related transaction costs in order to provide an apples-to-apples comparison with our original 2024 guidance. We continue to expect to meet or exceed our synergy expectations in 2024 and continue to identify additional related opportunities. Tailwinds from these synergies, sustained strength in our fee-based earnings, contributions from our acquired Easton assets and outperformance in our natural gas pipeline segment all contributed to our increased guidance. We continue to expect our total stand-alone capital expenditures including growth and maintenance capital to be in the range of $1.75 billion to $1.95 billion in 2024. This remains consistent with our initial guidance and does not account for EnLink or Medallion capital expenditures. As we look ahead, our financial outlook remains strong. And as noted, when we announced the EnLink and Medallion transactions, we expect ONEOK's total combined EBITDA for 2025 to be comfortably above $8 billion, which is double ONEOK's EBITDA run rate prior to the Magellan acquisition just two years ago. Following the close of these transactions, ONEOK expects pro forma 2025 and year-end net debt-to-EBITDA of approximately 3.9x and expect leverage to trend towards our previously announced target of 3.5x in 2026 as systems are integrated and growth projects are placed in service. I'll now turn the call over to Sheridan for a commercial update. Sheridan Swords : Thank you, Walt. Beginning with the Natural Gas Liquids segment. Rocky Mountain volumes increased 7% year-over-year, driven by higher propane plus volume from solid production in the region, partially offset by less ethane recovery year-over-year. The Mid-Continent region also saw lower levels of ethane recovery during the third quarter as natural gas and ethane prices presented fewer economic opportunities for recovery. Permian Basin NGL volume benefited from increased short-term volume on our system in the third quarter of 2024. We expect short-term volume to be replaced with long-term committed volume as we near the completion of our West Texas NGL pipeline expansion. In the Permian Basin, the completion of two third-party processing plants that we had expected to contribute to third quarter volumes were delayed. We expect these plants to be completed and flowing volume in the fourth quarter. We expect a step-up in Permian Basin NGL volumes in 2025 from the ramp-up of these two new plants, additional plants coming online, new contracts and new volume from EnLink plants ramping up system. The West Texas NGL pipeline expansion and MB-6 fractionator are on track to be in service by the end of this year. On the West Texas NGL expansion, the full pipeline looping providing capacity of 500,000 barrels per day is expected by year-end, with remaining pump stations to be completed in mid-2025. The Elk Creek pipeline expansion remains on track for our first quarter 2025 completion. In Phase 1 of our Medford fractionator rebuild is expected to be completed in the fourth quarter of 2026 adding 100,000 barrels per day of capacity, with Phase 2 expected in the first quarter of 2027, adding the final 110,000 barrels per day for a total capacity of 210,000 barrels per day. This was our first quarter since acquiring the Easton Energy NGL assets, and we are happy with how these pipelines are performing and integrating into our Gulf Coast and Houston area systems. The system's existing capacity from Mont Belvieu to the Houston Ship Channel is performing at a higher utilization rate with throughput increasing by nearly 30% since acquiring the assets. We continue to expect to complete connections from the legacy Eastern system to our Houston-based assets beginning in mid-2025 through year-end 2025 which will help us realize additional synergies by maximizing the available capacity. Moving on to the refined products and crude segment. Gasoline and jet fuel demand benefited from a robust peak driving season and refinery maintenance across our system drove long-haul volumes during the third quarter. Total refined products volumes at nearly 1.6 million barrels per day was a new record for the system. In July, all of our tariff adjustments went into effect providing a mid-single-digit tariff increase across our refined product system. With the start of blending season in September, we didn't see much of an impact in the third quarter, but has seen an increase in blending activity since then. ONEOK continues to benefit from the ability to execute certain blending related commercial synergies between the natural gas liquids and refined product businesses. We expect these types of synergies to continue to ramp up as low capital synergy projects come online in the coming quarters. As it relates to growth projects, we continue to expect the expansion of our refined products pipeline system from Kansas to the Greater Denver area and Denver International Airport to be completed in mid-2026. In July, we provided a record volume of jet fuel to the Denver airport, further highlighting the need for additional capacity to this key market. Crude oil volumes shipped on our wholly-owned assets increased 10% year-over-year due to committed shipper volume ramps on Longhorn and increased volume from third-party connections to the Houston distribution system. Our current volumes are a good base going forward. We remain excited about the pending Medallion acquisition and what that will mean for our long-haul crude pipeline. Minimal volume from Medallion Gathering is flowing on Longhorn today and a modest amount of bridge deck volume originates from these assets. So we believe there is a great deal of upside and synergy opportunity in bringing our systems together. Over time, we expect an opportunity to direct more Medallion barrels through our long-haul pipelines as existing capacity on these medallion assets fill up. Moving on to the Natural Gas Gathering and Processing segment. Rocky Mountain region processing volumes had another record in the third quarter, averaging nearly 1.7 Bcf per day. Volumes would have likely been higher, but we experienced planned and unplanned outages late in the quarter. These carried over into early fourth quarter, but are now back online. Part of the unplanned outages resulted from North Dakota wildfires in early October, that caused volume disruptions for about one-week due to producer shut-ins, power outages and high winds that also delayed completion crews. Our employees were quick to respond to these events and volumes have returned to levels seen before the fires. There are currently 40 rigs in the Williston Basin with 21 on our dedicated acreage. We continue to see benefits from the drilling of longer laterals and higher well performance on traditional laterals. We've updated our 2024 well connects expectations to a range of 500 to 530 well connects to reflect the higher volumes we're getting from fewer wells. Increasing gas to oil ratios in the basins continue to contribute to natural gas and NGL production strength. GORs in the basin are near all-time highs and combined with longer laterals support volume growth without requiring increase in drilling activity. We are currently seeing 42 rigs in Oklahoma with seven operating on our acreage and four on EnLink's acreage. We have seen additional wells drilled in oilier NGL-rich areas even as some wells in gassier areas of region have been delayed into 2025. We continue to expect approximately 65 well connects on ONEOK's acreage and expect approximately 90 well connects on EnLink's acreage in the Mid-Continent region this year. In the Natural Gas Pipeline segment, we benefited from higher firm and interruptible transportation rates in the third quarter. Strong performance so far this year, driven by firm demand contracts and a continued high demand for natural gas storage has positioned the segment well to exceed expectations for 2024. We continue to address increased natural gas storage needs of our customers. Recently activating three Bcf of previously idled storage capacity in Texas, and we remain on track to complete our Oklahoma storage expansion project in the second quarter of 2025. Both projects have firm contracts extending beyond 2030. Additionally, we now have access to significant natural gas storage through the EnLink system and we'll look for opportunities to best utilize our assets together in the future. Pierce, that concludes my remarks. Pierce Norton : Thank you, Sheridan and Walt. Before we wrap up, I want to take a moment to express my gratitude to our employees that have been affected by severe weather events across our operations over the past quarter from the recent wildfires in North Dakota, to the preparations for hurricanes on the Gulf Coast. These challenges have not only tested our operations, but have also disrupted the lives of our employees and their families. I sincerely thank you for your dedication to keeping our assets running safely and resiliently. Beyond that, I deeply appreciate the commitment many of you have shown to your communities whether through volunteer fire departments, relief efforts are fundraising events. And your contributions go beyond our business. They make a meaningful difference in the lives of those around you. Thank you for embodying our values and for making such a significant impact both within our company and in the communities where we live and serve. As we close out 2024, we expect an exciting and busy end of the year as we close our pending acquisition of Medallion and work toward Phase II of the EnLink transaction. Our employees have proven their ability to successfully integrate assets, systems and teams and to achieve meaningful synergies. I'm confident that with the support of our new colleagues from EnLink and Medallion and our talent \u2013 our teams will once again build on our strong track record of creating value for our stakeholders. Operator, we are now ready for questions. Operator : We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And the first question will come from Theresa Chen with Barclays. Please go ahead. Theresa Chen : Good morning and thank you for taking my questions. Maybe going back to Sheridan's comments about your natural gas infrastructure business, many of your peers have expressed enthusiasm in related to the robust growth outlook for natural gas infrastructure given the backdrop of power demand for a variety of reasons, including incremental demand from data centers. As commercial discussions have progressed over the past months and quarters, can you talk about how your assets situated within this backdrop and how you can participate in this being? Sheridan Swords : Theresa, this is Sheridan. Yes, I think our assets are very well positioned there. Right now, we are in discussions or have 23 different projects across our system based on demand for natural gas. And of those 23, 10 of them, we've had people specifically site demand centers that they're working after. So we think we're in a very good position with our assets going forward. And then if you layer on EnLink's assets and what they're seeing on theirs, I think we are in a very good position to be able to capture a fair share amount of this growth in natural gas demand for data centers. Theresa Chen : Okay. Thank you, Sheridan earlier for giving us the data points on the Medallion potential synergies to your long-haul pipeline. I'm curious, the current Medallion volumes, are they flowing primarily to Corpus or to Houston already, i.e., if they can go on Longhorn incrementally in BridgeTex, would the assumption be that they would also be additive to your Houston distribution system especially in light of Lyondell, still planning to close that refinery in that area in 2025? Sheridan Swords : Yes, Theresa, we \u2013 some volume from Medallion obviously, as I said, is moving on BridgeTex is much smaller on Longhorn. Other volume for Medallion is moving on to the Houston area. Of course, some are still moving down to Corpus area. We think that, that's part of the big synergies we see with Medallion is to bring that volume on to our long-haul pipes through our distribution system going forward. In terms of the overall macro economics that we're seeing between Corpus and Houston, where as the Corpus pipes have filled up, we're seeing much more demand for people wanting to get into the Houston area even with the Lyondell going down. We're seeing more volume across our Seabrook terminal. We've seen other volume being exported out of the Houston area. So we think we're very well positioned at this time to be able to market volume coming off the Medallions system into the Houston area. Theresa Chen : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Jean Ann Salisbury with Bank of America. Please go ahead. Jean Ann Salisbury : Hi. Good morning. Ethane demand for the U.S. looks pretty flat for the next few quarters until more export facilities come online. Can you talk about what you think drives the minimum possible recovery of ethane in the Bakken, whether it's a certain amount of the stream to flow on the NGL infrastructure or if it's like hitting residue gas Btu spec. And I guess, more importantly, like how far away we are from that floor? Sheridan Swords : Sure. We think about \u2013 you're right, the overall ethane demand is kind of flat right now. A little bit will change as crackers \u2013 the utilization rates on the crackers and on turnarounds and if they're all running. But overall, what we think really is going to start driving where ethane comes out, as we said before, is going to be the gas price in the region because really, you're looking at what can ethane be recovered in the region for sale into a Mont Belvieu price or sold as a natural gas price in that region. We continue to think there's going to be opportunities in the Bakken especially during the summertime where you see more depressed natural gas in that region, we will be able to incentivize that ethane to come out as we have in the past. We've also been able to do some of that in the Oklahoma at times when we see depressed prices in Oklahoma. We see that continue to continue \u2013 we see that continuing into next year. One thing will help us a little bit with that Matterhorn coming on in the Permian. We've seen \u2013 we should see some increase in natural gas prices in the Permian area, which will make it easier to bring it out of the Bakken because you'll need higher prices ethane to bring it out of the Permian. Jean Ann Salisbury : That makes sense. Thank you for that. And then as a follow-up, a lot of the kind of plateauing of Bakken GOR for the past few years has been caused by Bakken operators moving into higher oil cut areas from talking to your producers, do you feel that, that rate of change to the oil areas has kind of stabilized yet? Sheridan Swords : Yes. I think overall, it's stabilized. I mean, I think with a lot of things going into the production, what's happening on production up there and GORs, we've cited that how longer laterals have an impact higher IP rates that are driven by producers having more efficient operations or more completions and different techniques. All \u2013 a lot of things that go into the growth in volume, the growth in GORs and not only just the oil plays that they're going \u2013 that they're into now. But we think where they are now is where they're going to stay for a period of time. Jean Ann Salisbury : Great. That's all for me. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Michael Blum with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Michael Blum : Thanks. Good morning everyone. Maybe could you just stay on the volume discussion in the Bakken I'm trying to square your comments that you made in the prepared remarks about volumes and GOR trends with some of the recent basin level data we're looking at, which seems to show crude volumes declining a bit the last few months, gas production kind of flattening out. So I wonder if you could just talk about what you're seeing across your footprint relative to the overall basin? Sheridan Swords : We could still see that our customers are drilling at a level that they have been for a period of time. Obviously, we've had \u2013 the wildfires did have an impact in October for everybody as a lot of producers had to shut in wells to make sure we didn't have any issues with wells catching on fire. Also some of the unplanned outages on the natural gas processing side in the third quarter had a little impact on crude production. So I think there's a little bit of add normally on infrastructure up there at this time. But as we've got through that, we've seen volumes kind of move back to where we expect them to be at this time. So I think that's a little bit of noise you're seeing in some of the volume data that you're looking at. Michael Blum : Okay. Thanks, Sheridan. And then I wanted to ask about this over $8 billion guidance \u2013 EBITDA guidance for 2025. If I just simply annualize the Q4 results, pro forma for a full year \u2013 a full quarter contribution for EnLink and Medallion, we're getting something around $8.3 billion EBITDA run rate. And that's before any full-year contributions from West Texas, Elk Creek, et cetera. So I just want to see if we're missing something there or is that over $8 billion kind of a conservative estimate? Thanks. Walter Hulse : Well, Michael, I think we put the adder in there as that we were comfortably over $8 billion. So I can't argue with your math at all. Michael Blum : Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Brendan Reddy with JPMorgan. Please go ahead. Brendan Reddy : Hey. Good morning. For the stand-alone adjusted EBITDA rate, I was wondering if you could maybe just parse through how much of that is attributable to the legacy asset sales that you guys had last quarter and the Easton NGL asset acquisition versus base business strength, which you guys talked a bit about in the prepared remarks? Walter Hulse : I'm sorry, could you repeat that, please? Brendan Reddy : Just curious if you could parse through how much of the stand-alone adjusted EBITDA guidance raise was the legacy asset sale that you guys had last quarter, Easton NGL acquisition and base business strength? Walter Hulse : Well, the asset sale was actually caught up in the first guidance uplift. So as we moved into this $100 million increase, it's really against strength across all of our businesses, which we listed out in my remarks. So we're just seeing good momentum across all the businesses as we head into 2025. Brendan Reddy : Got it. And on the Bakken, we've hit a couple of different times. But on the lateral length, it looks like that was lowered a bit for the 2024 guidance. Curious if you could walk through any drivers there that we haven't hit already? Sheridan Swords : Yes. It just kind of depends on who's drilling the wells and what their acreage looks like and what they're trying to go forward. And so as we talk to them, there's been \u2013 some of them have delayed some of that may push out a little bit into 2025. So we made a little bit more in 2025. I will say the other thing we're also seeing lateral lengths and this kind of gets a little bit shadowed by the lateral lengths as we are seeing their completion techniques and the advancement in that and efficiencies of that really starting to shine through, and we're really starting to see really good volumes coming out of all the wells that are being completed. Brendan Reddy : Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Neal Dingmann with Truist. Please go ahead. Neal Dingmann : Good morning, guys. I was hoping that maybe I could ask another question around the $8 billion 2025 EBITDA guide, specifically just curious to maybe some of the base assumptions around that, such as how you're thinking about for next year commodity prices or overall production along with your CapEx? And also maybe wondering, I guess, maybe you all are somewhat indifferent on these macro prices and volumes, given just the specific company upside you see post all your accretive deals? Walter Hulse : Well, first of all, I want to just clarify that we didn't give 2025 guidance. We kind of gave you a directional outlook of where we see things going. And we will provide a whole lot more clarity around all of the different variables that you laid out there. In February, when we give our full 2025 guidance. But until we get there, we're going to leave it at the remarks we've made today. Neal Dingmann : Okay. That's well taken. And then just a quick follow-up. My question is on ethane. I'm just wondering, could you specifically remind me, I guess the volatility that you all continue to see with the product, and I assume the weak natural gas prices will \u2013 such as we've seen in Waha, will continue to be the driver behind the recovery decisions? Sheridan Swords : Yes. That's very true. The price of natural gas is going to drive, be the main driver behind our recovery. But that price of natural gas, you got to look at it for the regions. You've got to go all the way what's going to be \u2013 what's the price of natural gas in the Bakken, what\u2019s the price of natural gas is in the Mid-Continent, what the price of natural gas is in the Permian. Neal Dingmann : Very good. I'll leave it there. Thank you all. Operator : Your next question will come from Keith Stanley with Wolfe Research. Please go ahead. Keith Stanley : Hi. Good morning. First, I wanted to check in and see if the EnLink Conflicts Committee has determined the vote requirement yet to approve a sale of the public interest? And then are there any other procedural steps that are needed prior to ONEOK being in a position to offer to buy the remaining stake. Walter Hulse : We haven't disclosed our intention to pursue the acquisition of all the outstanding public units of EnLink in a tax retransaction that would provide a meaningful dividend increase to all of the EnLink unit holders. And when we have further information to disclose around that, we will, when it's appropriate. But I would say that we have cleared HSR review for both Phase I and Phase II. So there are no more procedural types of things that we need to get through. Keith Stanley : Got it. Thanks. Second one, I'm just curious on the $2 billion buyback plan through 2027 and given where leverage is, how you're thinking about capacity for buybacks next year specifically? And then kind of thinking back just more big picture, how are you viewing buybacks in the context of you just acquired GIP stake and EnLink and Medallion in what was a very equity friendly way as it was fully debt financed. Just curious if that impacts how you think about buybacks? Walter Hulse : Well, I'm glad you pointed out that because I would \u2013 I could make the argument that we just did a $3.3 billion buyback by using that cash. But that said, we still have the same capital allocation strategy that we announced in January. The EnLink and Medallion transactions are roughly about 20% accretive from a free cash flow standpoint. So we will continue to have even more cash flow as we go forward to think about buybacks. We're going to let that leverage come down in line where we intended to before we change any of our predictions around buybacks, but we have not \u2013 at this point, we don't believe there's any reason to change the target on the $2 billion buyback that we've already gone out there, even though we did do a pretty big buyback with GIP as well. Keith Stanley : Thank you. Operator : Thank you. The next question will come from Manav Gupta with UBS. Please go ahead. Manav Gupta : Guys, my first question is, it's been almost a year now that you have been operating these Magellan assets. And generally, when the year has passed, there is always some upsides, the assets performed better than expectations in certain areas. So if you could highlight that, which is allowing you to raise the synergy and also if there is any area where you probably had to do a little more work than you initially thought to capture those synergies? Sheridan Swords : Yes. This is Sheridan. Yes, as you said, we've been very pleased with how the synergies have come in and especially when we look into 2025, as I said in my remarks, we're going to start to see the small capital projects that we put in place in 2024, completed and see the earnings start growing from that. And those are where I think we were probably the most surprised going into this is some of the small acquisitions. I mean small capital project that we could do and the returns that we could get on that. So we're coming into a time that we're pretty excited about how we're going to see the businesses go together. I think the other area is just inefficiencies across any part of our system is we've got the two \u2013 when we get the two business groups together and got the people down in the business that really know how things are working, and they are really became innovative and how we can reduce cost to get butane to the right locations, how we can use other assets to move volume better through our systems. How we can connect the two systems together to take trucks off the road, moving butane to move them onto pipelines. How we think about projects to upsize pipelines going into the Denver International Airport. So I think there's a lot of things that we've been very excited about. I really haven't seen too much where we think that it was a lot harder than we thought it was going to be mainly I've been surprised that all the additional synergies that the two teams getting together have come up with and excited to see them really start to come together in 2025 and beyond. Manav Gupta : Perfect. My quick follow-up is exactly like you have seen over with Magellan. And you talked about some moving Medallion volumes on your systems. Have you also identified some growth projects stand-alone at the Medallion level which will allow you to grow the EBITDA from the assets which you're about to acquire? Sheridan Swords : We haven't necessarily had the specific growth projects on Medallion that we put in there. We know there's going to be some. What I will tell you is we learned through Magellan as we have certain buckets that we're going to get synergies in there, but we know there's going to be even more than that once we start looking under the hood, and we start getting the teams together and really have them working together and figure out other ways to be creative that we'll find some of those low-hanging fruit, low capital projects that we hadn't thought of when we put it in the buckets when we went in through the acquisition. Manav Gupta : Thank you so much for taking my questions. Operator : The next question will come from AJ O'Donnell with TPH. Please go ahead. AJ O'Donnell: Good morning everyone. Thanks for taking my question. Just wondering if I could go to the updated consolidated financial guidance. Curious if you guys would be able to provide some comments as to the breakdown of the contributions. The increase is about $350 million to the midpoint of the stand-alone guide I'm just curious how those parts come together and if there are any early synergies from the deal that are included in that number. Walter Hulse : Yes. No, I think that you can just look at the public data that we've seen out there, we clearly gave you our stand-alone guidance. So I think if you use EnLink, the Medallion will fall out as the piece that is there. As hard as we try to grab synergies in the first two months is that's a pretty aggressive challenge. So I think right now, it's pretty much just additive from the businesses as they come in, and we start to get the teams really ginned up to work together. So stay tuned on the synergies as we go into 2025. AJ O'Donnell: Okay. Thanks. Then one more quick one. I realize the EnLink assets are pretty fresh. But now that they're under your control, just curious if you guys plan to continue with EnLink's growth capital backlog, particularly any of their growth projects around the Louisiana area? Walter Hulse : Clearly, we're going to work with the team there to look at all of the projects and I think really look at what other opportunities we might be able to accelerate and look to really meet our customers' demand across all of their businesses. So we have not taken anything that was planned off the table, and we're going to spend time now to really look at those and prioritize where we see the growth opportunities. Pierce Norton : And this is Pierce. The only thing I would add to that is we do believe that probably the majority of the growth will be related to the natural gas side of the business because the size of the pipes and because of the capacities. We've mentioned AI before, a lot of industrial corridors down there as things expand in those areas. So we feel very positive about the intrastate and the natural gas side of the business down there. AJ O'Donnell: Great. Thank you. Operator : The next question will come from Sunil Sibal with Seaport Global Securities. Please go ahead. Sunil Sibal : Yes. Hi. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for the time. So first of all, just sticking to the consolidation theme. I was curious at the time of Magellan acquisition, I think the range for synergies was given was around 200 to 400 plus, one-year out, where do you think you are in that range as of now? Walter Hulse : I think we might have our Medallion and our Magellan \u2013 if we're talking about one year out, you are really referring to the Magellan synergies at that point? Sunil Sibal : Yes. So definitely to the Magellan synergies. Walter Hulse : Okay. Yes. We do that all the time. We get the two of them mixed up as we talk about. I think we're right on track, if not ahead of schedule a little bit as it related to the synergies that we've outlined as part of our specific guidance. At the second quarter, we said that we were very comfortable that we would meet or exceed synergies. And I think we feel the same way today as we head into 2025 on the Magellan side. The teams, as Sheridan said, are working incredibly well together, and we're just finding more and more opportunities. And a lot of those were low-capital type of things that we've just been working on now and we'll start to see the benefits in 2025 and 2026. So we couldn't be more pleased with where we stand as it relates to the Magellan integration and how those synergies have come to the fold so far. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Thanks for that. And then I realize you're pretty early in terms of EnLink and Medallion. But I was curious if you have any thoughts on further consolidation opportunities in this space? Sheridan Swords : Yes. I think when we think about what we see in front of us, I mean if you look at the maps and tell where we've been looking, we think that the Mid-Continent on the G&P side, there's a lot of opportunities there. EnLink gives us a little bit more coverage, especially on the western part of the state. We have some more \u2013 using the two systems together, I think we're going to be more efficient, moving gas around. Obviously, we look down into the Permian. We've already talked about being able to feed and fill our assets with both EnLink and Medallion beating our long-haul pipes as we continue to go forward, we think being bringing a integrated value chain to the table that's going to make both EnLink and Medallion even more competitive on getting additional new volume in that area. And then as Pierce just mentioned, Louisiana, we think there's a lot of opportunities in Louisiana. And as Louisiana is a big demand center, both industrial and for AI out there. Sunil Sibal : Okay. Thanks for that. Operator : The last question for today will come from Craig Shere with Tuohy Brothers. Please go ahead. Craig Shere : Hi. Thanks for taking the questions. So just real quickly, things have shifted a little bit since you announced these latest deals a couple of months ago. Could you see any notable acquisition upside in terms of overall economics from a notable relaxation of drilling and/or LNG permitting regs. And through your latest acquisitions just enhance your long-term interest and ultimately getting into liquids exports. Sheridan Swords : Well, Craig, this is Sheridan. What I would say as we look at Louisiana, obviously, there's a lot of LNG exports out of there. And with our pipe infrastructure there, we think that we have the ability with the larger diameter pipes that Pierce talked about to be able to pull volume through our system to be able to feed that LNG, the existing ones and new ones there. There's still ones that being talked about out there. And if there is a relaxation in the regs, I think you'll see even more come on to the Louisiana shore. So we like the position that EnLink puts us in there to be able to kind of be that last mile into some of these LNG facilities. Craig Shere : Thanks. Any other thoughts about exports? Sheridan Swords : As we continue to think a new \u2013 as energy continues to grow in the United States, it's going to be exported. And so we continue to look at where our position is there and evaluate where our needs are. And at the right time if we think we need to expand our abilities on exports, we will do it. Craig Shere : Fair enough. Thank you. Operator : This concludes our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Mr. Andrew Ziola for any closing remarks. Please go ahead. Andrew Ziola : Well, thank you all for joining us. Our quiet period for the fourth quarter and year-end starts when we close our books early next year and extends until we release earnings in late February. We'll provide details for that conference call at a later date. Thank you all for joining us, and have a good day. Operator : The conference has now concluded. Thank you for attending today's presentation. You may now disconnect.",
